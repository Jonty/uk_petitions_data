        "action": "Investigate the passengers who unlawfully halted the deportation of Yaqub Ahmed",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls for an investigation on all those involved in the halting of Yaqub Ahmed's deportation, to find out whether any laws were broken and to ensure that the course of justice was not deliberately perverted.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely imperitive for future deportations to clarify the position of the law so that this does not happen again and the British justice system does not fail victims and citiziens.",
        "background": "Yaqub Ahmed, a convicted gang rapist who attacked a 16 year old girl and has connections to ISIS was finally being deported back to Turkey for his terrible crimes in 2007, but his deportation was halted after passengers on the same flight saw it fit to demand he stay and the deportation be halted.",
