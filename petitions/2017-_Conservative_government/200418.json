        "action": "Re-nationalise the train service",
        "additional_details": "If we take Berlin and London, we can see a stark contrast in travel card prices there. For example, a day travel card in Berlin (zones ABC - which includes the city and its surrounding area) would cost an adult 7,70\u20ac (\u00a36.78), however, in London a day travel card (in zones 1-6) would cost an adult \u00a311.70. The difference shows that a nationalised system is cheaper.",
        "background": "Due to the privatisation of the train services, commuters have experienced frequent delays, with poorer service than would be expected of any EU country's services. On top of this, commuters face high fares, which are rising much faster than the rate of inflation.",
