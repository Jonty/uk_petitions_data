        "action": "Modernise and Amend The Highways Act of 1835",
        "additional_details": "Please see... http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/5-6/50/section/LXXII/enacted\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this partition is to ask the government to change the law so that PLEV's (Electronic Scooters)can be ridden in public areas. Currently they are banned from both Pavements and Roads. PLEV's are a cost effective environmentally friendly emission free way of getting around a city. PLEV's also need a classification as a vehicle type as a part of this in the same way as Electronic Bikes are classified",
        "background": "The Highways Act of 1835 is preventing Tech Startups and Global Business specialising in PLEV's (Personal Light Electronic Vehicle) from trading in the UK. It will also increase capacity of our cities by getting people off public transport and having fewer cars on the road.",
