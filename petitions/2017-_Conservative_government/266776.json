        "additional_details": "A recent Guardian article delved into the scientific discovery that a mass tree planting scheme is by far and away the cheapest and most effective solution to the climate disaster. It states that tree planting has mind blowing potential to tackle the climate crisis.  \r\n\r\nit would require minimal effort to start by making it illegal to fell any privately owned healthy tree that posed no danger to building structures or to human or animal life. Agricultural trees grown for sale would be exempted.",
        "background": "Trees absorb and store the carbon dioxide emissions that drive global heating. New research estimates that a worldwide planting programme could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere, but we need to start by keeping the existing and established trees alive.",
