        "additional_details": "The people of the UK request that before the next General Election a new voting procedure be put into place.     The system should  have the ability to stamp out voter fraud and should be able to check for multiple voting  which is happening  in some areas of the UK.      Some form of electronic voting using your  National Insurance number or even the issuing an identify card would be ideal.  \r\n\r\nPostal voting should only be available to the elderly and severely disabled.    \r\n\r\nPenalties for illegal voting and multiple voting should be severe and classed as a criminal conviction, a \u00a35,000 fine, and a ban from voting for at least 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe voting system should apply to the whole of the UK.... no exceptions",
