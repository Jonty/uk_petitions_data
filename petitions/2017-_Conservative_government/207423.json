        "additional_details": "A recent government survey showed 10 million GP Appointments are missed every year. \r\nThis equates to \u00a3300 million pounds. \r\nIf a \u00a320 charge was made \u00a3200 million could be saved and the privilege of getting an appointment would be more respected. \r\nMore Appointments would either be kept or would incur a no show cancellation charge as it in the private sector. If we do nothing to save our NHS, nothing will change. Please sign and share.",
        "background": "Whatever we think about our NHS, it is there for us all, day and night. But it is in trouble and something has to change. \r\nIf we don\u2019t respect it, we will lose it.  \r\n\u00a3300 million pounds are lost in Missed Appointments. Charging for these would reduce DNA\u2019s and create income.",
