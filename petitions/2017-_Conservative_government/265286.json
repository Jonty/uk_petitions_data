        "action": "Ban schools from selling single use plastic",
        "additional_details": "Me and a friend calculated on average how many plastic bottles - not including cutlery - get thrown away because our school has sold them. It was over 127,500, just at one school. This is not ok. By 2050 it\u2019s predicted that there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and we need to change this! the most effective thing schools can do is to simply ban it and educate students about plastic free swaps they can make in their everyday lives.",
        "background": "I want all schools across the UK to stop selling drinks and cutlery made of single use plastic. It shouldn\u2019t be allowed because it\u2019s terrible for the environment and none of it gets recycled even if it\u2019s put in the recycling bin. If schools really cared about our futures they wouldn\u2019t sell these.",
