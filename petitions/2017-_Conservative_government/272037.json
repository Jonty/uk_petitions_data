        "additional_details": "The struggle we face with overuse of plastic and packaging is real, and we are all aware that every effort needs to be made to protect our oceans from pollution. A video game or other media publisher choosing to sell their product digitally is a good thing, however some are choosing to sell their games using a download code in a plastic case, I can only imagine to maintain some sort of shelf presence. This is contributing to completely unnecessary plastic entering circulation.",
        "background": "Digital downloads for video games are increasingly becoming the more popular way of buying, rather than on a disc. It is inexcusable however when a download only game is sold in a physical plastic box - so-called \"code in a box\". It is a gross and unnecessary use of plastic that should be stopped.",
