        "action": "Stop MLM distributors selling health and weight loss products without training",
        "additional_details": "Multi-level marketing distributors can mislead the general public with promises of fast weight loss and cures for ailments, without informing them of the risks to their health or the side effects. This ignores the duty of care which qualified individuals (dieticians) have to adhere to by law.\r\n\r\nBy forcing the MLM Company to educate the distributors, the duty of care is passed to the distributors who can be regulated to make sure the clients are assessed with proper screening.",
        "background": "Products like weight loss teas, meal replacements and other supplements are currently being sold by multi-level marketing distributors who aren't required to have any formal training in nutrition. They are giving advice that they aren't qualified to give and this is dangerous to the general public.",
