The standard UK stool test does not reveal strongyloides. The Kato Katz test (not 100% reliable)is unavailable. Dr Paul Pottinger (University of Washington US) says the serology test is unreliable (YouTube- \u2018strongyloides stercoralis\u2019 RWJF microbiology, immunology & infectious diseases) & that the time it takes to get tests done can prove to be fatal in chronic cases.",

According to experts, medicine should be prescribed on the basis of travel history & symptoms, but British doctors are refusing to give medicine without a clinical test result.",
