        "additional_details": "There is an emphasis in social work, schools, nurseries and other areas of working with children which are all taking into account the range if needs of young people and children. \r\nBy allowing those that coach our children to teach without qualification or relevant training we run the risk of causing them serious emotional harm in the name of sport and leisure, seriously undermining the efforts that are being made in statutory services as well as other services that work with children.",
        "background": "General consensus of parents who've experienced gymnastics coaches is that they adopt a hard lined approach in the name of progress with skills development. Their influential role with young people is significant and a lack of teaching knowledge can impact students\u2019 mental health.",
