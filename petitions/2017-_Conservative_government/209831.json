        "additional_details": "Plastic straws are a big part of the global problem of unnecessary items ending up in the ocean, harming wildlife and entering the food chain. Eco friendly alternatives are available and there's no excuse for not using them.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/pft/2017/1/3/the-problem-of-plastic-straws-and-how-each-of-us-can-make-a-difference\r\n\r\nThis petition demands that the British Government put planet before profit and permanently ban the UK production and import of plastic straws.",
        "background": "Plastic pollution is a global issue, with plastic now being found in all oceans. Wasteful single-use items such as drinking straws are at the forefront of the problem. Every plastic straw ever made still exists in some form and they are consistently in the top ten of items found during beach cleans.",
