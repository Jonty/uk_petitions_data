        "additional_details": "The nets on trees are a signal that someone is planning to remove the trees. This should no longer be even an option. Planning should work round our existing stock of mature trees, and hedgerows should be protected without exception. Trees are vital to air quality in cities and to remove CO2. Ancient hedgerows are vital for biodiversity. Nothing replaces a mature tree or hedge. Felling should be restricted immediately to managed woodland only. We have a climate emergency. Felling needs to stop.",
        "background": "People have been horrified by the outbreak of nets on healthy trees and hedges to stop birds nesting. It's not the nets that are the problem, but the planned removal of the important trees and hedges. Mature trees are vital for air quality and to absorb carbon. They need to stay there.",
