        "additional_details": "Abusive ex partners also use children as a gateway back into their victims life. Safeguarding restrictions being put in place is not sufficient. If the child has contact with the abusive parent, they are very likely to be exposed to domestic abuse when observing the parent in future relationships. This can be damaging and is not in a child's best interest. The abuser may also abuse the child or use the child to indirectly continue to abuse their ex partner.",
        "background": "Abusive partners should lose the privilege to have contact with their child(ren) if the mother is forced to flee domestic abuse whilst she is pregnant or whilst the child is too young to choose for themselves.",
