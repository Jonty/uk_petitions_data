        "action": "Require all transport operators to offer child fares to anyone under 18, by law.",
        "additional_details": "Most trains in the UK are an example of how the fares system fails to support those who are in full-time education, and who are the future of our country. Fares continue to be structured as though it is the last century, when far less 16 and 17 year olds were in education. Both bus and train operators are guilty of exploiting young people, through fares and fines. A new law would create a sense of consistency and equality for all children using public transport in the UK.",
        "background": "The legal age of adulthood is 18 in the UK. Yet many transport operators require children of a certain age to buy a full-fare ticket, intended for adults. Young people cannot work full-time and we should be supporting them, rather than offering fares which exploit and disadvantage children.",
