        "action": "Ban the use of face coverings at protests and counter protests.",
        "additional_details": "Being able to cover ones face empowers people to commit crimes of assault, criminal damage, racial abuse, etc, that they may not otherwise commit. Much the same as a fake profile online empowers people to say things that they would be to afraid to say on a real profile. \r\nA law would greatly aid the police in doing their job and keeping the peace at public protests and counter protests. I feel it would reduce the number of offences committed at protests considerably.",
        "background": "It has became common practice for protesters to attend protests with their faces totally covered. With the sole aim of causing trouble and escaping police prosecutions. The police rely heavily on video footage to enable prosecutions at later dates and away from a hostile crowd.",
