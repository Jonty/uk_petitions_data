        "additional_details": "The Civil Aviation Authority propose that everyone owning a model aircraft/drone of 250g-20kg register with the CAA and take an online safety test. Failure to comply with these rules could lead to a fine of \u00a31,000. Included in these new proposals is a minimum operating age of 18 years.\r\n\r\nBritish Model Flying Association Members agree that we are already registered as a national body. I suggest that the CAA work with the BMFA so that members are automatically registered or exempt.",
        "background": "New regulations being imposed are penalising law abiding rc model flyers who are already in an association or nation body. There has been a lot of false sightings and media hype driving these new regulations .Illegal flyers will not register anyway.",
