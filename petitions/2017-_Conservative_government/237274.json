        "additional_details": "Many in secondary have to skip their breakfast so they\u2019re not late. According to a study, skipping breakfast can have negative impacts on energy and mood, which can be detrimental to our education. Also waking up later can ensure that we are well rested (because of all the excessive work done at home). Not forgetting that all of us are developing teens who need more sleep than adults. Finally, many can\u2019t interact with their family in the morning because they\u2019ve no time, they have to just leave.",
        "background": "Schools should start student\u2019s timetables later (a good time would be 10am). This will allow pupils to be better rested and let them be more productive and alert throughout their day at school and perhaps give opportunity for morning revision sessions for a better quality of education.",
