        "additional_details": "Today our roads are overcrowded and dangerous with too many cars and lots of polution. Reopening the Aberystwyth to Carmarthen railway would take the pressure off the roads, and it would be a major boost to the west Wales economy. I want the uk government to look into the viability of reopening this railway, the costs and benefits, and also ask the local people if they would like the railway reopened. Reopening this railway would be a vital transport link and a boost to the local economy.",
        "background": "The Aberystwyth to Carmarthen railwayline was closed by Lord Beeching in the 1960's. Since then circumstances have changed a lot and the rural west Wales communities are now trying to get the railway reopened. There are too many cars on the roads today and reopening the railway would ease congestion",
