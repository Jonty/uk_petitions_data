We are now in the ludicrous position of asserting that we must accept huge amounts of precisely such EU law, without changing an iota, because it is essential for our economic health - and when we no longer have any ability to in\ufb02uence these laws as they are made.",

Theresa May is a Remainer and proved time and again that she has no intention of fulfilling the Tory manifesto of delivering a true Brexit.\r\nShe has lied to the people, slyly trying to undermine us, treating us like idiots. She must go",
