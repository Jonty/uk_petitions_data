In particular, we're not sure whether you're concerned about Hunterston B nuclear power station or UK power stations more broadly.\r\n\r\nSpecific concerns of this kind are dealt with by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), the statutory safety regulator, which is independent of both the Government and Parliament. You can find out how to raise a concern with the ONR here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.onr.org.uk/complaints-concerns-whistleblowing.htm \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition about safety at nuclear power stations more broadly. For example, you could start a petition calling for a Government review or independent inquiry. "
