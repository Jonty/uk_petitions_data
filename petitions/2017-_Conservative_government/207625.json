This above all, is dangerous practice and causes delays. It effectively limits 3 lane motorways to the middle and right hand lane when drivers do not use the left hand lane.\r\n\r\nThe government should consider instructing the Police to give out more penalties to drivers committing this offence. Additionally penalties should be more severe to act as a deterrent.",

The Government should consider to enforce this law more stringently and issue with greater frequency the number of penalties to penalties to drivers who commit this offence.",
