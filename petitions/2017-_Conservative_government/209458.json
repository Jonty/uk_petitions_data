        "action": "Theresa May: Cancel the invitation for Saudi Crown Prince to visit the UK",
        "additional_details": "The Crown Prince has directed the bombardment of Yemen. Tens of thousands have been killed or injured. There is widespread famine and cholera, creating the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Yet, the UK still sells arms to Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe Saudi regime has supported repression in Bahrain, where its military intervened to end peaceful protests in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe lives of people in Bahrain, Yemen and Saudi Arabia are more important than arms sales. Stand up for human rights and cancel the visit.",
        "background": "We call on the Prime Minister to withdraw the invitation for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to visit the UK. The Saudi Arabian regime has one of the worst human rights records in the world. Torture and arbitrary detention are widely documented. In 2017 alone, over 100 people were executed.",
