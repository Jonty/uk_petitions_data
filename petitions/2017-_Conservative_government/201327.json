These courts are not open to the public unlike criminal courts.  Parents who are party to proceedings are forbidden to talk to anyone about what happens in court. They\u2019re silenced with a gagging order which means if they talk they face 10 years in prison, but it\u2019s time the world knows what is going on in our family courts. Parents have already got the life sentence - isn\u2019t that enough?",
        "background": "Let\u2019s get the Government to listen to the people. We need to stop forced adoption and make it illegal. Only parents should be able to consent to their children being adopted. ",
