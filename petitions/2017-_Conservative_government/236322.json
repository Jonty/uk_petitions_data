In particular, we're not sure what you'd like \"closed borders\" to mean. In any case,  people who are found to be in the UK illegally are not eligible for Government help, so we're not sure what funding you'd like to stop. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask the UK Government to withdraw from all agreements that require the UK to accept immigrants and refugees, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
