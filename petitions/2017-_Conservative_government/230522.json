        "additional_details": "In our school survey 88% of pupils wanted a permanent school counselor and 40% of our pupils had a time where they felt mentally unwell. Yet our school can't afford free school meals let alone a counselor due to cuts.The fact 40% of students feel unwell yet have no one to turn to is shocking and the government aiming to reduce suicide by 10% is not enough when so many young people struggling. Sign our petition and make a change. (1 out of 10 children suffering is according to YoungMinds.)",
        "background": "Over the course of our research for our citizenship campaign, we found that a staggering 1 in every 10 teenagers have suffered with mental health issues. Much of this can be blamed on government cuts to schooling and mental health. We want this to become a bigger issue rather than be ignored.",
