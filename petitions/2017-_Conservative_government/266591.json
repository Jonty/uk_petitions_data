In there increasing panic and desperation animals have been known to break bones and chew limbs off, after only a few hours animals have been found exhausted covered in thereown urine and faeces. Many die within 24 hours due to dehydration or even suffocation but many go on to suffer for long after if found alive they may just be dumped in the bin as a way of disposing if them. I urge you to take a look online at the overwhelming evidence that this is a completely inhumane practice that should be stopped.",
