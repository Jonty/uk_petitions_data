        "additional_details": "It is all too easy for people to renege on buying a house without any real consideration of their decision on other parties in the chain and how much it may have cost them.  This needs to stop, people need to be accountable fir their decisions.\r\n\r\nThe sale of my house has fallen through 4 times in total for the most part because people are too stressed with the process or no real reason other than they changed their mind.  This has left me out of pocket, impacted my purchase and is to say the least extremely annoying.",
        "background": "The law on buying and selling houses should be changed (similar to that of Scotland).\r\n\r\nOnce an offer is accepted it should be binding.  Any breaks in the contract should result in all associated fees within the chain being the responsibility of those who break the contract.",
