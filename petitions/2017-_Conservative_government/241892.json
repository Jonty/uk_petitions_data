        "action": "Abolish registration fees for all care workers",
        "additional_details": "Care workers give back to the public. We are employed by government agencies to provide services to everyone within the public. Covered within this are nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, and many other professions who care for and look after anybody in their time of need. The fact that we have to pay in excess of \u00a3150 each time we register yet receive little to no support from our governing bodies is insulting and belittles our essential roles within the community.",
        "background": "All care workers currently working in the UK have to pay exorbitant fees to agencies such as the HCPC/NMC to register and continue working. Without paying these fees, we are not permitted to work. For Social Workers these fees are set to rise 18% yet we have not received a payrise for many years.",
