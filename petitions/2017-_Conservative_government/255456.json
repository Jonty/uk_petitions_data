        "additional_details": "Last year, \u00a3358m (\u00a3800,000 a day) was lost to internet crime - a truly appalling statistic. Many receive up to 10 calls a day, particularly distressing for the vulnerable or elderly. Internet sites like whocalledme.co.uk are having 1000s of hits daily from the public frustrated and disturbed by scam callers. We need political will to make our internet/telecom suppliers and overseas governments answerable for their inaction over this massive, ongoing criminal activity and their plans to halt it.",
        "background": "Most people in the UK have received a scam call purporting to be their internet supplier, alleging they have computer issues and attempting to gain remote access to their bank accounts. These callers often go on to be menacing, offensive and intimidating if they are unsuccessful in their objective.",
