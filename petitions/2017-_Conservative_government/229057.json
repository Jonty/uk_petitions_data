        "action": "Utilise Reading Prison as a Shelter for the Homeless",
        "additional_details": "Since 2013, Reading Prison which has a potential capacity to hold over 500 people, that has running water and still being heated, is just lying empty. \r\n\r\nSo far it has cost the taxpayer in excess of a \u00a31 Million to mothball. Unused for the last 5 years (save an art exhibition and the odd film production company using it for shooting locations), it seems to me almost criminal, when so many are in need of warmth and shelter to not utilise this for those of who find themselves homeless.",
        "background": "Reading currently has the highest number of homeless not only in Berkshire but in the South East; as taxpayers we're already paying for this building to be heated, the lights kept on and the water running, it just makes sense when there are people, our people, outside in the cold, wind and rain.",
