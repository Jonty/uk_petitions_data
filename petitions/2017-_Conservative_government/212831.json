        "action": "End bedroom tax for bereaved parents/carers on the room of their deceased child",
        "additional_details": "Bedroom tax comes into effect a year after the child\u2019s death, if the parent is claiming housing benefit.\r\nA year is a short period of time after the loss of a child to then endure the stress of extra financial commitments.\r\nSome parents may feel unable to work due overwhelming grief, PTSD or other reasons. \r\nPenalising them for their child\u2019s death or making them move before they are ready will only cause more distress.\r\nIt is a cruel tax placed on people who are already suffering unimaginable pain.",
        "background": "Bedroom tax on the room of a deceased child is unfair, no parent wants an empty room for this reason.\r\nMy daughter passed away 2.5 years ago and I haven\u2019t unpacked her hospital bag. I couldn\u2019t imagine being forced to pack up her belongings and move away from the home that holds our memories.",
