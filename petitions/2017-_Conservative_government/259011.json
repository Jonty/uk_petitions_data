        "additional_details": "Faith in our Parliamentarians is at an all time low and for the Public to see these people (who are supposed to represent the very highest standards) committing criminal offences and then continuing as though nothing has occurred is absolutely unacceptable.\r\nMembers of other occupations are held to the highest standards and MPs should be too.\r\nThe rules should be changed so that our MPs are automatically removed from their roles on conviction of any criminal offence involving dishonesty.",
        "background": "MP Chris Davies has just been fined \u00a31500 after pleading guilty to providing false or misleading information for allowance claims. MP Fiona Onasanya served a prison sentence after being found guilty of Perverting the course of Justice.\r\nMPs should face dismissal on criminal conviction.",
