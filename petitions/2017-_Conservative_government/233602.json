        "action": "Combine the current individual SIA Licences to a single multi-category licence.",
        "additional_details": "By adopting a DVLA style single licence (which could still have clear colour coding for easy identification) there would be significant cost savings to the individual, the SIA and the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). Licences could still be renewed every 3 years and the individual could still be DBS checked, at the current fee of \u00a3220. But the production and administration costs would be reduced, reducing plastic as well as cost and administrative burdens on all involved.",
        "background": "The Security Industry Authority (SIA) have a number of individual front-line licences (Close Protection, Door Supervisor, Security Guarding, CCTV, CViT and Vehicle Immobilisation). Each costing \u00a3110-220 each.\r\nIf they were to adopt an approach similar to the DVLA there would be a saving to all.",
