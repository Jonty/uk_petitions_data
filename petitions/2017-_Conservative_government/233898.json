        "additional_details": "The past two years have seen plenty of surprises with respect to the EU, some unpleasant. But like the turkeys who don't vote for Christmas, nobody in Westminster is offering us the one EU choice that might actually be worth considering: full membership, including the Euro. It could be our country's best bet, though. No more pound, yes. But no need for one, if our banks are built not to need bailing out in the first place. As for jobs, let's just say the sucking sound would be in our direction.",
        "background": "In the 2016 EU referendum, there were 2 choices: Leave or Remain. We had our say. But there is a third-way: let's call it Re-Join. No more opt-outs. No more pound, even. Proper EU membership, like Germany and France. Are we so sure we want to leave, versus just joining up properly like the rest?",
