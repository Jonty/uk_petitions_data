        "additional_details": "Swallows, Swifts and Martins are already in severe decline, in part because of fewer insects, reduced habitat when they live abroad, and because their nesting sites are being destroyed.  Addressing habitat loss and insect declines are very important, but require long-term resolution.  This makes it all the more vital to prevent existing nest sites being destroyed - something which can be legislated on straight away.",
        "background": "Live bird nests have legal protection, but nest sites do not.  Swallows, Swifts and Martins return to the same nesting site year after year.  If these nesting sites are destroyed, with few alternatives available, local extinctions are likely.",
