        "additional_details": "Especially in the current heat of the British summer, for emergency workers to be unable to purchase food or drinks on account of 'poor timing', is a ludicrous notion. \r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition, and share to create more understanding of why this act should be considered.",
        "background": "This act would allow paramedics and all other emergency services to skip long waiting times, and be served as a priority in restaurants.\r\n\r\nAs paramedics are obligated to 'drop everything and run', this would reduce the possibility of workers missing out on food and drink due to long waiting times.",
