These tokens include: payment tokens (currency coins); utility tokens (services); and security tokens (equity and assets). \r\n\r\nLiechtenstein's Blockchain Act defines its objective as to:\r\n\r\n\"enable the transformation of the \u2018real\u2019 world to blockchain systems while ensuring legal certainty, thereby opening up the full application potential of the token economy.\"\r\n\r\nThe UK Act should aim to define \u201clegal certainty\u201d for blockchain implementation and projects, and define a world where our existing assets are added onto blockchain, and then traded there.",
