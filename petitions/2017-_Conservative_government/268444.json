        "additional_details": "The deforestation of the Amazon is threatening all life on Earth. It is estimated that we will have lost the Amazon by 2030. If continued we are going to reach a tipping point - in which the Rainforest will no longer be able to sustain itself and it will \u201ccollapse in on itself\u201d. This precious land is being used for agriculture that barely boosts the economy. Without this, our plans will be futile. We need the UK to pioneer on the Climate Emergency and urge others to follow in your footsteps.",
        "background": "We demand that the UK tells Brazil to stop Deforestation in the Amazon. If they don\u2019t, then we demand that you place sanctions on Brazil. All over the world people are calling for sanctions to be placed on Brazil. Act now and become a real leader in climate protection.",
