        "action": "Impose a term limit on all MPs of 10 years (no limit on election cycles)",
        "additional_details": "A term limit of 10 years - irrespective of the number of general elections - would give an MP enough time to learn the ropes of Westminster and be able to make a contribution to society and their constituency. It would increase the turnover and mean that they could not make this their sole career. More people would be able to participate, reduce hostility/apathy toward UK politics and people with a more varied life experience other than life in politics would get a voice in parliament.",
        "background": "Over the past 30 years, a political class has developed of people who know nothing but politics. They have never done a real job or worked in the private sector. After University they become bag carriers, SPADs and then MPs. They live in a bubble and do not understand concerns.",
