        "additional_details": "Utility markets are a competitive marketplace, and rightly so. Contract renewals are generally based around internet \"Compare\" websites that many elderly do not understand how to use. Electric and Gas suppliers are exploiting this fact by not moving them onto the best contract at renewal time. This is wrong and should be legislated against.",
        "background": "Many elderly citizens are paying excessive amounts for gas, electricity and water. Make it law that utility companies must automatically place them on their cheapest available contracts at the time of renewal, not just place them on a standard expensive tariff.",
