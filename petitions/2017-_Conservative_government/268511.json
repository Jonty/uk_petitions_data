        "additional_details": "Brexit is a choice. It fundamentally edits the DNA of the UK and a decision of this size and magnitude should never have been put to the public. Asking the public to vote on major constitutional change, where the risks are enormous, was a dangerous and irresponsible political decision.",
        "background": "Brexit will damage this country, and we are demanding that it be stopped. The political elite is driving a populist agenda through Brexit, and it will tear the country asunder. It's not just economic shock, it's a new era of worryingly familiar politics that led to some grim historical events.",
