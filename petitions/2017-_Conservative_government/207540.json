        "additional_details": "The loss of public toilets has not only been inconvenient and caused hardship, but has in some instances, become a public health issue.\n\nCoastal toilets are particular example of public toilets which have proved harder for the wider community to fund /manage (the only option to retain such facilities), due to the nature of their position in relation to a sensitive environment along with the associated elevated cost implications, although all public toilets everywhere are under threat of closure.",
        "background": "Currently, the provision of public toilets by a local authority is not a statuary requirement and as such the closure of public toilets has been an early port of call for local authorities to meet budget constraints. \nDedicated funding should be provided by Central Government rather than Councils.",
