        "additional_details": "Cyber bullying, bullying, threats and ABH, suicide, low self esteem. If parents get fined or threatened with prosecution each time their child bullies another, bullying will become easier to deal with. No child wants their parents to be in trouble, I think this will make the parents more inclined to help stop their child\u2019s bullying behaviour or get help with antibullying classes. Justice for the victims of school bullying. No child deserves to be hurt physically or mentally by their peers.",
        "background": "Bullies have always been a problem in all schools. No action takes place because of their age, therefore they continue to bully. Parents are threatened with fines or prosecution for their child to take too much time off school, surely parents should face the same threat for their child to bully.",
