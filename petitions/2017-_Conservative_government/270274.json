In addition to 210k homeless right now the report warns a further 375k children in England are in households that have fallen behind on rent or mortgage payments. This means thousands more are at financial risk of becoming homeless in the future.\r\nThe report, entitled Bleak Houses, states children are being housed in shipping containers - this shouldn't happen in the UK in 2019. Please allocate the funds required.",
