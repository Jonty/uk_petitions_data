Distance learners need the same things to complete their course as those who are attending a university campus. The degree is equal, why isn\u2019t the funding? Make things fair for the mothers wanting to change their lives to better their children\u2019s future, for the people with mental health who feel uncomfortable being surrounded by lots of people, and just for ANYONE who is wanting to study a full time degree from home!",

I am a single mother starting a distance learning degree full time, but won\u2019t qualify for funding.",
