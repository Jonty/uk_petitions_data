        "additional_details": "Minimum standards should be -\r\nTents must have an inner and outer skin and a minimum Hydrostatic Head rating of 3000. (Small play tents can be exempt.)\r\nAny sleeping bag rated as suitable only for temperatures over 5 degrees centigrade should be clearly labelled \"UK Indoors Only\".\r\nRoll mats must have a minimum thickness when compressed. \r\nAll folding chairs and stools must have their maximum weight clearly displayed in kilogrammes and stones and pounds, in large letters on the sales label.",
        "background": "There is a huge amount of camping equipment abandoned at festivals every year which is bad for the environment. Much of the equipment is of a poor standard and inadequate for the British summer leading to many people getting cold and wet to the extent that they need medical help.",
