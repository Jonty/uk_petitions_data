I work 40 hours on placement a week unpaid. \r\n\r\nOnce a month I get \u00a3450 from NHS Bursary. \r\n\r\nThis is not even minium wage and does not even cover basic bills like rent and bills.\r\n\r\nWe then have to do bank work just to earn enough to survive resulting in utter and complete burnout before we join the NHS!\r\n\r\nWe are not supported financially and ultimately not respected. \r\n\r\nMany students have been forced to leave the nursing degree due to financial difficulties.\r\n\r\nWe are the future of the NHS but yet left to suffer below the poverty line.",
        "background": "Currently there is no financial aid in assisting with housing costs such as rent as our placement is classed as work.\r\n\r\nIf this is correct then why are we not paid a basic working wage.",
