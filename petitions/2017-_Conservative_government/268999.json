We can increase democratic participation by registering school students and explaining the mechanics of local and national elections. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/01/eight-million-eligible-uk-voters-not-registered-ahead-of-european-elections-study-finds\r\n\r\nThere are many charities and organisations in the UK that can support schools to get ready for this.",
        "background": "Students in UK schools leave at 18 without any formal instruction on how to register to vote.\r\nIn a modern democracy where we promote democratic values in schools through the British Values agenda we should ensure that our citizens do not turn 18 without being registered to vote.",
