        "additional_details": "By law, all supermarkets are supposed to let consumers know if food is unpasteurized. I feel that this law needs to be extended to restaurants. We had a bad and dangerous experiance eating out, being told twice that dairy was pasteurized and finally after eating it, being told by a manager that it is not. This can lead to fatal consequences in an unborn child such as listeria/stillbirth. \r\n\r\nThere are gf/vegan/vegetarian symbols on menus. I believe there should be a pregnancy safe symbol too.",
        "background": "There are food safe signs in restaurants for Vegetarian, Vegan and GF. Why is there not a food sign showing dairy products as being safe for pregnant women, or at the very least if they are pasterized or unpasteurized? Without signage and education it can have drastic and dangerous consequences.",
