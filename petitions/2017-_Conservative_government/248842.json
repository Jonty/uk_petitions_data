        "action": "Change UK Law to make the rape of males by women illegal.",
        "additional_details": "The Sexual Offences Act 2003 states that penetration of the \"mouth, anus or vagina with [the defendant's] penis\" is sufficient for charges of rape.\r\n\r\nI suggest that \u201cthe intentional penetration of [the defendant\u2019s] own mouth, anus or vagina\u201d should also be sufficient for charges of rape.\r\n\r\nRape of any gender is a serious and traumatic crime and should be taken seriously within the eyes of the law. Males should be protected under UK law.",
        "background": "Currently in the UK, females can not be charged with the rape of males. They can only be charged with sexual assault and similar offences, which are likely to give lesser sentences. As society strives for equality, men\u2019s rights should not be forgotten and the rape of males should be taken seriously.",
