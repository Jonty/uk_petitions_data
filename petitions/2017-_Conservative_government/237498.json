        "additional_details": "Word's have power. Labelling and Disabling individuals you take away their power to be who they are, forcing them to prove and live in their challenges, focused on what they can not do. It also opens the system for fraud. Whatever the needs of a person to disable them prevents them from the support they need to fulfil their purpose, writing them off as DISABLED. A simple change with the word Enabled changes the way people are supported, and brings a can do attitude, and system that supports.",
        "background": "In the past few decades those with physical, mental and illness have been called offensive, and dis-empowering names, focused on limitations and weakness. It is time to Stop Disabling us. Enable Us.",
