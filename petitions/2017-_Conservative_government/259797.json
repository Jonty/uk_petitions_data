        "additional_details": "Rainforests are the richest environments on the planet and account for more than half the known species. It is estimated that just one hectare of rainforest can contain more than 1000 different species of plants and animals. Biodiversity like this, is not only a natural beauty that we must preserve but it benefits humans. 25% of pharmaceuticals come from the rainforest and they absorb 40% of man made CO2. Stop the destruction of rainforests and the loss of species by banning palm oil in 2025",
        "background": "The government has already committed to reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. However this does not acknowledge the devastating effects that palm oil plantations have on habitats around the world. Species are being lost at an alarming rate and ecological biodiversity of rainforests is falling.",
