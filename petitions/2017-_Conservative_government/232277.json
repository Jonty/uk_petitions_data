        "additional_details": "Baroness Altham published a report on women in the workforce and stated older women (aged 50 to 64) are now more likely to be in employment with the proportion of those in jobs reaching a record high in 2015 of 64.2% compared to just 41.9% in 1985.\r\nMenopause usually starts between 45 and 55 so many women  are trying to remain in work while dealing with Menopause symptoms that can be  disabling. For many HRT allows them to remain productive and reduces the risk of various other health conditions.",
        "background": "We have an aging workforce and women are now working through the Menopause which is not a life choice or self inflicted. HRT is a lifeline to many, allowing them to remain in employment. Despite working many struggle financially so receiving HRT free of charge would help the women and the economy.",
