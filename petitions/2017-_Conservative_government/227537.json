Reporting restrictions are automatic for all young people tried in a youth court. It would be for the court to decide whether to apply restrictions where a young person was tried in an adult court, which would cover most serious offences.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for the law to be changed to allow courts to make decisions on reporting restrictions relating to all drug or knife related crimes involving young people."
