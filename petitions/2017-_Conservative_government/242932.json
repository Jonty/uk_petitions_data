If someone with a mental illness commits a crime it can be deemed as diminished responsibility, as they are not in their right mind. \r\nIf someone kills themselves when suffering with mental illness it\u2019s classed as suicide. Mental illness is a disease, just like cancer. I want the stigma of suicide removed from society and have it changed to Death by mental illness.",

This leaves loved ones feeling like they could have done more to prevent it and therefore can lead to more mental illness. Change it to death by mental illness",
