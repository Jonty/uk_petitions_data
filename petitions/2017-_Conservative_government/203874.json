        "action": "Ban the sale of White poppies alongside the British Legion red poppy campaign.",
        "additional_details": "The white poppy campaign states that it remembers all war dead, which would include civilians and enemy combatants. Not just the enemy of old, but also the despicable fighters from groups like ISIL, who advocate rape and torture. While there is no issue with remembering more than just British Forces personnel who have given their lives, there is a great issue with doing this alongside the official campaign. The white poppy should only be sold at other times of the year.",
        "background": "Ban the sale of white poppies in November, alongside the RBL Campaign as it is nothing more than a political move that detracts from the good work the legion do and make a mockery of the official remembrance campaign and those that gave their lives for this country.",
