The previous solution to this was to make GCSE' s and A Levels harder to obtain and increasing exam pressure. This has had the opposite effect and is becoming detrimental to our state of mental health and well being. 2018 is said to be the most stressful year in terms of exams and teenage mental health has been reported to decline as a result.",
        "background": "From speaking to various individuals in A-Levels and GCSE's, we feel as a group that we are being put at a disadvantage and being set up to fail. The new A-Level and GCSE reforms are unfit for purpose and the overwhelming amount of content and exams that we are being put through needs reform.",
