        "additional_details": "For example, I\u2019ve just returned from being on holiday in Cornwall. All waste has to be bagged as the waste collection vehicle does not tip. They receive different bags for different parts of recycling. They have a roadside bottle collection. In comparison, where I reside in Bedfordshire we do not have roadside bottle collections, waste does not have to bagged. Recycling does not have to be separated. Some of our waste ended up in landfill due to not having a simple set of consistent rules.",
        "background": "Bin collection cycles and \u2018what can be recycled\u2019 varies county by county or sometimes town by town. I would like to see a single set of rules and collection cycles introduced across the United Kingdom. Introducing a simplified and consistent set of rules will improve recycling and avoid confusion.",
