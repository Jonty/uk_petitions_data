        "action": "Prevent housing associations from charging tennents for essential tree work.",
        "additional_details": "Housing associations are using a loophole in the law designed for private tenants to include tree work as \"standard maintenance\" (along with changing bulbs) in their tenancy agreement. As the owner of the property, and therefore the tree, the housing association should be held liable for any risk posed by dangerous trees in their tenant's gardens. So forcing the tenants to pay for tree work to mitigate the risk that they (the tenant) are not responsible for is unfair and should be made illegal.",
        "background": "A family member of mine who lives in a housing association house had a dangerous tree in their garden. The Housing Association wanted to charge them more than \u00a32000 to carry out the work needed to make the tree safe. I complained and won, but they continued to implement this unfair policy on others.",
