        "action": "Remove convicted criminal MPs from Parliament & cancel their pensions.",
        "additional_details": "MPs regularly use claims of personal integrity as part of their electoral campaigns, so criminal activity by any of them should not be tolerated. Once an MP has been convicted of a crime (no matter what the offence or level of punishment), the following should happen:\r\n\r\nBan them from taking part in parliamentary business\r\nBan them from again standing for public office\r\nBan them from receiving any and all pensions, benefits & privileges due to former MPs\r\n- Force a by-election in their constituency",
        "background": "Convicted criminal politicians should not be immune from the consequences of their actions. MPs are public servants; and other public servants face not only legal punishment for their crimes, but in many cases, they are dismissed from their jobs and denied their pensions. MPs should face the same.",
