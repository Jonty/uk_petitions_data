        "additional_details": "RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said:\r\n\u201cArriva Rail North, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, is a basket case rail franchise sucking up well over a quarter of a billion pounds a year in public bail-outs while wrecking service standards, ripping up the safety rule book and threatening to throw the guards off over half their trains.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://www.rmt.org.uk/news/rmt-demands-that-arriva-be-stripped-of-northern-franchise/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/11/04/german-rail-giant-seeks-help-prop-uk-arm-owns-northern-franchise/\r\n\r\nArriva North have had their chance. They haven't served the public well, and yet receive public money. It's time for them to lose the franchise.",
        "background": "As reported by the Telegraph on in November 2018, Northern Rail has seen a taxpayer bailout of more than \u00a3282 million. With ticket prices rising yet again, no improvement to the often overcrowded, delayed or cancelled services have been seen for many people who rely on these services.",
