        "additional_details": "In the wake of windrush incident,many of us are now awake as to what is happening in the society we live in.The whole country was left in shock. The migrants suffer everyday with these hostile policies.\r\n\r\nWe have recently seen a case of a Nigerian woman who despite facing difficulties got justice thru the courts. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/21/court-says-seriously-ill-woman-can-work-while-fighting-uk-deportation\r\n\r\nPlease help in bringing back basic needs for these migrants.",
        "background": "Under Immigration Act 2014, most migrants lost their right of appeal -that took their basic rights away - like Access to employment, NHS & much more. These are some of the basic needs a person requires to sustain one self. \r\nThis has lead to many migrants living in destitute conditions.",
