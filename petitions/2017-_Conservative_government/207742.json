        "additional_details": "The turn around in London academic achievement since the \u2018London Challenge\u2019 has driven the number of pupils in the capital with five GCSE A to C grades to over 60%. It can be argued that a premium investment is made into London due to higher living costs but the IPPR North study found this to be not the case, in fact it found that northern schools should receive compensation for having a harder job than those in London. It is time for Yorkshire to have a \u2018Yorkshire Challenge\u2019 and fair funding.",
        "background": "In 2016 an IPPR study found that northern secondary schools received over \u00a31,300 less per pupil than their London equivalent and primary schools suffer a \u00a3900 per pupil gap. At the time of releasing the figures IPPR North called upon the Government to address this via a \u2018Powerhouse premium\u2019.",
