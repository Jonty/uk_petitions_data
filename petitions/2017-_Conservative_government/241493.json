        "additional_details": "Landowners have the right to control parking and access to their land, however these \"parking enforcement companies\" and \"debt recovery services\" harass the public with letters and demands for fines which are merely an invoice for a breach of contract , most of which bare no good evidence or are falsified. There should be more regulation in this industry and undeniable evidence should be provided before people are legally threatened for payment.",
        "background": "Throughout the UK there are many privately operated car parks and private parking spaces which hire private parking enforcement to scare the public into paying unjust/illegitimate fines with the threats of taking vulnerable and ignorant people to court out of fear.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government and Parliament to establish specific new regulations for private car parks, if that's what you'd like to see happen. "
