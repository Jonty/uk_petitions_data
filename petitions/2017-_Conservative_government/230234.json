        "additional_details": "My son is 5 years old, just started year 1 mainstream primary school and has a diagnosis of non verbal autism with learning difficulties. His needs are not deemed enough for an additional needs school yet he is unable to communicate with his peers and teachers. If makaton or BSL were taught in the early years my son would now be able to communicate his needs, communicate with his friends and show his teachers how much he understands of the curriculum he is being taught. Please help us 10,000 signatures is all we need in order to give him a voice!",
        "background": "Communication is an ESSENTIAL life skill. Much of everyday life relies on it, from playing to learning, to getting our needs met. Makaton is a language programme using signs and symbols to aid communication and designed to support the spoken language.",
