        "additional_details": "Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan is currently the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, where same-sex sexual activity is illegal. He also owns City Football Group, which Manchester City FC is part of. Football is the national sport of the UK, yet the owner of the Premier League champions is Deputy Prime Minister of a country where homosexuality is illegal. If LGBT equality is to be achieved, Government Ministers from these countries cannot be permitted to own UK-based companies.",
        "background": "In many countries, homosexuality is still considered a crime. This is in direct contrast to the UK, where same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 1967. Government Ministers in countries where homosexuality is still illegal should be banned from owning UK based companies.",
