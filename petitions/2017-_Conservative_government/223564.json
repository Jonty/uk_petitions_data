        "additional_details": "Following a journalist's report on gay conversion therapy at a church in Liverpool the government has devised a 75 point action plan to improve the lives of the LGBT community. The plan states that the government will set out to ban such therapies but doesn't say how this is going to be enforced.\r\n\r\nYou can't simply just tell people not to do something and hope that it works, because it doesn't. Something more needs to be done. We urge the government to criminalise gay conversion therapy.",
        "background": "Gay conversion therapy is currently legal in the UK\r\n\r\nNo one should be told that their sexual orientation, their identity, is a an illness that needs to be cured.",
