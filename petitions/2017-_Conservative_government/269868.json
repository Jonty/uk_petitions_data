        "action": "Move Parliament out of London to the North of England",
        "additional_details": "Other countries have their political centres away from their capital or main city such as the Netherlands where the political centre is The Hague or in Australia where the political base is Canberra. This reflects their history as a union of states and is not unlike the U.K. where there are four nations and many regions joined together. Removing the focus on London would help rebalance our country.",
        "background": "The current Houses of Parliament are in need of an expensive repair therefore this is the perfect opportunity to move Parliament to a more central location in the U.K. This would help rejuvenate northern England, address the North/South divide and reduce costs for MPs as London is more expensive.",
