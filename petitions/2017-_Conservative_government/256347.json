If you ever watch the races, please take the time to look at the condition of the animal, do they look happy? Do they look in pain? Are they completely exhausted? And ask yourself, what does the animal get out of it? The nerve-racking shouting and cheering from the crowds, that frightens them more? No animal should be forced to run until they collapse, just to be put down if they fall over and injure themselves.",
