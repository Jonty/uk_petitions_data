        "additional_details": "Travel expenses to and from work engagements should be either refunded to the MP - or - MPs should be given free travel-cards to enable them to travel to and from work engagements free from financial expense.\r\n\r\nThis isn't about punishing MPs, it's about restructuring MP salaries to better reflect the values we hold dear in Britain; values of fairness and equality. In times of financial difficulty for many citizens in the UK, we need to make changes in the government that align with reality.",
