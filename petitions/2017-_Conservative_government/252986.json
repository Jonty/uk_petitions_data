        "additional_details": "Even apples are being packaged in non-recyclable plastic in supermarkets. There are many alternatives available instead of single-use or non-recyclable plastics, however these cost more so are often ignored in favour of larger profit margins. Evidence of the harm of plastic waster is widely available. Friends of the Earth found microplastics in every British river tested. https://friendsoftheearth.uk/plastics/microplastic-pollution-widespread-british-lakes-and-rivers-new-study.",
        "background": "Food packaging plastic waste is a threat to the environment. Plastics that are not biodegradable or recyclable are cheaper to manufacture so supermarkets and food producers are not incentivised to package food in alternatives that are less harmful to the environment.",
