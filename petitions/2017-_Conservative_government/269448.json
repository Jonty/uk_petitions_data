I was lucky my company supported me throughout and after 6 months I was able to return fully to work, sadly for the majority of patients this is not the case.",
        "background": "Everyone knows someone undergoing cancer treatment, on top of everything that the patient deals with there is sadly a financial side. Whilst in hospital I witnessed people either being put on SSP or being made redundant. Majority of cancer patients treatment is 6 months.",
