The fines would be used to finance the scheme.\r\nThis would make our public areas more attractive, would encourage tourism and would be safer for birds and wildlife",
        "background": "Litter, flytipping, & especially plastic is of a growing concern, not only nationally, but globally. The UK doesn\u2019t do enough to deter this antisocial behaviour.",

Different local authorities also have the powers to impose on the spot fines to those caught littering. We're therefore not sure what further action you'd like to see.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. You could also speak to your local council about the enforcement of fines for people who litter.
