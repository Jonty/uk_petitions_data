        "action": "Stop maintenance payments if the parent refuses access to the child(ren)",
        "additional_details": "Mothers and fathers who have sole custody of the children apply to CMS for child maintenance payments but at the same time will not allow the other parent access to the child(ren). To stop children growing up with an absent parent the laws and rules on maintenance needs to change. So many parents want to see the children and due to having to make CM payments can not afford to seek legal advice on access. A lot of men and women then sadly take their own life due to no longer seeing children.",
        "background": "A parent who refuses to allow another parent from seeing their children should no longer be allowed to apply for child maintenance payments. Every child should have both parents involved unless there are circumstances in which involvement would affect the child, eg drugs, violence, sex offences, etc",
