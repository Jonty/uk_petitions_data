        "action": "Ban firework sales and restrict their use to official authorised displays",
        "additional_details": "There is a proven history of support for the ban of public firework sales which are ignored by parliament, this is evident from previous petitions. \r\nSenior members of the Police, Fire Service, RSPCA, NHS, Ambulance Service and other organisations have all publicly spoken out in support of a ban and continue to do so each year.\r\nIt is time for the public servants in parliament to act for the people they are elected to serve and ban this unnecessary practice.",
        "background": "Every year the public use of fireworks causes alarm and distress to both people and animals, as well as causing injury and damage, either by accident or malicious action.\r\nThey also cause unnecessary pollution and litter for which the user is generally not held accountable.",
