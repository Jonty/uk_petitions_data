        "additional_details": "In 2014, Merseyrail spokeswoman Alice Owen said: \u201cThe safety of passengers is Merseyrail\u2019s absolute priority,...\" (reported in Liverpool Echo). This cannot be achieved without personnel on trains to ensure passenger safety.\r\n\r\nIf a passenger operates the alarm handle, there needs to be someone available to render assistance. The driver cannot do this. Without a second person on the train, the driver would have to go to the next station before stopping the train. This could make matters worse.",
        "background": "Merseyrail is to introduce new Driver-Only Operated trains. They only guarantee to have a second person on trains after 8 pm. Many antisocial and criminal incidents take place at other times of day. Trains should have a second person patrolling to maintain order, check tickets and help passengers.",
