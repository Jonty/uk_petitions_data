        "additional_details": "This should be formally agreed in Parliament rather than relying on the Supreme Court. \r\n\r\nWe have a parliamentary democracy in the UK. Respect for Parliament is respect for democracy. If this is in question then it is the current system that needs to be changed. Ensuring the system we have is functioning within its remit, meaning our elected representatices hold the Executive to account, is the foundation of our democracy.",
        "background": "Regardless of any individuals stance on Brexit we need to ensure we have a functioning government throughout this pivotal period in our history. Prorogation serves only to stop formal discussion and would cast dispersions over any subsequent actions of the actions of the Executive.",
