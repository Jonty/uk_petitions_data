        "action": "Make youths in further education eligible for a free bus pass",
        "additional_details": "There is a need for youths to have bus passes as it becomes increasingly difficult to access education as you grow older. On top of university fees, bus fees will also have to be paid. Lots of teenagers don\u2019t have jobs or work on minimum age which can make it impossible for them to reach their college, sixth form or university. Students who have just started college (age 16) are unlikely to be eligible for a free bus pass until 2070 when they will be more than done with education.",
        "background": "In England, citizens aren\u2019t eligible for a free bus pass until they reach the state pension age. For a yearly bus pass for anybody else, it\u2019ll cost \u00a3592, money that most teenagers and young adults don\u2019t have. Without bus passes, many people would be unable to travel to college and university.",
