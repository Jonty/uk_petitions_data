        "action": "Make councils set up payment plans for parking tickets instead of total payment",
        "additional_details": "I had a parking ticket which I couldn\u2019t pay in a lump sum.  The council wouldn\u2019t let me pay in installmemts so it got passed to the bailiffs and more charges put on. Then they came and clamped my van I use for self employed work and removed it after they were told it was for my business and valued under \u00a31350. I have a 7 year old child who I can not get to school anymore and I have no income now and have complained and appealed but still no van. I made payments but they wanted \u00a380 a month.",
        "background": "Make it so councils have to let people pay fines in installmemts for people who can\u2019t afford to pay in a lump sum for parking tickets. Instead of passing it to private bailiff firms who add more costs and won\u2019t accept an affordable payment plan until their fees have been added on.",
