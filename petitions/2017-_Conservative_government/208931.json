        "additional_details": "Currently, millennials are one of the demographic groups in the UK that are hardest hit in terms of affordability of living. With stagnant wages and rising inflation and for most, a thirst for wanderlust, the 26-30 railcard should've been available as soon as it was announced. Another pressure on millennials is that many commute to their workplaces as majority live with their parents as they are unable to afford a house of their own. I urge the government to pilot this railcard in other areas.",
        "background": "As a welcome resource for travelling millennials, the 26-30 railcard was announced in the Chancellor's budget on the 22 November 2017. However, it is currently ONLY being piloted in the Greater Anglia area of the United Kingdom. I urge the government to consider piloting this in more than one area.",
