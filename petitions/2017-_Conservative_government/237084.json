        "action": "Stop any plans by the Government and BBC to scrap over 75\u2019s free TV licence.",
        "additional_details": "Most pensioners watch their televisions and listen to the radio far more than the rest of us. They look forward to watching regular programmes and TV viewing is very much part of their daily routines. For a lot of elderly people, all they have is the standard channels and don\u2019t have access to internet and Smart TV. They are one of the most vulnerable groups in society, many living on a shoestring, having worked hard their whole lives.",
        "background": "Pensioners shouldn\u2019t have to pay for a TV licence. We need to support and treat them as valued members of society, most of whom have contributed to the system all of their working lives. It\u2019s one of those little perks that they give back to them, along with a free bus pass and winter fuel payments.",
