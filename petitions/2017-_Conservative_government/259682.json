        "action": "Legalisation of medicinal & recreational usage of cannabis in the UK",
        "additional_details": "With legalisation and controlled distribution it will benefit everyone: \r\nIt will displace the more dangerous strains, providing a safe product for the 3 million estimated UK users.\r\nIt will remove power from drug criminals. \r\nIt will create a substantial benefit in taxes to the economy, reducing the burden on the UK taxpayer.\r\n\r\nMisrepresented as a harmful drug, cannabis has never been directly linked to a single death. A stark comparison to the 88,000 deaths annually from alcohol in the UK alone.",
        "background": "The criminalisation of cannabis has only lead to increased drug crime & poor quality, with potentially harmful consequences & alternatives such as legal highs. Additionally, it has the power to create over \u00a31 billion for the UK economy annually.",
