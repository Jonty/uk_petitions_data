We want all authorities nationwide to be trained in awareness of who to contact as we believe the animal\u2019s welfare should take priority in all situations regardless of breed.",
        "background": "Recently a dog was tied up and abandoned. The dog was labelled 'aggressive' so was shot dead, but we believe she was not assessed fairly.  We require a change of legislation to prevent animals being killed before a proper assessment has been done. ",
