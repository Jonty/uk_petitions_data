        "additional_details": "E. drink consumption between 06' and 14' rose by 144%, access to these drinks by U16s is damaging the fight against childhood obesity because of the sugar/calorie content. The caffeine content also has an adverse effect on children as they aren't developed enough to cope with it, leading to hyperactivity and other health issues.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42298192\r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/21/government-urged-to-ban-energy-drink-sales-for-under-16s-over-health-concerns",
        "background": "We call upon the government to pass legislation which makes illegal the sale of energy drinks to children under 16. It should be an offence for an adult over 16 to buy an energy drink on behalf of an underage child. U16s should be banned from possessing E. drinks on school premises or in public.",
