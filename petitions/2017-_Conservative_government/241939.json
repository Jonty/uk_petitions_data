        "additional_details": "I don\u2019t understand why Michael Gove did not include RE as an EBacc subject. I believe that all students should have the option to do RE, History or Geography as they all classify as humanities. Furthermore, RE promotes pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, and prepares all students for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of the present and the future. Finally making RE more accessible to us will help us better understand and appreciate other people\u2019s beliefs.",
        "background": "I have to do the EBacc. In my school this means we only get one free choice. For GCSE my dream is to do RE, Resistant Material as my optional subjects, however I am only allowed to do one of these. If RE was a humanity I could fulfil my dream.",
