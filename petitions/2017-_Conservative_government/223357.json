        "action": "Ban plastic toys in children\u2019s fast food meals.",
        "additional_details": "Children seem to enjoy the toys more than the meals but fast food outlets could change this by offering more variety and healthier choices. They could perhaps create paper comics as an alternative to the toys and these could be recycled. \r\nThere is too much waste in the world and too much plastic going to landfill and ending up in our oceans. Fast food outlets would make a massive difference if they cared more about the plastic waste that they produce.",
        "background": "Fast food restaurants produce billions of non essential plastic toys every year to give away in children\u2019s meals. The toys which are packed in plastic bags are usually thrown away before the children even leave the restaurant.",
