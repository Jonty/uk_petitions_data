        "additional_details": "However the minimum amount of hours  you must care for a person before you are eligible to claim carers allowance is 35 hours a week. The amount you get is \u00a364.60. So if a carer does the bare minimum required to claim the allowance it works out to \u00a31.84 per hour. Yet they save the government roughly \u00a360 billion a year (amount from BBC news). Lets just let that sink in for a moment. Carers should be paid enough to live off as they are the backbone of this country.",
        "background": "Carers are the people in this country that give up their work and life to care for people they love. They do this because they love the people they are caring for.",
