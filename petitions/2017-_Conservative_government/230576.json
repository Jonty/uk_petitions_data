        "additional_details": "Some organisations have obtained permission from the FCA to provide loans to a higher limit, but many do not do this (e.g. due to the complexity of obtaining permission and costs).\r\n\r\nThis is a timely petition as officials from DfT, HMT and HMRC are reviewing the scheme\u2019s guidance (including the limit) as part of the Government\u2019s Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy.\r\n\r\nSource of inflation data: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator",
        "background": "Introduced in 1999, the scheme allows workers to buy a bike and accessories through their workplace. If the scheme\u2019s limit had tracked inflation it would now be over \u00a31,600. In addition, e-bikes are now becoming popular, provide access to cycling to more people, but are even more expensive.",
