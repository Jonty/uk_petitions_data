        "additional_details": "I can not stress enough the importance of not banning these tools, instead we should be sharing education on correct use. \r\nE-collars share many purposes: \r\n- A safety net for off lead sight hounds, hunting dogs and northern breeds well known for their lack of 're call. \r\n- To control security and protection trained dogs when off lead. \r\n- To control aggressive or reactive dogs who do not respond to positive only training methods. \r\n- Help protect live stock.\r\n\r\nPlease help responsible dog owners, and not prohibit the use of tools and training methods.",
        "background": "The government are calling for a ban on the use of \"shock collars\" more commonly known as E collars, branding them cruel. This is detrimental to many dogs, dog owners and rehabilators across the UK, and once the ban is implemented will follow with a rise in dog bites, rescues and deaths.",
