        "additional_details": "It is now believed that there are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic debris in the ocean. Shoppers worldwide are using approximately 500 billion single-use plastic bags per year. We believe that by reducing the use of plastic bags in the UK we will not only make a difference but lead others to follow in our footsteps and globally cut the use of plastic bags.",
        "background": "Raising the cost of plastic bags to 5p has already made a huge impact on the environmental welfare of the UK. Imagine what kind of impact raising the cost to 10p would make.",
