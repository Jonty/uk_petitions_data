        "action": "Both sex get the same pay in Championships and other prize money for sports.",
        "additional_details": "Historically, women have earned less than their male counterparts throughout society. The Wimbledon Championships are a prime example based on prized money. Men earn another 5 grand more than women do. The metrics seem to point in favour of the Men victor being paid a sizeable sum of money greater than the women's champion. It is clear there is still much to be done to overcome the lasting gap in men's and women's pay in the domestic and global economy; but at least it's a start.",
        "background": "I'm doing my GCSE's Citizenship investigation portfolio and have decided to raise awareness for 'Equality in Sport.' Through-out the years it's been a huge problem for both sex, races, etc.. I want to assure women and men get the same pay, not just as prize money but as a general job.",
