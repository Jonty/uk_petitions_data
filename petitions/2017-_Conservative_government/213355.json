        "additional_details": "There are insufficient bands to reflect the current value of properties and charges.  In 2017 the council tax for Band H properties worth millions in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea was \u00a31376 and \u00a32124 respectively, whilst in East Sussex it was \u00a33500 for houses worth a fraction of the price.  The system is unfair and advantages those with high value properties\r\n\r\nOne solution is increase the number of bands to reflect the current variation in house values and make the system more equitable.",
        "background": "Currently properties are assigned a council tax band (A \u2013 H) according to their market value in April 1991. Band A properties under \u00a340k whilst Band H over \u00a3320k. Despite houses prices rising considerably and disproportionately in some areas, the banding system has remained unchanged for 27 years.",
