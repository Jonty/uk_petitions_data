        "additional_details": "You are required to have a license in Northern Ireland to purchase and set off fireworks so it should be the same in England, Scotland & Wales. The government claim they take the safety of fireworks very seriously but there is still hundred of injuries every year & requiring a license would decrease the number of injuries by a huge number just like there\u2019s not many road incidents because you need a license to drive.",
        "background": "Fireworks are fun but also dangerous. Many people are injured from fireworks. Having a license would allow control of all the crime that happens from fireworks. It would allow them to take away the license from people who use them dangerously and ban them for life from repurchasing fireworks.",
