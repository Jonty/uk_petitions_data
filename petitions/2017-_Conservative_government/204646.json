        "additional_details": "Priti Patel's visit to Israel (as a holiday) informing no one then meeting the Israeli PM & Israeli ministers discussing foreign aid without anyone's knowledge is a clear conflict of interest. As a member of 'Friends of Israel' and when returning to the UK, spoke to her department about the possibility of providing aid funds for the Israeli army. As Secretary of State for International Development she met Israeli ministers but not a single Palestinian representative. Shocking personal agenda.",
        "background": "Priti Patel visited Israel without the knowledge of the foreign office ministers. Identified this as 'holiday' went on to meet key Israeli ministers including the PM. When challenged, claimed the FO knew and that she met a handful or ministers. Truth, met PM & 12 key ministers. FO did not know",
