        "additional_details": "Avastin is used to treat cancer in many countries and is typically used alongside chemotherapy. In particular this drug is added to treat those who have stage 4 colon cancer and has been proven to extend the life of those living with colon cancer in cases where it has spread.  \r\n\r\nNHS patients can access the drug by paying for it as a top up. Recently the patent came to an end and the cost has reduced.  Given the cost reduction NICE should reconsider approving this drug to be available on the NHS",
        "background": "Avastin (bevacizumab) is a cancer medicine that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body. It used to treat certain types of brain tumor, and certain types of cancers of the kidney, lung, colon, rectum, cervix, ovary, or fallopian tube.",
