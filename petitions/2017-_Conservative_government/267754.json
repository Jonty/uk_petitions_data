        "additional_details": "Med shortages are ALREADY occurring. Patients are being told their prescribed meds are not available. Some essential drugs are being rationed. Cancer patients are being told that they will not be prioritised for treatment if we run short of radioisotopes due to the UK's withdrawal from EURATOM. The Health Secretary himself has not guaranteed that there will be no deaths in a no-deal scenario. This is unacceptable for the UK in 2019.",
        "background": "There is little public confidence that the govt. is fully prepared for no-deal brexit, particularly regarding the supply of time sensitive, life-saving meds, which would intentionally and /or negligently expose people to harm, violating their right to life, a private life and family life.",
