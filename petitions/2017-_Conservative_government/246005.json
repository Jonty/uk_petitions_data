        "additional_details": "Lets take the initiative from France and make it illegal to throw unspoiled, perfectly usable food away instead of just 'trying' to reduce the amount of wastage. This is what is pledged by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. Instead of taking small steps in the right direction; lets stop wasting time and take ultimate action NOW. Thank you. Our environment needs us.",
        "background": "The amount of perfectly good, unspoiled, unsold food that is binned in the UK by supermarkets is disgraceful. This could be used and sent into many places such as food banks, nursing homes and homeless shelters helping to reduce hunger within our country as well as waste.",
