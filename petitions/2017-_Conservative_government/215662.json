        "additional_details": "This is taken from www.onegreenplanet.org ;\r\nA multitude of ascending colorful balloons against the backdrop of a bright blue sky may be a brilliant sight to behold, but, as the saying goes, \u201cwhat goes up must come down\u201d \u2013 and when balloons do, the consequences are deadly for wildlife.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is generally good intent behind the practice of releasing balloons such as memorializing an event, showing remembrance...[] that once released, balloons become nothing more than floating litter.",
        "background": "Plastic in the seas is becoming more widely known.
