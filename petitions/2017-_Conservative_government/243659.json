        "additional_details": "Save the turtles is just one reason why to sign but in the long run the waste and worrying about running out of space to pile our rubbish will reduce. Such a simple minor thing and it shouldn\u2019t take this long to have been done. Paper straws is the way forward and a simple easy change. It\u2019s not always the big changes that make the most impact",
        "background": "McDonalds is one of the biggest fast food chains and the amount of plastic straw they use is too much. We talk about saving the environment this is the most simplest change we could do. No issues with our oceans and we don\u2019t need to overfill a land yard with the rubbish as they will rot over time",
