        "additional_details": "This process would:\r\n- Vote options off the table\r\n- Provide a clear direction and mandate \r\n- Be justifiable to those who supported eliminated options\r\n\r\nAll principal options should be available, including but not limited to:\r\n- Exit with no deal\r\n- Withdrawal agreement, outside customs union, outside single market\r\n- Withdrawal agreement, inside customs union, outside single market\r\n- Withdrawal agreement, inside customs union, inside single market\r\n- Repeat Leave/Remain referendum\r\n- Cancel Brexit",
        "background": "The votes on Brexit by MPs suggest that no option commands a majority. However, if:\r\n- MPs vote for their preferred option\r\n- The option with the lowest number of votes is eliminated\r\n- The process is repeated until there is one option\r\nit would be a fair and transparent solution to the impasse",
