        "additional_details": "On average people who menstruate spend  more than \u00a318,000 on having periods in their lifetime. This may only be spent in small amounts at a time, but in the long run is an insane amount of money to spend on something that is not your choice. You should be able to go to your GP and ask for the products that you need in the same way that you can with birth control. Also, like birth control, they should still be for sale in stores for people who have particular brand preferences.",
        "background": "We want sanitary products to be free for anyone who needs them because they are a necessity for many people. People do not have a choice as to whether they menstruate and so do not have any choice but to spend a huge amount of money over their lifetime on sanitary items.",
