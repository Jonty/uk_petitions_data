        "action": "Introduce clearer labelling on all packaging of products containing palm oil.",
        "additional_details": "Unsustainable palm oil is a major contributing factor in the destruction of rainforests around the world. Deforestation not only leads to climate change, but the destruction of animal's habitats and their possible extinction. The orangutan has seen a loss of 80% of its natural habitat, in the last two decades. \r\nSo many products contain palm oil from crisps, to chocolate, to shampoo. It has even been reported that it could be used in bank notes in the future.",
        "background": "Consumers in the United Kingdom should have a choice. Due to the amount of names listed for palm oil, it is almost impossible to check whether a product contains palm oil, let alone whether it is sustainable. Packaging should be changed so that there is a clear choice when purchasing products.",
