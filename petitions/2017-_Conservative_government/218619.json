        "additional_details": "According to the RSPCA Facts and Figures, investigators deal with over 149,000 calls annually in regards to cruelty and neglect as well as rescuing 129,602 animals but only re-homing 47,000. Sadly the Animal Welfare Act 2007 is not enough for ensuring responsible ownership due to the rise in popularity for designer dogs like pugs and huskies. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home are seeing more dogs and cats due to being an unwanted present or unable to pay for health issues.",
        "background": "Further action must be brought in for owners, in order to prevent flippant animal purchases and irresponsible, unlicensed breeding. Sadly, charities are overflowing with pets; not enough responsibility is being taken by the owner- microchips just aren't enough, especially when details are outdated.",
