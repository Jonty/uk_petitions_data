However I now believe the best way we can be remember all those whose who fought for our rights, is to register our vote. Even if it is to say \"None of the above\". This is at least a tangible demonstration by our country of highly the sacrifices of these brave men and women are regarded. It will also be a source of solace and comfort to their families. They will know the ones they loved died for something worthwhile.",
        "background": "Making voting compulsory will give real meaning to the sacrifice of those who gave their lives and livelihoods for freedom and democracy. Compulsory voting honours our nations struggle to protect freedom of speech, workers rights, and votes for women, etc. It honours all those yet to be remembered.",
