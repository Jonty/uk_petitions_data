        "additional_details": "Access for public to that section of the beach will be impossible. It would be completely out of character and almost privatize part of our coastline. The area is green belt, the idea that this could go ahead is a sad day for our seafront. The building of houses on this site is for pure profit by the building company and council. If this project was to go ahead it would tell the population of south shields that the government don't care about your town just how much they can make out of it.",
        "background": "The current location has a public house on it right on the beach front.They had been approached by a housing company to build 23 appartments visible from the coast road. Revamp the current building yes but that amount of building on a green belt area opens the floodgates.",
