        "action": "Ban smoking within 6 meters from public entrances; exempting pubs and clubs.",
        "additional_details": "In the strictest sense, no law regarding entrance proximity contravenes the Health Act as these environments are no longer smoke free.  While one cannot control wind direction and the like, distance away from these entrances would normally include distance from windows, as well as provide a better environment for visitors.  This ensures the well being and comfort of non-smokers indoors remains intact, and only requires smokers to travel a few additional steps.",
        "background": "As an extension to the Health Act of 2006, extending the ban around public entrances further benefits non-smokers, while not providing additional hardships on smokers.  This benefits ground level offices mostly as smokers usually do so just outside, causing smoke to drift into nearby windows.",
