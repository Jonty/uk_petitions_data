Salary history should not be a factor in determining new pay as that undervalues the current market price for the position and skills of the employee.\r\n\r\n- There is gender pay gap in the UK, and this will help bridge closing the gap. This is a well known issue in the UK which the government is tackling.\r\n\r\n- Jobs will be offered based on skills, merit and demands of the job. Not gender, race or ethnicity.",
