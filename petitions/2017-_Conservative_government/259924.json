        "additional_details": "We propose a ban on flights from this small airport between 10.30pm and 7.30am to allow residents, children especially, the time to get a decent sleep and allow them to function properly at work and those at school to be able to learn and participate in lessons without feeling tired. Many of the residents under the flightpaths have responcible jobs and need to be able to get a decent nights sleep without interuptions. The expansion has meant property previously unaffected is now.",
        "background": "Southend Airport are continuously having 'unavoidable, emergency' flights after their agreed 11.30pm time. The morning flights wake us up at before 6.30am, therefore residents and their children are lucky to get 7 hours sleep, which is against recommended minimum guidelines to be able to function.",
