We need a strong leader, yet a leader who will not only listen to but uphold the will of the people. \r\nAt this present time, Mrs May does not appear to be this leader. Mrs May does not appear to want the best for the UK and the British people.",

We need to get out of the EU now.",

However, the Petitions Committee can\u2019t schedule votes of no confidence. This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. Petitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want."
