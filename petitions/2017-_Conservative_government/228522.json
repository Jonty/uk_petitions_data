        "additional_details": "People with disabilities have the same rights as able bodied people, and should receive the same level of service. If these measures are not put in place, this should be known as unlawful discrimination. This prevents people with disabilities from continuing with the criminal justice system. This should be implemented for both the witness and the defendant. \r\nRamp access through the entire court should be standard. \r\nI could not access the witness door because it had a step, this led me to, \u201cbump\u201d into my abuser. I had to sit very close to him with a screen but could still hear his breath as I was answering questions.",
        "background": "Disabled people should have access to all courts in the UK which should comply with The Equality Act 2010. Courts have a duty to make these adjustments ,removing barriers restricting the access that prevents people with disabilities being able to attend court, however this isn\u2019t always the case.",
