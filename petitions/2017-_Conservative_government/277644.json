It has also said that the intention of the scheme would be to support people seriously injured in Troubles-related incidents through no fault of their own, so we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
