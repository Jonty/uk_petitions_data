        "additional_details": "The government are losing credibility, force them to enact a 2 tier referendum, stay or leave, if leave, May's deal or No deal.\r\nThen make it clear that no matter how damaging, the outcome will be followed. No matter what, it cannot put us in a worse position than we are in currently.",
        "background": "The government is incapable of making a decision, and seems frozen over Brexit. The PM seems to deliberately waste the remaining time to force through her deal, and no-one is opposing Brexit, for fear of being labeled the one who undermined the referendum. They seemingly vote against all the options",
