        "action": "A referendum on whether to proceed with Brexit under terms agreed with the EU",
        "additional_details": "It is hoped that such a referendum will do one of two things:\r\n1. Help heal the divide in UK society caused by such a narrow result on a decision which many felt was vaguely defined at the time, with a far stronger mandate for a well-understood Brexit.\r\n2. Make it clear to the government that the will of the people is not represented by the terms they have managed to agree, and stop.\r\n\r\nWe cannot allow this to be an unratified decision railroaded by the government, further dividing British society.",
        "background": "In June 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU. Since then, the government has been negotiating with the EU on the terms of Brexit.\r\n\r\nWhatever these terms end up being, the decision is so large that this petition demands a vote for the British people on whether to proceed based on these terms or not.",
