        "additional_details": "Leaving using an unreliable result will damage UK democracy irreparably, ruin Britain's reputation for justice, be despotic and disregard the views of those who are likely to be today's majority. Denying 1.4 million~ voters now age 18 their say is also undemocratic. Leaving would be temporary due to Leave and Remain voter's age profile. Signatories: See pdf 6 & 7. If government refuse to act, keep finding signatories because the more that sign it, the more likely parliament is to do what we ask.",
        "background": "pdf 4 at www.todays-majority.uk explains why. This does not disrespect Leave voters as it is due to error. pdf 5 explains pre 24/06/16 government and Leave did not tell voters leave meant far lower exports to the EU, being a vassal state of the USA, job losses, austerity, higher taxes and more.",
