        "action": "Reject the Brexit Deal agreed by Theresa May and reopen negotiations immediately",
        "additional_details": "This deal needs to be rejected by the British people. It does not allow us freedom from the EU and binds our hands. It even agrees to extending the transition period if agreement can't be reached! \r\n \r\nIt doesn't matter what party you vote for, or whether you are a Brexiteer or a Remainer, EVERYONE who cares for this country has to vote against this awful deal + sign this petition. Read the deal yourself and you'll be shocked at how much sovereignty we'd be giving away. SAVE THE UK!",
        "background": "Theresa May and her followers have negotiated a very poor and unfair deal for the UK. Her misguided deal would mean Northern Ireland would have different trade rules than the UK (thus endangering the Union). We would also not be allowed to leave the Backstop (Protocol) without the EU's agreement.",
