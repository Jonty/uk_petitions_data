        "additional_details": "A briefing paper from the House of Commons Library titled 'Brexit & EU Citizenship' questions whether EU citizenship can be lost.\r\n\r\nClauses within EU law define an individuals citizenship status but it has been noted that citizenship cannot simply be taken away through a majority decision, especially against the will of the individual. The only way in which citizenship would cease to exist is if the EU itself were to dissolve.",
