        "additional_details": "My MP voted remain, with 59.1% of the area voting to leave. His position has remained unchanged and I do not believe is now representing his constituency, only himself.  As a 'remainer' he would want to stay within EU powers and therefor vote for the deal. How many other MP's are letting their own feelings take control of their vote to deal or no deal with the EU? We can not leave this important decision to a handful of people that may not be acting in the good faith of their constituents.",
