        "action": "Introduce Stronger Legislation Governing The Sale of Animal Grooming Products.",
        "additional_details": "Legislation affecting the sale of pet products is currently encompassed by EU Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 and Section 7.7 (a) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 on detergents (European Union, 2009) which states there is no 'sector specific' legislation governing the sale of pet grooming products. We believe the UK can lead the world in introducing stronger legislation forcing a reappraisal in the way in which these products are regulated and labelled.",
        "background": "At present, companies that produce cosmetic products for animals are under no legal compulsion to label their products appropriately or adhere to the safety standards that regulate the sale of human cosmetics. We want the UK Government to address this with the introduction of stronger legislation.",
