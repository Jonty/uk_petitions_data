Stations get missed, companies charge exuberant prices, people get crushed, people overheat (no air con on a lot of trains) and nothing is being done about it.\r\n\r\nAn office has a maximum limit to the persons allowed on a Health and Safety grounds, as do many other businesses and services (bus's do too). Why not trains?",

No H/S limit is enforced.",
