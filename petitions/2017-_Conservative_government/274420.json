        "additional_details": "Primates often suffer appalling mental health issues as a result of being kept in captivity. They also often have diseases such as diabetes due to the inappropriate diet they are fed. Thousands of privately owned primates are kept in the UK, as it is still possible to walk into a high street pet shop and buy a primate.\r\n\r\nThe law must change to make it illegal for private individuals to purchase or own primates as pets in the UK.\r\n\r\nFurther information: www.bornfree.org.uk and www.wildfutures.org",
        "background": "Primates have complex needs and are ill-suited for private ownership. However, the sale and keeping of primates as pets in the UK is currently legal. Legislation needs to change to make it illegal for private individuals to purchase or own primates as pets in the United Kingdom.",
