        "action": "Provide annual Breast Screening and handheld mammogram machines at GP Surgeries.",
        "additional_details": "Recently several women who have this disease found a change in their breasts themselves, had they not, their lives would be at risk of a higher Stage of Cancer or die before their next scheduled Screening. 3 years is too long, it is the difference between life and death. Other Countries do mammograms annually logically Early Stage treatment must cost less than treatment if left. There are cheaper handheld mammogram machines which could be put in GP Surgeries so annual Screening can be supported.",
        "background": "For many years women have been offered Breast Screening every 3 years. It is a National Statistic that women have been diagnosed with Breast Cancer between Screenings and most are deemed as not 'at risk' i.e., they do not have family history. Cancer is indiscriminate and can occur between Screening.",
