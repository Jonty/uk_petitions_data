        "action": "Amend the 1992 Badgers Act to allow culling of badgers in problem areas anywhere",
        "additional_details": "This extensive protection of badgers has worked well, indeed too well. Badgers are common now. The TB debate is the best known, but there are many other issues. Falling hedgehog populations, reductions in ground nesting bird populations, property damage, badger setts in fields endangering farmers and stock being taken are among the issues. Badgers have no natural predators.This petition asks that where badgers can be shown to be causing problems, limited numbers should be allowed to be culled.",
        "background": "First protected by the 1835 Cruelty to Animals Act, The 1973 Badgers Act offered great protection to badgers, though they could still be persecuted. The 1991 Badgers (Further Protection) Act offered more protection, and was reinforced by the 1992 Badgers Act , superseding the 1973 Badgers Act.",
