The Lisbon treaty does not do the things listed in your petition. For example, the Lisbon treaty could in no way stop the UK from calling itself a \u201cnation\u201d nor does it force the UK to adopt the Euro. UK has been part of and followed EU trade policy ever since it joined the then EEC and has long been part of the Common Fisheries Policy. Also, the European Parliament and the Court of Justice of the EU have never been and are not supreme over all legislative bodies of the UK. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for the UK Government and Parliament to commit to not adopting the Euro, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to happen."
