There is an inherent risk in the \u2018Big Four\u2019 conducting annual audits of companies where senior management are ex-\u2018Big Four\u2019 themselves.  A mutual understanding serves each party in this situation as well as the knowledge that any moral hazard contracts or companies are ultimately backed by the government (i.e. UK Taxpayers).",

In addition, tax avoidance schemes/\u2018earnings stripping\u2019 should be managed to ensure suitable levels of reinvestment back into the economy and infrastructure.",

We understand that you're concerned about public contracts, but we're not sure what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nFor example, we're not sure what you'd like to happen to the results of the audits. We're also not sure what role you'd like the audit to have in \"tax avoidance schemes/ 'earnings stripping'\"\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government to change the law so that the NAO is given responsibly for auditing any company that wins Government contracts worth more than \u00a320 million and that any appropriate contract must include an agreement to be audited by the NAO and the results made public.
