Thousands of Islamic refugees are allowed to flood into the United Kingdom every year yet as soon as it is a Christian woman that is in danger, the home office just turn the other cheek and hope the barbarians have mercy on her soul.",
        "background": "Asia Bibi is an innocent and most importantly Christian woman that is no longer safe living in Pakistan. There are lynch mobs wanting to kill her for insulting Islam. We need to bring her to the United Kingdom in order to show the world we are still available to poor Christians in crisis.",
