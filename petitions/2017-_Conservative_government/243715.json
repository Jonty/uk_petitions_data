For example, you could ask the Government to start an employment programme for mothers of school-age children, if that's what you would like to happen.\r\n\r\nThere are other petitions about childcare. You might want to sign one of these if they ask for something you want to happen:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228784\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/238115"
