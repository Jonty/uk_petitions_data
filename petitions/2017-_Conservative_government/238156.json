        "action": "Increase police funding on a local and national level",
        "additional_details": "We are GCSE students studing politics and Citizenship at Severn Vale School and we believe that poor funding for the police means that their vital role is unable to be fulfilled to a standard society requires. From our research we believe there is a direct correlation between a decrease in Police funding and an increase in crime. An example of this is that moped crimes nationwide have increased by 1572% in just 3 years and in the same time police funding has fallen by \u00a3499,642,790.",
        "background": "No one would disagree the Police have a critical role within our society by ensuring our safety and liberties are upheld. So we need to convince the Chancellor of the Exchequer to increase funding to an already challenged police force.",
