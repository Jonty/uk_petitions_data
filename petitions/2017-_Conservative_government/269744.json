        "action": "To legalise the use of electric scooters in the UK and update the highway act.",
        "additional_details": "I need no evidence or references as it is clear to see that the UK lacks in electric scooters transport compared to other countries due to the law. The app Reby allows everyone access to e-scooters for personal use at a paid fee. Of course there are restrictions, they are to respect the rules of the road and only go in 30 zones. Cycle paths are free to use and pedestrian zones only to be used if there is enough space. If we can have electric bikes, then why not electric scooters?",
        "background": "Personally, I discovered electric scooters on a holiday to Barcelona. I assumed social norms in England meant they \u2018weren\u2019t cool\u2019 and upon looking into it I realised that they were in fact illegal. I soon noticed a lack of congestion that I was used to in the UK. And people travelling harmoniously.",
