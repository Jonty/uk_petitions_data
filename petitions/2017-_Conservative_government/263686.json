They are seen to enhance patient care by the doctors they work with.\r\nSwift passage of the bill will protect the title and public from unqualified people using the title, as happened with Paramedics.",

It should be amended to grant the same prescribing and imaging rights to PAs as junior doctors with similar experience.",
