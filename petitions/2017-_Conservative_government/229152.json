If you\u2019re not on benefits/an alcoholic/drug dependant/aggressive you\u2019re sent home\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s unfair to the patient AND on the loved ones who then go home with someone who\u2019s vulnerable until the next time they endanger themselves for the cycle to reoccur\r\n\r\nWhy do we pay taxes to be turned away at crisis?\r\n\r\nPeople are dying & this MUST change.",
