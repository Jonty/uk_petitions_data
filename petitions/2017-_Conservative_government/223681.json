        "additional_details": "We had a bank holiday for the Royal Wedding, however, this not only brings the country together, but the world. Bank holiday for the day after the hopeful celebrations would be beneficial as there will be no irresponsible drunk driving as no one has to think about going to work the day after or being unproductive at work due to being hungover / not turning up at all. Everyone will be happy. Gareth Southgate should also be knighted upon bringing it home.",
        "background": "The World Cup Final is on Sunday 15th July, England are currently exceeding expectations. While we don't want to jinx anything we would like to be prepared to celebrate as a nation if the dream comes true. Therefor Monday 16th July should be a bank holiday to allow the country to come together.",
