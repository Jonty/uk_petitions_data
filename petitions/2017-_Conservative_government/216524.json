        "additional_details": "Many if not all of these people have worked here all their lives, paid taxes, raised families, bought property and contributed richly to their communities. \nWhen the Home Office writes to them, telling them they are likely to be deported within weeks to a place they don't know, and telling them to report to the police station or the Home Office, it is extremely distressing and inhuman. \nWe call on Government to cease this cruel treatment of our senior citizens with immediate effect.",
        "background": "Elwaldo Romeo is one of many law abiding older people who arrived here legally from the Caribbean with their parents in the 1950s and 60s but who are now being told by the Home Office that they have no right to be here and will be deported. This is inhuman and we call on Government to cease this now",
