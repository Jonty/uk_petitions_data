        "additional_details": "In England the number of homeless has risen every year for the last 8 years and has increased by over 250% since 2010. An estimated 320,000 people sleep rough in Britain. Average life expectancy is 44 years, over 30 years shorter than the average in the UK as a whole. People on the streets are often there for reasons beyond their control. They might have children who they don't see, or mental health issues that are not being treated. Homelessness is a problem that can and should be tackled.",
        "background": "Homeless people are stuck in a vicious cycle whereby they are unable to get work because they have no ID, so have no way of getting off the streets. For those who are actively wanting to work there should be help to obtain ID which could also facilitate help with substance abuse & accommodation.",

For example, you could start a petition calling for increased government funding for employment programmes for homeless people."
