Losing access to the EU market, which accounts for half of our trade would have a great impact on the future of the United Kingdom. \r\nA second referendum is our right!",

We\u2019ll have less money for public services, because the economy will be damaged. A second referendum is vital for the British people, now knowing the facts of how it is going to be bad, as we need the EU.",
