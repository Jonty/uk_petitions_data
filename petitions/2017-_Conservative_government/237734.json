        "additional_details": "Venezuela, a country that was once a stable democracy and a strong economy, is now plagued by a dictatorial regime that is starving its citizens, stands accused by the UN Human Rights Commissioner of systematically murdering and torturing protesters, and has triggered the biggest refugee crisis in the history of the Americas.",
        "background": "In May 2018, Venezuela held presidential elections that were condemned as \"neither free nor fair\" by the UK. In 2019 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was sworn-in as President. But the Venezuelan Constitution states that the president of the National Assembly must take office temporarily until new elections are held.",
