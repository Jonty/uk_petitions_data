        "additional_details": "This crime is mind torture as the perpetrator isolates and abuses their victim to the extreme in a calculated way so they are trapped completely. This is not seen by anyone and the evidence is minimal for conviction with a public jury. Perpetrators will not leave their victims alone. They cover up so well and you are made to look crazy. You get Stockholm syndrome, PTSD and ill. However many times you flee, they can find you, they know exactly what they are doing.",
        "background": "The standard jury system cannot understand or deal appropriately with perpetrators of psychological abuse. These cases must be exempt from a jury and heard by a judge with specialist psychology level trained to understand narcistic traits of controlling and coercive behaviour in all relationships. ",
