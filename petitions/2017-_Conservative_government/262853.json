They could decide whether they\u2019d rather be in the UK and EU or leave with England. \r\n\r\nThe backstop issue would no longer be an unsolvable problem and England can leave the EU, like they chose to.\r\n\r\nAny English people who don\u2019t want to leave the UK and EU could seek asylum in the UK and we can put this whole messy business behind us.",
