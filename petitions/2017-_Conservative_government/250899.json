        "additional_details": "Ex-Armed Forces personnel serving time in prison can currently accrue a great deal of money while serving their sentence. Meanwhile, victims, including the families of children who\u2019ve been victims of sexual offences, bear the cost of necessary therapy due to the lack of publicly funded services.",
        "background": "Currently, ex-Armed Forces personnel are entitled to keep their Armed Forces pensions whilst they are in prison. The taxpayer is footing the bill for their imprisonment AND paying them a pension. Yet services for their victims are underfunded and inadequate. This is patently unjust.",
