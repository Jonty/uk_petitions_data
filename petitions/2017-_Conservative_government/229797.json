        "action": "Require restaurants to give a range of vegan and vegetarian options by law",
        "additional_details": "The other reasons are simple. While I firmly believe killing animals is wrong and that a plant based diet brings great benefits I accept not everyone will change. But I do believe that everyone is happy to try or at least take pressure away from the animal farming industry. \r\nThe killing of animals for food and the use of what they provide has been linked to cancer, diabetes and other awful diseases by some studies. We pay millions in treating these.",
        "background": "As it stands there is no actual law that states restaurants must provide vegan and vegetarian options. Veganism is on the rise and gaining real growth as its own lifestyle. most of us feel unfairly treated when our options are greatly limited and social interactions are in decline as a result",
