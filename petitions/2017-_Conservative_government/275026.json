        "additional_details": "Brexit is a hotly debated topic that has divided the nation. This petition is not influenced by Brexit, but it does play a significant part as the Prime Minister decided to prorogue Parliament in order to push through his plans for the October 31st deadline. This petition is to ensure that a person - in this case the Prime Minister should face trial in court for acting against the law. \r\n\r\nNo person is above the law, and no-one should be allowed to significantly break it and not face trial.",
        "background": "No-one is above the law and if you are found breaking it then you should be held to account. Today, the Supreme Court ruled that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson unlawfully prorogued Parliament. This petition is to see that Mr Johnson should face trial for his unlawful actions.",
