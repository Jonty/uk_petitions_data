        "additional_details": "I want to make it law that cyclist must wear a helmet when using the road and have the correct protection of clothing. The helmet is to protect their head from sustaining a hard injury. Yes sometimes the helmet can't help the impact of the accident but 8/10 it does help. If by making this law I save 1 person then thats one family/friend less that have to suffer the pain. Seat belts keep car users safe so does a HELMET.",
        "background": "2 Years ago this year I lost my god-father in cycle accident, no fault of his own. He was wearing a helmet, his bike had lights on and he was wearing protection clothing. Ever since loosing him it has been more noticeable that some cyclist using the road don't do this.",
