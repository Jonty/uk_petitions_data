        "additional_details": "An obligation for MPs to hold constituency surgeries on a monthly (or other regular) basis would be beneficial to MPs and constituents alike.\r\n\r\nMeeting with constituents is a key responsibility of the role of the MP (per: http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/mps/ for example)",
        "background": "MPs currently have discretion about how frequently to hold constituency surgeries, or even whether to hold them at all.  This results in a discrepancy between levels of representation offered.  Some MPs go out of their way to exchange views with constituents, whereas others avoid doing so.",
