        "additional_details": "Acid attacks are not just another violent attack. \r\n- they are not impulsive, but require preparation and are premeditated\r\n- they don't inflict controlled damage, but as much damage and suffering possible - that makes them also vicious\r\n\r\nRegister would ease limitting access to such substances, through purchase or by performing a particular role. It could protect public in certain circumstances (similar to Sarah's Law and Clare's Law) or allow for easier monitoring and swiffter police reaction.",
        "background": "UK is amongst the countries with highest rate of acid attacks. There is a trend them increasing in number, just in London those being doubled since 2014, inspite of Government actions so far. Register is one of the possible actions promoting 'zero-tolerance' approach.",
