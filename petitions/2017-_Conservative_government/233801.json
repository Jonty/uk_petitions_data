        "additional_details": "The Secretary of State for Transport owes it to rail users in the North to intervene and force improvements on Arriva Northern so that it\u2019s customers can travel in comfort and on reliable and \r\npunctual services.  If Arriva Northern can\u2019t do this they should be stripped of their franchise.\r\nThe North - it\u2019s people and it\u2019s economy - deserve the same investment in its railways as those in other parts of the country and we deserve a reliable and high quality service.",
        "background": "Arriva Northern Rail\u2019s service is an affront to a First World rail system.  Punctuality and comfort don\u2019t seem even afterthoughts. Old, outdated, uncomfortable carriages, poor punctuality, regular strike action contribute to a regularly poor experience by customers on northern rail trains.",
