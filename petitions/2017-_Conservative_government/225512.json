        "additional_details": "Putting in as little as 20 hours extra a week can result in nearly \u00a3250 tax being taken from wages, it benefits the person using the service but not the staff that provide the support to help the person in the care environment, I think a decreased tax code for people in the care industry would make the extra hours worthwhile and would also help to get more people into the care industry",
        "background": "A lot of people in the care industry take on overtime to help people that they support across the health care sector to give them the best support they could have, a lot of the carers etc don't feel the benefit of putting in extra hours but feel a pinch by getting a large amount of their pay taxed",

For example, you could ask the Government to raise the tax-free allowance for care staff so that they can earn more money before they pay tax."
