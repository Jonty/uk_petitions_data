        "additional_details": "Firework smoke has been shown to significantly increase breathing problems and have increased toxicity compared to traffic pollution. In this technologically advanced world we live in, surely we have the ability to come up with more inventive ways of using music, lights, and water displays to commemorate the new year.  In 2018, authorities in Dubai opted to light up the Burj Khalifa in a sensational display without fireworks, proving it can be done. We could save millions & our health-pls sign.",
        "background": "It\u2019s the beginning of a new year and in many countries around the world, it has become a tradition to set off thousands of fireworks in elaborate displays. But if we stopped to consider the environmental impact of such extravagance, would we still choose this option or go for a safer, greener option",
