        "action": "Change the insurance industry in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "People usually avoid informing their insurance company about damage they repair themselves as this typically results in hiked premiums. Why should we pay twice? Insurance companies should not be allowed to increase premiums if they have not paid out for said damage. This is mostly relevant to car insurance but can apply to every insurance.",
        "background": "When one contacts their insurance company to inquire about a claim, the insurance company usually hikes the premium at renewal regardless of whether or not the insurers pay out. The government should change the legislation to ensure that the public are not ripped off by the insurance industry.",
