        "additional_details": "Equal opportunities for all? Deaf people are discriminated against everyday. Not being able to use their language in schools and not given the option to sit a GCSE in their first language. This is like making an English person sit a French GCSE as their first language!\r\nStatistics show how this is effecting deaf children's grades with less than half achieving!\r\nThe cost of BSL courses range from \u00a3300 - \u00a31,600 per course and with no financial support available it makes it impossible for families to communicate with their deaf children. \r\nLets break this barrier and allow equality for all, lets give everyone the option of a bright future!",
        "background": "90% of deaf children are born into hearing families. With little support available these families are unable to communicate with the deaf child leaving them feeling isolated and alone. If BSL were taught in schools children would have the opportunity to feel equal and not have to face these barriers",
