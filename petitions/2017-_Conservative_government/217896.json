In many places I get no healthy vegan option at all. I don\u2019t expect all businesses to have vegan options but some sectors should.\r\nAlso I am forced to handle non vegan items in total disregard of my strong ethical objections. This should not be legal.\r\nPeople calling themselves vegan has grown to 7% of the UK population from 1% in 2 years.",
