        "additional_details": "We need to stop letting these children/family struggle because no one really knows what we go through, especially if you are an autistic female who can mask her traits by observing and mimicking what other children do and giving eye contact when it comes to comunicating but this is very exausting to the autistic female, which results in meltdowns as soon as she gets home from holding herself together all day and being someone she's not, just because we are female we are thought not to have autism.",
        "background": "Austism presents differently in males and females that most girls get left undignosed and left flying under the radar, a failed generation and we need to change this. All doctors and teachers everywhere should have the training to recognise autism in both sexes.",
