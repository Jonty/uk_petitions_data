        "additional_details": "51.9% of British people voted for a Brexit and what Theresa May is giving us is a joke. We need someone who is good to lead the UK to independence from the EU which is what we voted for. This is why Theresa May, who was a remainer, is not good enough to lead our country. Theresa May should step down and someone like Boris Johnson should take the lead in giving Britain its independence back.",
        "background": "Theresa May is not fit to be the prime minister during the current brexit situation. The British public voted for a brexit and it has been promised so it is absolutely absurd to have a prime minster who was a remainer to lead what the British people have voted for.",
