        "additional_details": "Libraries are a part of the fabric of our local community which have provided generations of families with access to literature, education, knowledge, learning and support. Libraries are an essential part of public services just like Schools, and Hospitals enabling poor children from disadvantaged families to access information, knowledge and skills to give them a decent chance in life. Libraries are fantastic assets to the community and need to be saved for future generations.",
        "background": "Currently Local Authorities are closing Libraries up and down the country, and they can evade their responsibilities to provide a Library service under The Libraries and Museums Act 1964 by citing the provision to provide 'a modern and efficient and service within available resources'",
