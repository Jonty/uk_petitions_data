ULHT removed beds from the children\u2019s ward and were told to put them back by the CQC but ULHT did not! For more information look at SOS - Pilgrim Hospital on Facebook",

We all know that if these services close they will not return and then marks the death of Pilgrim Hospital. This means Lincoln, Nottingham and Peterborough for children\u2019s services.",
