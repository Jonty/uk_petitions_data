        "additional_details": "\"When we arrived at the hospital my son needed a nappy change. I checked the men's and disabled toilets for changing facilities to find none. I asked at the information desk where baby changing was and was told it was only in the ladies. I asked where dads were expected to change their babies and was told to ask a nurse to use a side room but not to bank on them allowing it. I ended up changing my son's nappy on the floor in a corridor.\" Dadsnet Member.",
        "background": "TheDadsnet hear daily from dad's who haven\u2019t had access to safe places to change their baby\u2019s nappy. Including an NHS hospital. We want the government to change the laws around the provision of baby changing facilities accessible to fathers, like former President Obama did in  the USA.",
