        "action": "Keep EU food labelling regulations following Brexit to highlight allergens",
        "additional_details": "As a mum of a child with Cows Milk Protein Allergy, the legislation has made our life much easier, as i know it has many others. \r\nThere is still work to do, particularly in bakeries and restaurants to ensure allergy information is readily available for customers, but it would be an absolute travesty if the legislation was to fall away when Britain leaves the EU. \r\nPlease give your support to this petition to help keep our food labels clear and allergy awareness an important factor in food safety.",
        "background": "The introduction of regulation EU FIC 1169/2011 in December 2014 means that the presence of common allergens are now highlighted on food packaging and should also be available when requested for unpackaged food. It would be a terrible backwards step if this progression in food safety was to be lost.",
