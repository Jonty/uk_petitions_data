        "additional_details": "The British public voted to join the EEC as a mutually beneficial trading block NOT an ever closer union dominated by Germany and France. If anyone doubts this consider why our prime minister has to constantly beg favour from their respective leaders. Any strategic negotiation requires both sides to take hardline positions not necessarily sought. All MP\u2019s are kindly reminded of this simple fact and respectfully requested not to contort the wishes of the silent majority.",
        "background": "When the majority of the British public voted Brexit our intention was simple. It was EXIT THE EU, not \u201csemi-leave\u201d, or \u201ckeep EU rules and jurisdiction\u201d, or perhaps dither around for years on end with no idea what to do, it was just EXIT. Any MP arguing anything different is kidding themselves.",
