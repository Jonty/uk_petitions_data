        "additional_details": "There should be a nation-wide, guaranteed response to individuals seeking help for suicidal thoughts and feelings in our hospitals. \r\n \r\nThe following procedure should be guaranteed as a standard response: \r\n \r\n1. The contemplation of suicide or signs of severe mental distress is classified as a medical emergency. \r\n2. The individual is processed on-site immediately. \r\n3. The individual is taken to a \u201cCalm Room\u201d. \r\n4. \u2018Suicide Guarantee\u2019 trained staff member speaks with the individual with attentive compassion. \r\n5.

        "background": "When you feel suicidal in the UK, doctors tell you to go to A&E. What you will find there is based on luck: will you find compassion? Or will you be judged and turned away? A majority of the time, the latter. Asking for help can be a turning point for individuals in crisis.",
