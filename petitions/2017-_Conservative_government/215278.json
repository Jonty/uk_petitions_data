        "action": "Make middle rate DLA a base rate for children with Cystic fibrosis.",
        "additional_details": "Many people are awarded middle or high level for the care and mobility parts of DLA, its awarded for conditions that aren't chronic, so CF should be taken more seriously with awards. Some families on forums discuss how two families who have CF children with the same daily routines apply and one may be awarded lower rate and one higher rate. Theres no pattern at all it just depends who gets the paperwork. CF should have a minimum award rate of middle care.",
        "background": "Many parents caring for a child with Cystic fibrosis aren't getting carers allowance because families are being told they can only get lower rate disability living allowance, CF is a chronic illness that requires many daily treatments. Many parents cant work due to this & need carers allowance!",
