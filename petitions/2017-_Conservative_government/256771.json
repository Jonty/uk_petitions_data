Each of the MPs will only be subject to one no confidence vote per term as set down by the fixed term parliament act. The question should be added to the local elections ballot asking people to vote if they have confidence in their MP. This ballot is offered automatically during their term in office, so constituents can remove MPs during office not having to wait up to 5 yrs.",
