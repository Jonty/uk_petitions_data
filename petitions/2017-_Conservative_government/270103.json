        "action": "Remain in the EU until technology to avoid the Brexit backstop is available\r\n",
        "additional_details": "Replacing any possible hard border in Ireland with this technology will render the backstop unnecessary. The initiation of this compromise solution will resolve the current impasse, all sides can be involved in signing it off. The technology may take up to 10 years to be ready (as indicated by certain investigations), however staying in the EU until the technology is fast tracked is eminently preferable to leaving without a deal, remaining, or implementing other much more unpopular compromises.",
        "background": "A feasibility study into the ease of the Brexit process wasn't commissioned prior to Article 50 being triggered. The best compromise will be to leave the EU as soon as technology to remove any need for a hard border in Ireland is signed off as ready by the UK, Eire and the EU.",
