        "action": "Lower the rate of duty on alcoholic beverages in pubs (and restaurants?)",
        "additional_details": "Communal drinking and socialising forms a valuable function in terms of social cohesion and sense of community. Home drinking or street drinking can be actively detrimental to this. Making retail purchased alcohol relatively more expensive would, I believe, help to discourage this. The alternative of course would be raising the level of duty charged on alcoholic beverages bought from retail outlets.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time.",
        "background": "Pubs form a valuable social and community function in many towns and villages and help to make Britain what it is. Towns and villages with good pubs are better than those without. This should be recognised by Government. It is the role of good Government to make this country a better place to live.",
