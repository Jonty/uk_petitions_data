        "action": "End the IVF postcode lottery and demand equality of provision on the NHS",
        "additional_details": "Infertility is a disease with profound effects on individuals and on families, and private treatment is very expensive. Individual CCGs can currently choose whether to offer 1, 2, 3, or even 0 rounds of treatment without being held accountable for unjustifiably perpetuating inequality in provision, or failing to follow NICE guidelines. If this rationing of treatment had happened with any other aspect of healthcare - treating broken bones, or heart disease, or MS - it would be decried as a major scandal.",
        "background": "For the sake of equality and fairness we need the government to hold local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to account and to legislate to ensure that access to IVF provision on the NHS is equal across England. All CCGs should be required to offer the same number of rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
