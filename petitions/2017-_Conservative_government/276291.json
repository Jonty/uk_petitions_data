        "additional_details": "100s of 1000s of children here in the UK use sign language or signing systema to aid communication. I strongly believe that if all primary schools promote a sign of the day/week children will learn the basic word signs. This doesn\u2019t have to cost, i would be willing to volunteer to supply videos. it won\u2019t take time as will only take less than a minute each time in assembly/registration. I know schools can choose to teach sign but it should be compulsory. How can inclusion ever be down to choice!",
        "background": "This can be simply a sign of the day/week shown in assembly or registration & doesn\u2019t need to take up precious time/money. My brother is my inspiration, he has severe disabilities and uses sign to support his speech and communication. Nobody should be socially isolated due to communication barriers!",
