        "additional_details": "People who need and would like to have Otoplasty surgery can\u2019t get it done due to NHS not funded enough. It costs too much going private and either myself and/or other people who want Otoplasty can\u2019t afford it. It\u2019s not right that myself or others would have to go private. The cost is about \u00a32,500-\u00a33,500 plus any consultations etc.\r\n\r\nI want to get this done as it\u2019s causimg me significant Psychological distress and others feel the same. I don\u2019t want to go privately to get cosmetic surgery.",
        "background": "I would like to have cosmetic surgery as my ears stick out a bit,  I\u2019ve been to my doctors and seen different doctors and they said I might not be accepted due to funding and not have a good case.\r\n\r\nI suffer from Body Dysmorphic Disorder and severe depression, having  ears pinned would help a bit.",
