        "additional_details": "Mobile data access is a key part of working and personal life for almost all people in the UK today. \r\n\r\nTo have access for some and not for others when a network goes down is depriving large segments of the population with the ability to be productive, happy, and even safe.\r\n\r\nIt does not need to be this way, if the hardware of UK mobile data coverage was recognised as a natural monopoly and brought into public hands so it could also be managed in the public interest, all would be better off.",
        "background": "6 December 2018, O2 experienced a widespread failure affecting 20m+ UK customers. However other network providers continued to enjoy access. This petition would bring into public hands the network of phone masts, thus guaranteeing equality of access for customers.",
