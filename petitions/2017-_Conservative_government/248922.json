That referendum was held on 23rd June 2016 and was decided by majority that Britain would leave the EU (Brexit). The British public was told that the referendum result would be upheld by David Cameron and by his successor Theresa May. . We demand that Parliament delivers on that result and that the option to cancel Brexit should be banned from any discussion on the matter in the Houses of Parliament.",
