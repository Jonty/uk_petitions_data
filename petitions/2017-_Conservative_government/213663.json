        "additional_details": "Cheap, disposable tat that is given for free in magazines, has no longevity and will end up in landfill before the year is out most likely. If children\u2019s magazines alone were not permitted to include this stuff, think of the difference this would make - not only on the environment but also kids\u2019 attitudes to reading magazines for the love of reading, alone!",
        "background": "All children\u2019s magazines on sale in UK shops have a packet of cheap plastic tat attached to them as a purchase incentive. \r\n\r\nThis is catastrophic for the environment. But it also creates negative behaviour in children - they should desire magazines for reading/activities not gaining more stuff.",
