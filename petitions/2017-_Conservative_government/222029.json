        "additional_details": "Palm oil is the leading cause of rain-forest destruction, particularly in South-East Asia and it is hidden in many of the products that we all use daily. \r\nWhile we wait for companies to follow the lead of Iceland supermarket (recently stated they will remove all the palm oil from their products), all products containing palm oil should have it CLEARLY stated that it does so on the label. Caring consumers can then make more informed choices regarding the products they purchase.",
        "background": "Palm oil - the 'invisible ingredient' and the leading cause of the destruction of the rain-forest in Asia. Companies can state 'palm oil' as an ingredient in over 200 ways. And so, consumers cannot make informed decisions. All products containing palm oil should declare it clearly on the label.",
