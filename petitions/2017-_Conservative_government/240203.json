        "additional_details": "Following a recent incident in which my wife was set upon by two out of control dogs and subsequently witnessed our own dog savagely killed I have looked at the law and was shocked to find this mainly focuses on physical harm of a person. The law does not take into account the mental damage ensuring such an attack can cause, also the pain and suffering the loss of a pet from such a horrific incident can inflict. The law seems to have been put together hastily following media focus on attacks and needs a review.",
