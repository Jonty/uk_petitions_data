        "additional_details": "Children have to spend 8 hours a day in school for 5 days a week, adding up to 195 days in school (minus teacher training days), and 714 hours for children in secondary schools. This means that the amount of time in school for secondary school children has increased by 79 hours compared to primary school children. Children need time to cool off and wind down as well, and a 6 week holiday is not enough.",
        "background": "School has become more intense for children in the 21st century. Children are bombarded with lots of work everyday, and tough exams that just get tougher; judging by the amount of time they spend in school the time they get to cool down and be able to express themselves as children is very limited.",
