        "action": "No second referendum/Peoples Vote on the final Brexit deal",
        "additional_details": "The attempts to propose yet another referendum or \"Peoples Vote\" and pose a set of questions to the British public on the final deal is a distasteful proposal. We were  given a free and fair referendum two years ago. Holding another referendum would be an appalling waste of taxpayers money and send out the wrong message to the British public that the vote on June 23 2016 was meaningless.\r\n\r\nThe referendum should not be re-run just to placate individuals unable to accept a democratic decision.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned,  call upon HM government to dismiss calls for a referendum on the final deal as the British people were asked an important question on the 23rd June 2016. The choice was a binary one - Remain or Leave the European Union. Leave won.",
