        "action": "Amend the 2004 Hunting Act to include a minimum age requirement for hunt riders.",
        "additional_details": "A minimum age of 16 years old for riders with trail hunts is required. The accidental but brutal killing of an animal should never be witnessed by a minor.\r\n\r\nTrail hunts can kill foxes. Regardless of whether a hunt chases and kills foxes intentionally or by accident, this is no place for a child. Children as young as 5 or 6 ride out on hunts. They are innocent and unaware of the intent of the hounds should they get on the scent of a fox. To witness such a violent act at a young age could normalise abusive behaviour and create an acceptance of animal cruelty.",
        "background": "A child witnessing a fox killed by hounds during trail hunting has a psychological impact. It can be detrimental to their mental health and wellbeing. ",
