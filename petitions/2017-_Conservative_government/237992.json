        "additional_details": "In the UK some medical conditions are eligible for a 'medical exemption certificate' which means that they do not need to pay for the day to day treatment of their condition. One of the criteria which will make you eligible is having \"a continuing physical disability which means you cannot go out without the help of another person\"(NHS website). Without my lenses I would struggle to live my life the way I do now, it would limit what I could do inside and outside the house. It is not a choice.",
        "background": "When I was 6 months old I was diagnosed with cataracts, I had both natural lenses removed, registering me partially sighted. This left me having to wear very strong lenses, -18 prescription. Without lenses I would be unable to see, to be able to see I have to pay \u00a3100 each year for the privilege.",
