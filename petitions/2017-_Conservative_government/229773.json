        "additional_details": "Now in the 21st century Doctors dispensing staff are as qualified in all aspects of dispensing and services as the Chemists.The one mile rule should now be changed to fit the NHS White Paper headed PATIENT CHOICE so that all patients in practices throughout the country have to option to choose where they would like to have their medicines dispensed.The ruling has been challenged before but never challenged for the wording of PATIENT CHOICE that the White Paper promises. We have to make a stand.",
        "background": "A Dickensian ruling was set in the early nineteen hundreds which stated that Doctors prescribed and Apothecaries dispensed.Doctors could  only dispense to their patients if they lived more than a mile (as the crow flies) from the Apothecary due to Doctors staff not being qualified to dispense.",

For example, you could ask the Government to require GP surgeries to have facilities for dispensing medicines, so that its an option for patients, if that's what you would like to happen."
