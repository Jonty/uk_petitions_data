        "action": "Make it unlawful for candidate names to be on UCAS applications.",
        "additional_details": "In 2015, David Cameron stated that this would be introduced. Instead, a few universities have volunteered to trial the removal of names from UCAS applications. It is noted that neither the University of Oxford nor the University of Cambridge are a part of the trial. This is nonsense! There is no reason to allow universities and UCAS to decide whether to keep names on UCAS forms. Instead, this should be government policy and enforced. This is too important to leave to UCAS and their universities to decide for themselves.",
        "background": "Racism, sexism and class discrimination exist. Applications to university should be based entirely on the candidate's ability and not prejudice or social engineering. Removing names from UCAS applications, removes another potential way that universities can discriminate.",
