For example a toxic community of 12 year olds who finish, constant glitches that dramatically affect gameplay and graphics made to look like loony toons. This problem has got to the point where it is even a problem for some players, stories include people hearing the \u2019Battle Bus\u2019 and \u2018Golden Chests\u2019 in their everyday ventures. Termination of this game in the United Kingdom will bring sanity to those not only playing the game, but also the ones not. Thank you.",

Making other people\u2019s lives talking to these people, very distressing.",
