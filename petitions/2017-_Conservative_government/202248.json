        "additional_details": "The new 1% Employers Education Tax will go towards eliminating the tuition fee liability on all existing UK graduates and providing free university tuition fee for all current and future UK students leaving further education.\r\nIn addition, individuals who may have missed the opportunity to go to university and who may now, or in the future, wish to pursue a university degree for whatever purpose will be encouraged to apply at all stages of their life and be funded to do so.",
        "background": "Employers currently receive the rewards of a highly educated workforce but contribute little or nothing towards the educational costs of their employees.\r\nEmployers should pay a 1% tax rate on the gross salary of all employees to help fund the tuition fee costs of all students entering university.",
