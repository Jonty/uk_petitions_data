        "additional_details": "After working 18 years, getting taken away the long service days you earned, and bank holidays being pushed on everyone as a normal day, they used to be Sunday trading, but are now getting longer and longer, with last Good Friday, the store staying open 24 hours. \r\nWe have been in talks, along with the GMB, to not force this contract on us, but they haven\u2019t listened. So this petition is the only way I can think of getting our plight heard, life is not all about work.\r\nGIVE OUR BANK HOLIDAYS BACK!",
        "background": "Colleagues are losing their choice to work bank holidays, and their human right to spend time with their families. Retail groups get greedy, many on minimum wage, taking away long service rewards, moving the goal posts for night shifts, the only thing we have left, or should have is our family time.",
