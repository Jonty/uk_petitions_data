        "additional_details": "What ever reason the government feel this is the right thing to do it is morally wrong. They claim they are doing these things for the benefit of the people who live there, yet if you look at the death toll of civilians and images of Syria before and after the war more bombs being dropped is in no way the right thing to do. Besides this it is causing rising tensions with Russia. Have we not learned yet that war is not the answer? And by supporting America with bombing Syria we are provoking war.",
        "background": "The death toll of civilians in Syria due to the war are now over 500,000 and in 2017 alone it\u2019s estimated that 10000+ civilians were killed. These are mass war crimes. Which the UK are taking part in. They claim it\u2019s necessary due to chemical attacks by Assad, yet no evidence has been provided.",
