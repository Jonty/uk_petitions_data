        "additional_details": "A third of children in the UK are overweight or obese; for those with severe or morbid obesity (Tier 3) their weight is physically and emotionally debilitating. Adult Tier 3 services are available and funded but only 7% of LA/CCG provide Tier 3 services for children. The Government needs to provide adequate funding for specialist obesity services for children with complex needs, provide clear guidance on commissioning services and invest in the treatment services needed.",
        "background": "Childhood obesity can be the result and cause of other mental and physical health issues, such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and poor mobility. Specialist services and adequate funding for children with severe or morbid obesity (Tier 3) are urgently needed.",
