        "action": "New drivers to have black box with continuous speeding reported to the police",
        "additional_details": "It should be mandatory that all new drivers have a black box for their first year of driving, with all continuous excessive speeding data sent to the police. Police should deal with this behaviour the same as if they caught the driver themselves, via a driving awareness course or points. Black boxes shouldn\u2019t be limited to just cars either, they should be on all road legal transportation. This could not only potentially save lives, but save money on insurance in the long run too.",
        "background": "Most new drivers today think they are invincible on the roads. All black boxes do at the moment is record excessive speeding to the car insurance companies that use them. Why are these behaviours not reported to the police and why are drivers not punished for this behaviour?",
