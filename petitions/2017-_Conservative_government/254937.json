        "additional_details": "It could be argued that these MP's are disregarding the outcome of the Brexit vote in their own constituency and acting in relation to their own wishes or indeed party direction. I feel that  in order to address this situation  MP's should, following any referendum, be made to fully support and comply with their constituency result.  Instead of playing party politics make MP's support the wishes of the constituency that put them into Parliament.",
        "background": "In relation to Brexit it appears that some politicians are not acting in the way  their constituency would like them to. This is unacceptable and must change. MP's are put into Parliament by the citizens of their constituency and are there as their representative not to act against their wishes!",
