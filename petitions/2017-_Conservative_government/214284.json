The idea of the petition is to educate the public about the value British farming has on the country and ask for their support by signing a petition to lobby their MP\u2019s to support continuing subsidies for British farmers.",
        "background": "Under current EU legislation farmers in the UK receive 3 billion pounds year in subsidies mostly in basic payments which are based on per acre owned of land.",
