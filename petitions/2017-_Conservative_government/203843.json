        "additional_details": "A exam to test background knowledge of basic political systems, taken a few weeks before an upcoming election. This could then be marked over the following days, and anyone who passed will be sent a verification code or something similar to enable them to vote on Election Day. An in depth analysis of how the population did overall on the exam could then be published, allowing political parties to see what areas of knowledge/ which demographics they could address in future election campaigns.",
        "background": "Make it a requirement for people to have to pass a political competency test in order to be allowed to vote in General Elections, or in Nationwide Referendums. Brexit is a stark reminder; it only takes a small percentage of the population to be politically uneducated to sway a huge national decision",
