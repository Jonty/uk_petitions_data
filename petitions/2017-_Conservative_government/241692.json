It\u2019s ok these new blinds being made child safety fitted but many house holds still have old blinds and are not aware off the new laws regarding corded blinds. \r\n\r\nCorded blinds need banning and those people who have the old type need warning of the dangers of the blinds. The Government should also start an awareness raising campaign, to make people aware of these dangers.",
