It is now in the national interest that she be replaced without further delay by a new Prime Minister who clearly has the desire and ability to deliver Brexit properly and thereby fully honour the result of the 2016 Referendum and who enjoys the full confidence of Parliament and the people to do so",

She should resign immediately",
