        "additional_details": "Given the history of other referendums concerning the EU, there is suspicion that delaying cpmplete separation from the EU, will in effect generate apathy in the electorate and result fudge and further compromise, even another referendum to keep UK in the EU. This completely contradicts the wishes of the majority who voted to leave.  The consequences of Government prevarication on this matter, will dilute and further diminish the right of the the Government to govern the governed. We the people, have no trust or confidence, in the competence of Theresa May to govern the UK satisfactorily.",
        "background": "The recent Florence speech by the Prime Minister has not fulfilled or satisfied the democratic outcome on membership of the EU membership referendum.  The wishes of the majority vote are not being supported by the Government.",
