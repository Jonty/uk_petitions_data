        "additional_details": "I have been a vegetarian for over 10 years now and have constantly had trouble while shopping to see if I can actually eat the food on the shelves. I have even had to use my phone in store and search online for this simple answer, and many other families will know this struggle. When it looks like half of the ingredients on food labels now are chemicals I've never even heard of, it seems illogical for the consumer to have to go out of their way to find a simple, but essential, yes or no answer.",
        "background": "With an estimated 2% of the population of Britain being vegetarian, many people will know the stuggle of scanning through every ingredient on a label trying to work out if they are able to eat the product. With this information so easily known to the manufacturers, it is time for this burden to end.",
