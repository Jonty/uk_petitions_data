        "additional_details": "Is knife crime at its highest level ever?\r\nAfter 2007, when 48 children and teenagers were killed by blades in England and Wales, the annual number of deaths subsided until 2014. Since then figures have risen again, with 39 deaths in 2017 and 37 last year.According to the\u00a0Office for National Statistics, from the period of April 2016 to March 2017, there were a total of 34,700 police recorded offences involving a knife or sharp instrument.\r\nSo why has the government not considered life sentences?",
        "background": "We all know the UK, predominantly London, has a major problem with knife crime and stabbings, something which appears all too frequently across our news channels.\r\nBut is there enough being done about it ? \r\nI strongly believe that anyone who is caught carrying a knife should receive a life sentence",
