We know that the content is subtitled because if viewed via the providers own catch up services, they are present\r\n\r\nHowever, using a computer to connect to the individual catch up services is not a workable solution due to the technological barrier\r\n\r\nThere is a lack of will in the industry, enforcement or detail in the current legislation, so the broadcasters avoid the spirit of the law",

He needs on-demand content but if it doesn't originate from Sky then subtitles are absent",

Following Ofcom's consultation on this, the Government is now drafting regulations to put these quotas into effect.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out what action you would like the UK Government or Parliament to do."
