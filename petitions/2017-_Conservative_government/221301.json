        "additional_details": "Most students do not have enough time to do such huge amounts of work on top of having other subjects and responsibilities. Honestly, what is the point of expecting students to do so many tasks? Even teachers who work for BTEC and have to mark some of them most likely do not want to be reading thousands and thousands of words from repetitive tasks. How can teenagers be expected to do all of their schoolwork, get high grades, take part in extra-curriculur activities, and look after their health?",
        "background": "BTEC examining board expects students to accomplish very long tasks in a short period of time, which is incredibly stressful and too long to be completed with other subjects and responsibilities. Expectations and workload, even for passes, are very high - even though it is only worth an E grade!",
