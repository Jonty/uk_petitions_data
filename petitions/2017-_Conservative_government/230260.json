        "additional_details": "If the police are unwilling/ unable to investigate criminal subversion of electoral law, our democracy and the rule of law itself is under threat. A result based on admitted breach of electoral rules, which themselves warrant referral to the police as possibly criminal, should not be accepted as valid. The rules are there for good reason. They must be upheld. No matter what one's view on the issue, our democracy matters more.",
        "background": "In view of the fact that the Electoral Commission found electoral law was breached during the EU referendum campaign, and in light of reports that the police have not investigated that to establish whether it was criminal, apparently because of political sensitivity: the result is unsafe",
