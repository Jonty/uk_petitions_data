        "action": "Lower Import duty on classic car parts from the USA.",
        "additional_details": "There have been numberous instances where we have sent car parts for engineering work in the USA having already imported it from the USA only to be charged import duty again on the parts return to the UK. The rules are evidently either unfair or unclear to those applying them. Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.",
        "background": "Many small car/garage businesses in the UK rely on classic car parts and associated services from the USA but many struggle financially  due to the amount of duty paid. We ask Parliament to either abolish it on classic car parts or lower it to a reasonable level, with clear rules on its application",
