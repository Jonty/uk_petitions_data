        "action": "Revoke Natural England general licence ban until fair balance has been made",
        "additional_details": "We cannot allow any legal licenses to be removed like this, irregardless of the nature of them, as it raises concerns over stability of the licence system. The farming community cannot be expected to tolerate this when no legislation has been put in place to ensure any changes. We cannot allow licenses to be revoked just so discussions can be made, the men and women of crop and live stock need to be able to do their job at least until a firm route and plan is in place",
        "background": "Its beyond ridiculous that the general licenses were revoked seemingly overnight, when there has been no discussion or debate on how to balance the issue as mentioned by natural England and others. This drastically affects farmers controlling crops during what seems to be unknown amounts of time",
