This in my opinion is discriminatory towards those on low incomes who need that extra help because they are not in a position to work full time.",
        "background": "It\u2019s become increasingly difficult to find a letting agent/ landlord that will accept people on low incomes with top up benefits. The Government should have some input on this due to the lack of council properties available to those in need.",
