This is achieved by placing a newer player with a very experienced player that has higher level weapons/ gear. The newer player will keep on losing and will eventually buy gear/ weapons in order to be able to compete, this is a total con. They have to be stopped from making players pay for something that should be given in the game that they have already paid for.",

For example, you could start a petition to introduce legislation banning in-game purchases which give players advantages in the game."
