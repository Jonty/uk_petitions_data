Either you allow all faiths to worship here or you stick to the rules and you stop people from doing this. It was Easter Sunday and the lady taking the video was extremely offended by the acts of a few people breaking the rules of the park. The men were shouting and saying there was only her that was bothered. Well, this petition says otherwise. Having a 2 tier law enforcement system in our country has to stop. You cannot have one rule for some and another for the rest. Our country is divided enough. Stop this.\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tommyrobinsononline/videos/1225000744302644/?hc_ref=ARTr3a5gxvbl3bWtrSmNfIw9-qhTatmU75qKZKUcSPghbTfEYtDYI1b32APW9zdRAi0",
