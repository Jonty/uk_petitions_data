        "additional_details": "We the UK Public, ask the UK Government to ensure the UK continues to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest regardless of the outcome of Brexit. With over 180 million viewers worldwide, including nearly 7 million from the UK, the Contest unites and entertains people across the globe. The UK must combat further global and cultural isolation by ensuring continued participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, showing we are outward rather than inward-looking nation.",
        "background": "The Eurovision Song Contest started over 60 years ago in 1956 and the UK has participated every year since 1959. Musical taste and political opinions aside, this unique Contest annually unites Europe for lighthearted entertainment and a celebration of both our similarities and differences.",
