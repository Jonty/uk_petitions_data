        "additional_details": "The way my son sees it, and I agree wholeheartedly, is why should he miss out on quality time with his family, and doing things he enjoys, and winding down after school? Why should he spend 6 and a half hours in a classroom, to come home and do 2 or 3 more hours work?? Often it takes longer due to his autism. \r\nWhen does he get to be a child? When does he get to be just him?? When does he get to relax? \r\nSchool is for work. Home is his safe place, his happy place, not a place to add more stress.",
        "background": "Homework is a massive strain on so many children, especially special needs children. My eldest son has autism. School is a struggle for him anyway. But after a full day of school work and the pressure to succeed in a classroom environment, the last thing he wants is added stress of work at home too.",
