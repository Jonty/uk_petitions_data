        "action": "Break the deadlock. A second referendum with ranked choice voting.",
        "additional_details": "Britain is woefully divided and Parliament is paralysed. Since the 2016 referendum, politicians have spoken of 'the will of the people', but the binary nature of the referendum -- Leave/Remain -- failed to give the government a clear direction. Calls for a second referendum to date have pretty invariably sought to exclude the least palatable option (usually, 'no deal') from the ballot. To break this deadlock and heal Britain, all options must be handed back to the people.",
        "background": "Parliament is in deadlock. A second referendum could finally resolve that, but only if the mandate it offers is crystal clear. This petition seeks a referendum with ranked choice voting: voters will be asked to number 'Withdrawal Agreement', 'No Deal', and 'Remain' in order of preference.",
