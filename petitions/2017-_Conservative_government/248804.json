This is subject to different waste labelling rules and may require certain special disposal depending on its nature:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/how-to-classify-different-types-of-waste\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out clearly what rules you think there should be around the disposal of plastic waste."
