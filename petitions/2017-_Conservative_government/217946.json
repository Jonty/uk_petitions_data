        "additional_details": "Some aren't lucky enough to go to a school in their borough as spaces fill quickly, so they have to travel to other parts of London. This has consequences, e.g. travel time means they arrive home late, cutting into time meant for school work.\r\nWaking up early means often they don't get enough sleep (minimum 8 hours) despite staying up late to do work.\r\nTravelling far at the age of 11 adds stress to parents, especially if they cannot drop them to school, until the child has adjusted.",
        "background": "My younger brother has been on the waiting list for a secondary school in the borough of Brent. My brother wakes up extra early just to attend a school that is much too far from home. Every person should have the right to attend the nearest school for safety travelling purposes and personal reasons.",
