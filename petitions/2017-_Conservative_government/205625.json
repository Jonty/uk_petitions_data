        "additional_details": "We respect the right to free speech, and the right to protest. However, these rights are not without exception, and they cannot be used in a manner which causes harm. \r\n\r\nIndividuals also have the right to go about their lawful business free from harassment, and protests and vigils outside the hospital infringe upon this. \r\n\r\nProtests and vigils can be held in a number of places throughout the country, but hospitals are a place for healing. They are accessed by people in their most vulnerable state.",
        "background": "Over the past few years a number of groups have set up protests and vigils outside of hospitals. \r\n\r\nWe believe this is unacceptable, and that people should be able to access healthcare free from harassment.\r\n\r\nThe obvious exception being union organised protest for staff.",
