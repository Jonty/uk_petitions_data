        "additional_details": "The letter from the secretary of state for the home department sent a letter to Tyler that his lyrics \u201cencourages violence and intolerance of homosexuality\u201d How can you still judge an individual from 6-7 years ago? I believe his ban should be lifted. He hasn't written lyrics like that since, just look at his recent album Flower Boy. He promotes doing well in life and just enjoying life in general. The man is an inspiration to many including myself and has changed drastically.",
        "background": "The US rapper Tyler, the Creator was banned from the UK because of the nature of his lyrics which is out of order considering the lyrics were written when he was a teenager and they were written from an alter ego so does that mean authors who publish vile books should be banned?",
