        "additional_details": "Almost on a daily basis one hears of the escalating problem of 'unwanted' dogs. There needs to be protective legislation put in place for these animals. A rigorous vetting/monitoring system need to be put in place, funded by licence fees, public fund raising and savings made by reducing the large scale drain on charitable organisations, who could redirect some of their income into preventative measures.",
        "background": "The increase in unwanted/ ill treated dogs means that many rescue centres are at saturation point. I believe we need to tackle this problem from the other end and stop the tidal wave of dog breeding. Licence all breeding dogs and breeders, neuter all dogs not licenced.",
