        "action": "Require social media sites to have warnings of flashing imagery/strobe lighting.",
        "additional_details": "If people are warned that a post contains flashing imagery, then it can make things so much easier for people with sensory issues and they then don't have to process all the flashing lights which can be overwhelming for many and so overall, including warnings on social media posts would definitely make sites such as Snapchat and instagram more accessible and friendly for many people, whether they suffer from epilepsy, sensory issues or simply find that flashing imagery can bring on anxiety.",
        "background": "So often nowadays, people are going to parties and concerts and posting about it on social media which inevitably means that some content contains flashing imagery, however people with epilepsy and/or sensory issues are just opening up stories without a warning, which could bring on unease to them.",
