        "action": "The UK should terminate the EU talks forthwith by withdrawing the Art 50 notice.",
        "additional_details": "The current BREXIT negotiations are an irresoluble mess.  The immediate costs of withdrawal will be enormous, and the long-term debilitation of the UK economy even more serious.  Sterling will continue to fall in value, because of all the commercial uncertainty.  The negotiations, instead of constituting a single bargaining process, have been converted, by ill-advised agreement, into a two-stage process, in which the EU has sole control of future progress.  We should seek another way ahead.",
        "background": "It is already clear that, within the current framework, the EU is bound to win.  Article 50 has never been triggered before, and it is manifestly defective in its conceptual structure: the UK should withdraw immediately, and make progress as a Member of the EU, from within.",
