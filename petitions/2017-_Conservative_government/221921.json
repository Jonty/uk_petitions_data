        "action": "Introduce mandatory laws for business to recycle and reduce waste.",
        "additional_details": "I have worked in several different work environments from retail, hospitality to car dealerships; in each the recycling regulations have been non existent. In retail you receive deliveries daily- usually in cardboard boxes- I've seen employees throwing away 20 boxes with the explanation being, 'It was closer'. This is why our planet is dying. \r\n\r\nCafes and food stalls should have recycle stations for their customers to reduce the waste of paper and cardboard packaging. Eg. Camden and Shoreditch.",
        "background": "From independent cafes to chain stores you see each throw away recyclable products daily as the facilities are not available. Laws must be placed to make in mandatory for shops to recycle and have options open to their customers.\r\n\r\nPossibly introducing inspections to keep track of the regulations.",
