        "action": "Make NHS prescriptions and healthcare free for all Universal Credit claimants",
        "additional_details": "This government\u2019s incompetent handling of the move to Universal Credit is leaving many people already struggling with their finances, including people legally entitled to free dental care and prescriptions, going without the treatment they need because they can't afford to pay for it.\r\n\r\nNo one in Britain should have to go without healthcare because they can't afford it. Prescriptions and all NHS treatment should be free to anyone claiming Universal Credit. More information at http://bit.ly/2yzForA",
        "background": "Universal Credit claimants are being denied the free prescriptions and NHS dental care they are entitled to because doctors and dentists don't know whether they are eligible for it. Claimants for some of the benefits included in Universal Credit are entitled to free healthcare while others aren't.",
