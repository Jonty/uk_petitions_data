Suspects can be held without charge\"\r\n\r\nA series of leaks from the then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails suggested that Saudi donors fund extremism.\r\nA number of mosques found to be preaching extremist Wahhabism have been said to be linked to Saudi organisations.",

There is also evidence that suggests Saudi donors sponsor terrorism. We cannot support governments of this sort.",
