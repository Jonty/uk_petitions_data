        "additional_details": "My sister died last year after consuming super strong cider for 4 years. She ended up with cirrhosis of the liver. Doctors confirmed that this alcohol was to blame to for her health declining rapidly. They said that this particular product acts like a paint stripper on the inside of your body. She has left a young daughter who now has to manage on her own without her mother for the rest of her life. She has recently had a baby and the baby will never know his grandmother due to the devastation this drink has caused.",
        "background": "Super-strong ciders should be removed from shelves as they have high alcohol content. This alcohol content should either be reduced or the drinks themselves should be discontinued. Drinking this drink is dangerous and the matter should be taken seriously.",
