The government then charges you 40% tax on your interest payment, costing you \u00a3976 a year. Assuming you earn \u00a352,111; you are paying the government \u00a33,416 (976+2440) a year for borrowing their money (without decreasing your balance). Corporation have tax-deduction on their interest payments, so should students.",

Assuming we finish university \u00a340,000 in debt, we have \u00a32,440 a year of interest payments to make before we are even able to reduce our principal balance.",
