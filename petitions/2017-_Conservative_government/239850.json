        "action": "Make it a criminal offence for MPs to deliberately mislead the general public.",
        "additional_details": "When parliamentarians deliberately lie or mislead the electorate (this is copious and consistent), it compromises and severely undermines our democracy. I am therefore calling on Parliament to debate this issue and consider making the deliberate presentation of misinformation to the electorate a criminal offence. A criminal offence constitutes an act that is harmful not only to an individual but also to a community, society or the state. There is a genuine case for this both legally and morally.",
        "background": "Members of Parliament are elected into a position of power and trust. It is therefore imperative that Parliamentarians accurately review the information they are presented with and ensure, to the best of their ability, the information they present to the general public is truthful.",
