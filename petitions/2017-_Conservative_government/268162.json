This had resulted in undue stress to the owner and a I am sure, the dog too.\r\n\r\nBy subdividing property with 'living property', cases involving animals/plants can be pushed through quicker and resolved quickly.\r\nBy subdividing, greater punishments can also be applied to relevant cases.",
        "background": "Prosecution services like the Crown Prosecution Service and the RSCPA often have their cases pushed to the side and as a result animals are often forgotten putting unnecessary on animals and owners while cases are sorted. More often that not, animals are separated from owners during this time.",
