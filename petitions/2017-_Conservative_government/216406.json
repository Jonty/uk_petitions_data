        "additional_details": "Misconceptions about false reporting have direct, negative consequences and may contribute to why many victims do not report it. I believe people should be better educated about the issues and people need to know about what they can do to help. Rapes do not always occur between strangers in dark alleys, 85 to 90 percent of victims know their attacker; this only makes it harder for victims to move on from the incident.",
        "background": "85000 women and 12000 men are raped every year, that is 11 every hour. 13% of women who are raped attempt suicide and 94% experience post- traumatic stress disorder within two weeks of the incident. I believe that all victims should be provided with support to guide them to living with the trauma.",
