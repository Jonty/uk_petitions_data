        "additional_details": "IN THIS DAY AND AGE WE DO NOT NEED THE BBC. IT IS NO LONGER NEEDED AND IS A BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. WHY DO WE NEED IT? THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO CONTROL OVER IT. THE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER IT. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDA AND WE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO PAY. SELL OFF THE BBC AND CLOSE IT DOWN NOW. WE DON'T NEED THE BBC FOR ANYTHING. SELL IT OFF TO PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND LET THEM MAKE USE OF IT. AND GET THIS MILLSTONE FROM OFF OUR NECKS.",
        "background": "Now we see the BBC extorting money from the over seventy fives. Look at the logic of the situation. We have the Tories who have a philosophy of personal reliance and private industry. We saw this when they sold off telephones water gas electricity railways and the post office. Save money sell it.",
