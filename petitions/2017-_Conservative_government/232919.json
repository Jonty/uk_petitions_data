        "action": "Independent review of unfair fines on drivers by local councils.",
        "additional_details": "I believe motorists are now being seen as easy pickings and are used as \"Cash Cows\". In many cases it appears councils are turning a blind eye to Bad Signage over and above the safety of the general public. \r\nThe internet, national and local press are littered with examples but in only very few cases have councils been held to task and refunded fines. There should be an independent review of the law.\r\nAlmost every motoring organisation has at some time highlighted the problem but still seem powerless to put a stop to this highway robbery. \r\nWith your support we can force a debate in parliament.",
        "background": "In recent years councils (despite it being illegal to use cameras as a revenue stream), have used cameras to catch motorists committing minor misdemeanours, raking in millions of pounds each year.",
