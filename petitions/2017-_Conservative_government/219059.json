        "additional_details": "My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and often ends up injecting too much or too little insulin when having to try and estimate his carbohydrate intake - this usually results in low or high blood sugar, which often leaves him feeling unwell. Before his diagnosis we didn\u2019t think twice about where we ate, but it\u2019s made us realise how beneficial it is for type 1 diabetics, as well as for people just trying to watch their calorie intake, when nutritional information is provided.",
        "background": "Nutritional information being provided by restaurants would make it so much easier for people with type 1 diabetes to count their carbohydrates and inject for them more accurately when eating out.",
