The common denominator is inaction by HMRC. More progressive countries have banned back dated tax laws, why haven\u2019t we?\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next?\r\n\r\nBack dated IR35? ISAs and Pensions \u2013 large sums of money declared to HMRC; these savings would be an easy target. Student Loans. Inheritance Tax. Could all be next.\r\n\r\nOnce retrospective taxation is the norm no one has financial security",
        "background": "Any form of back dated taxation removes financial security. Once retrospective taxation is the norm no taxpayer can have financial security.\r\n\r\nTax legislation should only ever be prospective; affecting actions from that point. All retrospective, retroactive or backdated taxation must be stopped.",
