        "additional_details": "We believe that there needs to be greater accountability by Public Company Directors. We believe there needs to be a change to corporate law where, to be a Company Director of a PLC (or any company on a public share exchange), individuals have to provide personal securities commensurate with the financial rewards. These securities should extend to pension provisions.\r\nBy introducing a personal element of risk to Senior Executives, irresponsible risk taking will be eliminated in our major PLCs.",
        "background": "In the UK we have created a corporate environment where Company Directors are rewarded for success and failure. This is different for SME owners where risk taking is offset by the potential of losing everything, including their home. We believe such rules should apply to Corporate Directors.",
