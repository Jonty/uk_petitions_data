        "additional_details": "Because of the additional need for support, all mental health services are guaranteed to treat some autistic patients. However, many staff have no training in this whatsoever.   \r\n\r\nEven basic training would have an immediate impact on helping autistic people engage with services effectively. \r\n\r\nInpatient mental health care should be viewed as our last line of defence. Therefore it is imperative that these staff have, at minimum, a basic understanding of autism spectrum conditions.",
        "background": "1 in 68 people has an ASC. \r\nOver 50% of autistic people have depression. \r\nThey are 28 times more likely to exhibit suicidal thoughts/behaviours. \r\nThere is difficultly in accessing support, and staff are insufficiently trained. According to NAS, Transforming Care implementation needs improvement.",
