        "additional_details": "The majority of sex workers are women with children and this may be their sole income. When companies block us from accessing their services they are stopping our livelihood. \r\n\r\nThese companies process money used to pay for goods and services. The UK government AGREES that sex and sexual content is a service that can be legally provided and sold. So these company should provide the same service to us as to any other small buisness. \r\n\r\nYet companies currently are taking away our income.",
        "background": "At the moment sex workers are being discrimated against by companies who will not allow us to use their services. \r\n\r\nWe are asking the goverment to make the discrimination against sex workers by companies illegal.",
