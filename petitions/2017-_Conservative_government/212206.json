        "additional_details": "With reference to GP services and having spoken to a number of Doctors,most are not enjoying their work, feel stressed, unappreciated, and having to cover for Dr\u2019s who have left/retired with no available replacements. The long term viability of the NHS is at risk due to inadequate funding and political argument. Focus is required to establish a well funded, well resourced system that can provide services to all, not least within the Mental Health area.",

Have a Royal Commission review it\u2019s future and aim to remove it from party politics, with no political gain to any party and focus on creating a stable funding platform",
