        "additional_details": "There have been multiple scandals over implanted medical devices, including pacemakers, TVT meshes, breast implants, & metal hip joints.\r\n\r\nCurrent rules mean manufacturers don't have to produce clinical trial evidence before CE safety marking & use in patients. Equivalence allows a new device to be waved through if a manufacturer declares it similar to an existing product, even if those other products have had safety concerns.\r\n\r\nReference: BMJ Open 2017;7:e017125\r\ndoi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017125",
        "background": "Repeated scandals involving medical devices show that the current regulatory system is not fit for purpose\r\nTighten regulation of medical devices so that:\r\n- High risk medical devices have clinical trial evidence at the time of approval\r\n- There is a publicly accessible registry for such devices",
