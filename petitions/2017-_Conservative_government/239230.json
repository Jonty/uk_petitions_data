        "action": "Introduce mandatory National Service in the UK",
        "additional_details": "We believe the government could find a way to run this system effectively and in a way which people would be happy with.\r\n\r\nAt least one year in Nation Service, it could be run like an apprenticeship system where young people would gain a qualification or trade from 2 years of National Service. All of this can be debated and planned through in Parliament... WE HOPE.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this is to give people a sense of duty, honor and revive some patriotism in future leaders, workers, parents, and educators, etc. across this country!",
        "background": "By introducing national service, the government would find it a positive force in promoting social cohesion, which would foster and sustain a more vibrant feeling of patriotism and duty and could give people vital skills.",
