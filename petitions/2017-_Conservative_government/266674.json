        "additional_details": "Universities have a duty of care, but 62% of students leave higher education experiencing sexual violence (revoltsexualassault.com) and 1 in 7 students experience domestic abuse (nationalarchives.gov). These are mostly student on student cases. When students turn to their university for help they often find no support. \r\n\r\nMany Universities allow for perpetrators to stay near victims and harm others. Zero tolerance would enable the removal of the perpetrator for the safety of victims and other students.",
        "background": "Every University should be made to publish a sexual violence and abuse policy, this must cover sexual, physical, verbal and domestic abuse, as well as hate crimes.  These policies should all commit to having a zero tolerance policy on this conduct. ",
