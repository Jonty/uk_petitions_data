At work, I earn \u00a34.20 an hour - an hour of work can\u2019t pay for a single train journey! A lot of 17 year olds don\u2019t even have a job. In addition, the price of train tickets is set to rise in January 2019. Minimum wage will only increase in April 2019 by 50p... still not enough for me to buy a single train journey. I\u2019m not regarded an adult in any other aspect of my life - legally I am a child, NOT AN ADULT!",

I have a job, but do not earn adult wage! Why am I expected to pay adult train fares?",
