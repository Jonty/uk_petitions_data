        "additional_details": "Elysium said it's not financially viable with low pupil numbers, yet have kept numbers low. Costs per child placement is several thousands less than other similar providers.\r\nInsufficient advertising means parents haven't been aware of the school, therefore unable to make it their preferred choice on EHCP. This school is vital for the children & shouldn't close.\r\nPrivate companies need forcing out of the education sector for this reason. They have other plans for the site so removed this provision",
        "background": "Elysium Healthcare own the school & shocked parents by announcing on June 17th that the school is permanently closing as of July 24th. They have refused all negotiation offers to overturn this decision, leaving complex vulnerable children with no school, impacting further on their mental health",
