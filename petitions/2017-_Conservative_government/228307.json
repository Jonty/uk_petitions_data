        "additional_details": "New measures in the Off-Payroll Working consultation effectively introduce a new 15% tax for self-employed workers, while enabling firms to circumvent their obligation to give employment rights to workers. This opposes the intentions of the Government\u2019s \u2018Good Work Plan\u2019, designed to prevent unscrupulous firms forcing vulnerable workers into precarious work.\r\nParliament must ensure self-employed workers cannot be classed as \u2018employed for tax purposes\u2019 without receiving full employment rights.",
        "background": "Newly proposed reforms to tax the self-employed \u2013 known as Off-Payroll Working - introduces rules that enable firms to classify workers as \u2018employed for tax purposes\u2019, without providing them with any employment rights. This is wholly unacceptable.",
