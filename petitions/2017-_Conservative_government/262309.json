        "additional_details": "In 1965, the UK had evicted the islanders of the Chagos and unlawfully claimed territory. The evicted islanders were sent to Mauritius.\r\nA landmark ruling on 25.2.19 by the ICJ in Brussels has ruled the 1965 process as unlawful and advised the UK to return the archipelago control back to Mauritius. \r\nThe UK \"has an obligation to bring to an end its administration\" of the Chagos.\r\nNow, the UN has voted in New York against UK occupation of the archipelago, with 116 states for decolonisation.",
        "background": "Chagos Archipelago IS part of the overseas territories of the Republic of Mauritius. The UK is unlawfully occupying this territory and refusing to return control back to Mauritius. The ICJ in February 2019 has ruled against the UK occupying the Chagos territory. \r\nNow the UN has confirmed the same.",
