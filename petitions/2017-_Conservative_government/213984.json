        "action": "Start sanctions on South Africa for their racial discrimination of Whites",
        "additional_details": "South Africa has recently voted to confiscate land from whites without compensation - meaning that they can take livelihoods away and feel no need to make sure those they hurt are okay.\r\n\r\nActive discrimination is also rampant with whites not being allowed to get a job if there is someone of almost equal skill and having to live in slums due to housing being denied.\r\n\r\nViolence against whites is severe with farmers being the most likely to be murdered as there is little done to protect them.",
        "background": "In the Apartheid era of South Africa our country applied economic sanctions on South Africa to weaken the position of the government and bring racial equality. We must do this again with the current regime as they are actively oppressing whites in the same manner the old government did for blacks.",
