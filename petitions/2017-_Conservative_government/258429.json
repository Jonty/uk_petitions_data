        "additional_details": "I am one of the 17.9 million people that voted to leave the EU for my children's sake and I cannot believe that it has now become a political football with all the remainer's believing that a delay will cause another vote. peoples respect for the government will be thrown out of the window. most people watching the recent votes in the houses of Parliament were treated to a child like performance of our elected government. If the leavers can have there petition recognised then so can we.",
