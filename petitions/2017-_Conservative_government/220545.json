        "additional_details": "Many people leave hospital thinking how can I thank the NHS for their help. I certainly have on our several a&e visits over the last few years. Installing a donation station would help people to feel they are giving thanks whilst helping our NHS through the tough cuts they face. The cost of installing would of course be covered in no time with donations received then start generating profit for the NHS.",
        "background": "The NHS provide an amazing service, yet are always getting budget cuts. \r\n\r\nInstall machines at hospital entrances and exits in which people can leave a donation if they wish, cash or card (contactless).\r\n\r\nUse this to top up the NHS budget as a whole, or let hospitals use how they need to.",
