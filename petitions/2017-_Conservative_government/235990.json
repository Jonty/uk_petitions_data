        "additional_details": "Human understanding of cetacean intelligence is becoming clearer (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_intelligence), as is the role whales play in maintaining life in both coastal and pelagic waters (https://stories.anmm.gov.au/why-save-whales/oceans-nutrient-cycle/). This, in turn, helps maintain the ecosystem that humanity relies on for its own survival.  Climate change is already calling into question human wellbeing. We need all the help we can get to ensure the planet's survival.",
        "background": "Japan is standing down from the IWC with the intention of returning to commercial whaling in 2019.  Science shows whales as intelligent with language and culture.  Hunting them for profit is ethically and morally wrong. Their demise damages the planet's ecosystem and thereby our own wellbeing.",
