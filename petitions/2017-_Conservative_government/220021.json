        "additional_details": "All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel\u2019s parliament), both the residences of the Israeli Prime Minister and the Israeli President as well as the Supreme Court of Israel. The British Government should recognise and respect the basic fact that Jerusalem is the capital city of the State of Israel and what better way to do this than follow the United State\u2019s lead by moving the British Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.",
        "background": "In May 2018, the United States moved their embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. We believe that the United Kingdom should follow this lead by moving our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and finally recognise Jerusalem as the capital city of the State of Israel.",
