        "action": "Against the construction of the proposed M1-A6 link road",
        "additional_details": "This road would be disastrous to local people in Sundon Park, Upper and Lower Sundon and Marsh Farm. Things affected by its construction include a local hospice caring for the terminally ill, an ancient woodland, designated greenbelt countryside, the cutting off of the village of Upper Sundon from local amenities, local wildlife native to the area and a 900 year old church. Roads in the Luton estates of Marsh Farm and Sundon Park would become busier and couldn't handle the extra traffic.",
        "background": "This petition is against Central Bedfordshire Councils plans to construct a new bypass north of Luton called the M1-A6 link road. The road would start at junction 11a of the M1 and end south of Streatley village on the A6.",
