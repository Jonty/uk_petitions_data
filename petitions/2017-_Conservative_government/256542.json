        "additional_details": "UC was designed to allow claimants to take part-time work without losing their entitlement altogether. It was also said that it makes claimants better off taking on work, as they keep at least a proportion of the money they earn but most claimants doing part time hours or on a zero hour contract, will be worse off once they have paid for their travel and Council Tax.\r\n\r\nDue to these large deductions, part-time work may no longer pay and some people would be better off refusing part-time work.",
        "background": "People claiming Universal Credit and working part time or on a zero hour contract are getting their payments reduced by 63 pence for each \u00a31.00 they earn in take-home pay.\r\n\r\nThese deductions should be reduced to help with travel to / from work and Council Tax which UC claimants still have to pay.",
