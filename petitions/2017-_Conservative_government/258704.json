We also respect that ads needs to be shown. We believe that the amount of ads shown on websites such as Facebook and YouTube is ridiculous,  people who watch videos now leave as soon as an ad opens up and I am one of those people. I feel like there should be restriction on how ads are shown including the length and how often it comes up.",
        "background": "Having ads pop up even for the simplest thing can be the most annoying thing ever. Open a video of 2 mins to have a 15 second advertisement forced to your face. Advertisement has gotten to the stage that it has become a privilege to pay for it to not have an ad forced in your face.",
