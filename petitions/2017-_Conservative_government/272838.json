If MP s don't agree what people say then they can resign as they are not honouring a democratic decision.",

Let people decide what they want. \r\n\r\nIt's not ideal to call for 2nd referendum but 3 years after the 1st one parliament is not sure what we (they) want. Give the choice to people and do whatever people say no if no but.",
