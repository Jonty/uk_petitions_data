        "additional_details": "This is a vital protection, as this covers former spouses who have been the victims of domestic voilence and other vulnerable people. Furthermore, people who retain their right of residence, are living in the UK by the virtue of EEA law, and so it is only fair that these people are also covered by the brexit negotiations and the protections afforded to EEA nationals are also extended to those people who retain their right of residence",
        "background": "Under Current EEA regulations, former spouses of EEA nationals, retain their right to reside in the UK, even after they cease to be family members of an EEA national.\r\n.",
