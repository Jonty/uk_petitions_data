Adding iron to food is dangerous for hemochromotosis sufferers, for whom iron overload can cause early death, and there is some evidence that non Hemochromotosis sufferers also have a less pronounced effect from iron overload.\r\n \r\nFor further details see this YouTube video\u2026. https://youtu.be/YZThKSvP7Cc\r\n",
        "background": "In 1940s there were good reasons for adding iron to flour and breakfast cereals as Anemia was not well understood. Today this is not the case, but excess iron can reduce lifespan of older people and it accumulates over time in the body. Denmark banned it in 2004.",
