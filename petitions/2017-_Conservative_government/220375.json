        "additional_details": "The English speaking part of Cameroon has for over 60 years since joining La Republique du Cameroun been subjected to marginalization and oppression of the Anglo-Saxon culture, which was considered untouchable during the unity of the two Regions to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. There is the need for meaningful dialogue to resolve the crisis. Without an independent UN Observer to monitor peace and oversee dialogue, we could have a genocide on our hands.",
        "background": "There is ongoing violence perpetrated by Government Forces and Southern Cameroonian militants in the English-Speaking part of Cameroon, specifically the North-West and South-West Regions. The UK needs to call for a UN peacekeeping force in Southern Cameroon.",
