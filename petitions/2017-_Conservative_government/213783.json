People are aware of organ donation and can choose to opt in if they wish to opt in. People may not be able to opt out before their death as death can be sudden. People may not be aware of this law so it will be unethical to opt them in as they wouldn't know they have to opt out. We refuse this law should be passed where peoole are automatically registered to organ donation.",
