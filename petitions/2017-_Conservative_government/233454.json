        "action": "Change the Rape Law so defence council cannot use victim blaming.",
        "additional_details": "This part of the law states in  that if A believes there has been consent that it cannot have been rape. It is only if A believes there wasn't consent and still penetrated B that it is Rape. So when a rapist is caught and being processed through a court and is trying to get away with it, their defence council defend them using 1C. They try to make it that A felt there was consent through all of the meaningless victim blaming of what was being worn etc. is a problem with our LAW.",
        "background": "The reason underwear, how much you were drinking, where you were, etc. is brought up during a court case on rape is seen in 1C of the Rape Law. And the only way to prevent people being challenged in this way as victims is for the law to be changed.",
