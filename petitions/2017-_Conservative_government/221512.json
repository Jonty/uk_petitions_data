        "action": "Students doing history GCSE's should learn 5 units for History instead of 4.",
        "additional_details": "From the information I have acquired from students doing the 2018 GCSE History examinations, doing 4 units of history was not challenging for them and the task was too easily completed. They knew that they were not being tested to their full potential of memorisation and would be interested in doing an extra unit. Additionally, a fifth unit would not only further test the exam skills of each candidate, but would also help in ensuring those who succeed are the very best and most hardworking.",
        "background": "I personally am a strong believer that GCSE's currently are just a test of memory, and the hardest working students should be segregated from those who's efforts are inadequate.",
