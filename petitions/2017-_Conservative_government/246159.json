        "action": "Revoke Article 50 and commit to a new referendum on a clear Brexit plan",
        "additional_details": "Step 2 may take some time as it requires a majority in parliament to back a single proposal for Brexit but the UK will never be able to agree a new relationship with the EU until this happens. The plan needs to be clear and realistic and parliament needs to commit to implement it once approved by a referendum. The only way for the UK to do this on its own terms is to halt the current Article 50 process.",
        "background": "Brexit is not going well. Here is a way forward:\r\n1. Revoke Article 50\r\n2. Agree a plan for an alternative relationship with the EU\r\n3. Allow the public to vote on it\r\nThis does not overturn the referendum but gives the public a further vote on a detailed Brexit plan which can be delivered.",
