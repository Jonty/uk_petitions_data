        "additional_details": "It needs to be made a requirement by law that bicycles be sold with lights. Cycling is encouraged by the Government, with more people using bicycles as their main transport. There are many cycle lanes on roads across the country but still legal to buy bikes without lights, despite it being the law to use them between sunrise and sunset. All vehicles sold must have working lights. The law needs to move with the times to keep cyclists safe whilst on our roads.",
