        "additional_details": "All are forced into a linear grading system that cannot, by definition, do justice to the different kinds of intellectual aptitude that students - and people in general - possess. Two weeks of non-stop examinations after three or four years of study represent a sudden change of pace, a stressful and disconcerting episode that stimulates some while others are disoriented or defeated.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the point. Exams are arbitrary, stressful and unfair.",
        "background": "Timed examinations discriminate against intelligent students who are absorbed in their subject in favour of canny students who concentrate on learning how to pass exams. They promote the fluent and glib over the deep and thoughtful, the single-minded over the many-faceted",
