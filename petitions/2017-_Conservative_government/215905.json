        "action": "Manufacture UK Passports in the UK after Brexit, not overseas.",
        "additional_details": "Outsourcing production offshore, under the control of what will then be a foreign nation (not a fellow EU member) puts the integrity & security of these important travel and identity documents at risk & increases black market access. It will also put skilled British jobs at risk.  De La Rue's contract should be extended until they can tender under new post-Brexit procurement rules that serve UK interests, in the interests of providing certainty for THIS British business as we leave the EU.",
        "background": "The Government have announced a French firm will manufacture the new Navy British Passports after Brexit. This is against the spirit of our decision to Leave the EU & take back control. The Navy British Passport is, as the Prime Minister said, 'an expression of our independence & sovereignty'.",
