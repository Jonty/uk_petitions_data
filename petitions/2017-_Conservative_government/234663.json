        "action": "Prevent the UK Parliament revoking Article 50.",
        "additional_details": "We therefore demand that the British Government do anything and everything possible to prevent Parliament from either extending the Brexit transition period, revoking Article 50 or for adding the option of remaining in the EU on any future referendum ballot paper.\r\n\r\nWe further demand that the British Government make it clear to Parliament and the British people that rejection of the Draft Withdrawal Agreement will not be an option of extending the transition period, renegotiating the Agreement or revoking Article 50, and that the UK will, consequently leave the EU without a deal and revert to trading under WTO terms.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, are concerned that British MPs, business leaders and unelected peers who do not support the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union are exerting undue influence on the Government's handling of the Brexit process with the intention of cancelling Brexit.",
