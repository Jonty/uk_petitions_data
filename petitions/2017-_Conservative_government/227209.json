The UK government opposes religious intolerance in all forms, including actions that discriminate against religious freedoms or beliefs.\r\n\r\nTolerance for those of different faiths is fundamental to British values.  We believe in the values of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 18, highlights that freedom of religion or belief is a fundamental freedom applying to all human beings. The UK government regularly highlights to our international partners, the importance of adhering to international law and human rights.   The UK has a strong and enduring partnership with the Netherlands; when appropriate we do raise concerns directly.  As Prime Minister Theresa May has said, \u201cReligious discrimination blights the lives of millions of people across the globe and leads to conflict and instability.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo support this work, on 4 July, the Prime Minister announced the appointment of Lord Ahmad as her Special Envoy on Freedom of Religion or Belief.  As Lord Ahmad said on his appointment, \u201cFreedom of religious Belief is a human right that must be respected.  People from all faiths or none should be free to practice as they wish. This respect is in all our interests.\u201d\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",
