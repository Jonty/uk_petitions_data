        "additional_details": "Play is a protected right for children under Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. When planned and led effectively different types of purposeful play contribute to the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of the child. Although some schools provide children with this opportunity beyond early years as part of their core provision this should be a requirement for all UK schools.",
        "background": "Purposeful play is a central component of early years provision but the requirement for children to play should not end at Year 1. Play should be a requirement within the national curriculum ensuring all children are provided with opportunities for purposeful play across the primary age range.",
