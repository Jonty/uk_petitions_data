        "additional_details": "Derby performed significantly worse than the national average across risk factors such as poverty that contribute to mental health. As part of secondary education it should be mandatory that support is available at all hours of a school day from a trained professional.\r\n\r\nMental health awareness is a stigma that is slowly being broken, however young people are often worried about being judged or do not trust subject teachers.",
        "background": "We are seeking to raise awareness because in Derby, mental health issues between children are becoming more common.1 in 3 young people suffer from mental health. This can affect them in their day to day lives which leads to their education being affected.",
