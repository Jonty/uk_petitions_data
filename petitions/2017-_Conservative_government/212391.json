        "additional_details": "Badgers can sometimes carry bovine TB and because of this, have been culled. Most TB is in cattle, but some infections come from badgers. Research shows that the disease is not passed on by direct contact, but through contaminated pasture and dung; however badgers that are 1.5 meters away from an infected cow could be infected too. This means that you should not kill badgers for this as they are not the ones carrying the disease. Also, bovine tuberculosis is uncontrollable and the cull does not prevent it from spreading. If you are to catch bovine TB from a badger, you have to be very close when it coughs/sneezes.",
