        "additional_details": "When a dog is scanned (i.e. by a veterinary practice) the only information being provided through the scanner is the microchip number. If the information included alert data which was recorded by the data operator, provided by the true keeper, this could help with the recovery of stolen dogs.\r\nPolice / RSPCA officers etc should be given scanners to support this and enable them to scan when they identify potentially vulnerable dogs.",
        "background": "There is no method to raise an alert (where the dog is stolen) when a dog is scanned by a vet or authorised person.\r\nWhen the data operators records show the dog as stolen, an alert should be made to the individual operating the microchip scanner to alert them to such. Confiscation laws introduced.",
