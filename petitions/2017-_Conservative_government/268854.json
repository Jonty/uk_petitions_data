        "additional_details": "Vexatious recall petitions need to be blocked, but there is an obvious conflict of interests if MPs themselves determine when they can be recalled by their constituents.\r\n\r\nWe ask that Parliament: \r\n\r\na) allow recall petitions in any circumstances, subject to a requirement that they be approved by a voters\u2019 jury (i.e. a randomly-selected sample of the local electorate); and \r\n\r\nb) delegate to an appropriate independent body all decisions on petition thresholds and details pertaining to jury approval.",
        "background": "MPs can\u2019t be properly held to account if they can only be challenged at a General Election, when their personal failings are over-shadowed by broader issues. Without effective procedures for constituents to recall their MPs at any time, the public can\u2019t have confidence they are properly represented.",
