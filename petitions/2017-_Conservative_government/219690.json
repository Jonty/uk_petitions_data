        "additional_details": "Children are vulnerable people, who by default cannot consent to or take control of actions revolving around the organisation of their lunch arrangements.\r\n\r\nSchools must not be allowed to punish children for what is the responsibility of adults.\r\n\r\nThere are many legitimate reasons why a payment may be missed or packed lunch misplaced.\r\n\r\nChildren excluded in this way are liable to long term emotional suffering.\r\n\r\nDenying proper food choice is not allowed in prisons. \r\n\r\nIt must not be allowed in schools.",
        "background": "A recent incident of a school child being excluded and given bread and water instead of a hot meal or full lunch with friends has highlighted treatment which appears \"Dickensian\" when small arrears build up for school dinners. \r\n\r\nThis must stop.",
