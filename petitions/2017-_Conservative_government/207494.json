        "additional_details": "As a result, many end up resorting to illegal methods to get them done, which is often unsafe, unsanitary and irresponsible. Instead, the government should take responsibility for this increasingly serious problem and recognise that by not legalising them, they put young people at risk, because quite frankly- most of the time these illegitimate 'tattoo artists' don't care if the ink they use is even safe.",
        "background": "The law allows 16 year olds to drive (even though the law recognises them as the most reckless drivers), DRINK, join the army (all of which endanger the lives of others), have sexual intercourse, get married and have children but won't allow them to get tattoos -meaning most get them illegally.",
