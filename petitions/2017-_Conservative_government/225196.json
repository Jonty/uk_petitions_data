        "additional_details": "Market makers routinely drop / rise the bid and ask on traded stocks so that the \"reported\" trade falls above or below the mid price, which is what the broker uses as a guide to report any given trade as a buy or sell to investors. Everyone knows that this manipulation of reporting is freely used to exploit investors, and yet this practice is allowed to continue without intervention by regulators. In what modern fair & transparent society should this practice be allowed to continue?",
        "background": "As a private investor I am routinely frustrated by the mis-reporting of trades on the stock market (buys often reported as sells and vice versa). There is no technological reason information should not be correct. It simply serves to deceive small investors leaving them at an unfair disadvantage.",
