        "additional_details": "Many artefacts acquired from other countries are well looked after and conserved by our museums and should remain. However, the Hoa Hakananai'a cannot be well displayed in a museum however much space is given over to it. The proper place to see the Moai is on Easter Island where they present a stunning backdrop to the surrounding Pacific ocean These unique statues are not neglected and are open to tourists to walk among them and marvel, and they will! I believe that the Hoa Hakananai'a should be returned to the Rapa Nui as soon as possible. Please help this to happen for this tiny nation of guardians.",
        "background": "This revered statue was removed by a British captain in 1868 and looks out of place in the British Museum. It is believed by the Rapa Nui people to emit a \"mana\" spiritual force.",
