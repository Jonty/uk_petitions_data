        "additional_details": "Landlords should most definitely ask for a cleaning fee for pet owners but pets should not be banned. Pets form a family and we got our dog to help with my brothers depression the dog has already been in a shelter and it would be so cruel to put him back. Most people in the UK have pets and 100s of dogs and cats are being left at shelters due to the ban, this is outrangeos and should not be happening in a first world country. People cannot even feel at home in a house they\u2019re paying for.",
        "background": "My family are struggling to find a house to live in because we adopted an old dog whilst in our current house. We got a dog because the landlord allowed us as he said he wanted us in the house for a very long time, A YEAR after allowing us he has decided to move back into the property.",
