        "additional_details": "Some cereals that are aimed at young children have just as much, if not more, added sugar than some sugary drinks. \r\n \r\nCoca cola contains 10.6g of sugar per 100ml \r\nTesco Multigrain Boulders contain 25g sugar per 100g \r\nCrunchy Nut clusters contain 31g sugar per 100g \r\nFrosties contain 37g sugar per 100g\r\n \r\nA decent breakfast is vital for children going into school.\r\n \r\nI believe that cereals should have a reduced amount of added sugar in order to help tackle the UKs obesity epidemic.",
        "background": "There has been a lot of coverage in the press about the 'sugar drinks tax'. Per 100g some cereals contain just as much sugar, if not more than some of these sugary drinks. \r\nI want the government to call on food manufacturers to reduce the amount of added sugar in yoghurts and breakfast cereals.",
