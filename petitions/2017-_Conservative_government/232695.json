        "action": "Reintroduce the Eurasian lynx as soon as possible.",
        "additional_details": "The Lynx UK Trust published research documents about a lynx reintroduction in 2015. It is now 2018 and no action has been taken by the government. Our country is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, with 53% of our species in decline. I would suggest that the lynx be reintroduced within 1 year of this petition receiving 10,000 signatures, as we need to act fast. If you want to read more go to The Lynx UK Trust's website. The Government should approve the reintroduction licence as soon as possible.",
        "background": "There are 1.5 million deer in the UK, which is a massive overpopulation. They are overgrazing our woodlands causing a significant loss in biodiversity. Reintroducing the lynx would be a long-term solution to this issue and would restore balance to the UK's ecosystems. ",
