        "action": "Allow non-UK citizens to vote in general elections after 5 years of UK residence",
        "additional_details": "I recently discovered that non-EU citizens are ineligible to vote in UK general elections, and on further research that non-commonwealth citizens have no voting rights at all. It seems wrong that people who have lived and worked in the UK for a considerable period have no say in their futures. There has been a drastic increase in hate crimes towards foreigners in the UK since the Brexit vote, and making them more a part of our society can only help to make them feel more welcome.",
        "background": "We want all non-EU/non-commonwealth citizens living in the UK to have full voting rights (including in general elections) after 5 years of residence. In order to create a truly representative government we must include the opinions of these people who make up approximately 8% of the UK population.",
