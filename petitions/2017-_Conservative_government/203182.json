        "action": "Ensure Grafham and Rutland reservoirs remain exclusively for Fly fishing.",
        "additional_details": "In general terms fishing in England is under pressure as many new UK residents are used to catching and taking there fish home, in stark contrast to most English born residents who fish for sport and take great pride over fish capture and release. Fly fishing has embraced 'catch and return' fishing in an attempt to preserve fish stocks and Fly Fishers have seen many so called Predator fishers catching and taking trout even though they are not permitted to do so.",
        "background": "Fly fishing for stocked trout on Grafham and Rutland has occured exclusively over the past 50 years. Over the past few years Anglian water have started introducing 'Predator Fishing' and some unscrupulous Predator fishermen are catching and taking trout even though they are not allowed to.",
