        "additional_details": "Uniform is important, it is a levelling factor that bonds us in unity. However the tie divides us through being a dated tradition of what is perceived to make a \"man\" look smart. In the pursuit of gender equality, the silk noose should be an optional accessory worn at the employees or pupils discretion and should be banned from being a mandatory requirement enforced by an employer or organisation.",
        "background": "Ties as a part of mandatory uniform is imposed on both pupils and employees at school and in the workplace. This dated tradition sees for the best part men having to wear a tie at work when women are only required to wear smart blouses. In the pursuit of gender equality the tie should be optional.",
