This is causing distress, distrust and dissatisfaction, and having a detrimental effect on children.\r\n \r\nWe want \r\nA new body, independent of DFE, to which complaints that parents believe have not been dealt with fairly or in accordance with guidance can be escalated for investigation.\r\n \r\nUpdate the latest Governance handbook March 2019",
        "background": "Academies at present when investigating complaints are only obliged to adhere to their own complaint policy, regardless of the outcome & a parent can only escalate to DFE and would only be eligible if the complainant can evidence that the complaints process has not been followed by the academy.",
