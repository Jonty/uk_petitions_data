        "additional_details": "The average GP sees more than 40 patients daily and only for a short period of time. This puts a health risk as the practitioner may not have enough time to see those who have a worrying health risk. Due to this, GP faces mounting pressures of increased, demand, unmanageable workloads and lack of resources causing more to leave the profession. Giving a pound when making an appointment will increase investment towards GP so more doctors can be recruited to see patients carefully and with no rush.",
        "background": "According to the British Medical Association (BMA), England will lose more than 600 GP practices by 2022 without urgent investment. although the government has a long-term funding plan, at this point only 7.1% of NHS budget is spent on GP funding. Paying a pound, can increase investment towards GP.",
