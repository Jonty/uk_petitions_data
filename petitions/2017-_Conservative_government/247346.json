        "additional_details": "The country needs to understand and discuss whether Corbyn's proposed deal is any more credible than May's deal.  It is not enough for Labour to state they will work on a jobs first alternative.  How exactly will this be achieved? What will be the compromises? More information is needed on what this looks like in order to have sensible discussion and to bring communities together. A people's vote should not be confined to \"No Deal\", \"May's Deal\" or \"Remain\" if other deals are in the pipeline.",
        "background": "Amongst the turbulence of Brexit and a potential \"No Deal\" exit, Remain voters are petitioning to revoke Article 50 whilst opposition MPs are calling for a deadline extension. The public are unclear on the nature of the \"alternative deal\" that Labour and Jeremy Corbyn are specifically advocating.",
