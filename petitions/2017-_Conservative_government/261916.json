        "additional_details": "Looking for a job is a hard process. However, when you find one it doesn\u2019t always mean you will be treated as equals in the workplace. Many places are able to pay people under the age of 21 reduced wages due to their age. Even though you are still completing the same amount of work. This is a form of ageism and needs to be addressed by our Government. Everyone deserves the same rights no matter your age.",
        "background": "I am 16 years old and have currently began looking for a job. However, I have noticed that employers are able to offer people under the age of 21 ridiculous wage gaps. Only at 25 you are legally entitled to national minimum wage. I want to change this that so that everyone is paid fairly.",
