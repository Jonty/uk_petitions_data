They have to demonstrate evidence of waste packaging recycling and recovery of a sufficient quantity to met this obligation. They can do that directly or by signing up to a compliance scheme. You can find more details here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-producer-responsibilities#check-if-youre-an-obligated-packaging-producer\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition to replace these arrangements with an obligation to provide a \"take-back\" service like those operated under the WEE directive if that's something you would like to see happen."
