Our management company refused to install a bin because \"it would not be emptied often enough\" - this is what we pay them for.\r\n\r\nWe have no authority to challenge cost increases, which are enforced regularly in spite of little/no action occurring.\r\n\r\nWe have no say in works undertaken/planned.\r\n\r\nWe have no take-over rights or consultation in the appointment of the management company.\r\n\r\nThis is effectively an additional tax, albeit private.",
        "background": "Fleeceholding is the newly formed practice of charging homeowners an additional premium to \"manage\" communal areas of land on a recently built housing estate.\r\nResidents have no rights, no escalation route, no say on the management of these areas and yet are threatened to pay or face court action.",
