        "additional_details": "If you work under 22 hours get get tax free but if you work more you get taxed.\r\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense the more hours you work the more tax you pay. As a person you don\u2019t receive any extra.I believe there should be a cap on how much tax and national insurance should be taken from your wages. If you work more then 45-50 hours a week, what you do  over should be tax and national insurance free. Personally I work 60-70 hour weeks and get tax an extortionate amount. Which works out I work 15-20 hours free because that\u2019s how much goes to the groverment.\r\nThere should be a cap on tax and national insurance to make it fair for all those people that work those extra hours.",
