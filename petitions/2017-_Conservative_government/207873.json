        "action": "Add directly democratic measures to the political process of the United Kingdom.",
        "additional_details": "It is reasonably evident, after a century of representative democracy, that the process is flawed. Representatives are often elected on overly optimistic statements, false promises, even lies. Once in power, the judicial branch is often too slow to provide a check or balance for representative actions. \r\n\r\nPutting a Swiss style democratic system in place - where the electorate can, through petition, gain access to referendum, would offer a timely check on laws passed by representatives.",
        "background": "Pure representative democracy offers only the power to select humans for office, not the right to influence policy. Whilst protest is available to voice policy concerns, it is not a direct solution, and often not heeded. Some access to direct democracy would offer a check to representative action.",
