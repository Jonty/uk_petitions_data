        "action": "Require constitutional referenda to have an unambiguous result for MAJOR change.",
        "additional_details": "Recent plebiscites (Scottish Independence & Brexit) resulted in extreme national division, creating strenuous objections to & denial of the outcome, seriously affecting levels of division & resulting in futile time consuming/distracting efforts to re-run both votes.\r\nReferenda need clear unambiguous outcomes, demonstrating a credible majority for change.\r\nIt's not logical or sensible for MAJOR change to be settled 50/50. MAJOR change requires a minimum 60% vote & a 75% turnout (effectively 45%).",
        "background": "Referenda can be a very divisive method of government abdicating its responsibilities (avoiding electoral fallout). If government require the people to vote on matters of MAJOR constitutional change, they should ensure the terms of that referendum have very clear & unambiguous outcome conditions.",
