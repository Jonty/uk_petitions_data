According to a press release, researchers at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia found that a turtle had a 22 percent chance of dying from ingesting one plastic item. Once a turtle gobbles 14 pieces of plastic, the mortality rate jumps to 50 percent. Once an animal eats 200 pieces of plastic death is eminent",
