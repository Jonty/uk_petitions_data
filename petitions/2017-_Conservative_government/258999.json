        "additional_details": "This is a disgusting, irresponsible and avoidable use of hundreds of meters of plastic. The owner of the bag wasn\u2019t even paying attention and stood just looking at her phone. \r\nPlease support this petition to stop these companies providing this service at airports.",
        "background": "A few weeks ago, I was at Heathrow and I looked on in horror as I saw a woman with a soft hold-all bag pay to have it wrapped by The Excess Baggage company. The bag was placed on a turn table and spun while being wrapped in thick plastic wrap. The man wrapping the luggage spun It 100 or more times.",
