        "additional_details": "As police officers have have tasers, prison officers should be equipped with tasers as well. It's wrong for prison officers to be assaulted by prisoners. When prisoners attack prison officers, other PO's have to rush to get to the incident.\r\n\r\nSo when PO's are in a desperate situations, they do defend themselves but it would be more helpful if they are equipped with tasers to stop prisoners.\r\n\r\nSo i'm doing this petition to ask that PO's are given more powers and to be equipped with tasers.",
        "background": "Prison Officers  do an amazing jobs and at times it can be difficult for them. Some prison officers either get seriously injured and/or killed which is horrific for a prison officers family/friends and their colleagues.\r\n\r\nPrison officers should have more powers as they have a difficult job to do.",
