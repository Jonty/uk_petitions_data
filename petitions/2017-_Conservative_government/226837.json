        "action": "alter law so that biological parents are legal guardian of their surrogate child",
        "additional_details": "If the embryo is biologically from the couple struggling with fertility and they choose to use a surrogate, there should be a law in place to say that baby is theirs legally and that the surrogate cannot keep the child once born. Couples struggling with infertility have enough to worry about without having their hopes dashed by a surrogate mother who may suddenly decide she doesn't want to part with the child once born, which would be devastating if the couple are biologically the 'real' parents",
        "background": "In the UK, the worrying thing about using your own embryo (which is biologically yours and your partners DNA) is that the surrogate is the legal guardian and can keep the child once born, if they decide to. I find this a scary thought after struggling to have my own child and considering surrogacy.",
