        "action": "Increase funding to GIC's and GP's for transgender patients",
        "additional_details": "The Government must provide sufficient funding to  GIC's and GP's to cope with the continued rise in requests for help for transgender patients. This will in turn, help reduce those needing treatment as a result of self harming ect. The Government must also ensure adequte funding so that treatment under shared care protocol for those who have to go private while waiting NHS care, is consistent throughout the country rather than the postcode lottery as it currently stands.",
        "background": "Despite a steady rise in the number of transgender patients seeking treatment, funding remains poor with waiting lists often several years. Figures show that self harm, suicide, depression, drink and drunk problems are substantially higher for those questioning their identity, all costing the NHS.",
