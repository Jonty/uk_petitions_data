My son was born at 33 weeks. He should have been born in October but ended up arriving unexpectedly towards the end of August. \r\n \r\nPrem babies are known to disadvantaged starting school and especially if they are unexpectedly born in July or August. This would help to reduce the difficulties faced by prem children and mean they would be starting school when they were supposed to.",
