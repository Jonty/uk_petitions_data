        "additional_details": "The Government needs to protect employees by making sure that a review meeting, through the period should be carried out allowing time to improve.\u00a0\r\nAlso if at the end of the probationary period the employer feels the employee is not suitable then a reason must be given following guidelines.\u00a0\r\nThe government should make it illegal to dismiss anyone without given support to improve or a reason why they are being dismissed.\u00a0\r\nThis is currently allowed to happen giving workers no protection",
        "background": "Currently the employment law does not protect employees during the probationary period of a new contract.\u00a0\r\nAn employer can dismiss the member of staff without reason within this period with no review and the employee has no legal right to challenge it.\u00a0\r\nI feel this needs to change.",
