        "additional_details": "We need to get on with the business of delivering on the referendum. The EU are showing little flexibility on amending a \u2018fair Brexit deal. And some politicians are frustrating all attempts to find a way out. A Prorogue at this time is totally appropriate and the anti-brexiteers are now using this as a stick to beat the brexiteers over the head. Let is build a vote to counter those doubters and help this country get back on it\u2019s feet before the pound falls any further and more jobs are lost through business uncertainty.",
        "background": "Give Boris a chance to prepare for serious domestic policy changes and prepare for Brexit. The referendum held on 23 June 2016 decided the will of the UK nations to leave the European Union. Invocation of Article 50 occurred on 29 March 2017. So, now it\u2019s time to leave.",
