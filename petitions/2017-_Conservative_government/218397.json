        "additional_details": "I'm looking to move from my present address, (I have social housing) boy was I shocked, when I saw the cost of fees involved in doing so in the private sector. Fees have been illegal in Scotland since 2012, so why is it not the same in England? \r\nIs it because so many MP's are Landlords (123 was the count in 2017). They won't want to pick up the tab themselves, like they have to in Scotland for these checks, let's force their hand.\r\n",
        "background": "The fees letting agents charge have gotten out of hand, you can lay out a lot of hard cash, and lose it if you fail the reference, credit, or guarantor, stages of applying for a Tenancy, the cost of the Tenancy itself can be ridiculous, it's illegal in Scotland, why not in England?",
