        "action": "Make voting in local & general elections compulsory.",
        "additional_details": "District & County Councillors, School Governors, are being elected by a tiny number of electors. Called upon to administer complex issues & substantial budgets, they may be - at best - incompetent, at worst be driven by a motive contrary to that desired by the majority. The ballot slip should include a box labelled 'none of the above', but anyone on the electoral roll who doesn't vote should have to pay a fixed penalty - say \u00a350. Voting 'on line' should also be possible.",
        "background": "The 'turn-out' at local government elections is abysmal. The resultant problem is that small groups that are motivated by a covert agenda may succeed. A 'fixed penalty' for failing to vote - as applies in Australia & N.Z. - might provide an extra incentive to vote.",
