        "additional_details": "I strongly believe the punishments in such cases (SP 30) do not fit the crime. My suggestion is that the law is changed so that penalty points are allocated depending on the amount of the excess speed reached...for instance 1 penalty point for 5 mile per hour excess..2 penalty points for 10 miles per hour and so on.",
        "background": "I am a scooter rider who has ridden to work, from Kew to Central London, each day for many many years...with no fines! I have recently received 4 speeding tickets in one week for marginally exceeding the speed limit on the A40.",
