        "action": "Stop Harmful Chemicals from entering the UK post-Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "The EU REACH system has successfully reduced consumer exposures to chemical pollutants linked to breast and other cancers. REACH regulations determine which chemicals end up in the environment \u2013 our water, air and soil \u2013 and in everyday products.  \r\n\r\nHealth and environmental NGOs, and industry, regard REACH as the gold standard for chemicals regulation. There is a real risk this benchmark is diluted post-Brexit, making it harder for the UK to keep pace with global action on toxic chemicals.",
        "background": "The Government must safeguard public health and ensure Brexit does not weaken environmental protections from chemicals linked to cancer. We should remain part of the EU REACH system, but if no-deal occurs any new chemicals regime must mirror and copy across future improvements in EU chemicals laws.",
