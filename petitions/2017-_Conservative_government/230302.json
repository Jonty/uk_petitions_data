The Act was passed in order that vehicles could be easily traced in the event of an accident or contravention of the law. \r\nIt\u2019s seem evidently obvious that this should apply to push bike, so they can be held accountable for their actions.\r\nLet all get together and make a difference, sign this petition and let\u2019s get our voice heard.",
