Even my child having a life threatening illness was taken off her attendance for the year",
        "background": "Recently one of my three children were rewarded with a trip to the coast - fully funded by the primary school, because she had 99+ attendance - yet my children who both suffer with chronic health conditions - were excluded due to lower attendance. \r\nThis is discrimination towards vulnerable children",
