        "additional_details": "Just think about what you do when you get in your car - you put your seatbelt on, turn the ignition on and release the handbrake. One small extra step to breathe into a breathalyser before your engine will turn on would be nothing. \r\nThe cost of these units is around \u00a31000, but vehicle (and motorbike) manufacturers could drive that cost right down with bulk orders.\r\nThey have been around for years - why are they not an every day part of cars and motorbikes?",
        "background": "On average 3,000 people are killed or seriously injured each year in drink drive collisions\r\nOne of these was my friend, someone's husband, and about to be a father\r\nIf cars, motorbikes and vans were fitted with a breathalyser linked to the immobiliser, not one of these tragedies would have happened",
