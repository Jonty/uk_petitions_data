        "additional_details": "The Home Office have charged a fortune for this, and made the wrong decision. I have 28 days to appeal, and Immigration Lawyers are looking at around \u00a33,500 to work with the case. I simply don't have this kind of money. But if anyone from a EU country can bring in a partner from outside the EU, to Britain and it will only cost \u00a365. They don't have the checks and requirements to meet, that a British National has to meet. Our country is not helping our citizens. Let's get this decision over ruled.",
        "background": "I am a British Citizen, living and working in the U.K. I have a 2.5 year old son, with my Filipino partner. We have done everything the Home Office have asked, our application could be used as a training example. But according to the decision maker. Our 800+ A4 pages of relationship is all a Lie.",
