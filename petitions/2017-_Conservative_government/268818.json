        "action": "Make CBT course compulsory for car drivers.",
        "additional_details": "As young as 16 and with only a basic knowledge of the Highway Code you can be out on the road after just a few hours of basic tuition. As a CBT instructor I see negligent and reckless car drivers put young motorcyclists lives at risk for no reason. These car drivers are needlessly risking the lives of young people.\r\nMaking the CBT compulsory for car users would increase awareness for the vulnerability and invisibility of motorcyclists while educating dangerous drivers of effects of there actions.",
        "background": "As the cost of living and driving increases more young people are turning to motorcycles as cheap transport. Since it\u2019s introduction the CBT course has reduced accidents and fatality\u2019s in new motorcyclists by 50%. Now the most dangerous thing for young bikers is uneducated car drivers.",
