        "additional_details": "As a professional driver (hgv) I believe drls are very dangerous and all motor vehicles manufactured should now constantly have their lights on, best example car is the Volvo, if the switch is positioned on (0) then the headlights are still on! Several times I have been close to a collision due to this and personally I don\u2019t think it would be fair for anyone to have an accident and potentially injure or even kill a person or family and get punished for it for the sake of making it a legal requirement that vehicle lights are constantly on.",
        "background": "Daytime running lights also known as (Drls) are dangerous, travelling around the country I\u2019ve seen far too many people driving at nighttime with only the vehicle drls on, which unfortunately are only on the front of vehicles.",
