        "additional_details": "\u201cTrains allow pets either side of the Channel and by car through Eurotunnel, but for those without a vehicle, there is little option.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe train is for most dogs the most stress-free method of transportation and I find it very strange to hear there is no option to take them onboard the Eurostar. Within the UK and within France trains allow dogs to board for either free or a small additional cleaning fee, and I do not see why the Eurostar should be any different.",
        "background": "Recently we got our Yorkshire terrier Teddy set up with a pet passport so he could accompany my parents to France. \r\nWe then discovered he could not travel on the Eurostar part of the journey without being a guide dog. Our dog hates travelling in the car so he now has no option but to stay at home.",
