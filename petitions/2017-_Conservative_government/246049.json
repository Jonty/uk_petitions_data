However our opportunities are restricted as we are not that of a certain age; yet individuals have to work longer hours or have multiple jobs to even have a chance at achieving to be independent. So why young people are continuing multitasking and being exhausted, I ask the government what makes young people any worse, than individuals doing the same job 25 and over? Is this ageism?",

However I feel as a 19 year old I can not achieve this for a few years after University. I want 18-24 year olds to have the same opportunity as everyone 25 and over to have the same wage.",
