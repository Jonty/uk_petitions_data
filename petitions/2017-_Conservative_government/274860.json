We need to make combatting climate change a total priority. A 2018 UN report stresses the need of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, which is a near impossibility without additional funds.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/",
        "background": "Climate change is the greatest threat mankind has ever faced. It is the utmost responsibility of Her Majesty's government allocate significantly more funding to tackling this issue which threatens the future of all UK citizens with additional grants in the vein of the Aryton Fund.",
