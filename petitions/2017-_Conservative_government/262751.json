        "additional_details": "The quarry will devastate 220 acres of countryside which can never be restored to its grade 1 and 2 farmland. This land contains ancient hedgerows and heritage sites. It will cause silica dust which can kill. The dust will travel directly towards a primary school and will affect the health of thousands of children and the elderly. The land will be at risk of becoming a flood plain after they have finished. This is against St John\u2019s College\u2019s environmental policies. Please help us save the land!",
