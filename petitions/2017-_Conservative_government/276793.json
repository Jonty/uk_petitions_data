        "additional_details": "In a study at a primary school in Stoke-on-Trent, 7-11yr old children were read to, just for fun, most days over 1 term. Their enjoyment & motivation to read increased significantly; their reading attainment improved at more than TWICE the expected rate. An easy, low cost solution to the crisis in reading is to change the curriculum to make space for daily storytime. By taking pressure off, children\u2019s well-being and results will improve!  https://www.egmont.co.uk/stories-and-choices-research/",
        "background": "Children who read achieve more, do better in all subjects & experience better well-being, yet only 37% of children 6-11 read for pleasure daily. Reading aloud to children frequently is THE most effective way to encourage them to read, yet daily storytime is not currently statutory on the curriculum.",
