        "additional_details": "The reason we should stop the BBC from being able to charge for the TV licence is 3 fold. \r\n\r\n1. it is a private company that has managed to take a fee that was originally charged for the usage of the radio frequency that was used to watch TV and listen to the radio. This now is mostly done by cable or straight which you pay a fee for with the provider. \r\n\r\n2. They can charge you for watching any TV channel even if it is not their own and make a profit off of other peoples work which I would suggest would be a breach of copyright.\r\n\r\n3. They do not remain unbiased with there news reporting and have on numerous occasion falsified the news and documentaries to push their own political views and agendas.",
        "background": "By the end of 1923, around 200,000 licences had been issued and by 1928 this had risen to approximately 2.5m.\r\n The Treasury took a cut until October 1963, when excise duty on licences was abolished.\r\nA colour TV Licence currently costs \u00a3126.50 annually for each household.",
