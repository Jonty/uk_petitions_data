        "additional_details": "A rear numberplate should be required and written clearly in order for police to read and for cameras to see, but front number plates should be optional as if someone was to be pulled over by police, their rear number plate would be visible to the officer so there should be no issues, and say the person was to drive at a high speed past a speed camera, the camera would still be able to pick up the rear license plate, making the front number plate unnecessary",
        "background": "For years front number plates have been a necessary requirement in the UK, where as in other countries they\u2019re not required, drivers should be allowed to remove their front number plates but still keep the rear",
