        "additional_details": "This petition is launching over Christmas 2018 where it still remains a challenge to participate in the gift giving tradition while avoiding single use plastics. \r\nConsumers need plastic free alternatives.\r\nExcess plastic packaging engulfs our children's toys. \r\nToy producers must be pressured to make urgent & significant changes necessary to protect our natural world.\r\nThe cheap price of plastic does not reflect the environmental cost. \r\nProducers profit whilst contributing to plastic pollution.",
        "background": "The Packaging Producer Responsibility Regulations framework is a positive step but targets do not reflect the urgency of our global plastic pollution crisis: producer target is 57% recycled or recovered by 2020. This is not enough.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-producer-responsibilities",
