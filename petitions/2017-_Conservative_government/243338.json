        "additional_details": "In light of the recent Tommy Robinson case where certain people were offered payment in order to ruin someone\u2019s reputation, I believe the BBC has overstepped the mark and the choice now needs to be given back to the people as to whether we want to continue funding this.\r\n\r\nThere should be more clarity on the \u2018TV\u2019 License - a tax for publicly broadcasted channels that you may not want or need. Surely I should be allowed to own a TV/streaming device without having to pay for something I don\u2019t want.",
        "background": "The BBC, a publicly funded broadcaster, should no longer be a forced choice we have to embrace. We should be given the option on whether or not we pay our tv license in order to receive the BBC\u2019s broadcast.",
