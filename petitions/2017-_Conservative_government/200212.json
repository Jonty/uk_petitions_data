        "additional_details": "An individual, e.g. student or home-owner, may have two places of residence, in different local authorities. They are entitled to vote in both local authority elections but by law they are only allowed to vote once in a national election.\r\nThe individual does not have to specify at which residence they would like to cast their national vote, so they receive two polling cards and whilst it is illegal to vote twice there is no validation carried out to stop this.",
        "background": "There is insufficient rigour applied to the voting process and it is open to error and fraud because it is not national, has insufficient identity checks on an individual, and does not include an individual\u2019s voting rights. A national database and appropriate identity checks would resolve this.",
