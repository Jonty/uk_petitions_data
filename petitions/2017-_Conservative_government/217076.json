        "additional_details": "In March, I renewed my SIM-only contract because it offered free roaming in Turkey at no additional cost. Within a few weeks they contacted me to say that free roaming in Turkey is no longer included in my contract and would cost \u00a36 a day to use my phone there. My wife also took out a contract a couple of weeks after me with the same belief that we could use our phones in Turkey for no fee.\r\n",
        "background": "I believe contracts should be honoured. As a consumer I do not have the right to change the terms of the contract after a purchase. I want a new law to state that mobile phone companies cannot change the terms of a contract without the consent of the other party to the contract. ",
