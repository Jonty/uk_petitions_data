All it takes is a scanner to be used at the vets and a quick name confirmation. I know it's more work for our vets but it could save so much heartache.\r\n\r\nI will always keep Charlie's microchip up to date, just in case.",

When we take our pets for medical attention, more often than not, nothing is done to confirm either the pets or our own identity.\r\n\r\nThis needs to change.",
