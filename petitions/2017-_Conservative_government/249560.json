        "additional_details": "Since then,  MPs who are elected by the People, for the People,\r\nhave done nothing but try to overturn the result.  They have plotted and connived to try to keep us in the EU.  The extension was a plot, namely, to allow 3 more weeks for them ALL to contrive a plan to keep us tied to the corrupt EU, either by a soft Brexit (which is not leaving),  reversing Brexit,  or cancelling Brexit. THIS  WILL NOT DO.  The antics of Politicians over the last months have been a disgrace.  We, the People will not stand for it any longer.  You have no idea of the anger that people feel towards you ALL.   You will be punished for your treasonous acts.",
