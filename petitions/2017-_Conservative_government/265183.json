        "additional_details": "TNBC is negative to Oestrogen, Progesterone and HER2 Protein receptors, so treatments like Herceptin aren\u2019t effective. New treatments and advances in tech are slowly becoming possible e.g. gene activity, microelectrode bio-sensor devices, bio-markers, the UK bio-bank are all in development. I took part in a platinum-based drugs trial targeted at \u201cus younger people\u201d. But lowering the age for mammograms from 50 to 25 could detect cancer at an earlier stage and improve outcomes.",
        "background": "I\u2019m Rachael. I was diagnosed with poorly differentiated Grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma Triple Negative Breast Cancer 7 months post-partum on 18/10 2018. TNBC is rare, aggressive and usually found in people under 50. About 15% of breast cancers are TNBC.",
