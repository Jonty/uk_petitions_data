        "additional_details": "Motorcycles should be exempt from this charge as a huge amount of them travel around London every day. The majority of these bikes will have to pay the new ULEZ charge of \u00a312,50 and this will inevitably push a lot of the bikers to use trains, buses and underground causing even more pollution and congestion. Bikes as well as bicycles are a good way of keeping low level emissions and congestion to a bare minimum. Bikes are the solution and not a hindrance! For more info Join We Ride London or Mag",
        "background": "The Ultra-Low Emission Zone charge was announce by London Mayor earlier this year, in response to the rising levels of harmful NOx gas In the air. It will mean a flat \u00a312.50 daily rate applied to all pre-2007 motorcycles that travel in certain parts of central London from April 2019.",
