        "additional_details": "As a former Sussex Police officer who was deployed as a urban and rural unformed officer and Detective, I am deeply concerned that Sussex Police is becoming more isolated and detached from the public it serves. Online referrals are no effective substitute for face to face engagement and the Government and local authority should recognise and react to the severe budgetary restraints that are causing the loss of public confidence in the counties police service.",
        "background": "Over the past twenty years, operational police presence in Sussex has been reduced to dangerous levels. A lack of warranted officers is resulting in too many documented cases where there has been a lack of e police response leading to an increased the risk to public safety.",
