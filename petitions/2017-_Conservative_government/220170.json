        "additional_details": "These men bore witness to the most devastating weapon this country ever produced, yet have laboured ever since under an oppressive cloud of official denial. \r\n\r\nIt is time this nation repaid the debt of honour it owes to all British Nuclear Veterans who participated and their families. Every other nuclear power has recognised its nuke vets and Britain must, in all good conscience, do the same.\r\n\r\nPlease show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition below.",
        "background": "It is 60 years since Operation Grapple Y, when Britain exploded a 2.8 megaton bomb at Christmas Island in the South Pacific with the help of 22,000 servicemen.\r\n\r\nThe British Nuclear Testing Programme ran between 1952 and 1967, it was the largest Tri-Service operation since the D-Day landing.",
