Currently, the only remedy is enforcement.\u00a0\u00a0This requires awareness of the misdemeanour and costly action to remedy. In contrast flood-risk is a Material Consideration, yet fire claims many more lives than flooding.\r\n\r\nHad the fire safety of the works to Grenfell Tower been considered at the Planning stage the deaths may have been avoided.",

This leads to conflict; planning may be granted for a building that does not comply with Fire Regulations.",
