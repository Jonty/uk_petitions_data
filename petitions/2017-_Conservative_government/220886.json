        "action": "Remove the household means assessment from student loans for all adult students.",
        "additional_details": "The student loan assessment is unfair. A common example is where a students mother lives with a new partner. The partner earns a good salary and pays maintenance for his existing children - however the student applying for university must ask this man, who s/he may only have known for a year for their financial details. Then will be awarded a lesser sum because of this man income . With the expectation that he will top up the reduced loan. This rarely happens leaving the student disadvantaged.",
        "background": "Parental maintenance cease at 18. The UK government assesses an entitlement to a student loan for an adult upon the income of people who live in their household but may have had no previous financial responsibility for ? \r\nAllow all students to apply for the maximum award. It\u2019s all repayable",
