        "additional_details": "As a student myself, I cannot stress the fact that it is my future I would be voting for; my ability to study abroad, my ability to find work abroad, my future. I think on behalf of my peers I can say this is how the majority of us feel. At 16 we can marry, we can have children, but we can\u2019t vote for something that will ultimately affect us more than any other group in society- does that seem fair to you?",
        "background": "Recently our youth have proven more and more politically active and responsible; trying to succeed in getting their once muffled political voices heard. \r\nThere were lies in each side of the Brexit campaign. People did not understand the reality of what they voted for.  This, is no democracy.",
