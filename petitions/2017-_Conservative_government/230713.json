        "action": "Raise the Level of Tax free Allowance to \u00a324'000",
        "additional_details": "Putting cash in the pockets for the majority of the population should be an immediate priority for the government during this time of austerity.  This gesture would help those on lower incomes to meet the increasing costs of food & housing whilst also boosting the economy as people would have more disposable income to spend how they need.\r\n\r\nI understand people want to contribute the society they live in and they will continue to be able to do so through our current rates of VAT on purchases.",
        "background": "People should start paying income tax when they earn above the average national living wage.  The tax free allowance currently stands at \u00a311'850 and from that point onwards income tax is applied.  I believe this should be increased to \u00a324'000 to increase individual and families disposable income.",
