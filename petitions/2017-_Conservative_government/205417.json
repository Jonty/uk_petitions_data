        "additional_details": "Some12,000,000 people in this country for many personal reasons choose not to marry.  In some cases a previous bad experience in marriage may persuade them not to say \"I do\" for a second time. Previous correspondence from the Treasury suggested that married couples/civil partners were seen as being in \"committed/recognised\" relationships.  This is something of an insult to genuine couples who have been together but unmarried for 25+ years. The government must stop this totally unfair prejudice.",
        "background": "We believe, in terms of Inheritance Tax, long-term partners are being treated grossly unfairly as opposed to married couples/civil partners.  Like millions of others in this country, long-term partners are equally committed to each other as anyone else and should not be penalised with a 40% tax!",
