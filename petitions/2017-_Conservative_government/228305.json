        "additional_details": "Bedsforbullies rescue pick up the pieces of just some of the lucky ones who have escaped. Prime example is Della a 10 year old bull terrier who was once a very loved family pet who was given away or sold off and she ended up in the hands of these evil people, she escaped and was found by a policeman called Derek who contacted bedsforbullies to help with Della. She had horrific facial and body injuries where she had been savaged by fighting dogs. No charges were ever brought.",
