Please accept our sincere condolences. \r\n\r\nAs we explained previously, we can't accept your petition because the Government and Parliament aren't responsible for the issue you raise. Cemeteries and crematoriums are usually the responsibility of local churches or your local council. In this case, Carmountside Cemetery and Crematorium appears to be the responsibility of Stoke on Trent City Council.\r\n\r\nYou can therefore raise this issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors \r\n\r\nYou can also petition your local council - you can find out more here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.stoke.gov.uk/info/20043/councillors_and_decision-making/137/petitions"
