        "additional_details": "they are asking for a second referendum which we don\u2019t want we just want to get on with it. But I feel nothing being achieved by the conservatives since the electorates voted 2 and 1/2 years ago maybe longer and we\u2019re still debating on a deal and no deal. The EU is a failing organisation and is trying to bring us down!\r\n17.4 million people which is 52% voted to leave but we know it\u2019s increased since then and yet the government still not doing anything they still want ties but we just want to leave.",
        "background": "We have noticed recently after the brexit referendum that remainers want to remain even though they left they are not respecting the will of the people.",
