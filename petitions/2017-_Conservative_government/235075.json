        "additional_details": "Granted petrol prices seem to be going down, however with student loans being so low that they don\u2019t even cover rent, my parents have to use so much of their hard earned money to pay for extra rent/food/petrol etc. As well as jobs for students being seemingly impossible to obtain, the idea of student discount for petrol is definitely one to consider!",
        "background": "Being a student myself and also being a driver who loves cars, the idea of not having my car with me when at university is not a thing. It makes it so much easier to be able to go home for emergencies or to go to large/cheaper supermarkets. But with petrol being so expensive it\u2019s hard to afford it",
