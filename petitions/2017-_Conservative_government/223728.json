        "action": "Stop avoidable deaths: additional regulation of Diamorphine and other opiates",
        "additional_details": "Much stricter control on the prescribing of Diamorphine and all other opiates is needed. At least three doctors should authorise any prescription of these drugs, following open discussions with the patients and family. The wishes of the patient must be the central focus. Special training needs to be given in the prescription of opiates to doctors and pharmacists. Legislation needs to be introduced to enforce the above. Patients' safety must prevail.",
        "background": "Diamorphine should only be used for extreme pain in terminal illness. \r\nMy husband was prescribed Diamorphine for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and pneumonia from which he was recovering. This is wrongful prescribing and can cause death. Stricter legislation and rules are needed.",
