        "additional_details": "The best estimate we have is that around 0.4% of people are non-binary (EHRC), over 250,000 people in the UK, comparable to the number of Buddhists in the UK - yet we are not counted in the UK census. We are not protected by the Equality Act unless someone thinks we're trans, we are required to pretend to be men or women when getting married, within the Home Office and when applying for DBS checks. Having companies providing toilets for us, and looking at our needs when in prison.",
        "background": "We call on the government to recognise non-binary people in law as distinct from men and women, in the form of a third gender option on passports and birth certificates, the ability to change one's gender legally to a third option with a gender recognition certificate as trans men and women can, etc",
