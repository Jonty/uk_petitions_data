        "additional_details": "Evidence can be seen all over social media, residents of Portsmouth are very unsatisfied with this as there are many other ways to lower emissions. Such as electric busses, cheaper fairs for people to get where they need to be etc. Not charge residents that are just leaving or entering Portsmouth for work! Why should residents pay to drive in their own town and then having to pay for parking. The government has to find a better way than this as the lower class citizen simply cannot afford this.",
        "background": "Why should every person in Portsmouth pay to drive in and out of the city? Workers, unaffordable payments. No other suggestions such as \u201celectric busses\u201d it should only be the visitors of Portsmouth to pay these charges. Not the residents!",
