        "additional_details": "The fees will be \u00a365 for over 16s and \u00a332.50 for under 16s. This can result in hundreds of pounds for some families and is extremely unaffordable. The application itself seems quite invasive and stressful, so to charge so much on top seems unfair, especially after promises were made that EU citizens' rights would not change after Brexit.",
        "background": "In order to stay in the UK after Brexit, EU citizens will need to apply for \"settled status\". This will cost up to \u00a365. It is unfair to charge EU citizens to keep their rights when they came here not knowing this would ever happen.",
