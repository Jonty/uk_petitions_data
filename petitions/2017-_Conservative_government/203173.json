        "action": "Revise to Abortion Act to allow women to take medical abortion pills at home.",
        "additional_details": "The Abortion Act of 1967 states that any abortion must take place in a medical clinic. Since this Act was passed, medical abortions have become possible, and now make up 2/3 of abortions. Due to the Act, women have to travel to a clinic twice within 48 hours. It is not medically necessary to take these pills in a clinic, this is simply enforced as a due to the strict terms of the 1967 Act. Consequently, many women unnecessarily begin this painful process in public or whilst travelling.",
        "background": "Currently, women are required to take abortion pills at a medical clinic due to the outdated Abortion Act of 1967. This means that women often begin the painful process in public or whilst travelling. This could be easily avoided if the Act was amended to allow women to take the pills at home.",
