        "additional_details": "With the old grading system, there was little a correlation between a level and a child\u2019s year group, and this can be seen in the way that in a Year 6 class there could be a range of levels, from level 2 to a level 6. However, the new National Curriculum sets out a mark scheme of a simple emerging, developing, secure, mastery.",
        "background": "From September 2014, the Government made huge changes in the way that students were to be assessed. This was a new way of thinking for schools, looking very different to the previous 20 years. These changes have created confusion among students and parents while decreasing student motivation.",
