        "action": "Make parking of ICE vehicles at EV charging points a more serious offence",
        "additional_details": "Currently, there are more than 100k plug-in vehicles in the UK. These cars require charging points to be able to move and in most cases such points are placed within parking areas for conventional cars. Although clearly marked as such, many of the points are obstructed by ICE vehicles, deliberately parking in EV-dedicated slots. This became a chronic symptom across the country and causes unnecessary stress for drivers. Local councils are not doing enough to protect rights of EV community.",
        "background": "Dedicated charging points for EV across the country are regularly and deliberately occupied by conventional ICE vehicles. This causes unnecessary stress for EV drivers as, unlike conventional cars, electric vehicles require charging points and attached parking place to be able to move.",
