        "action": "Reverse the BBC's decision to means test the free TV Licence for over 75s",
        "additional_details": "After 20 years of free licences, how can the BBC justify taking a housebound pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years she had for free, and then not only having the power to ask for a fine of \u00a31,000 - the standard penalty - but also the power if she can't pay, to ask the courts to send her to prison.\r\n\r\nIf this scheme goes ahead we will see the most vulnerable in society who are completely dependent on their television for companionship and news, forced to give it up.",
        "background": "From June 2020 more than three million people aged over 75, who previously received a free TV licence, will have to pay for one under a new scheme which comes into effect next year.\r\n\r\nFree TV licences for the over 75s will now be means tested, with only those who receive Pension Credit eligible.",
