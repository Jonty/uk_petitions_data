        "additional_details": "This 17 year miscarriage of justice brought about immense public support, several Parliamentary debates in both Houses, EDMs, reports from the National Audit Office and countless items of correspondence to, and from, the Ministry of Defence. Collectively, this is an important record of MoD, and RAF, failings and the loss of this would be detrimental to providing important learning opportunities for future military leaders.",
        "background": "The Chinook crash on the Mull of Kintyre, on 2 June 1994, resulted in the loss of 29 souls.  The pilots of the Chinook were wrongly blamed for the accident, resulting in a 17 year fight to clear their names. It was eventually proved that the MoD had wrongly blamed the deceased pilots.",
