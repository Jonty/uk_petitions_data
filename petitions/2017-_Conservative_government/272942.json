It was a binary vote: \r\n\"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\"  \r\n\r\nIt wasn't \"do you want to remain a member, leave with a deal, or leave without a deal\" \r\n\r\nLeave won by 1,269,501 over 1.2million people but they won't carry out our decision. They think they know better \r\n\r\nA General Election before 31 October will decide",
        "background": "We were asked to make the \"biggest decision of our lifetime\" a vote for In or Out of the EU in 2016.\r\nThe result has not yet been honoured\r\nAs Parliament is gridlocked it should be a decision for the General Public\r\nSo we need a General Election before October 31",
