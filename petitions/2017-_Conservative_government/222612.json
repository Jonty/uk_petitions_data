        "additional_details": "In a country where abortion is legal, why do we allow the \u201cpassive harrassment\u201d of pro-life campaigners outside of hospital and health care settings.\r\n\r\nEveryone is allowed to have their opinion and protest for what they believe in, but this should be nowhere near a hospital, where people are facing these heartbreaking decisions. It is inappropriate and immoral. Please help us change this, so women in the UK will not be forced to take dangerous actions to terminate pregnancy.",
        "background": "Every day, women in the UK face the hard decision to terminate a pregnancy. If this wasn\u2019t already difficult enough, the prospect of \u201cpro-life\u201d campaigners picketing outside the hospital, sometimes can be enough to prohibit women from accessing the care they need due to shame, embarrassment or guilt",
