        "additional_details": "I know someone who has been ill for twenty years with Cerebral Ataxia; Fibromyalgia; and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, which can be fatal. Also Lyme Disease. Wishing to avoid opiates he bought Kratom for pain relief without the negative effects of opiates. He was arrested and the police took his kratom, leaving him without pain relief. He now has no choice but to take an extremely addictive substance which costs more in terms of treating the known deleterious effects.",
        "background": "Drug companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to opioid pain relievers. Healthcare providers overprescribed these HIGHLY addictive medications. Kratom can provide pain relief without these risks and yet is prohibited by the 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act.",
