Brexit will not solve British social inequality. We need to hold the government accountable to fix the true issues of the country and stop using the EU as a scapegoat. \r\n\r\nYes, we are a democracy and people's voices need be heard. But the government has the responsibility to make the right decision to lead this country into a secure and prosperous future.",
