        "background": "Broadband deals are too complecated !\r\nBroadband price increase every year is not advertised when you buy online. \r\nSpeed is advertised as \"Up to\" and small print is saying \"fair usage policy\" so it is misleading consumer and from that advertisement you cannot really say what service you will get.",
