Endometriosis is recognised as a disability in many other countries, but not yet in the UK.\r\n\r\nEndometriosis should be formally recognised as a disability, and covered under the Disability Discrimination Act. Women are losing their jobs and facing difficulties!",
        "background": "Many suffer with extreme chronic or recurring pain, chronic fatigue, digestive problems, fertility problems and many have to undergo multiple surgeries, intense hormonal medication (with many side effects) or find ways of coping or fitting their lives around the intense pain they are subjected to.",

We're not sure exactly what you mean when you ask for Endometriosis to be made a recognised disability.\r\n\r\nLaws and policies don't usually list specific conditions and define them as disabilities. In most cases, it\u2019s the impact on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for protection under the law or makes them eligible for support.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about how to show you're disabled under the Equality Act here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/showing-you-re-disabled-under-the-equality-act/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
