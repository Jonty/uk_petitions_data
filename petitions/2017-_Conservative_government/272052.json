        "additional_details": "The year ending June 2018 shows there were 1,770 reported road deaths, 26,610 people killed or seriously injured and 165,100 casualties of all severities. These numbers are accurate statistics from the Great Britain provisional estimates on reported road casualties.\r\n\r\nWith the current penalties of 6 points and a minimum fine of \u00a3100 already in place the statistics on road casualties has decreased by only 6%. The public believe a stronger penalty should be in place to act as a real deterrent.",
        "background": "Distracted driving is the leading cause of vehicle accidents in the UK. More accidents are caused by distractions such as using a hand-held device than drunk driving, dangerous driving, speeding, running a red light and even serious weather conditions.",
