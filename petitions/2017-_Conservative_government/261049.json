        "action": "Establish an English Parliament at Richmond House after Westminster repairs.",
        "additional_details": "At the peak of the turmoil of the Brexit negotiations, it was perhaps noted that our representatives saw fit to instead devote valuable time to debating regulations regarding the height of letter boxes. This petition is therefore rendered in the interest of lightening the burden of governance on the British Parliament so as to create more efficient governance under the principle of local powers for local prerogatives and diverting less pressing matters away from the British Parliament.",
        "background": "In light of the enormous cost of renovating Richmond House for temporarily seating the British parliament during Westminster Palace repairs, it is suggested that after said repairs, Richmond House be designated the seat of an English Parliament with power to legislate in England on devolved matters.",
