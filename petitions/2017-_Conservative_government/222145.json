        "additional_details": "As an example: \r\nAssad Hussain, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 12 years. Hussain was found guilty by unanimous verdict on February 27 of one count of rape and one count of indecent assault.\r\n\r\nHe groomed and raped a child, he will be out in 12 years, that isn't a punishment at all, it isn't a deterrent. \r\n\r\nIf a life sentence is given for grooming, raping and assaulting a child, it should mean a life sentence should be served. No minimum tariff. A life sentence. Life means life.",
        "background": "Victims of child grooming, rape and assault are affected for their whole lives, lenient sentencing is farcical when a life sentence is given with a minimum tariff of 12 years. These children will live with this their whole lives. A life sentence should mean a life sentence.",
