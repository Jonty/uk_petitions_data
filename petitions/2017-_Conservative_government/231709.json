        "additional_details": "Make it the law that all Airbnbs and other short term lets of under one month have to require a change of use through the Local Planning Authority and be registered. They will also have to apply for the same entertainment and alcohol licences plus food hygiene and health and safety regulations as a Hotel or Bed & Breakfast. They will have to reapply annually for their licence and objections can be raised as in any other licensed premises. The property will also be subject to business rates",
        "background": "Properties are being changed from homes into cheap accommodation. This subjects the Hotel and B&B industry to unfair competition, increases rents as there are less properties available. This is also contributing to homelessness and is destroying local communities",
