        "additional_details": "In recent days, distressing news has emerged that Donald Trumps\u2019 policies have lead to migrant families being cruelly separated from each other, for the crime of seeking a better life.\r\n\r\nChildren are being kept in cages, in some instances neglected, and according to some reports unable even to hug their siblings.\r\n\r\nTheresa May has stated that these images are \u2018disturbing\u2019 but wishes to continue with the visit. We argue that refusing to fully condemn this behaviour is instead condoning it.",
        "background": "In the last few days, the images of children being kept in cages has haunted the world, a crime committed by the nation claiming to be the leaders of the free world.\r\n\r\nThis petition demands that the UK government cancel Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the UK until the policy of family separation is ended.",
