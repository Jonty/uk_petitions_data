What\u2019s more, dog owners who do have heart attacks have better survival rates following the events.\r\nReduce stress - Studies show that not only can your canine companion make for a happier home, spending just a few minutes with your dog can lower anxiety levels, and increase levels of serotonin and dopamine, which are two neurochemicals that affect your calm and wellbeing.",

I have the same maternal instincts as every other young woman. Yet, because I would rather a dog than a child, this is seen as a lesser life event.",
