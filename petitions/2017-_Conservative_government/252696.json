        "action": "Easily solve the Brexit impasse by voting all solutions on an elimination basis.",
        "additional_details": "Parliament has proved that voting Yes / No to any potential Brexit solution simply results in a NO vote no matter what is on the table. Forcing MPs to vote systematically for the best (or least bad) choice in each round and eliminating the least popular solution from the subsequent round is the only way to obtain a consensus where there is such a huge divergence in opinion. The process could even be extended to a multiple round referendum if MPs truly wish to honour the wishes of the UK people.",
        "background": "There are too many potential solutions to the Brexit process to gain a consensus with a binary Yes / No vote. All solutions must be voted on together in multiple rounds where the least popular solution is eliminated from the next round. The final vote would be between the two remaining solutions.",
