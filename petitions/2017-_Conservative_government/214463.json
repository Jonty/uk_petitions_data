        "additional_details": "So I ask that a British Foreign Legion is formed so Patriots of this country who were rejected by the British Army can serve their country, as I believe it is wrong that many patriots like my self are not given this opportunity, due to their pasts.\r\nJust like the French Foreign legion, people who want to come to this country to make a better life for themselves could do so by serving five years in the British Foreign legion. After that time is served they can be granted British citizenship.",
        "background": "Many British Army applicants are turned away due to their history of mental illness, certain complications such as having had a detached retina and also those with a criminal background. However The French Foreign legion could accept these failed applicants and they often prove to be great recruits.",
