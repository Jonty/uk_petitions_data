        "action": "If Brexit negotiations indicate there will be no deal, hold a second referendum",
        "additional_details": "The EU referendum was won by a margin of less than 4%. Many participants voted based upon misinformation and false promises from the leave campaign.\r\n\r\nGiven the possibility that Britain could walk away from Brexit talks with no deal, it is undoubtedly democratic to give Britons the opportunity to reverse the last referendum, should no deal occur. A no-deal Brexit was not what the majority of leavers voted for, let alone remainers.\r\n\r\nThe referendum proposed here would be another simple in/out vote.",
        "background": "Recent reports of the progress made in Brexit negotiations are not positive, which is bad news to many leave and remain voters.\r\n\r\nA second referendum is not undemocratic: the country can listen to voters whose opinions have changed and to those who are unhappy with the current execution of Brexit.",
