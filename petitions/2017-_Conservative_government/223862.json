Petitions need to call on the Government or Parliament to take a specific action. \r\nThe UK has no formal extradition treaty with Pakistan, but Section 194 of the Extradition Act 2003 does allow special extradition arrangements in exceptional circumstances. However, under current law, an extradition process is initiated at the request of the government of the country in which the individual has been convicted of a crime.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.
