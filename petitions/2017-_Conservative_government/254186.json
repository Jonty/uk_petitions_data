        "additional_details": "Joining a club to learn a new skill is beneficial for children's emotional and physical health as well as giving them more options for future work. At the moment, these activities are subject to 20% VAT which makes them too expensive for many families. We believe that children's activities with a physical or educational benefit (e.g. sports, dance, drama, maths etc.) should be 0 rated for VAT, opening them up to a wider range of children from different backgrounds.",
        "background": "Childcare is currently exempt from VAT but children's activity clubs (e.g. holiday sports camps, drama clubs, dance etc.) are not. This means that access to these types of activities may be out of the reach of lower earning families and these children may miss out on learning a new skill.",
