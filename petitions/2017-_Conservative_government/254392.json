        "background": "The brexit referendum was a farce...\r\n\r\nWhether it was the big red bus and the \"all things to all people\" policy of leave or the \"using tax payers money for pro remain leaflets\" policy of the pro-remain government.\r\n\r\nThat referendum split families and country. It can't be allowed to happen again",
