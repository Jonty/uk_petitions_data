        "additional_details": "My own daughter was in a nursing home whilst I recovered from surgery. Her Human Rights were breached and due to not having deputyship it meant the system could ignore concerns raised. The process for obtaining deputyship should be made automatic for parents and young people who are deemed to need it. \r\n \r\nOur case isn\u2019t unique there are numerous horrendous cases coming to light. People are being put into institutionalised care against family wishes. This is the tip of iceberg.",
        "background": "Once children who lack capacity to make decisions for themselves reach adulthood, it\u2019s extremely difficult to get the legal right for parents to act in their best interest. The present system is to go to court of protection which is extremely difficult. This puts our young adults at risk.",
