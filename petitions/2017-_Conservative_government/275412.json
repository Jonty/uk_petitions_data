        "action": "The Government needs to fund more money to schools",
        "additional_details": "The Government is only funding under \u00a342 billion making it \u00a34,700 per primary school student and \u00a36,200 per secondary school students. The Government is funding State Pensions for over \u00a360 billion and Benefits for over \u00a3100 billion. Surely, there can some cuts to other things that the Government funds in order to allow every student to recieve the proper education they deserve?",
        "background": "The Government should fund more in schools as cuts and other negative factors are being made. Students are now paying for their own equipment, textbooks, etc for over \u00a330 which some cannot afford. Not all students have that luxery. This limits students recieving the education for their dream career.",
