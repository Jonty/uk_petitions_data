        "additional_details": "Votes such as eu referendum have taken many years to enact and since then the public and politicians have been able to further scrutinise and research the true effects of such changes taking place. Why then should someone who was 17 years old at the time of the initial referendum not have their opportunity to vote for changes taking place when they are now of legal age to vote. Let's refine our democratic process and give the future the voice it deserves.",
        "background": "Votes passed affecting future generations should be voted again by citizens who have come of age since that vote, yet before New legislations are enacted. If for example a citizen is 16 years old at the time of a vote, but 19 when enacted. This citizen should have their vote added before enactment.",
