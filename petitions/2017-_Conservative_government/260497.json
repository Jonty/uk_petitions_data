        "additional_details": "Successive UK gov's. have failed to deliver an effective, forward thinking transport policy/infrastructure across the entire UK. Because of this failing, and pressure from debatable climate change evidence, they now choose to risk billions of pounds in the economy that are generated from the use of petrol/diesel every year. This ban will very quickly have a massive adverse effect on the UK economy, putting millions of jobs/livelihoods at risk when it was gov's failing in the first place.",
        "background": "Government have failed to invest in inter-model, integrated and sustainable mass transit and freight movement as well as lack of funding for town planning to cut air pollution. Because of this they are now penalising companies and individuals that will have to pay heavily before the 2040/50 cut-off.",
