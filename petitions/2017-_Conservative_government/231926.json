        "additional_details": "most uni's in the EU are free ,however, what we are seeing is that Universities are continuing to increase their fees and reduce the grants available. The saddest issue here is all courses cost the same, that means a degree in nursing costs the same per year as denistry. \r\nAs a result it's making higher education more attractive to students who can afford it and making it more difficult for students from deprived areas and low income families make it to uni's due to the fear of burdening loans.",
        "background": "The cost of university fees in the UK are unacceptable seeing as public universities are financed by the government. \r\nIt's not fair for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds who struggle finaiacially and students from higher economic background to be expected to pay the same fee of \u00a39,250.",
