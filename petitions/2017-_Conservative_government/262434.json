        "additional_details": "Take the stress of a ticking clock and multiple failures off of the next PM.\r\n\r\nLet them do it properly, as is the British way. If No Deal is the option taken, then let\u2019s have 2 years to prepare and make sure not one UK citizen is left in fear of its consequences. If we\u2019re going for a deal, let there be a new team to negotiate it. If we\u2019re going for a second referendum, give the inquiries into the financial irregularities time to complete their work. \r\n\r\nThis is simple, common sense.",
        "background": "The next PM should be given a clean slate to implement Brexit/the EU Referendum Result.\r\n\r\nWith the clock ticking they would only have 3 months before Oct 31 to prepare or renegotiate. By revoking Article 50, you give them the generous gift of setting their own timetable.",
