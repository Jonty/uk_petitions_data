        "background": "kings mill hospital has signs all outside saying \u2018no smoking\u2019 this does nothing you walk to the hospital, you see over 30 people smoking some pregnant some with drips attached to them,the birthing ward is right above we\u2019re people smoke with the windows open so smoke goes straight up to the birthing",
