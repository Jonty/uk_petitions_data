        "additional_details": "This Petition is different from previous examples calling for a General Election which were critical of the Government or its Members.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th September 2019, Parliament passed a bill excluding the possibility of no-deal. The Government\u2019s negotiating position has been significantly weakened.\r\n\r\nWith no working majority, the Government is rendered impotent by opposition MPs and Tory rebels. A General Election is now the only way that the public can elect a majority Government to deliver Brexit.",
        "background": "The government has lost its majority and its ability to leave the EU \u201cwith or without a deal\u201d as mandated by the people in the 2016 EU Referendum.\r\n\r\nWe demand that in the present circumstances, Parliament holds a General Election without delay in accordance with the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011.",
