        "additional_details": "People who need and would like to have surgery can\u2019t get it done due to NHS funding. It cost way too much to go private as the people who are on benefits can\u2019t afford it. It\u2019s not fair that people have to pay privately, especially those on benefits like myself who really need it.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if the government could help fund the NHS for things like this. I\u2019m tired of going to the doctors and them saying I might not be excepted every single time I go.",
        "background": "I want to have ear pinning surgery (Otoplasty), I keep going to my doctors but they keep saying I might not be accepted due too funding. My ears do stick out and wanted them corrected, ears pinned. \r\n\r\nI suffer depression and Body dysmorphic Disorder and would help if I could get ears corrected.",
