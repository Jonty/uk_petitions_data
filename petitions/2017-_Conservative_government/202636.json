        "action": "Call upon USA & North Korea to de-escalate; make it clear UK won't join conflict",
        "additional_details": "If a military conflict does arise, the NATO treaty compels member states to treat an attack on one as an attack on all. However, since Donald Trump is goading Kim Jong-Un to attack the USA to provoke war, the treaty should not be honoured. A military conflict between the USA and NK should not be allowed to escalate even wider; making it clear the USA stands alone in this would send a strong signal that de-escalation is now essential.",
        "background": "Kim Jong-Un and Donald Trump are set on a course for global nuclear destruction; each action or verbal outburst from one is followed by an escalation by the other. It must be made clear that they stand alone in this, that other civilised nations will not join them in any ensuing conflict.",
