To better understand and help to tackle this issue, statistics on the number of deaths of homeless people on the streets of Britain should be recorded.",
        "background": "According to the guardian, the number of homeless deaths on Britain\u2019s streets has more than doubled since 2013, yet the extent of the problem is not known as neither the government nor local authorities are required to keep statistics on this. By understanding the problem, it can be better tackled.",
