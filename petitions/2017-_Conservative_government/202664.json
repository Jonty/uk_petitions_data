        "background": "Many stores have staff who decide to lick their fingers to make it easier to open carrier bags. This is a serious health and safety issue as it can cause the spread of illnesses and diseases. It is very unhygienic and disgusting and shouldn't be the norm. They can use water instead.\r\n",
