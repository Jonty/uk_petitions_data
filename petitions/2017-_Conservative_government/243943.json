Iraq and Afghanistan is it any wonder.\r\n50% of rough sleepers are British Army veterans who are given no support after leaving the service.",
        "background": "British army veterans, some in their 70's are to be charged with offences against civilians in the troubles of Northern Ireland 40 years ago.   The IRA were all released from prison and given amnesty under the Good Friday agreement.   It's a scandal that 40 years later our veterans face prosecution.",
