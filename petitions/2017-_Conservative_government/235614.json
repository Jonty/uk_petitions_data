        "action": "Pause BREXIT and hold a #PeoplesVote if there is no agreed EU deal by 15 March.",
        "additional_details": "A recent judgement by the EU courts has confirmed that the UK can unilaterally withdraw its Article 50 Notice without repercussions. Exercising this right will allow government to put in place #PeoplesVote if there is no other way to resolve deadlock in parliament caused by a small minority of MP's who want a CHAOTIC NO DEAL BREXIT and have rejected the governments negotiated deal.\r\n\r\nBecause it is your future and the future of your children and grand children that is at stake we need your support",
        "background": "Leaving the EU without any deal will cause unacceptable hardship for many UK families, cause heavy lasting damage to the UK economy and the security of the UK and is against the national interest. We need MP's to protect the lives and livelihoods of their constituents & parliament to protect the UK.",
