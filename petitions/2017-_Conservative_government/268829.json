However there aren\u2019t any patches of land in Wales that allows us to park up and be social without interference from local authorities who move us on and just pushes the problem elsewhere and wastes police resources.",
        "background": "Car enthusiasts often commandeer car parks related to businesses whom do not want us there.\r\n\r\nQuite often the noise also carries over to local communities who take to social media to complain and often results in police being contacted.",
