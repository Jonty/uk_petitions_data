        "additional_details": "Boris has very publicly said that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than go to Brussels to ask for an extension to article 50. \r\nSince then he has said on multiple occasions that there is no way he would ask for an extension. \r\n\r\nIt is now looking likely that Boris will indeed to back on his word and ask Brussels for an extension to article 50. The only honourable thing to do in this situation is concede defeat and step down as prime minister and leader of the Conservative party.",
        "background": "If Boris is unable to deliver on his promise to \u201cget brexit done\u201d before October 31st then he should be compelled to step down as prime minister and leader of the Conservative party and a general election should be held.",
