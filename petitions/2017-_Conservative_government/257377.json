        "action": "17'4 Million people want a 'NO deal' Brexit. Put that option back on the table.",
        "additional_details": "It appears that the extensions have been asked for to wear down the Brexit process. There was no mention of Brexit with 'A deal' on the referendum ballot paper, so people voted for a clean break. Removing 'No deal' from the negotiations is totally unacceptable and goes against the will of over half the electorate. MP's and the PM are elected, and employed, to represent the people. It is time they did just that.",
        "background": "We had a referendum which was offered by the Government. The result of which the Government said they would honour. Theresa Mays deal is no Brexit is no Brexit at all, In fact it is worse than remaining. More than half the Country want a no deal Brexit and demand that the promise is kept.",
