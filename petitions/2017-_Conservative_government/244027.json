        "additional_details": "23 June 2016, the citizens of the UK voted to leave the European Union and return all sovereign power to the UK parliament. However, this was not fair on our MPs who never thought they would have to actually run the country, they were just trying to get expenses to get a taxpayer funded step on the lucrative London buy-to-let market. Our laws are now made in Brussels. Parliament is redundant, so let's make the MPs redundant. We don't need this layer of middle management. Let's give back control.",
        "background": "Churchill said \"democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried\" but he had never met Jean-Claude Juncker. On 29th March 2019, if we have not left the EU, let's save the \u00a3551 million per year parliamentary cost and spend it on the NHS instead.",
