        "additional_details": "The American Civil Liberties Union says quite clearly;\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Trump administration is choosing to separate families. It\u2019s a policy decision that could be stopped at any time by the president without legislation.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeparating children from parents can be regarded as a form of torture for children, its effects can last a lifetime. The UK cannot be seen to be condoning this by allowing someone doing this to visit the UK, his visit should be cancelled immediately.",
        "background": "President Trump is taking asylum-seeking children away from their parents at the US border. The UN says this is illegal. Over 2,000 so far. If Trump visits the UK it will be seen around the world as an endorsement. Her Majesty the Queen may have to shake his hand; as a country we cannot allow this.",
