        "action": "Minimum sentences for using physical violence or brandishing weapons.",
        "additional_details": "On 3 seperate occasions I personally have had knives pulled on me during the execution of warrants issued by HMCTS. On 2 occasions the police refused to arrest as they said there is no point and on the 1 occasion they did the offended was issued a \u00a350.00 fine (which they never paid) with no other punishment at all. \r\n\r\nThis is a story that is all too common in our workplace and I feel a minimum sentence should be introduced to provide justice to all frontline workers attacked or threatened.",
        "background": "On a regular basis my colleagues and I are subjected to physical aggression and attacked in the course of our lawful duty. We want minimum custodial sentences brought in so when we are attacked in our workplace or have weapons brandished against us we will have confidence in the justice system.",
