        "action": "Instruct the next Government by holding a referendum alongside the election",
        "additional_details": "If the referendum had been held 50 years ago, no-one would say that the result was still relevant.  It was actually held well over 3 years ago, and my father, who has since died, voted but my 18 year old daughter did not have a vote then.  Why should my late father\u2019s view be counted but my daughter\u2019s ignored when she's the one who will be affected?  There has been roughly a 10% change in the voting population since the last referendum - about 5% have died, and another 5% have joined.",
        "background": "The public are fed up of Brexit, so hold a second referendum alongside the next General Election.  Ask two questions: \"leave or remain?\" and \"if we leave do you want 'no deal', or 'the negotiated deal' ?\"  No matter what the outcome, the Government will be forced to bring the matter to a close.",
