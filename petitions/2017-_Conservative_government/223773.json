        "additional_details": "Enough is enough! We could be paying what we nowadays pay for TV Licence (\u00a3150.50 for a colour and \u00a350.50), which has gone up since 2010 towards the NHS as it is in much need of extra government funding.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree and if you think paying a TV Licence is pointless and you prefer that money going to our NHS!",
        "background": "The United Kingdom is perhaps the only country in the world that requires citizens to pay for a TV Licence. We often see news of ridiculously high salaries of BBC entertainers/workers which our licence money pays for.\r\n\r\nThe NHS needs extra funding and the TV Licence money could make a difference",
