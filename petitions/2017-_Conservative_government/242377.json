Freeholders of existing properties, particularly multi occupation dwellings (such as blocks of flats) canpresently refuse consent to tenants and leaseholders\u2019 installing EVCPs. This must change urgently if a shortage of public EVCPs is to be avoided. Parliament must enact legislation to prevent freeholders\u2019 refusing consent or, make it mandatory for freeholders to provide EVCPs. \r\nWe\u2019re ready for a breath of fresh air...",
        "background": "The starting point for providing adequate electric vehicle charging points for the sea change to EVs is to provide EVCPs at home. Government intervention to stop freeholders\u2019 refusing consent is now vital, and without delay.",
