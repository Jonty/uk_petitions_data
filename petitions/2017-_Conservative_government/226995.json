        "additional_details": "Speaking to residents, there was up-raw and was lead to believe that it was one free resident parking and anymore would be \u00a310. But when it came in it all changed and everyone had to pay high amounts.\r\nSpeaking to the parking team they said \u201cAll permits are okayed by the residents themselves.\u201d, which is a lie. We are paying council tax and then when we prove we live there it\u2019s very hard to even get one car approved. In addition, sometimes we can\u2019t even park, so a place is not even guaranteed",
        "background": "Arlesey residents parking permits stand at the moment at \u00a310 for the first vehicle, \u00a370 the next and \u00a390 for the next. \r\nWe are residents and we asked for permits due to the amount of people parking for the train station. That doesn\u2019t mean get more money out of us residents.",
