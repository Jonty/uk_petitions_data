        "additional_details": "It doesn't matter if you are lower, middle, upper class, famous or not, your cat will probably go to landfill if it\u2019s killed on the roads. \r\n \r\nCouncils who say they scan, often don't. They think \"It\u2019s just a cat!\", yet it only takes two minutes to scan. It's easier to throw cats away than to scan them for their owners.\r\n \r\nDEFRA \"encourage\" councils to scan, so the law should be changed so that councils must scan all cats and keep records. Councils need to respect our cats the way they do dogs.",
        "background": "Why do we feel that cats aren't as important as dogs? They are family pets too - they have one at No.10 Downing Street. The law must be changed and scanners supplied to all councils. They don't cost very much. Cats are part of a family and deserve to be returned home.\r\n \r\nPlease sign Gizmo's Legacy",
