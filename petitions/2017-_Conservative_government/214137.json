        "additional_details": "The average IFA placement is over 2.5 times the cost of an in house placement for a looked after child. Meaning that if I had enough room for another LAC at home I would save the government over \u00a3500000 in the next ten years. Surely some level of investment coupled with a contract for the foster carers would be a very sound investment in the long term. I am sure that every councils IFA bill far exceeds its bill for in house carers. Let's fix this problem.",
        "background": "I am a foster carer with over 12 years experience, having looked after over 45 children. \r\nI believe the government could help long serving foster carers to move to a larger home so that more children have access to good levels of care.",
