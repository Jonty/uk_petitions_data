        "additional_details": "Currently deterrents exist but the Government should require councils to prevent developers from building on land if they have illegally cut trees or habitat down. This would render the land valueless thus putting developers off doing it.\r\n\r\nTrees are not something that is easy to replace and therefore we need hard deterrents to stop it being worth a developer taking a chance on destroying them. There are currently laws in place but we feel that a financial burden isn't enough for killing trees that are hundreds of years old. This alone would be enough to stop most cowboy developers from destroying nature.\r\n\r\nPlace covenants on any land that developers illegally cut trees or habitat down",
