        "action": "Do not adopt the new road safety rules proposed by the EU in 2022.",
        "additional_details": "The EU have provisionally agreed new rules which are set to implement a speed limiting technology on to all vehicles sold after 2022. There are also plans to install a black box recorder in these vehicles to track location and speed. Regardless of the outcome of Brexit, the UK Department Of Transport has said that the UK will also implement these rules.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 the public voted to leave the EU because we do not want to be bound by it's rules any anymore.",
        "background": "The changes proposed by the EU modify the way a vehicle drives so drastically that I believe everyone would need to re-take a modernized driving test which of course nobody wants to do. Older people especially will struggle with technological changes and many people pay more to avoid a black box.",
