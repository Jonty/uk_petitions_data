        "additional_details": "According to the World Health Organisation pictorial messages are the most cost-effective way of educating and relaying health warnings as was the case for conveying the health risks of smoking. It worked. Some countries reported that even young children developed high awareness of the risks.The Government now needs to apply the same strategy to an even greater risk to society, ALCOHOL. Do away with the lame \"Drink Responsibly\" label and display images that make you \"think before you drink\".",
        "background": "Banning smoking in public places, prohibiting advertising and printing gruesome images of cancer on cigarette packets was one of the most significant public health acts this century. I'm calling for Government to do similarly with alcohol by printing pictorial images of the effects of alcohol.",
