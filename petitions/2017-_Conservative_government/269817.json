        "action": "Government to force all supermarkets to use paper bags for fruit and veg sales",
        "additional_details": "Anyone who has watched the BBC Blue Planet series with Sir David Attenborough, must want to reduce their use of plastic but supermarkets are not being forced to take their pollution seriously. If the government tells supermarkets that paper bags for shopping, like those used for decades in the USA are a better, safer, more environmentally sound basis on which to trade, then tax or fine them for not complying, will help consumers start to reduce their passive contribution to waste.",
        "background": "Plastic pollution is now a massive problem for the health of our people & our wildlife, environmental protection is needed, not by 2050 but NOW. Most people shop in supermarkets and single use plastic is a big factor in our waste, UK supermarkets can start now to reduce this by using paper bags",
