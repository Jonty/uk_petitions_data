        "additional_details": "The large amount of people with long term illness that have a background of overuse of antibiotics is quite shockingly apparent. This can contribute to a decline in overall health.\r\nHaving an advice slip issued could save time and give patients facts to consider. They may then take more responsibility for gut rebalance with good probiotic use, reduced sugar and less processed foods. It will also help them consider their choices when hoping for antibiotics before it is really needed in future.",
        "background": "We are all aware that overuse of antibiotics has become a big problem. GPs may not have the time to advise patients of the risks of reducing the power of these, the effects on gut bacteria health and how the gut may need extra care to rebalance after. This lack of knowledge needs addressing.",
