        "action": "Allow students to be registered at their home GP and uni GP at the same time.",
        "additional_details": "Students have reported leaving GPs in tears, after being told they cannot receive their prescribed medications, due to them being registered with a different GP which are oftentimes many miles away. On top of the rising levels of mental health issues students are facing daily, the government should be helping to reduce stress levels for students; this would be one step towards better mental health for students, and one step towards a better health system.",
        "background": "The fact that that students cannot be registered at their home and uni doctors simultaneously is causing stress and upset, which only adds to the general troubles they face daily, regarding mental health. The biggest problem is that students are unable to get prescribed meds when they need them.",
