        "additional_details": "Sunday Trading Laws serve no purpose and are damaging to the retail industry who are struggling to survive in a World where supermarket chains who employ tens of thousands of people are fighting for survival in an ever changing World where online suppliers are now dominating the marketplace for sales.\r\nPeople are working 6 and sometimes 7 days per week just to survive, so the opportunities to go to the Supermarket have reduced considerably.\r\nAllowing Supermarkets of any size to trade as early as 6am and remain open until 11pm on Sundays is more in-keeping with lifestyles of the 21st Century and the extra hours will help struggling supermarkets too.",
        "background": "Sunday Trading Laws are not in keeping with the World we live in today and should have been scrapped long ago.",
