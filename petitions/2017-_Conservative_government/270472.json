        "additional_details": "Similar systems have been implemented in other nations with some success. By offering this system, more people may be inclined to tidy their waste up and hopefully other peoples too. The bags would be available to take from beachside shops potentially boosting their trade. This would also cut down on costs for local councils as there would be less of a cleanup each day. Please consider this proposal and help us as a nation step forward in our efforts to clean up our act.",
        "background": "With more and more pollution destroying our environment we feel that more needs to be done by the general public. Adding the incentive of free parking at beaches across the UK in exchange for collecting waste off the beaches may help cut pollution down.",
