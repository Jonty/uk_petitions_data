        "additional_details": "Prayuth seized power in an illegal coup in 2014, overthrowing elected leader Yingluck Shinawatra. The junta has used dictatorial power to repress human rights, prosecute critics of military rule, ban political activity, censor media, and try dissidents in unfair military courts. \r\n\r\nPrayuth was also army chief in 2010 when the military launched a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. More than 90 people were killed and nearly 2,000 wounded.",
        "background": "Theresa May has invited Thai dictator Prayuth to the UK on June 20 and hopes to agree new arms deals.\r\nWe are UK-based Thais who want democracy and human rights. Please support our message to May: \r\nDon\u2019t welcome Prayuth to Britain. Tell him to restore Thai democracy. Don\u2019t sell arms to the junta.",
