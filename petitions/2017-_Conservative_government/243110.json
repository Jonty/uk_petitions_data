        "additional_details": "BBC refuse to provide equitable full coverage of Rangers. This impacts hundreds of thousands of Rangers Fans who are also licence payers. Rangers have over 40,000 season ticket holders and took circa 250,000 fans to Manchester for 2008 UEFA Cup Final. \r\n\r\nRangers Fans across Britain contribute anything from \u00a340m and over to BBC via the licence fee. It is not unreasonable for them to expect the same coverage from the state broadcaster as any other football club.",
        "background": "Follow Rangers is a Rangers shareholders group. \r\n\r\nLike many Rangers supporters we are seriously troubled by BBC Scotland\u2019s ongoing bias against our club. Recent events have led us to seek to petition Her Majesty\u2019s Government to intervene and debate this matter at Westminster.",
