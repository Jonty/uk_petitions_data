        "additional_details": "The current charge per prescription item is \u00a38 and set to raise at any time. For a full set of Inhalers, that's two preventative and one steroid inhaler, it can be up to \u00a324, the months us sufferers have an attack or catch flu/pneumonia you have to add steroid and antibiotic costs to this aswell. The winter months especially can see some sufferers spending upto 50 pounds just to survive comfortably with this condition. I urge everyone to sign and help us.",
        "background": "Myself and many of my friends suffer with asthma. Asthma is a life changing condition if you don't manage it properly. For me, it stops me laughing, running and general hard exercise due to coughing and wheezing when I do these things. Inhalers are expensive and they don't last long.",
