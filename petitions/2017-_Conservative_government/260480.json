        "action": "Adapt planning legislation to require that trees are moved rather than cut down.",
        "additional_details": "Positive results of moving the trees.\r\nMore established tree habitat preserved.\r\nLess isolated green spaces.\r\nReduced local flood risk due to less soil erosion and increased drainage on site.\r\nLarger trees can absorb more carbon dioxide, less illness, less pressure on the NHS.\r\nMental health benefits of greenspaces. \r\nWill encourage developers to incorporate existing trees, to use brown field sites or redevelop existing sites. \r\nWill boost the tree moving industry and provide jobs nationwide.",
        "background": "Currently developers plant saplings or semi-mature trees to off-set the loss of greenspaces. But these do not offer the same micro-environments as mature trees and we can not afford to wait for saplings to mature to reap the benefits for the climate. We should save as many mature trees as possible.",
