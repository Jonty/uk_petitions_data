        "background": "The NMC has been an independent regulatory body, funded by Nurse's & Midwives. \r\nThe main aim of the NMC is to protect patients, whilst regulating practice of Nurse\u2019s and Midwives.\r\nI feel the NMC should be funded by the tax-paying public and not by N&M's, like the Health & Safety Executive is.",
