        "additional_details": "The NMC recently decided to pay their staff an 11% annual pay rise & we are still fighting to get above 1%!\r\nIn September 2017, it was reported by the BBC News Online: Fourteen unions joined together to ask for the increase, (3.9%!!), saying pay has fallen by 15% since 2010, once inflation was taken into account. \r\nHow can the NMC justify a \u00a3120 annual retention fee, to an organisation, whose primary remit is to protect patients, & have got a massive pay rise?? \r\nI have colleagues using food banks!",
        "background": "The NMC has been an independent regulatory body, funded by Nurse's & Midwives. \r\nThe main aim of the NMC is to protect patients, whilst regulating practice of Nurse\u2019s and Midwives.\r\nI feel the NMC should be funded by the tax-paying public and not by N&M's, like the Health & Safety Executive is.",
