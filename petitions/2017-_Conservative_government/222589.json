        "additional_details": "Multinationals reduce their taxable profits by deducting interest payments on loans held by another subsidiary located in a low tax jurisdiction.\r\n \r\nThe Government should change tax regulation to prevent this and should: \r\n-disallow for tax purposes the company\u2019s interest expense on non-infrastructure borrowings and cap annual deduction to 1% of turnover; \r\n-disallow all non-UK intragroup recharges from subsidiaries/related parties above 5% of turnover.",
        "background": "Utilities companies\u2019 taxable profits are being drained by large foreign-owned multinationals. The profits subsidise their global monopolization and enrich the 1% high wealth investors. Government\u2019s tax revenue destined for health and welfare is being permanently lost.",
