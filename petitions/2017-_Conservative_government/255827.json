        "additional_details": "The U.K does not have to enforce these regulations because of brexit so why should we implement these Stalin style rules? Having black boxes could also implicate people in crimes they didn\u2019t commit and the speed limiting is not only a constriction of our freedom (solely in principle) but is also dangerous as it could prevent overtaking lorries and could cause more accidents. Zurich insurance and AA President Edmund King have denounced the new laws: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-6851299/amp/All-new-cars-fitted-mandatory-speed-limiters-2022-shock-EU-rules.html",
        "background": "The E.U plans to introduce speed limiters on all new cars from 2022. This will limit engine power when a driver goes over the speed limit and will prevent the driver from having full control of their vehicle. Black boxes will also become mandatory to log our location and speed at any given moment.",
