        "additional_details": "Since starting this year of university in Cardiff I have been issued \u00a3120 in parking fines for being a few minutes late or parking because there were no other spaces available. There are NO areas in which you can park for free that are within reasonable walking distance! Everywhere charges, even paying \u00a31 per day would still make money for the local government without taking away so much money for people who need to park every day in that area for education, work or leisure.",
        "background": "I have noticed that parking in the city for work and education is very expensive. For me to attend university for one week I have to pay \u00a340-60, I know that the councils and business' need to make money but this can't be justified for charging people upwards of \u00a38 per day for parking.",
