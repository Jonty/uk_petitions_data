        "additional_details": "The analysis by academics at the London School of Economics for the All Party Parliamentary Group on a Better Brexit for Young People said there was \"deep concern\" about the \"negative impact\" of last year's referendum vote.   The report based on the findings of 40 focus groups and a survey of more than 3,200 young people and adults found young people were concerned about the loss of opportunity as well as the impact on Britain's image as a tolerant, multicultural society.",
        "background": "The younger generation did not fully grasp the possibilities of the vote to leave the EU and the information by each side was wholly inadequate.  It is such a significant event, especially for the younger generation, that a second chance vote should be taken.  It is never too late.",
