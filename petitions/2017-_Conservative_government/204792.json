        "additional_details": "Now after 5 miscarriages I have been tested and found to have (aps) often known as sticky blood which means I would need a blood thinning injection daily if I was to become pregnant again. This could have saved my 5 babies\u2019 lives but because of this guidance, that unfortunately wasn\u2019t the case. I am hoping to get this changed so other women like myself can get the answers and save the heartbreak please help.",
        "background": "I have suffered 5 miscarriages in total, one being this year in 2017. I knew after the first two that something wasn\u2019t right and pushed and pushed for testing. Unfortunately the NHS guidelines currently say that women need to have had 3 consecutive miscarriages before being offered tests. ",
