Ending the sale of alcohol, both at bars and with meals, would not only help reduce sexual harassment, but help members stay alert and able to conduct business on behalf of the tax payer. Parliament is a place of work, and there is no need for alcohol to be served.",
        "background": "The issue of sexual harassment at work is a matter of concern, not least within Parliament. We believe Parliament should lead the way in ending this abuse. Many complaints are reported to arise in situations where alcohol is involved. Parliament is a place of work and there is no need for alcohol.",
