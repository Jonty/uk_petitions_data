        "additional_details": "Many consumers are currently prevented from putting their bank accounts and pensions to work in support of the transition to a low carbon economy. This also subjects them to elevated risks from stranded assets as larger investors increasingly divest from unsustainable businesses.\r\n\r\nWe believe there should be a legal requirement for all banks and pension providers to inform consumers where their money will be invested and to provide options for investment in sustainable businesses and funds.",
        "background": "Most UK bank/savings accounts and many pensions don't indicate where funds will be invested or provide the consumer with options that support environmentally sustainable investments. We believe this is wrong as it inhibits consumer action on climate change and exposes the consumer to risk.",
