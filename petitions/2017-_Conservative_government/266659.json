        "action": "Strict regulation of increased transport prices for holidays out of school term",
        "additional_details": "If a parent was to take their kids on holiday during school dates, we are fined, sent to court and treated like criminals. \r\nHowever, airlines and hotels alike, are allowed to target us specifically and charge incredible fees and prices just because we are booking in the time allocated to us by the government.\r\nThis is a highly unfair form of discrimination that I am surprised still exists. Cheaper alternatives include coach travel, which lasts for days & is not ideal especially with small kids.",
        "background": "As a parent, it is already a stressful job having children.\r\nOne thing all parents look forward to, is the ability to relax and travel abroad with our kids. However, airlines especially, have made this an uncomfortable expensive feat which always increases during school holidays.",
