        "additional_details": "Buying an electric car is not a sensible option for the thousands of UK residents without their own offstreet parking space, who might otherwise have opted for one. The solution is to improve availability of public charging to the point where this ceases to be a problem. The government must create a legally binding minimum quota and aim to exceed it: that the charging network should match the density in 2019 of petrol pumps in every region. Scrappage should also be launched for all ICE vehicles.",
        "background": "Lack of charging infrastructure is a major deterrent from the purchase of an electric vehicle. The UK Government must create a legally-binding scheme to expand coverage of the charging network to the entire country. Simultaneously, as many fossil-fuel burning cars as possible need to be scrapped!",
