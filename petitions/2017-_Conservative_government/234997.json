You pay so much money and hardly wear it also you are often restricted to looking plain (you hardly can wear jewellery makeup or have your hair dyed). The schools often encourage you to 'express yourselves' yet we are trapped in a plain and boring uniform. We have good enough clothes and rules as to what you can wear can easily be introduced if we remove school uniform. There is no point wasting money on uneeded extra clothes.",
