However, in my own situation and hearsay evidence from women in my age group this change would mean that the last year or few years before reaching SPa, some women would benefit financially albeit they may pay additional tax on the additional money not deducted by  NI contributions.",
        "background": "1995 and 2011 Pension Acts means thousands will have worked for over 50 years by the time they reach SPa. This petition ensures some financial compensation for this group of women by ceasing NI contribution for those women who would have made sufficient contribution before they reach SPa.",
