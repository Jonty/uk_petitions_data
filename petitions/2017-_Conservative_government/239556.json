        "action": "I think that children yr 7-9 should be able to have a 2.5 day weekend",
        "additional_details": "It is proven that children 13-19 (secondary school children) are the age group who take their lives the most and it is also proven that most of the time this is because of bullying or STRESS. With my petition I believe that the extra half day would allow children to have fun and work to high enough standerds. This is mostly aimed at 11-14/15 yr olds. The extra half a day also allows children to be active and another major rising problem is obesity which my solution can also conquer. This is also good for the teachers, who will have more time to work for better results Thank you.",
        "background": "In secondary school, children face much stress from h/w, changes in their life (physically and emotionally) and having the extra half day (finishing school at 12:00) would help so much. Children in yrs 7-9 need to be active and have fun and study at the same time- and I believe I have the solution.",
