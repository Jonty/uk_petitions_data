Some paying parents' salaries paid to partners account so liability orders are ineffective! Some ensure no collateral in their name. Children are suffering all over the UK!  Adjusting the paying parent's tax code can stop this. This saves time, effort and stress for all concerned; not to mention tax payer's money on non-compliant and  devious 'paying' parents who actively avoid paying maintenance.",

Deductions of earnings do not work for those who choose to frequently change employers before these are effective.",
