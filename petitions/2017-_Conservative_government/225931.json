        "additional_details": "To find alternative parking it is a two mile drive to circumvent the railway bridge. At off peak times this can be quite quick, but  in the late afternoon it can take more than 30 mins just to get past Bromley South Station and as much as 2hrs to get parked. Other areas of the Central Zone have different concerns and it is long overdue for there to be a public consultation to discuss traffic issues, as meetings have been cancelled in the past and local dense construction is imminently planned.",
        "background": "The parking off Bromley High Street is always busy and it is extremely difficult for residents to find a bay if they do not have off street parking. There are only 13 Residents' Bays to serve 3 Rds and flats in the High St. Metered parking is \u00a31.70 per hour and it is only possible to pay for 2hrs",
