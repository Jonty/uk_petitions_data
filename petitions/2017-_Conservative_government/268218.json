        "additional_details": "Behind every image is a child being abused. Perpetrators argue they\u2019re only looking but each image shared is a real child and the sharing of such encourages more abuse. Perpetrators should not be able to escape a prison sentence under ANY circumstances. It costs the police/cps and therefore the tax payer to bring these people before a judge. Innocent children are not being protected. I believe an automatic prison sentence would make perpetrators think again.",
