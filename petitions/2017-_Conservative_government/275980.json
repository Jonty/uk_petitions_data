        "additional_details": "Too many MP's have recently resigned their party whip and joined a different party or declared themselves independant. They no longer represent the constituents who elected them, so should be subject to a by-election in their constituency to allow voters to decide if they still wished them to represent them.",

If that MP then decides to leave their original party and join another one, or become an independant, they no longer represent the people who voted for them.",
