        "additional_details": "There are examples in the past which show that these sorts of taxes are just another way of extracting more money from the public. Rarely do they have the full desired effect on consumption.\r\nFurthermore, meat is not the leading cause of heart disease or global warming, thus it would make more sense to target those sectors.",
        "background": "Do not consider imposing additional taxes on meat products. Introducing a product specific tax will only serve to penalise the poor. Instead of reducing consumer choices, it would be more beneficial to educate the public about the impact on their health and environment.",
