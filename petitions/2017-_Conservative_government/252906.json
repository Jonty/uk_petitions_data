Please research the Single Transferable Vote (STV) as an example of how local elections can be more representive of political views. The current system has left us with labour or conservative parties and they have not been representive of our views and have left many in this country frustrated, angry and unheard",

Not based on their policies, I have been voting tactically as the first past the post voting system has not represented the changing and diverse views of this country, there are other voting systems which will allow new parties in.",
