        "additional_details": "This is inconsistent with support for tenants. The housing element for rental costs can be paid within weeks and people are allowed to work and still get the support. Before transferring to universal credit people could get help with mortgage interest and still do permitted work whilst receiving employment and support allowance, for example. https://www.gov.uk/support-for-mortgage-interest; https://www.gov.uk/housing-and-universal-credit",
        "background": "When people make a claim within universal credit for help with owner occupier housing costs (support for mortgage interest) there is a 39 week wait, 9 assessment periods. Also if they earn even 1 penny they cannot receive any help. Any help they do get is now a loan.",
