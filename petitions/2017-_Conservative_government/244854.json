        "action": "Raise Inheritance tax threshold from \u00a3325 for unwed people living together",
        "additional_details": "I.e. a couple lived together 50 years, he died, she had to sell up to pay the IHT,  there was  not enough left to provide her with a home. There are many people in this situation. Same applies for single people and siblings inheriting. Just \u00a3325 is so low now, it has been the same for decades. Most homes are at least that price or more, so that means the homes have to be sold leaving people homeless. Inheritance tax threshold  is now far too low for people not married, singles and siblings.",
        "background": "Many single people have lived together for years, only to find that on the partners death, the survivor is in danger of becoming homeless due to the rise in house prices, alone. It is now 2019, and \u00a3325k IHT  threshold has stayed the same low for decades. It is unfair that unweds have this worry",

For example, we're not sure whether you'd like to change inheritance tax for cohabiting couples only or for all people who live together.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for the threshold to be increased in line with house price increases since 2009, if that's something you'd like to happen. "
