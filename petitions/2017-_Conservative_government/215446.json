        "additional_details": "My father has been storing caravans (with no permanent structure) on a field on our farm for over ten years. He has had them there over ten years - and after that time, the council served an enforcement order 'out of time' but this has still escalated through the courts, to the point of them making a POCA confiscation order. We feel this is no different than the UK gov acting like a zimbabwean dictatorship - trying to take farmers lands when they feel like it.",
        "background": "Is it morally right that the UK government can allow local councils to use POCA - which was intended for arms dealers and drug dealers, to try and immorally seize farmers assets in response to minor planning infractions on greenbelt land? Sign here if you think this is immoral and plain wrong.",
