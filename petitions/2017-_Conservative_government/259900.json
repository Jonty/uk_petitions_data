        "additional_details": "While claiming it is taking steps to reduce carbon emissions, the government is also undertaking major new road-building schemes, which experience has repeatedly shown will only lead to more traffic. These schemes should be mothballed and their funding diverted to build and improve cycling infrastructure everywhere. Separating cyclists from traffic and pedestrians makes cycling a safer experience and will lead to fewer people choosing to drive, benefitting both public health and air quality.",
        "background": "Countries with a high prevalence of cycling often have one thing in common: an expansive network of bicycle paths and lanes separate from both roadways and footpaths. The UK is seriously behind and must do much more to make cycling an attractive choice for commuters.",
