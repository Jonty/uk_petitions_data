        "additional_details": "I played conkers as a nipper every Autumn and apart from some calcification of my knuckle just under my little finger from Stewart Brown who was a bit vicious it did me no lasting harm and didn't affect my eyesight.  I've got glaucoma but I am 99.9% sure that had nothing to do with playing conkers.  So let the kids play conkers and stop forcing them to wear goggles.  It's ridiculous and also I feel for the kids that can't afford goggles and feel excluded from the fun.",
        "background": "Please can we start a petition for this ridiculous thing where you can\u2019t even play conkers, you have to wear goggles. That is the biggest problem. You can\u2019t play conkers in England.",
