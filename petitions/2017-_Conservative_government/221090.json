        "additional_details": "Arriva don't respond to complaints and just keep getting away with doing nothing, leaving commuters in the north miserable and feeling powerless. They've had the franchise for 2 years and conditions have just gotten worse over this time. \r\n\r\nCommuters pay a lot of money for a service that isn't good enough. Strip this company of the franchise and put it back in public ownership, ran in the public interest with some sort of accountability.",
        "background": "Myself and thousands of other commuters face a daily struggle of getting where we need to be. The train timetables are useless because services are constantly cancelled or delayed meaning we can't plan ahead. Then the services that do run are horribly overcrowded.",
