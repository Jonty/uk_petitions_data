        "action": "Legislate for a referendum on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU",
        "additional_details": "In June 2016 the UK electorate voted by a majority to leave the EU. HM's Government and over 80% of MPs elected at the 2017 GE agreed to abide by the result and implement it. Now Parliament is in deadlock over the terms of our departure. A new referendum may be the only way to resolve the deadlock but it cannot be on the issue of membership, which has been settled. Any new referendum should only allow the public to choose between the Government's negotiated deal and exiting with no deal at all.",
        "background": "The UK's EU membership was settled \"for a generation\" on 23rd June 2016 when a majority of the electorate voted to leave the EU. Parliament is now in deadlock over how to implement that decision and a new referendum may be the only way to resolve this crisis if Article 50 is extended beyond 12.04.19",
