Electric school bus motors\r\nproduce zero emissions. This means cleaner, healthier air while\r\nkids wait to board the bus & inside the cabin.",

We\u2019re asking the government to ensure the vehicles carrying our children to school don\u2019t add to the already harmful levels of air pollution.",
