        "background": "UK commits to UN target that each country gives 0.7% of GNI (Gross National Income) for Overseas Aid. Only 6 (inc UK) of the 28 participants achieve target - average for all is 0.30% - (OECD 2015). UK pays c10% of total - ie \u00a314bn of \u00a3140bn. As NHS is in need, \u00a37bn could save it.
