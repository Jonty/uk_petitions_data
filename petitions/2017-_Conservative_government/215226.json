        "additional_details": "With alot of deaf Schools closing and Deaf Hearing impaired Children now being taught in mainsteam Schools with Classroom support.\r\nSocially they are being affected..\r\nIts a lonely place for Deaf Children Socially.\r\nWith a huge shortage of interpreters and some Deaf adults having to wait almost a week for support. I feel Children will enjoy sign language enough to encourage them to feel as passionate as myself and gain qualifications.\r\nLets make a bridge bring hearing and deaf together.",
        "background": "Being a child of Deaf  Parents I am deeply passionate about having Sign Language involved in Schools.\r\nWith a population of 11 million Chilren Deaf or Hearing impaired in our Country I feel it would be of huge benefit to teach Sign language at a young age..",
