Such analysis was developed and documented extensively then offered to Minister of State for the Constitution, via an MP, but not apparently felt useful to HMG. It might have solved many problems since 2016. Might it yet?",
        "background": "In 2017 some students boasted of voting twice. Only 10% doing so might have swung 15+ seats. Careful examination of marked registers and available data could identify credible cases. Sampling mathematics offers reliable estimates of the total. Maybe only 43% of voters could manage 48% of votes.",
