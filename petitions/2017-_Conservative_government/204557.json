        "action": "Ban the sale and use of glue traps as a method of pest control.",
        "additional_details": "The use of glue traps is opposed by the RSPCA and PETA.\r\nSpecies trapped are too wide to list but include all rodents considered pests, wildlife, songbirds, owls and domestic pets. The RSPCA   canvass for their use to be restricted to professional pest control bodies but I believe that their use by anybody, professional or otherwise is unacceptable. If you are still in any doubt I urge you to view some of the video footage of trapped animals on glue traps and please reconsider, thank you.",
        "background": "Glue traps cause unacceptable levels of suffering and are  indiscriminate in the species they trap, wild animals, birds and even pets. Trapped animals have been known to tear patches of fur out, break bones and gnaw off their own limbs in a desperate effort to escape, this can last for days.",
