        "additional_details": "You should sign this petition if you believe that the future is in the hands of our youth and if you wish for the future generation to sustain a healthy government and economy. Slight changes to the school timetables could reduce the irritation of children and allow them to fulfil their full potential. Some children cannot consume their daily calories as they have to rush to leave the house in the morning, therefore, they come to school grumpy and not able to learn.",
        "background": "It is scientifically proven that children are more alert at 10am. We believe that children should come to school fully awake and ready for the day of learning ahead of them. Children find it difficult to wake up and get ready and that is one of the reasons that they dislike attending school.",

We understand that you're concerned about children starting school early, but we're not sure what you'd like the Government to do.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government to make it law for schools in England to start at 10am, if that's what you'd want to happen."
