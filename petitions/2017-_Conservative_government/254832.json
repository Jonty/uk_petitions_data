Not allowed within flats. \r\n\r\nPeople should be allowed to be given the opportunity to test and create in small quantities to see if products they wish to promote as a business plan are viable or just be able to enjoy a hobby of theirs.",

It is understandable that spirits are more flammable than the current legally permitted alcohol but people should be allowed the opportunity to create small quantities of spirits recreationally.",
