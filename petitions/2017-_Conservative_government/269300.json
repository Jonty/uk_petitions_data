Cancel Brexit\r\n\r\n2.Proceed with the terms of the Withdrawal agreement as agreed with the EU.\r\n\r\n3.Exit the EU with no deal.\r\n\r\nThe second referendum will take place one month after the first, the public with be able to vote on the top two from the first referendum. The outcome of the second referendum be binding, and the result acted on 3 months after. \r\n\r\nLet's end this deadlock and make a decision collectively so we can move forward.",
        "background": "I believe that the current mechanism on deciding on the outcome of Brexit is fundamentally flawed & in its current form can never achieve a way forward. \r\n \r\nThe outcome should be taken away from the hands of politicians that understandably have to think about their party, career or legacy.",
