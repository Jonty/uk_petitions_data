        "additional_details": "Since this behaviour is already illegal in the stock market, this change to the law should not unduly harm the free market.\r\n\r\nWith economic and cyber conflicts of increasing relevance, it is appropriate that acts of economic and cyber treason should be added to the acts of military treason currently within the law. \r\n\r\nPetitioner is aware that there is no death penalty for felony treason and nothing in this petition asks for its introduction or application.",
        "background": "\"Bear raiding\", or \"shorting and distorting\", a private company by manipulating its decisions or spreading adverse rumors while shorting it is already illegal. We call for this same protection to be extended to the nation as a whole via an extension to the laws on felony treason.",
