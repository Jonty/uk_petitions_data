        "action": "Eliminate the use of black plastic in food packaging.",
        "additional_details": "It is misleading for a manufacturer to label the black plastic as recyclable when our recycling plants cannot detect it. To eliminate its use will make recycling information clearer to the consumer. \r\nUsing a different colour will substantially increase the amount of plastic packaging which can be recycled through our household waste collections.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/content/recyclability-black-plastic-packaging-0",
        "background": "Most recycling plants use optical sorting systems which cannot detect the black plastic against the conveyor belts. This means the packaging ends up as landfill or incinerator waste.\r\nWhen manufacturers use recyclable plastic trays they should be forced to choose a colour suitable for recycling.",
