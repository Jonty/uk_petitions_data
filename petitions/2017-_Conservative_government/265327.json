The financial commitments are open ended.\r\n3.We have to accept and follow laws they pass that damage our interests.\r\n4. We cannot sign any trade deals with other countries.\r\n5.Under the Agreement we might be stuck in the EU a total of 78 months.\r\n6.The Irish backstop splits the UK up.\r\n7. The Withdrawal Agreement is legally binding and the Political declaration a possible customs partnership.\r\n8 It prolongs business uncertainty. Is an unbelievably bad Agreement for the UK and a great one for the EU.",
        "background": "The EU offered treaty (Withdrawal agreement) was put to the House of Commons on the 16th January 2019, it was rejected by 432 to 202 initially and twice since. It is obvious Parliament have rejected it outright. It subjugates the UK peoples and is also wholly unacceptable to us the undersigned.",
