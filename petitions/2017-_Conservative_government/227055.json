        "additional_details": "Alongside a threat of violence, emotional & financial barriers make leaving an abusive home difficult. Escaping requires meticulous planning and preparation. Someone may need time off work to move without their partner knowing or they may simply not be able to afford to escape. \r\n\r\nIf the UK follows the example set by New Zealand and the Philippines, in giving domestic violence victims paid leave to escape their violent household, we could help before it's too late. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.co.nz/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/26/new-zealand-paid-domestic-violence-leave-jan-logie",
        "background": "An average of 2 women a week are killed in the UK. The majority are killed at home, often at the hands of a partner. One of the most dangerous times for a victim of domestic abuse\u00a0is when they try to leave. In giving victims help with their economic situation, we could save so many.",
