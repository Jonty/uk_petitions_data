        "action": "Remove fees for basic RGN nurse training and teach them in nursing schools.",
        "additional_details": "Since the schools of nursing were removed from our teaching hospitals the number of people coming into nursing has declined. In 1990 student nurses made up a THIRD of the NHS workforce, once Project 2000 was introduced the quality and number of student nurses steadily slipped.\r\nNursing at degree level entry means the NHS has lost thousands of potentially fabulous nurses because those that want to nurse cannot afford to train. \r\nWe need excellent basic nursing care skills before we need a degree!",
        "background": "The NHS is unable to recruit sufficient nurses and many potential nurses are put off by university / diploma debts. \r\nIncrease the student nurse uptake by paying a basic salary and contract them to work for the trust that trained them for 6 months once qualified.",
