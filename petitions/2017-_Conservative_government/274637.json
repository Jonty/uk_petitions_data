In the EU the UK is the leader in giving subsidies to fossil fuels, according the European commission. It found \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.5bn) a year in support for fossil fuels in the UK, significantly more than the \u20ac8.3bn spent on renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThis isn't good enough and our taxes should not be used to fund the destruction of life on our planet.",
