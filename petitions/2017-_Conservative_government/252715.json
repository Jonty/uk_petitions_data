The arrangment being forced on the UK is a financial-punishment which will take many decades to recover from, and out wieghs the loss of trade from a no-deal. We need time to plan and arrange an exit from the EU that does not rely on EU agreements.",
        "background": "Theresa May has wasted nearly 3-years in fake negotiations with a block of countries that have openly declared economic-war on the British public's wish to leave their Franco-German self-preservation society. Brexiters still want us to honour the referendum, but only once we have a plan to do so.",
