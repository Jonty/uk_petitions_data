        "additional_details": "Moving this holiday will advantage both individuals and the economy.  When Easter Falls late in April, there tends to be a cluster of 4 public holidays, (Good Friday, Easter Monday, Mayday and Whitsun), all  within 6 weeks.  Businesses can suffer with people taking of time off between the days, with individuals finding it hard to accommodate childcare.  There is a general consensus that no-one should forget what happened, so the way to ensure this would be a public holiday on the actual day.",
        "background": "The Mayday public holiday is for most people, just a chance for a day off and has very little significance.  Mayday marks the beginning of summer, although summer doesn't start until June.\r\nThe holiday was created in 1978 and falls on the 1st Monday of May and not necessarily on the day itself.",
