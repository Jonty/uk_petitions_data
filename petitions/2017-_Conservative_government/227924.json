        "additional_details": "We have a working line German Shepherd who we cherish. \r\n\r\nAfter 12 months of positive, reward-based training, his progress plateaued. \r\n\r\nBear is a highly prey driven dog. Given the chance, he would choose to chase livestock and would fail to recall from other dogs. \r\n\r\nWe enlisted the help of a highly qualified trainer and Bear has gone through a complete transformation. \r\n\r\nIt would be a travesty to see them banned but we believe training should be compulsory before being able to use an e-collar.",
        "background": "I believe that used correctly, e-collars are a valuable tool in training some dogs out of certain behaviours. They are not a golden ticket in dog training. I would like there to be compulsory training upon purchase as minimum requirement to their use.",
