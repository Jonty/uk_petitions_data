        "additional_details": "Many studies reveal that children who torture or kill animals are likely to show violence towards people when they grow up. Re-classifying animal abuse will aid law enforcement and the FBI in quantifying and reporting incidents of animal abuse.\r\n\r\nPlease show your support for a UK National Animal Abuse Register by signing this petition. If you are a UK citizen you can also ask your MP to support this initiative by contacting them at https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps",
        "background": "In The UK, abuse against animals is increasing dramatically and very rarely are offenders, when found guilty, barred from keeping or being involved with animals. I ask that it becomes law that an Animal Abuse Register is brought into place and that all offenders are placed on this register.",
