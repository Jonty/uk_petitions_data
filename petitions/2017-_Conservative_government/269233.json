        "action": "Justice for the Gurkhas. Equal pension and settlement rights to adult children.",
        "additional_details": "The Gurkhas were given the settlement rights only in 2009 after a long campaign and court battles. However their children, majority of whom were over the age of 30 were excluded. If they were given the right to settle earlier in the 50s to 90s, their children would have been able to join as under 18 minors or would have been born in the UK & a British citizen by birth. \r\n\r\nThe Gurkhas receive only a tiny fraction of pension compared to their British counterparts and living under poverty in the UK.",
        "background": "The Gurkhas suffered historical injustice even though they showed the bravest of bravery, fought wars and gave blood, sweat and tears for the British government in the last two centuries including the First and Second World wars, Falkland islands, Iraq and Afghanistan.",
