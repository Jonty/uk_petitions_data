        "action": "Boris Johnson needs to show the public his collection of buses",
        "additional_details": "Many claim that Boris lied about his pastime fancy and seemed to struggle with explaining his personal hobby. If Boris can prove he does make buses depicting the faces of happy people as he elegantly describes in the interview then he may sway the general public into believing he is a 'normal' every day individual. If he refuses to share his collection of buses then that would raise a more interesting question.",
        "background": "Public opinion surrounding the next Prime Minister of England is varied. We need a leader who is honest, reliable and of sound mind. In an interview with Talk Radio, Mr Johnson was asked what he does to switch off away from politics, his reply of paining buses was intriguing and interesting.",
