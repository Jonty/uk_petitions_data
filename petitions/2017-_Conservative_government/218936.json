        "action": "Make it a fineable offence to cross tidal roads outside of safe crossing times.",
        "additional_details": "Figures from the Ministry of Defence in 2017 show a sea rescue costs approximately \u00a31,900, while an air rescue by the RAF costs more than \u00a34,000.\r\n\r\nThis petition relates to all tidal roads and causeways in the UK.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, would like to see drivers who ignore safe crossing times on tidal roads/causeways and require rescue be fined for their actions, and for this money to be invested in the RNLI.",
        "background": "Every year dozens of people ignore the safe crossing times at the Holy Island causeway and are rescued by the RNLI. This not only risks lives and uses a service that could be required elsewhere, but also costs the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds each year which could be avoided.",
