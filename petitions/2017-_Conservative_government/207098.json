        "action": "The UK stays in the customs union as part of the Brexit process.",
        "additional_details": "Most MPs support the customs union being retained but Brexiteers want it removed in order to enable this country to negotiate trade deals with other countries. Not having a trade deal does not prevent members of the union from trading with other countries. Germany for example trades a great deal with China as we do with the USA. Tariffs have to be paid in some circumstances but that does not stop trading.",
        "background": "The UK is a trading nation and free movement of our goods within the EU is critical. Being a member does not prevent the UK from trading with other countries - we do so now. It simply means that tariffs have to be paid in certain circumstances. It would also solve the Ireland impasse at stroke.",
