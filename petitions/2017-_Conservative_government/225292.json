        "additional_details": "For this reason we believe that the Government MUST declare the EU Referendum held in 2016 null and void! We therefore demand that all negotiations on leaving the EU should immediately be stopped and that the EU Referendum be re-run and this time to ensure that previously excluded groups; British expats living in Europe, and European expats living in UK, are given the right to vote in said new EU membership referendum. This must be a constitutionally correct EU-Referendum, NOT merely advisory!",
        "background": "Given that the Electoral Commission has found 'significant evidence' of joint working between Vote Leave and another campaign group, BeLeave, this now compromises the principles of fair Elections and brings the result of the EU Referendum into disrepute. This shames our country.",
