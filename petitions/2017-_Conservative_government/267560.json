        "additional_details": "The viewership for the world cup final (shown on freeview) peaked at 8.3 million. Contrast this with average viewing figures of 550,000 for the cricket world cup games on payview. The England vs USA Female Worldcup semi-final (available on freeview) was watched by 11.7 million.\r\n\r\nThe low visibility of cricket has impacted on participation and interest levels. To safeguard the future of the sport, it is essential that culturally important cricket events like the world cup are shown on freeview.",
