It claims it is justified in doing so because those involved in one are more likely to be involved in another accident later on. \r\n\r\n\"By having a non-fault claim our customers fall into a category that we see as a higher risk to insure.\"\r\n\r\n\u2018We rate on the fact an incident has occurred, whether they have claimed or not.\u2019\r\n\r\nOriginal article:\r\nhttps://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-3052191/How-drivers-insurance-costs-soar-no-fault-accidents-don-t-claim.html\r\n\r\nIt has to stop. The industry needs tighter regulations against this kind of profiteering, as that's what I, and a LOT of drivers see it as",

They told me that it was because I had notified them March last year that someone had smashed my windscreen. I did not make a claim. They had classed the notification as an 'at fault claim'.
