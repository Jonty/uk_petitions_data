        "additional_details": "Only allowing public use of fireworks on select dates (for example, Bonfire night, New Years Eve & Chinese New Year) would really help for animals & people who suffer from the fireworks. It would mean they have time to plan & be more calm & on other nights when it\u2019s professional displays only, people will know when the fireworks will go off & when they will stop, so it\u2019s not much of a fright.",
        "background": "Almost all animals suffer from the loud bangs from fireworks & can cause them to have health problems. As well as that, fireworks can cause stress to PTSD sufferers & people who generally have a fear of them.",
