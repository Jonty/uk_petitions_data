        "additional_details": "The concept is unfair.  Cars and vans have to confirm yet black cabs have a 15 year amnisty. Coaches that produce just 4% of the pollution are being persecuted . New coaches are \u00a3200,000 and this cost will be passed onto children at school who want a trip. The cost of lorries delivering will increase , and Tourism in London will die due to people not visiting.. as for people who live in the circular roads, the poor will be taxed \u00a312.50 per day just to drive!",
        "background": "The ULEZ extension is persecuting people who live in London. It\u2019s a poor people\u2019s tax. It is also biased agaist commercial enterprise like Trucks & Coaches yet black cabs have a 15 year amnesty.  The whole concept is unfair as it does not include river or air traffic.",
