        "action": "Reform the sentencing laws for manslaughter and murder",
        "additional_details": "Manslaughter ranges from one punch to someone stabbing someone who is unarmed multiple times in a sustained and brutal attack. Serving five years of ten in prison is not enough, instead of shutting prisons, there should be enough to allow violent offenders to serve a whole term sentence. Criminals these days know how to play the parole board knowing they may be able to go home halfway through their sentence even though they have taken a life. This situation does not deter violent people from carrying or arming themselves with a knife and ultimately killing someone.",
        "background": "There should be no half sentences and life should mean life for violent and serious crimes. The broad term used for manslaughter needs to be addressed and reformed, there has to be better sentencing to provide justice for the victim and their families when someone has been violently killed.",
