You have to pay for a bus pass to even get to work which is 200 pound a term for an adult pass, prescriptions are not free because your not in education but technically we are. Life would be so much easier if we could drive but we can't afford to learn to do that either or take on an insurance per month at \u00a3170 then I help my mom with board too. We are expected to work as hard as the other employees when there on \u00a37+",
