        "additional_details": "My intention with this petition is that if self examination is introduced to the health/sex Education curriculum then self checking would become part of our daily lives and routines like washing/cleaning teeth/wearing deodorant. ..whilst in the shower we check ourselves. Right now we don\u2019t all do it because we weren\u2019t taught too from a young age and it\u2019s not routine. This needs to change and be taught in schools, early detection does save lives it is so important to know your body!",

Teaching to routinely self examine the correct way in this lesson would bring body awareness and in turn early detection",
