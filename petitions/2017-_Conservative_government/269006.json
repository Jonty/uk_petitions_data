However, had I been in receipt of these benefits (if we had been married) and then I lived with another person, these benefits would have been withdrawn, because now the government would consider me to being 'living together as though married'.\r\nThis contradiction and unfair treatment has to end.\r\nPlease sign the petition.",

He was my next of kin and I was his. When he took ill 8 yrs before he died, I cared for him, as in 'sickness and in health'. \r\nWe were committed!",
