        "action": "Ban the removal of non farmed fresh water course fish for use as food.",
        "additional_details": "As a lifelong angler along with many other friends we have noticed many rivers,ponds lakes ect around Lincolnshire and Yorkshire have started to see a large decline in fish populations.\r\nTo counteract and help towards this we aim to start this petition to stop humans taking course fish from any waters unless specifically bred for the table for the period of 10 years with then a revue on the progress.\r\nWe feel this gives fish stocks a slightly better chance to help halt the decline in many venues.",
        "background": "Fresh water fish are now on the decline due a number of reasons from Cormarants, Otters and people from Cultures where removal and eating of course fish is acceptable.",
