        "additional_details": "If the majority of the United Kingdom was to swap to computer-based examinations, this would reduce the long-term costs of paper, which is much better for the environment. Furthermore, it may result in deserving students earning a more accurate grade, as it would be the quality of their answer that is being assessed. In the growing world of technology, we think this is the most beneficial for students sitting there exams.",
        "background": "Any student who has sat an exam would agree that handwriting an exam can be very time-consuming and even painful -during GCSE\u2019s some students had up to 4 exams per day ! This would have hugely affected the quality and amount if written work as a student can produce and therefore impact grades.",
