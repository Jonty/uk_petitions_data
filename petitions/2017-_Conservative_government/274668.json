        "additional_details": "In May, the UK parliament declared a climate emergency. Yet, recycling facilities are still not available for pedestrians in high traffic areas of Belfast city centre and many cities across the UK. For citizens to be empowered to make environmentally friendly choices, there should be basic recycling facilities available in high traffic areas of city centres. Providing widespread recycling facilities in the city centre will enable us to be more eco-friendly in our everyday lives.",
        "background": "Currently there are hardly any recycling bins for pedestrians in Belfast city centre. Everyday too much waste is sent to landfill from the city centre. This could be avoided if more recycling bins were installed in busy areas. There should be a recycling bin alongside every landfill waste bin.",
