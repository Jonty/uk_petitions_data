        "action": "Hold a referendum on HS2. Give the public the vote like we had for Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "Having undertaken a great deal of research into the pro's & con's of this project, attended HS2 facilitated meetings, researched the impact nationally that this will bring I can't help but feel that even though Royal assent has been given its not to late to allow the public to vote on whether this project should go ahead. This country already has a good railway system which with investment can be improved using existing lines. The HS2 project is a national issue so should be decided by us all.",
        "background": "HS2 is expected to cost \u00a350+billion, not to mention the mess and impact it will make on our countryside, wildlife and nature. At present our NHS, emergency services, social services, affordable housing is in disarray. We were given a referendum on Brexit which will affect us all so why not HS2?",
