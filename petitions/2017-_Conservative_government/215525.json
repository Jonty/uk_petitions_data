        "additional_details": "Glasgow City Council are putting their hourly rate up from this August from \u00a32.51 per hour to \u00a34 then \u00a35 from next year onwards.  This is going to hit working parents hard and low income families and although there might be extra free hours added to 3+4 year olds free entitlement this will have a huge effect on parents with 1 or more children and for those with children who are under 3.  People are trying to make ends meet and this increase is due to insufficient funds to cover free school meals for primary 4 children and to help support their 2020 vision of 30 free hours for 3+4 year olds.",
