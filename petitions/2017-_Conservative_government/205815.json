        "action": "Repeal the decision to exclude animal sentience from the Brexit Bill",
        "additional_details": "The only benefactors of this decision are vivisectionists, farmers, slaughter houses and other institutions and companies where they require the suffering of animals to go unrecognised. This can not be allowed to happen and we the UK citizens strongly encourage the UK government to repeal this decision and uphold our countries stance on high animal welfare standards and animal rights.",
        "background": "Animals be them livestock or domestic have long been recognised in the UK as having the ability to feel and experience pain and fear. The governments decision (won by a slim majority) does not benefit UK citizens nor is what the majority want. We as a country should be evolving not devolving.",
