        "additional_details": "There is a current legal definition of abuse and I would hope that most professionals have adequate training in recognizing domestic abuse and violence of all kinds and be able to recognize incidents that are illegal. \r\nI propose that there be a legal consequence if these professionals involved with domestic abuse cases ignore incidents and in severe cases where these incidents lead to extreme failures and were not reported there should be job consequences, fines and imprisonment. Abuse is abuse.",
