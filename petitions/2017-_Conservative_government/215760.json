        "additional_details": "I would like to make it LAW that restaurants, bars, hospitals, and straws attached on cartons of juice in the supermarket are all paper. For example in the US many industries were forced to look for eco friendly solutions and now use Aardvark paper straws as they are the only paper straws on the market that are made in the USA, 100 percent FDA food-grade approved, biodegradable and compostable.\r\nApproximately one million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals each year are killed because of plastic.",
        "background": "Seaborn plastic trash is on track to outweigh fish in our oceans by 2050.\r\nStraws are not the only cause, however they are a massive contributor.\r\nStraws are small and slimline and are perfect size to be consumed by fish and entangle marine life. Campaigns are just not enough for EVERYONE to change.",
