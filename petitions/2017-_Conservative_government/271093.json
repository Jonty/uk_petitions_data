        "additional_details": "I have lost quite a few friends down to car drivers being distracted and just changing lanes and not noticing the biker in the next lane. If a car driver is made to do the cbt they can then feel how open you feel with no security of a metal frame around you. If this can save a few lives then surely this has got to be worth making part of the uk driving test. Change needs to come. Car drivers are far to easily distracted by phones and music and the safety of their metal box surrounding them!",
        "background": "If drivers are made to do a cbt they can then feel how it is to be riding a motorcycle on the road and how vulnerable you become. People will then become more aware to look for bikers when they are driving along. To many bikers are killed due to people in cars not looking and pulling out.",
