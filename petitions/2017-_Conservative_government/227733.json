        "additional_details": "We were taught how to give CPR and how to deal with choking when we were discharged from the neonatal unit as Johnny had been ill. This was part of their discharge procedure, however other parents are not taught this before leaving the hospitals. \r\n\r\nOur antenatal classes did not teach this basic skill either and all parents should be given the right on knowing what to do in an emergency.",
        "background": "As it stands parents have to pay to undergo a course to learn how to give CPR and how to deal with choking in infants and babies. \r\n\r\nAfter losing our son, we believe that no parent should have to pay to learn this skill.",
