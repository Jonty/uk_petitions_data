        "action": "Form a dedicated recovery/response unit on the QE2 bridge/dartford crossing/A282",
        "additional_details": "With revenue of 160 million pounds last year surely a response team can be budgeted in to quickly remove stranded vehicles on the run up stretches north and south of the crossing as well as the A282 and move them to a safe place instead of waiting hours for recovery from the drivers own breakdown service or insurer. The loss to the economy must run into millions of pounds a year and creates havoc and misery for users and drivers in the surrounding areas",
        "background": "Every day users of the QE2 bridge/ Dartford crossing have to endure horrendous queues as a result of stranded vehicles blocking the carriageway through breakdown or accident . Let's have a dedicated response team to get the lanes open asap",
