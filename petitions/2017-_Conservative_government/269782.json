        "additional_details": "There are hundreds, thousands of people within the UK aged under 25 who live with dependants and have rent and bills to pay. A person's age should not impede their remuneration for the same level of work as someone who is simply older than them. I believe the time has come to stop the segregated, illogical pay gap and give people the pay they deserve.",
        "background": "No matter your age, the cost of living is still the same. The difference in minimum wage between those aged 18 and those aged 25 & over is currently \u00a32.06. This increase in wage for those aged under 25 would make a considerable difference in their lives.",
