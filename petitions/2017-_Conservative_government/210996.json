        "additional_details": "I worked at Hereward FM (Now Heart) in the 90's which was truly local and based in the centre of the city. I have also worked at BBC Cambs, both of these stations used to focus heavily on the city but both have now withdrawn from the city.\r\nConnect does not even try to fulfil a local remit and does not broadcast from the city - it is in Kettering.\r\nPeterborough, one of the fastest growing cities in the UK, needs a radio station that is forced to be based in the city and focus only on the city.",
        "background": "Peterborough is one of the fastest growing cities in the country and does not have a radio station that broadcasts from the city.\r\nHeart has moved to Cambridge, Connect broadcasts from Kettering and rarely mentions the city and BBC Cambs is based in Cambridge and largely ignores the city.",
