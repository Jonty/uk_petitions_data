        "additional_details": "With just 12.9% covered in wooded area, the UK is far more deforested than the average of European countries (The Institute of Environmental Science).\r\n\r\nBecause the amount of woodland being planted is well below target levels - 1,500 hectares in 2017, and 800 in 2016 (The Forestery Commission) - the UK is likely suffering from net deforestation as land is cleared for developments.\r\n\r\nIf Brazil will not accept our \u00a310 million donation to help the Amazon, it should be spent reforesting the UK.",
        "background": "A \u00a310 million donation from the UK to restore Amazon rainforests was turned down, with Brazilian officials quoted as saying it should be used \u201cto reforest Europe\u201d instead.\r\n\r\nBritain should set an example to other countries, and do just that by investing in forests and woodland in the UK.",
