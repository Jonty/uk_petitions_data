        "additional_details": "Parents pay an average of over \u00a36,600 per year for a part-time nursery place, which is often insufficient hours for a small business owner.  \r\n\r\nThere were 5.7 million SMEs in the UK in 2018, that\u2019s over 99% of all businesses. \r\n\r\nIn many families it doesn\u2019t make financial sense for both parents to work. Making childcare a taxable allowance would help to ease the pressure created by childcare costs, and be particularly beneficial for SMEs run by women who often shoulder the majority of childcare.",
        "background": "In the UK childcare cannot be classed as a taxable expense. This holds many small businesses back from growth, particularly those owned by women. \r\n\r\nMillions of businesses could generate higher revenue with adequate childcare.",
