        "additional_details": "We should make stability a priority for housing. Temporary accommodation effects our kids. They need permanent housing. Some of these mothers have run from domestic violence and are now lost in the system of temporary accommodation. What chance do these kids have? Their mental health, self-esteem and education is effected due to not being in an area long enough. Some children wait months to get a placement. Vulnerable women and children should not be in temporary accommodation.",
        "background": "Local authorities must prioritise families and give them permanent housing, not temporary accommodation. Stability starts at home. How can these children have a chance by moving home to home, area to area, changing schools and friends? It\u2019s confusing for a child and mentally damaging. It must stop. ",
