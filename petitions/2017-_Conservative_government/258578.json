        "additional_details": "The main argument against legalisation is that the new super strength \u2018skunk\u2019 weed, available in the UK, potentially causes mental health problems. Therefore I have found a brilliant solution to stop the weed from hell melting the minds of our kindred. Just don\u2019t produce/distribute skunk weed! If cannabis is legalised the government can control it. They will grow it, sell it and tax it. So if the government don\u2019t want skunk weed, don\u2019t grow skunk weed. Instead only grow natural safe cannabis.",
        "background": "The laws on cannabis are changing all over the world and I think most people agree that eventually the UK will follow. So why wait? By setting a time limit it forces the government to act. It\u2019s time for change, it\u2019s time for legalisation.",
