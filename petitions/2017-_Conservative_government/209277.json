        "additional_details": "In my eyes an ideal system would be to have these petitions firstly carry on as they are; proceeding to go to debate if they hit 100,000 signatories, have the non-binding debate in parliament as is at the moment and THEN, after that debate, have all present Commons MPs vote on forming the petition into an official parliamentary motion that is then brought to the Commons Chamber.\r\n\r\nThis will create for a more direct and transparent democracy which I would hope for the government to support.",
        "background": "Currently petitions from this website have no legislative effect, they are merely debated and then left in the dust. To be a more transparent democracy this should be changed such that these public parliamentary petitions may be formed into motions and potentially into law.",
