Government have a duty to protect the public & reform with a single free tribunal & more powers & a new regulation/law with a legal duty for complaint bodies to obtain all records/evidence in all complaints, with the ability to fine across our public services if they fail/abuse/breach data law & withhold records. End the era of self-regulation of complaint bodies due to conflict of interests as funded by industry",
