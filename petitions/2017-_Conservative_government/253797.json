        "additional_details": "Fish prices have increased by more than 30% in the past 12 months and have risen more sharply in the past few weeks. Partially due to the weak value of the pound, EU regulations on quotas, pulse fishing and demand, to name but a few. Alongside this potato prices have been at an all time high for the past 12 months due to the extreme weather conditions last year. This industry is worth millions to the UK economy and must be protected to save the industry and Nations favourite dish.",
        "background": "The Nation's favourite dish is under pressure from huge increases in the costs of core ingredients. Over the past 12 months some key costs have increased by over 40%. If action is not taken soon, fish and chips could become a dish of the past. Removing VAT will help protected a National treasure.",
