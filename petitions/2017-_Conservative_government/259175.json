        "additional_details": "There may be some instances where artificial lawns are useful e.g. in schools yards with heavy use. But it\u2019s frequently increasing use by people (e.g. cover their back garden) is hugely damaging to the environment and incredibly short sighted. People may be unaware of the enivronmental impact. It should be regulated and subject to planning permission to ensure its use is maintained at low levels and only where essential.",
        "background": "The use of artificial lawns has grown significantly in recent years. Whilst providing a convenient solution to some open spaces, it\u2019s manufacture significantly increases carbon omissions, reduces the environment for natural wild life and will take potentially thousands of years to breakdown.",
