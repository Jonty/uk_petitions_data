        "additional_details": "Example: The Sun, 21st October - \"Brussels: UK's 600,000 benefit tourists is no problem\". Correction published later - \"There is no evidence of 600,000 'benefit tourists' in the UK. Neither has the European Commission said this would be no problem\".\r\n\r\nIf the regulator has the power to insist that clarifications and corrections are published at least as prominently as the offending article then this will encourage newspaper editors to exercise better judgement, and raise awareness among the public when a newspaper seeks to influence public opinion dishonestly or incorrectly.",
        "background": "Our newspapers are some of the least trusted yet most influencial in the world. Clarifications and corrections are in small print well into the newspaper where few will notice. Most have a biased agenda and some have a track record of prominent stories later shown to be false or misleading.",
