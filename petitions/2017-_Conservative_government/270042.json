        "action": "Provide option to 'opt out' of the state pension and pay less NI contributions",
        "additional_details": "With the national average life expectancy for being around 81 years old, future pensioners, will be working longer, contributing more and recieving less at the end, if they live long enough. Given that the state pension age continues to increase and there is no longer an increase in the average life expectancy an option to opt out and pay less NI should be available to allow citizens to pay more private pension contributions through out their working life to potentially retire earlier.",
        "background": "With the continuation of the state pension age increasing, younger citizens are, and will continue to be unfairly paying more contributions with less end benefit than previous generations, meaning many may not even receive the state pension after contributing all their working life.",
