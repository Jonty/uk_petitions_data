Does that mean that person should be sentenced for \u201churting someone\u2019s feelings\u201d? If a message is a direct threat and/or a call of action to cause violence, then it is a crime, but if that person is exercising their right to freedom of speech which might be considered \u201cextreme\u201d then that person should be well within their right to do so; especially if it is an opinion (subjective), or a joke.",

A law such as this is entirely subjective, and laws should be based on facts. Not feelings.",
