        "additional_details": "We want the following changes\r\n\r\n1. Remove the minimum income floor permanently.\r\n\r\n2. Consider the income from the self-employment, when calculating the Universal Credit payment, as an income from employment would be considered e.g. only the amount earned is considered.\r\n\r\n3. Only take into consideration the amount of money taken from the business as drawings - not all profit is income for the self employed person as they need to keep money for the up-keep of the business.",
        "background": "Many people who are self-employed find themselves discriminated against through this flaw in the Universal Credit system. A self-employed business may take years to bring in a significant income and some people may work like this as a flexible option to facilitate other commitments in their life.",
