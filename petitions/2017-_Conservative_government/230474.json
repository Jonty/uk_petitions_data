        "action": "Make it illegal to use parent-child spaces if you do not have a child with you",
        "additional_details": "There is a safety issue as the extra space allowed in a child space means children can get in and out safely without being right next to the moving wheels of other vehicles. Additionally, these spaces are often closer to the trolley park or business entrance meaning if you have to get a special trolley to use or are carrying infants you don't have to go too far from the car in order to be able to do this safely. Having to carry children, baby bags and your shopping is very difficult already!",
        "background": "I would like parent-child spaces to be considered with the same respect as disabled spaces and be offered as a matter of course in all public car parks. As a mother of 2 infants I am left to struggle getting them out of the car in an unsafe space because people without a child use the child spaces.",
