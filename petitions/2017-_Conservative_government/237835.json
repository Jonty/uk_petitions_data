        "additional_details": "For example, people leaving their engines running in school car parks may be exposing children to harmful emissions. Whilst schools may be proactive in trying to get people to stop these behaviours to protect children from harmful emissions, the law currently only states that it is illegal to run your engine on a public road. I want the law extended to both private and public car parks.",
        "background": "It is currently illegal to sit in your car whilst keeping the engine running on a public road. This law needs to be extended to any car park, public or private or on a private drive in order to protect children and the environment from harmful emissions.",
