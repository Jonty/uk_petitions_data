        "action": "All local authorities should recycle all plastic",
        "additional_details": "Surely we should have a joined up approach to recycling ALL waste, particularly all plastic. Each council should adhere to a national recycling standard where all plastic is sent to be recycled. Economies of scale would make this more feasible rather than individual councils negotiating their own recycling schemes.",
        "background": "Torridge and West Devon do not currently allow recycling of anything other than plastic bottles. All other plastic is sent to landfill. In a joined up world how can it be that other Councils can recycle all plastic and others can only recycle some.",
