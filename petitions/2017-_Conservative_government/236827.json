        "background": "I feel that the cervical smearing age should be lowered. If the legal age for having sex is 16 years old in the UK then why is cervical smearing age 25? The HPV virus is transmitted via sexual intercourse, virtually all cases of cervical cancer recorded in the UK were caused by the HPV virus.",
