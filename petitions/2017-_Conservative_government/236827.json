        "additional_details": "People who have been experiencing five years of pain, discomfort and bleeding can go in and out of hospital, not find the problem and still be told that a smear cannot be offered before the age of 25. For some people this could be too late.",
        "background": "I feel that the cervical smearing age should be lowered. If the legal age for having sex is 16 years old in the UK then why is cervical smearing age 25? The HPV virus is transmitted via sexual intercourse, virtually all cases of cervical cancer recorded in the UK were caused by the HPV virus.",
