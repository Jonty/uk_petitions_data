It is in all our interests to ensure a\r\ncontinued and undisrupted supply of medicine to the UK.\r\n\r\nWhile the chances of \u2018no deal\u2019 have been reduced considerably, the\r\nGovernment will continue to do the responsible thing and prepare for all\r\neventualities, in case a final agreement cannot be reached. Extensive\r\nwork to prepare for a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario has been underway for over two\r\nyears and we are taking the necessary steps to ensure the country\r\ncontinues to operate smoothly from the day we leave. Our objective is to\r\nminimise disruption by taking unilateral action to prioritise continuity and\r\nstability, wherever possible and appropriate to do so.\r\n\r\nWe have been speaking directly to industry across the medical supply\r\nchain, from pharmaceutical trade bodies to storage providers, so\r\npatients can still access medicines in exactly the same way as they do\r\nnow. The public can have confidence in the Government\u2019s plans for\r\ncontinuity of medicines supply in the unlikely event of a \u2018no deal\u2019\r\nscenario. The Government has asked pharmaceutical companies that\r\nsupply medicines to UK patients from, or via, Europe to ensure they\r\nhave a minimum of six weeks additional supply in the UK, over and\r\nabove their business as usual operational buffer stocks, by 29th March\r\n2019. There will be separate arrangements for the air freight of\r\nmedicines with short shelf-lives, such as medical radioisotopes. Since\r\nwriting to pharmaceutical companies, we have received good\r\nengagement from the industry who share our aim of maintaining\r\ncontinuity of medicines supply.\r\n\r\nWe understand that medicines like insulin are vitally important to millions\r\nof people in this country and we continue working closely with\r\ncompanies to ensure that stockpiles of medicines are sufficient to cope\r\nwith any potential short term delays at the border, in the event that there\r\nis \u2018no deal\u2019.\r\n\r\nOur contingency plans include sensible mitigations for medicines that\r\ncome to the UK from or via the EU, such as precautionary stockpiling by\r\nsuppliers, to ensure that the supply of insulin and other essential\r\nmedicines to patients is not disrupted.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union",
