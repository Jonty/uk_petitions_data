        "additional_details": "The UK government could be a perfect mediator between India and Pakistan due to its history and the strong cultural ties that exist between the UK and the Indian subcontinent. Following a series of events, there is increasing concern about the welfare of Kashmiris in Indian Administered Kashmir as they are being denied basic human rights. Mediation is required to help both governments come to an agreement regarding the status of Kashmir.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-49481180",
        "background": "Indian Administered Kashmir has been under a curfew and communication blackout since 4th August. Recently there has been little communication between Indian and Pakistani governments so a third party is needed to facilitate talks in the region.",
