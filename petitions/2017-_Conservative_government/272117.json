Mediation is required to help both governments come to an agreement regarding the status of Kashmir.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-49481180",
        "background": "Indian Administered Kashmir has been under a curfew and communication blackout since 4th August. Recently there has been little communication between Indian and Pakistani governments so a third party is needed to facilitate talks in the region.",
