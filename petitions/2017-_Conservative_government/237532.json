        "additional_details": "The only option for MPs who cannot be present in Parliament is to be paired with one from the other side of an issue who agrees not to vote.  The pairing system is informal, and was shown to be ineffective last July when MP Brandon Lewis broke a pairing arrangement with MP Jo Swinson, who was on maternity leave.  Our elected representatives must be allowed to represent us without having to compromise their children's health and well-being, their own health, or their families' urgent needs.",
        "background": "An MP was forced to delay a caesarean section to deliver her baby in order to be in Parliament on 15 January 2019 to vote on the Government's plan to leave the EU.  We urge parliament to establish a proxy voting procedure for MPs who require parental, medical or bereavement leave.",
