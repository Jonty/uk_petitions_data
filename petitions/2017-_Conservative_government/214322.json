        "action": "Fund a clinical audit of ovarian cancer to urgently improve survival rates",
        "additional_details": "When a woman is diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK the odds are stacked against her. It is one of the deadliest cancers for women and only 46% will survive 5 years beyond a diagnosis. UK survival rates lag significantly behind the USA, France and Germany, and even countries such as Thailand and Romania. We urgently need earlier detection and better treatment to improve women\u2019s chances. If my mum\u2019s cancer had been diagnosed earlier she would have had a 90% chance of survival.",
        "background": "Shockingly, the UK has one of the worst survival rates in Europe for ovarian cancer. It\u2019s too late for so many women like my mum, but we must do better. In 2015 the Chief Medical Officer called for an audit of ovarian cancer treatment & survival. Funding an audit is key to saving more women's lives.",
