        "action": "Stop insurance discrimination affecting those with pre existing medical issues",
        "additional_details": "The Government has said (in a letter to MP David Davies) that this is a commercial matter. Yet human rights are not a commercial matter. Life & CIC insurance is necessary for security. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says: Article 25. (1) Everyone has the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability... in circumstances beyond his control. 'Everyone' includes people with pre existing medical conditions who cannot afford higher premiums for life/CIC insurance.",
        "background": "Our society (rightly) talks about equality and yet the Government accepts insurance companies charging people more money for taking out policies - if they have a pre existing medical condition. It's blatant prejudice and discrimination. The government must stop this insurance industry-led practice.",
