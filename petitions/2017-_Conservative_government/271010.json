In particular, we're not sure exactly which powers, for example which \"domestic powers\", you're concerned about. Some of the powers you've mentioned are not prerogative powers, for example dissolution is now a statutory provision under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. We're also not sure to whom you want to transfer existing prerogative powers.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN03861/SN03861.pdf\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
