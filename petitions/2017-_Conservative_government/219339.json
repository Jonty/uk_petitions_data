        "additional_details": "Gambling was legalised in 1961 for better government control and to allow SMALL bets to be placed.  There are 2 billion problem gamblers and it's increasing. The card would control frequency of betting which is the main trait of a problem gambler, together with the size of bets.   Gambling results in bankruptcies, divorce, NHS costs, Crime, Benefit claims and Deaths.  Most gamblers have a addiction disorder (an illness) and are vulnerable.  In most cases gamblers don't want to gamble.",
        "background": "A gambling card would control people spending and control frequency.  The card limit would be based on disposable income.  The card would have a monthly limit and no credit balances can be carried forward.  The card will work on all platforms of gambling - shop counters, race courses and FOTB's.",

For example, you could ask the UK Government to work with gambling companies to create a scheme to help people to manage their gambling. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
