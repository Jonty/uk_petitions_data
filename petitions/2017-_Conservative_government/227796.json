        "action": "Stop playing Vivaldi as hold music on the benefit enquiries line.",
        "additional_details": "Several benefit numbers spout the same song over and over again. After 15 minutes one becomes irked. After 20 minutes, the music has slightly disturbing undertones and after 30 minutes the listener turns exasperated, frantic and starts to shout at their handset. This is not ideal: it breeds frustration and resentment at Vivaldi, the benefits line and possibly the government as a whole.",
        "background": "Whilst it is understandable that businesses do need waiting music to occupy the minds of enquirers, playing Vivaldi's 'Spring' over and over again creates associations incompatible with the normal levels of appreciation that one should have for such a classical musician.\r\n \r\n",
