        "additional_details": "Many companies have failed to raise the wages of Security Officers due to profit constraints in security servicing contracts. The government should role out a mandatory 40% increase against minimum wage in which the contractor must pay its License Holders once contracts have been renewed or at the next available opportunity. The 40% increase should then be processed at each Minimum Wage rise to maintain a competitive pay industry.",
        "background": "With Minimum Wage rising and coming in line with Security Organisations pay rate, the government should protect License Holders and impose a 40% raise above the National Minimum Wage. Minimum Wage is currently at \u00a37.83, with a 40% increase License Holders would receive \u00a310.96 minimum an hour.",
