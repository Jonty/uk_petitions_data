        "action": "Recommend that the term Islamophobia be dropped.",
        "additional_details": "The government has previously issued recommendations on terminology e.g. for communicating about disabled people. It is high time for similar guidelines to be issued for communications about religious groups. \u201cAnti-Muslim discrimination\u201d would be a more precise and clear term, clarifying that it is animosity towards people which is not permitted, while respectful criticism of a faith is allowed. The new term is also easily adaptable to other religious groups and is therefore fairer.",
        "background": "The term Islamophobia is ill-defined, and has overtones of special protection and rights for one belief system above all others. It is widely criticised today as being inaccurate, divisive and restrictive of free-speech.  We feel that this vague and problematic term needs to be dropped.",
