        "action": "Change the burden of proof threshold in Police 'Gross Misconduct' hearings.",
        "additional_details": "Fairness and justice demands the burden of proof that need be met be no less than that required in criminal cases, 'beyond all reasonable doubt'. Possible outcomes in 'Gross Misconduct' cases are the loss of a persons livelihood, barring them working in the police service in any capacity, them being named on a public register, along with the loss of reputation and risk of disadvantaging them in obtaining alternative employment. Only meeting the highest evidential threshold can justify this.",
        "background": "Currently in Police 'Gross Misconduct' proceedings the level of proof required is based on the 'balance of probability', being the evidential test applied in civil court cases, this is both unfair and against the principles of fair and natural justice.",
