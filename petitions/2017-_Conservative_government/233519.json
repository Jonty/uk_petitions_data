        "additional_details": "Publicly funded bodies have shown disregard for financial discipline and the BBC may be the worst. If commercial entities want to pay their staff excessive salaries and perks let their shareholders approve it or otherwise. The taxpayers are the BBC shareholders and I say enough is enough. who work primarily for the BBC should also pay tax and NI like everyone else at source. The talent will evolve to fill any gaps.",
        "background": "The BBC is a public service and should not pay excessive salaries or other payments to individuals. Paying anyone over \u00a31.5m a year to watch and comment on sport or present a 3 hour radio show is too much. Alternative talent could be found at lower salary levels.",
