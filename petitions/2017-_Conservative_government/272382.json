        "additional_details": "Even when name-calling is seen a simply \"banter\", it sets precedent for name-calling which can be personally affecting, for example in terms of racial or sexual/gender identity slurs.\r\n\r\nSince the House of Commons is about debating political opinion and facts, there is no need for name-calling nor ad-hom attacks which not only exemplify inconsiderate and rude behaviour but also distracts from the purpose of government - to lead the country with honesty and integrity.",
        "background": "The government & MPs are the leaders of our country. Their behaviour should show leadership as well. There is no place in respectful society for name-calling nor ad-hominem attacks.\r\n\r\nThis petition demands that name-calling and ad-hominem attacks in the House should be disallowed by the Speaker.",
