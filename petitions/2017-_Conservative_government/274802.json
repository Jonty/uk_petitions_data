        "additional_details": "Historically we needed a 'point' to pick up food because forks weren\u2019t invented. Now we only need the point to open the biscuits.\r\n \r\nResearch demonstrates rounded knives had significantly less penetrative capabilities than pointed knives. Round-ended knives can still cause slash type wounds, but they are far less likely to be life threatening.\r\n \r\nThe UK has worked for the public good by restricting handguns, paracetamol, smoking in public and plastic bags \u2013 now it is time to say \u2018no point\u2019.",
        "background": "We call on Government to see the sale of pointed domestic kitchen knives as a thing of the past. We urge them to take urgent measures to promote the sale of safe kitchen knife designs and restrict those designs which have been used in so many acts of violence. In one study 94% were kitchen knives.",
