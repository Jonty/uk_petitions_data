        "additional_details": "The Office of National Statistics state that the total number of crimes reported by police arose by 10% between April 2016 and March 2017 -a total of almost 5 million crimes. Violent crimes arose by 18%, robberies by 16%, sex offences by 14% and knife crimes by 20%. Women are more likely to experience all kind of violence and 5 times as likely to experience sexual attacks.The number of rapes recorded by police has doubled in the last 4 years. The figures are worrying and women feel insecure.",
        "background": "It's unfortunate that we we are witnessing the rise of crime especially in the last year. It is also common sense to acknowledge that women are in a higher risk to be victims of all crimes especially ones of sexual nature.\r\nAs crime is skyrocketing protecting ourselves is an obligation.",
