        "action": "Make trespass a criminal offence.",
        "additional_details": "As a security company covering a small area, we attend approx 6 cases of free runners trying to climb cranes each week. The police are unable to arrest when no damage has been done, as trespass is civil law. Each case causes a costly internal investigation, possible project delays, and leaves no discouragement for the perpetrators to return - even on the same day to the site next door on one occasion recently. It's a matter of time until a fatality occurs, as safety doesn't feature.",
        "background": "All trespass should be made illegal. The construction industry currently spends on keeping \"free runners\" from risking their life climbing cranes etc. Industrial sites are hit with huge bills for removal of illegal traveller encampments, and the culprits have little incentive to stop their actions.",
