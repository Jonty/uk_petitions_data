However, there is a legal cap on how much they can increase council tax without asking local people to vote on it in a referendum.\r\n\r\nThe Government has announced that this cap will be increased for 2018-19. You can find out more about this here:\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05682\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the Government not to make these changes, if that's what you'd like to happen.
