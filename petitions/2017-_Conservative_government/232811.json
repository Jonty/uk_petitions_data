        "additional_details": "Studies have shown that your brain wakes up and is usually more active at 10:00. This would make your grades better as you find it easier to learn later in the day. Also waking up early causes stress as you have to get ready quickly and that can raise your heart rate. This would not just affect students it could affect the staff a some of them come from far places so it\u2019s hard to get to work quickly. So starting at 10:00 would give them time to drop of there kids and get to there work in time.",
        "background": "To begin this would be a good idea as studies have shown that teenagers are more likely to go to bed late and wake up late so we find it harder to wake up. On many occasions I have woken up late and got to school late, this causes unneeded anxiety which will affect your grades and mental health.",
