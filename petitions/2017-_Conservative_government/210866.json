        "additional_details": "Russia lacks a humane system of shelters, food and medical support for homeless cats and dogs. However, contracts worth $1.95million have been signed in host cities to kill the animals rather than set up shelters or provide spay/neuter and vaccinations programmes. \r\n\r\nRussia must withdraw all contracts and cancel planned slaughter of hundreds of thousands of animals.  \r\n\r\nWE ASK OUR GOVERNMENT: Contact the Russian Government and demand the passing of animal protection laws and redirect any foreign aid to support humane solutions to remove stray animals from the streets.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/bloodyFIFA2018/",
