        "additional_details": "A National Wildlife Habitat Protection Office is imperative to certify wildlife habitat genuinely void of life, prior to habitat destruction by local authorities, contractors & developers - eliminating conflicts of interest involved when checking for wildlife is solely required of those who stand to profit from reporting an absence of it. \r\n\r\nRetrospective enforcement of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 is a virtual misnomer, as far as protecting wildlife & habitats, after their destruction.",
        "background": "Councils, contractors & developers throughout the UK have an inherent conflict of interest when checking for the presence of protected wildlife living in their natural habitats & legislation is ill suited to proving negligence retrospectively, after habitats are destroyed for financial expediency.",
