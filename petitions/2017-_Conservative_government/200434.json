        "additional_details": "A recent example: Pilning (S Glos) - Footbridge to one platform demolished, sneaked through under the guise of a \"minor modification\". Now served by two trains a week in one direction only. \r\n\r\nWe ask the Secretary of State for Transport to take the necessary steps to stop this cynical abuse of the system. Please remove the loophole that allows to close any part of a station without a proper public consultation. Make a full consultation compulsory when the change affects any passenger services.",
        "background": "Closure of a railway station is a serious blow to the community it serves. It deprives it of valuable transport links, and makes it much more difficult to get to and from. However, all over the country stations are being \"closed by stealth\" with little or any consultation of the people affected.",
