        "additional_details": "It has been shown that with the involvement of 16 and 17 year olds, the Brexit vote would have been different, which simply proves that people of this generation are able to shape the country and have their shay responsibly. It is now time to make consistent the age of majority in the UK and allow 16 year olds, who are legally considered adults in Scotland but not in the rest of the UK, some consistency and respect in the way in which they are treated.",
        "background": "Those over 16 should be able to have their say in the running of the country based on age. Under 18's are able to pay tax and National Insurance, but remain unable to vote on how their contributions should be spent, and shape the country in which they will live for many years to come.",
