        "additional_details": "Minority government with no mandate for any current option. Historical failure to inform public debate by failure to place relevant data, reports and documents into the public domain in a timely manner. Lack of public trust in motives and actions of many politicians.\r\nWithout a mandate any decision - deal, leave with no deal or remain -risks alienation of a large proportion of the electorate and will set back future progress after that decision has been made. \r\nDemocracy requires public engagement",
        "background": "The government has negotiated a bad Brexit deal.\r\nIf this deal is the only one available from the EU this and the other options of no deal and remain should be put to the electorate for a mandate. Politicians cannot agree a way forward and no one can honestly say what was voted for in 2016",
