        "additional_details": "Most pheasants in the UK have not reproduced in the wild but have been released. 25% of those bred in captivity die before the shooting season even begins. Many birds are wounded when shot and not killed outright. They are hugely destructive, causing damage costing thousands of pounds. On compassionate and environmental grounds, their release should be prohibited.\r\nhttps://www.gwct.org.uk/research/species/birds/common-pheasant/\r\nhttp://robyorke.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gamebird-release.pdf",
        "background": "Every year approximately 35,000,000 pheasants are released into the countryside to be shot for sport. They are often intensively reared and little able to cope in the wild, with many killed by cars.This non-native species also causes massive damage to crops and gardens. This practice needs to stop.",
