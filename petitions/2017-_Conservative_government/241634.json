        "additional_details": "This practice is cruel and vastly outdated in many ways. \r\nThere is nothing educational about animals, the environment or life cycles that can be found from practicing such 'projects' or 'experiments'. \r\n\r\nChickens have complex social bonds and 'pecking orders'. These types of 'projects' deny them a chance to develop their natural bonds and deprive them of natural beginnings, hence negating the natural observation of animals and respect for their lives.",
        "background": "Unhatched chicks are taken from their their mothers, and brought into school classrooms where they are denied everything that is natural to them. Chicks born in this manner often become sick and deformed. Many projects like this result in the chicks being euthanised when it is over.",
