        "additional_details": "My accident happened while cycling to school. I came off my bike head first, landing in front of a car, which drove over me, trapping me beneath. The air ambulance attended and I was flown to hospital. I sustained three breaks, a fracture and lost some teeth. \r\n\r\nThe consultant said I wouldn't have survived without a helmet.  \r\n\r\nI want you all to understand it can happen to anyone....as it happened to me!\r\n",
        "background": "Wearing my cycle helmet saved my life! It protected my head when I hit the road and from the hot exhaust when I was trapped under the car. The helmet was amazing as it was damaged and melted but still intact. Now I want all children to have to wear helmets. ",
