        "additional_details": "When the body needs to meet such needs, no amount of will power will over ride this no mater what the legal penalty is so what civilised country should put its citizens in such a position.\r\n\r\nCouncils should legally provide such services in all urban areas but should also not issue licences to any businesses selling refreshments if there are not toilet facilities available to its customers within say 100 meters of the business.",
        "background": "Throughout the UK, public toilets are closing. These actions are unfair on all sections of our society. It is a natural requirement to use toilets. It is illegal to defecate or urinate in the street so it should be a legal requirement to provide the facilities required to avoide breaking the law.",
