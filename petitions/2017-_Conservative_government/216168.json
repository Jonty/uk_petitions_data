        "additional_details": "Students should not be tested upon content they have not been taught, especially in certain circumstances where the educational content has not been provided with during this time of strike. Not only are we paying for this disservice but it's now effecting our student experiences, education, mental and physical health and patience. We should not have to stress and put ourselves in detrimental states of wellbeing to try and teach ourselves 3+ weeks of content for end of year examinations.",
        "background": "Due to the ongoing UCU strikes nationwide, universities have ended up missing over 3+ weeks of content, with no content being provided in this absence. It is unfair to test us on content we have not been taught. With the strikes still potentially ongoing after Easter, it only makes things worse.",
