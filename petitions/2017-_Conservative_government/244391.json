        "additional_details": "This year, 189 children in Herts were not allocated a school at all. \r\n(In addition, 1363 children from OUTSIDE the county were given places at one of their four choice schools.)\r\n\r\nThis campaign is to prioritise children with NO PLACE allocated at all and get them prioritised so they're not left with a very far away school, but given first pick of the new spaces that become available. \r\n\r\nOthers, who have already received a ranked school, will get second pick of newly available places.",
        "background": "My child is among 189 in Herts who have not been allocated a secondary school place for Sept. \r\nWe also have NO prioritisation over anyone who has already received one of their 4 choices. Therefore they can move up the list and be given a higher ranked place before we are offered anything at all.",
