The progression of the Bill within the House of Commons would not only raise the grave nature of the situation but also reduce the time taken to consider and potentially implement changes.",
        "background": "Migrant workers are exploited through the relationship between their visas and employers. Under the tied UK working visa, seeking employment elsewhere is illegal. Evil employers abuse this system, creating environments without pay, threats and bribery, physical abuse and facing deportation.",
