        "action": "Allow supply teachers to pay into the 'Teachers' Pension'.",
        "additional_details": "Supply teachers used to be employed by LEAs. They were paid to scale, had pay progression and a pension. Successive governments have turned a blind eye to agencies taking this role where supply teachers are not paid to scale, have no pay progression and have no pension. A supply teacher will earn \u00a316000 a year if they work every school day (the agencies having got \u00a329,250 for that teacher). Some things we have to accept: the government signing our pension away, we shouldn't have to.",
        "background": "Supply teachers cannot pay into the Teachers' Pension. If you are contracted for 2 hours a week you can opt-in, but as a supply teacher working 5 days a week you can't. Why? Because supply agencies don't employ us, so can't pay the employer's contribution. The ethics of agencies are another debate.",
