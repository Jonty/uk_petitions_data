        "additional_details": "A no-deal Brexit is a lose-lose response to our various frustrations, and Brexit with deal is a very weak and dangerous compromise. We can do ourselves, the EU and the world a favour by negotiating to stay inside the community that we have helped to build. It is time to update and streamline the EU and keep it together, make it better and stronger.\r\nWe are in a unique position, because we are set to leave unless we revoke Article 50. So let\u2019s negotiate to do just that.",
        "background": "Many of us are dissatisfied with different aspects of the EU. However, most other member-countries are too. This is a unique opportunity to bring about those much-needed changes. Negotiate to REMAIN, not to leave. This is the win-win solution for leavers, remainers and other EU countries.",
