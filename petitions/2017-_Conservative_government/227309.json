        "additional_details": "I am detained in a mental health unit currently, and am often unable to take leave because I use a wheelchair and the hospital drive is too steep for a manual wheelchair. Many units are unable to accommodate wheelchair users at all, and those that do often struggle to provide equal access, consistent access to physio, or other adaptations. This may mean some young people, purely because of their physical health needs, are sent to elderly mental health wards! THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE!!!",
        "background": "It seems logical, but people can have both physical and mental health problems. Yet many mental health units do not allow for or accommodate physical health needs or disabilities. It's 2018, so surely we should be able to provide care for people with complex or multiple needs...",
