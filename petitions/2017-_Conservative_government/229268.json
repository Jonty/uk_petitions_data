        "additional_details": "In the recent Labour Party conference delegates voted for a motion backing a second referendum as an option, There should be no option, Full Stop. Negotiate the terms of the withdrawal, have a public vote on the outcome do whatever needs to be done to secure the UK leaving, but be sure the final outcome is still LEAVE.",
        "background": "I feel it would be unfair, illegal and a betrayal for labour to go against the 2016 Brexit referendum result. The UK has voted 'Leave'. Regardless of public opinion now, The original result remains the same. The United Kingdom has been bullied for years, Stand Up For What's Right! Support Democracy.",
