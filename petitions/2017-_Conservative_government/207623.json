You can be a UK National but not Resident of the UK, this is acceptable as this is regulated accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have many times waited in the line at Boarder Control whilst people decide which Passport to use to enter this Country. I have known many people who have a UK Passport but have no intention of living here, their Children have taken UK Nationality when born overseas to a non UK National Mother who has the intention to live in the Mother's Country. When the Father is a UK National the baby has taken the Nationality for a \"just in case we need it\" reason only even though he does not intend to live in the UK.",
