        "additional_details": "There are 13 female prisons in the UK & only 6 of them have Units for Mothers & Babies. Those 6 Units only provide a total of 54 places. It is only when a mother enters prison that she can apply for a place at one of those Units.\r\nThis can be changed! The legal system is there to protect individuals, it can provide a caring attitude to pregnant women as early as when they go to court. Circumstances can be considered and options can be taken to put an unborn baby at the heart of the legal system.",
        "background": "There are 3,901 women in prisons (approximately 16% of these women are on remand). Within the prison system there are on average 100 babies born each year, and those women who have been sentenced (not on remand) usually have their babies separated from them. Why should that happen to a baby?",
