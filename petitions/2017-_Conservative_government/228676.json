        "additional_details": "The definition given by the government website for disability is to have a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial/long-term negative effect on ability to do normal daily activities. Anxiety, depression and other mental health illnesses fall under this and yet service dogs are not allowed. Dogs are important for people with mental health and allowing them to go everywhere with the person, like a guide dog, such as shops and restaurants allows the person to become a more active member of society.",
        "background": "In America service dogs cover both physical and mental health needs. Anxiety is a mental health condition that can cripple the people who suffer from it many of whom struggle to go outside let alone have a life that is equal to non-sufferers. Same goes for depression. So why can they not have help.",
