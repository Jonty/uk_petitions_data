        "additional_details": "There's been many pet deaths caused by pet toys. My friends dog nearly died through playing with a dog toy and my dog was playing tug with one of her toys which the inside was sticking out. A very sharp plastic tube is the only way I can describe it held together with a small piece of sellotape hidden under woven rope. This could have caused my dog serious harm.",
        "background": "Animals are just seen as pets to most but to many they are like a family member. Children's toys have to pass a safety check so animal toys should have to too. This issue needs addressing urgently.",
