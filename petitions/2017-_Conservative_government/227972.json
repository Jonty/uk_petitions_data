        "action": "We request a ban on issuing psychiatric drugs to children under 5 years old.",
        "additional_details": "We are aware that children as young as two could be being medicated with strong drugs designed for adult use, such as psychostimulants, antipsychotics or antidepressants. We have safeguarding concerns about this growing practice. Increasingly Educational Psychologists in the field are aware of such cases and this causes us great concern.",
        "background": "We strongly believe that the risk of potential harm from psychiatric drugs is too great to expose a young child\u2019s brain to this risk. Countries like France have a ban until seven years of age. More research is needed in this field and caution is required until that point.",
