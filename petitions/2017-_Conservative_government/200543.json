        "action": "Eliminate financial requirement for UK citizens bringing legal spouses to the UK",
        "additional_details": "Government rules for British citizens to bring non-EU spouses to the UK are forcing some to have to leave the UK or abandon their spouse. The Government should be looking after these citizens above all others. British citizens shouldn't have to face this government imposed dilemma of choosing between their spouse and their country.\r\n \r\nThis petition proposes the elimination of the income and capital hurdles that discriminate against UK citizens settling their legal spouses in the UK.",
        "background": "Currently EU citizens can settle their non-EU spouses in the UK on proof of a legal marriage. For UK citizens there are additional income or capital requirements. These additional requirements discriminate against UK citizens and can prevent resettlement of their non-EU spouses.",
