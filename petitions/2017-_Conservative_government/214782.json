        "action": "Make nonconsensual medical intervention for intersexed people illegal.",
        "additional_details": "About 1 in 2000 children are born with genitalia considered atypical enough to prompt medical investigation. Nonconsensual treatment, according to studies, often causes severe physical and psychological harm to patients. We need to stop nonconsensual medical interventions, as the Maltan government did, and make sure that no one has to suffer nonconsensual treatment again. Being intersex is not a bad thing. Intersex people deserve to be protected from discrimination.",
        "background": "Data from intersex civil societies show that intersex nonconsensual surgeries are not a thing of the past. They expressed concern at unnecessary surgeries on intersex children before they can provide consent. It called on the government to stop these. This has not happened.",
