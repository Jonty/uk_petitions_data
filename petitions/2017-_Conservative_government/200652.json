        "action": "Change CICA policy that states children age 12+ can \u201cconsent in fact\u201d to sex",
        "additional_details": "The age of consent is 16 for good reason. It reflects the cognitive, emotional and social development required as an absolute minimum to consent to sex. The current CICA guidelines flies in face of this, notwithstanding ignoring the context in which \"consent\" occurs. Coercion, fear and manipulation are part of these offences and as such \"consent in fact\" is null and void. \r\nSuch victim blaming is wrong, unhelpful and psychologically damaging. As such, this should be fully debated in Parliament.",
        "background": "Children from age 12y could be refused compensation for sexual abuse on grounds they consented under revised rules.\r\nThe Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) review of its guidelines revealed that almost 700 child victims were denied payments, even where the attacker was jailed.",
