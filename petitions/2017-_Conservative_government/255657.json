No matter what background we are from our children are going to meet people different from themselves, even LGBTQ people. Education causes no harm but ignorance does. LGBQ children will benefit from knowing they have the same rights and are entitled to the same respect as everyone else.\r\nhttps://www.researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk/grants/RES-062-23-0095/read",
