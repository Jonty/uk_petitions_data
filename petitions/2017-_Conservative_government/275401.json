        "additional_details": "Escort ships are the ships which protect our fleet, our aircraft carriers when deployed will always have frigates and destroyers around them keeping them safe during operations. They form a ring of steal around UK waters all the time, escorting potentially hostile forces through. They also keep this nation moving whilst patrolling vital shipping lanes which deliver to this country everything it needs to secure our way of life. Lets make sure the navy has enough of these warships.",
        "background": "The Royal Navy is an extremely capable force, which is deployed at home and abroad all year round. It works incredibly hard, and with the job it does for our nation it needs the resources to be able to work properly. This petition calls for the MOD to increase escort warships to a minimum of 25.",
