        "additional_details": "We rely on parents telling us they have made a payment, and then have to wait until the money is credited to our bank account which can take several working days. We do not get any notification about when a payment is made, and if we call the helpline we are told that information cannot be shared about any pending payments due to data protection. Even on our bank statements, it does not say who the payment has come from. We cannot operate a business like this.",
        "background": "There is a complete lack of communication about payments that have been made through Tax-Free Childcare. Providers have an account they can login to, but cannot see any payments that have been made to them.",
