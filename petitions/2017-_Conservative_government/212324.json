        "additional_details": "We are concerned that allowing such involvement will lock the British taxpayer into long-term debt, especially should any NHS trust involved require additional funding.\r\n\r\nWe are further concerned that the needs of private financiers and banks will dictate the shape, size and scale of our health services and that the high costs of PFI debt charges means that the NHS will be unable to operate as it would have done through conventional procurement funding.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call upon the British Government not only to rule out US or any other foreign company involvement in the NHS post-Brexit but to commit to no extension to or further PFI funding arrangements across all NHS services.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, are disappointed that the Prime Minister has not ruled out the possibility of US companies having any involvement in the NHS as part of a post-Brexit trade deal with the USA.",
