        "action": "Implement Agriculture as a compulsory subject up to YR9 and an option for GCSE.",
        "additional_details": "I see extremely worrying false and skewed information floating around that unfortunately people are desperate to believe. It's time we finally try to do something about it and save the most important industry, I feel, on this planet in a constructive and educational way. I believe that giving children and young adults the facts in a structured lesson, weekly, will enable the next generation to grow up knowing the true importance, the factual information and have the love for UK Agriculture.",
        "background": "Agriculture on a whole is an extremely important industry, it is used by everyone across the country, across the globe and it's not just for food! Hopefully, teaching children and young adults correct and factual information will help support UK and worldwide farmers and the industry in the future.",
