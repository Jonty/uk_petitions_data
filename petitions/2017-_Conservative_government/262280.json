        "action": "Save British Steel by providing state funding or by nationalising it.",
        "additional_details": "the \u00a330m requested by British Steel is insignificant when some 25000 jobs are under threat. The cost of 25000 workers claiming benefits and not paying income tax or NI would equate to this figure within a month or two.\r\nthe Government should legislate that all Government contracts and major construction work in the UK must use British Steel.\r\nThe UK should not be importing cheap substandard steel from the likes of China, produced under slave labour conditions, there should also be a significant import tax/duty on all Chinese products.",
        "background": "The Government has said it cannot provide state aid to save British Steel due to EU legislation.\r\nfirstly we should not be in the EU, if the self-serving politicians had done what the electorate had voted for, secondly was it not state funding that bailed out the banks to the tune of \u00a3billions.",
