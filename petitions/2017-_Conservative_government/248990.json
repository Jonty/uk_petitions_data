        "action": "Support the 2016 referendum result and leave the EU",
        "additional_details": "This first petition only represents one side of the coin. It is clearly undemocratic to have a vote on a subject, but then claim success by only counting the votes on one side and not the other. If you are not opposed to nor frightened by change and feel that the UK should still be looking to leave the EU in one way, shape or form then here is your opportunity to express that view. Here is the chance to, in effect, have a second referendum without the political manoeverings that have so far clouded, shrouded and fouled up the process.",
        "background": "A petition to 'revoke article 50 and remain in the EU', claims to represent 'the peoples' voice'. At the time of writing the petition has over 3 million signatures (nowhere near the 16 million remain voters). There ought to be a balancing petition to lend any credence either way and this is it.",
