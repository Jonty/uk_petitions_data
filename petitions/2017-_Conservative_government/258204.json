        "action": "Include made to penetrate in the UK rape legislation",
        "additional_details": "I put forth this petition to include female forceful envelopment of a mans penis in the definition of rape and to make the rape law prerequisite for a penis and penetration to be removed from the law. When men are raped by women, seldom are they raped with an object, they are usually forcefully enveloped by a woman. The definition also negates the women who are raped by women, especially those who are done so without an object. Do the right thing, make male and female victims equal under law.",
        "background": "I am a man who was raped, but under the current UK rape legislation, i don't qualify as a victim because my rapist was a woman. As we stand, only men can be charged with rape. This negates men and women like me who weren't raped by men, but rather women. I bring this petition to change that.",
