        "additional_details": "Are 16-17 year olds immature people, not to be trusted with serious political decisions? I don't think so. These days, teenagers are hounded with pressure to find work experience or summer courses during their holidays, even if they have only just finished their GCSEs.  When teenagers are forced to be hard-working adults so early, the least they deserve is to have some say over their future. If there is another referendum on any aspect of Brexit, teenagers aged 16-17 ought to have a voice.",
        "background": "Young people are affected more deeply than older people by the result of the Brexit referendum, as their lives will be changed for very many more years. However, young people aged 16 to 17 were not allowed to vote in the 2016 referendum, in contrast to the Scottish independence referendum of 2014.",
