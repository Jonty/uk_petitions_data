        "additional_details": "In 2017 a worker who was 18 years old would get \u00a35.60 a hour, while a worker who was 25 year old would get \u00a37.50 a hour.\r\nThat\u2019s a massive difference, and on a 30 hour week, the 18 year old would get \u00a3168 a week, while the 25 year old gets \u00a3225 a week. Meaning most young people do not have the income to buy or rent anywhere until they are 25 years old and on the higher income, meaning they have to live at home longer. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m calling for equal pay because morally I think it\u2019s right thing to do.",
