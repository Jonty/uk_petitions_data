        "additional_details": "A constitution sets out the rules for how a society\u2019s rules are made or changed, and all constitutions do three things.\r\n\r\nFirst, they establish the authority that different centres of power have, how they relate to one another, and how these relations can be changed. \r\n\r\nSecond, all constitutions define the powers and rights of citizens and how they are protected.\r\n\r\nThird, all constitutions express the aspirations of the society. \r\n\r\nHaving a written codified constitution would be good for democracy.",
        "background": "A citizens\u2019 constitution for UK democracy is more necessary with every passing day - Many democratic societies benefit from constitutions on the rights of its citizens . Now is the time for the UK to have its own written formal constitution codified into law with current chaos in parliament",
