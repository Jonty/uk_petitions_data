        "action": "Legalise Marijuana, and Hemp to help tackle the use off fossil fuels & plastics",
        "additional_details": "Hemp can be made into almost everything we currently use plastic for, an entire house has been made from hemp as well as everything inside! Hemp is going to take off, and we need to make sure were not behind the times when it does. Most problems to do with the smoking or ingesting of Marijuana comes from drug dealers putting other things in it to up the profits. Most research suggests its better for you than drinking is, its also causes less fights that the police have to break up.",
        "background": "If Marijuana was legalised then an entire network of Drug Dealers would go out of business, the profits on the tax would go into government hands, not criminals. Fossil fuels are running out, if the UK start the process of making hemp now, we would become a leading industry, a massive economic boost",
