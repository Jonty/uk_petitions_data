        "action": "Start a referendum on whether or not to carry out a new referendum on Brexit",
        "additional_details": "The country is divided and there are so many protests taking place against Brexit, so many people are not happy. Many businesses have shown that they are worried about Brexit. To settle the question, once and for all, we need to go back to the people and ask for permission to carry out a new referendum on Brexit. The question can only be settled by the power of the people, not just the parliament, and therefore, the public should decide, once and for all, if they want a new referendum on Brexit. If the public said no, the UK should leave the EU immediately. If the public said yes, a new Brexit referendum should take place.",
        "background": "With all the protest against Brexit and as it is not possible for parliament to cancel the previous Brexit referendum, then a referendum on a new Brexit referendum should take place. If the decision is yes, article 50 should be delayed and two public votes to take place.",
