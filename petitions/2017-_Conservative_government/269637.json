The figures must be transparent as must the Government's answers about the lack of progress in curing these diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Government should fund awareness campaigns such as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month & Sarcoma Awareness week. Awareness + research = cure Our children keep suffering and dying.",

Yet there has been little, or no, funding for research into these cancers and little, or no, progress.",
