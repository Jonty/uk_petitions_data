        "additional_details": "Thank you to everyone who took time to read my first posts to get the story into the public domain. I hoped after all the press publicity Ian and  Richard would have had a far more considerate outcome. They have not been reinstated and the station will remain closed until further notice. We now have global support. Now is the time for us to ask for your support again and ask if you would sign our petition and share this post.",
        "background": "Richard Clarkson and Ian Pedrick, who have more than 60 years of experience between them, were dismissed for using their own vehicle and equipment to rescue a car which had rolled down a hill towards a cliff edge. We need these men reinstated to keep us safe & to reopen our vital coastguard station.",
