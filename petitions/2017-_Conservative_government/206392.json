        "additional_details": "Bands have had a secondary role for some twenty years being trained as Medics. This was not some haphazard scheme but properly conducted by the RAMC Training school in Ash Vale and was as stringent and complex as the training given to their own trainees.\r\n\r\nBands did go on operations and supplied medical cover.\r\n\r\nThe scrapping of all Regimental Bands was a catastrophe and what remains of Military Music must be left in place.   \r\n\r\nNo further cuts to military music.",
        "background": "The Royal Marines, Army and Central Band of the Royal Air Force are an integral part of the the British Military.\r\nIf the cuts to military music are not halted national ceremonies such as Armistice Day will suffer removing the infrastructure and teaching process.  No further cuts to military music.",
