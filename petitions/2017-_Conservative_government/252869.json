        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister promised we would leave on 29/03/2019 over 100 times, she betrayed her promise. The Prime Minister has also promised there would only be one extension and she would not seek to extend this process beyond the agreed date. As there is no majority in Parliament we demand to leave the European Union on 12/04/2019 without a deal. To go against this would be a rejection of our democratic vote and the will of the Great British Public.\r\n\r\nNo deal is the best deal.",
        "background": "17.4 million people voted to leave the European Union in 2016. Since then Parliament has done everything to delay or stop this from happening. We had one extension to our exit date and we refuse to allow another extension. The only way forward now is to leave on WTO terms on 12th April.",
