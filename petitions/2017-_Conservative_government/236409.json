        "additional_details": "In France you can ride an electric scooter in cycle lanes and on the pavement, providing you keep to a set speed limit. In Germany electric scooter use on pavements is legal up to 6 kph. Austria and Switzerland it is fine to ride your scooter in cycle lanes and on roads up to 25 kph. In California PLEVs are recognised as a legal way to get around as long as the rider is over 16 and wears a helmet (which we think is really rather sensible).",
