        "additional_details": "Since the 2001 terror attacks on the USA, under article 5 of NATO, we have been going to Afghanistan in order to \"protect\" and \"prevent\". So much money has gone into it, more than \u00a347billion in military in general to be precise. This has just gone into killing mostly civilians.",
        "background": "A lot of money is spent on military action, which has gone into the Afghan intervention because Afghanistan was seen as a threat to the USA. Since the execution of  Bin Laden, the main threat has been eradicated. I believe that us being there, just causes collateral damage.",
