        "additional_details": "Rudolph, along with his 200 friends and relatives, will have to be culled to make way for this building site, which will wreck their required habitat. All of this can be avoided \u2013 if HS2 agree to move the building site just a few hundred metres. Unfortunately, though, they are not listening . . .\r\n\r\nTherefore, we the undersigned respectfully request Theresa May and her Government instructs HS2 Ltd move the disruption and building site away from the Blithbury Reindeer Lodge in Staffordshire. This would save Rudolph, his family and Christmas for children in the coming years.",
        "background": "The home of Rudolph and the largest reindeer herd outside Scandinavia is under threat from HS2.\r\n\r\nThe farm where he lives will be damaged beyond repair - just to provide a proposed trackway and turning area.",
