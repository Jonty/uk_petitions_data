        "additional_details": "In 2014 a parliamentary bill \"Face Coverings (Prohibition) Bill\" failed due to the actions of the following MP's pandering to Muslim sensitivities, Keith Vaz, Gerald Kaufman, Rushanara Ali, Lyn Brown\r\n\r\nThe failure of this bill in 2014 fuelled the rise of political violence in the UK by the likes of Antifa, who the US government has declared \"domestic terrorists\". These and other groups can still legally cover their faces at political events.",
        "background": "Other countries have banned the covering of faces at political gatherings due to the rise of extremist political violence and drain on policing resources. A new law is needed in the UK, banning the covering of faces at political events to stop violence.(This will not be a 'ban the Burka' bill)",
