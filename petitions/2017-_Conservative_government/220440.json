        "additional_details": "Govia Thameslink has consistently had the worst performance figures of any train operating company in England. It has failed to improve services and now totally failed to deliver on its own new timetable leading to total chaos. It is contributing to lost man hours, harming the economy and failing in all aspects of customer service. It has been criticised by two Commons Select Committees and the National Audit Office for its repeated  failures.",
        "background": "The Secretary of State should intervene immediately over GTR's failure to implement its new timetable leaving commuters stranded and mass cancellations of services despite having a year to plan for the changes.",
