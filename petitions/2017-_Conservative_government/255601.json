        "additional_details": "There have been many different times filibustering has been used ,including the 15 year rule bill , the European withdrawal bill and citizens rights for foreign and commonwealth members of the armed forces.The fact that a single memebr or possibly two or three working together can thwart the proper debate is a waste of time and public money.",
        "background": "Far too regularly during debate in Parliament and in the House of Lords, some MPs resort to filibustering ( talking out of time) anything they or their group disagree . I consider this tactic to be a waste of time for members , a direct abuse of the parliamentary system and a waste of public finance",

The House can also vote to bring a debate to an end early or to impose a time limit on some types of business.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out clearly what further action you would like taken."
