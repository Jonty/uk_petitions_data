Only people calling themselves social workers or using other titles which are protected need to register.\r\n \r\nThere are however, several titles used by social workers which are currently unprotected, leading to cases of families being subjected to negligent care by those who use these unprotected titles to avoid the registration process, and detection.\r\n \r\nAll titles should be protected.\r\n",
        "background": "At the moment there is no law requiring everyone engaging in social work to register with an independent monitoring body like Social Work England. This loophole allows for dangerous levels of malpractice to take place inside the system, which could lead to, or may have already caused, child deaths.",
