        "additional_details": "Billions of single-use plastic bottles are sold every year in UK and these create a waste and recycling problem we can't cope with. UK tap water is of high quality and (like Rome in 150 BC) people should have access to clean water within our towns and cities. \r\nThe avoidance of oil-based plastic is now critical and a major objective & concern for all UK citizens. These fairly simple drinking water facilities will significantly help end abuse of plastic in our environment. Thanks.",
        "background": "That Central Government vote to fund all Local Authorities in every UK town & city in order to install tap/water drinking / refill facilities (in place by June 2022) on high streets, shopping areas, public places-dramatically cut the need for bottled water & abuse of single-use plastic bottles.",
