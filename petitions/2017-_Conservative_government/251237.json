Surely at times like this, they could join forces to make this happen. Rather then paying extra for expensive guests, this could be used to just allow students to enjoy their evening and celebrate the year.",
        "background": "Every year we have an annual summer ball. This year however, it has been scrapped due a lack of funding. No other university has had this issue and I feel strongly that students should have this opportunity to celebrate their achievements, in particular final year students who are leaving.",
