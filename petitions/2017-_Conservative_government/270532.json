        "additional_details": "Saturday 24th August 2019, shop within Liverpool City Centre, both facilities that had access to baby changing - Womens and Disabled. No mens. The mens facilities had no access to baby changing. Now I know I could have gone to the disabled facilities however I feel this unfair on any disabled person. I could not have gone into the womens as this would have been wrong. So I had nowhere to go. I had to find a FAMILY ROOM however mens rooms should have access",
        "background": "Whenever I am out with my 9 week old baby boy, I find it increasingly difficult to find baby changing facilities within any establishment. It is either in the womens, or in the disabled facilities. I believe that all men should have access to changing facilities in their own toilets/facilities",
