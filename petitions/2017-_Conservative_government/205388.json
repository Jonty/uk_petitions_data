        "additional_details": "Though created almost two centuries ago, recent years have seen the Vagrancy Act abused in absurd and unnecessary ways. In 2014, three men were arrested and charged under Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824 for taking food from bins outside an Iceland supermarket in Kentish Town, North London.\r\n\r\nThere is no justice to be found here: this Act is a mockery of justice; it serves no purpose but the punishment, persecution, and stigmatisation of some of the most vulnerable in our society.",
        "background": "The Vagrancy Act 1824 makes it an offence to sleep rough or beg.\r\n\r\nIt is a barbaric, archaic law that criminalises the very existence of those homeless forced to take to the streets or beg for survival. \r\n\r\nScotland & Ireland removed this outdated law decades ago - England & Wales must join them.",
