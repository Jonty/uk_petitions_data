        "action": "Create a minimum free-to-carry hand luggage allowance for all UK-bound flights.",
        "additional_details": "Ryanair has started charging even for hand luggage. It's likely other carriers will follow suit. \r\n\r\nConsumers have no protection from these practices, and ultimately are forced into paying the fees, as a hand luggage allowance is essential to most people when flying. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this petition is to encourage the government to make a minimum requirement of free-to-carry hand luggage for flights in/outbound of the UK, so consumers are not forced to pay for every essential thing when flying.",
        "background": "Airlines are constantly removing luggage allowances. It started as hold luggage, and now carriers are removing hand luggage allowances too. \r\n\r\nLuggage is an essential part of flying. Being required to pay for it is unfair on the consumers.",
