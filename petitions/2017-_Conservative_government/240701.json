        "additional_details": "The minimum age at which you can buy cigarettes in the UK is at present 18.\r\n\r\nIn 2016/17 there were estimated to be 484,700 hospital admissions attributable to smoking (Hospital Episode Statistics), and in 2016 there were estimated to be 77,900 deaths attributable to smoking in the UK (Office for National Statistics).\r\n\r\nTobacco smoking destroys lives and families, while megacorporations haul their massive profits to the bank. If you believe it should be phased out, please lend your support to this petition.",
        "background": "Set the legal smoking age to 19 in 2019, 20 in 2020, and raise it by one year annually. This way, the limit will always be the current year, making it easy to remember. No one would find themselves banned if they already smoke. However, anyone currently under 19 would be prevented from taking it up.",
