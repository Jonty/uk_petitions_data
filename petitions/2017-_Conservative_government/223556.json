Small business Owners invest large amounts of their own money, Work long hours and boost the economy but their are little incentives to help them, just more and more rules and regulations.",
        "background": "When David Cameron came to power he promised to reduce red tape for small businesses, instead it has increased. It is unfair to place the same legislation on small businesses as large ones as there are not the staff or funds to deal with this.\r\n\r\nEncourage small business, don\u2019t break their backs!",
