Currently there is only one average speed camera which is Exeter bound, there are none Plymouth bound. A reduction in speed limit would also reduce the seriousness of injuries in the regular collisions which occur on this road.",
        "background": "The volume of crashes on the A38 in Devon is a daily issue. Due to the layout of certain sections of the road, such as a Splatford Split, a reduction in speed limit should be imposed to protect motorists.",
