        "additional_details": "Asia Bibi was arrested in 2010 and sentenced to death for blasphemy. In 2018 a court found her innocent and accepted that all charges had been fabricated because she refused to convert to Islam. The PM, Imran Khan, caved in to extremists by refusing to allow her and her family to leave the country. Two politicians who supported her have been killed, and Asia and her family are in danger. The UK government should request her immediate release and offer her and her family asylum.",
        "background": "Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian, spent 8 years on death row for faked blasphemy charges. Although found innocent she's in protective custody as extremists are trying to kill her. Imran Khan refuses to let her leave the country. The UK should offer her asylum and campaign for her immediate release.",
