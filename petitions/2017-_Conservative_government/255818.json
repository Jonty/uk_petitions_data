The house is 60% remain and as such are trying to stop Brexit using every trick in their books and making up new rules as they go along. Anything to stop Brexit from happening. By only allowing the options to accept a deal whether it be Mrs May's deal or any other deal they can get a majority for or no deal can the house honour the referendum result of 2016.",
