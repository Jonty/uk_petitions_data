It is clear that the actions of the killer were malicious and not those of wild foxes, with the case being closed there is no closure for families affected and the killer will continue with no consequences. This case NEEDS to be reopened before the killer continues to commit disturbing offences and moves onto larger victims.",
        "background": "The Croydon Cat Killer has been mutilating cats and other animals for three years, with over 500 victims. The case has recently been closed by Scotland Yard with the conclusion that it was foxes committing these murders.",
