        "action": "Grant paid sick leave for women who experience miscarriages and abortions.",
        "additional_details": "Many women who go through miscarriages and abortions are faced with the difficult situation of being in too much pain and trauma to go into work but being unable to afford taking 1-3 unpaid sick days off work. They are then effectively forced to attend work in a weak and unwell state as though of normal health and fitness, thereby having a negative impact on themselves and their performance. \r\n\r\nThis petition seeks legal recognition and support of the natural experiences faced by women.",
        "background": "To be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), an employee must be off work sick for 4 or more days in a row. If an employee is off sick for between 1-3 days, they will not be paid.\r\n\r\nWomen experiencing miscarriages and abortions should be granted SSP effective from the 1st day they are off work sick",
