        "additional_details": "Exams should adapt to be about the processing of information and tailored to groups of subjects as some subjects like pharmacology will need facts to be memorised. In other subjects that require equations or simple statistics information should be given as search engines are available in most workplaces and people often learn equations or statistics for the exam and forget them quickly. By saving time on being taught these we can be taught how to process harder information further qualifying us.",
        "background": "In the workplace there is often access to fast and accurate search engines like google. Here the way you process the information is more important than knowing simple facts which can be found in a matter of seconds. Exams should adapt to be more about processing data in the appropriate sections.",
