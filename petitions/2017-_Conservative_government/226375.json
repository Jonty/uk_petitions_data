        "additional_details": "The West Midlands Ambulance Service state that in a huge majority of cases, \"ambulance crews will voluntarily stop their breaks in order to get to immediately life threatened patients quickly\". \r\n\r\nSource: https://wmas.nhs.uk/about-wmas/patient-safety/nhs-ambulance-service-rest-and-meal-breaks/\r\n\r\nThe Government should make a campaign to encourage the public to let paramedics skip queues in shops while they are on their break.",
        "background": "Resources for the emergency services are being stretched already. Some paramedics work 12 hour shifts, and get from 15 minute to 45 minute breaks. However, demand often outstrips available ambulances, and a lot of paramedics voluntarily stop their break earlier to get to a life threatened patient.",
