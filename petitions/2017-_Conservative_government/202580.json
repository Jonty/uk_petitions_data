        "action": "Examine Greybull's actions in respect of insolvency of Monarch Airline/Holidays.",
        "additional_details": "We question the entire involvement of Greybull Capital in respect of Monarch. From reports it would appear that both prior and post insolvency the UK Government have pumped millions of pounds into Greybull Capital and although Greybull state they have lost out in excess of \u00a3100 million it is reported that Monarch had \u00a348 million in the bank and aircraft take off and landing slots will be worth at least \u00a360 million to Greybull. These figures alone equate to greater than \u00a3100 million.",
        "background": "Monarch ceased trading on Monday 2 October 2017, leaving 2,000 employees without jobs and 860,000 passengers without flights. This is Greybull\u2019s third venture that has failed and the largest failure in British aviation history.",
