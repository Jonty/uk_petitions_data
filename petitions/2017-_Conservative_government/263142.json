She was thrilled to be given that all important \"all clear\" status. \r\nTo have that news and two months later find that the cancer had spread. Is simply devastating and really cruel. If she was given a full scan after both breast cancers it would have almost certainly been treatable as the doctor believed it had been there since the first cancer two years earlier and had gone unnoticed.",
        "background": "My lovely Mum fought off two lots of breast cancer over a two year period. She was given the all clear in March. In May, when her health declined we found it had spread to her lungs and liver. At no point was she given a full body scan to confirm this until it was too late. She died a week later.",
