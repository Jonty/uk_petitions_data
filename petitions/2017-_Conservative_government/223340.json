        "action": "Reduce the TV license fee and privatise the BBC",
        "additional_details": "Our proposal is to make the BBC a privately funded channel, as all others are, with commercials and/or subscription fees. Approximately 11% of license fees are spent on the infrastructure and broadcasting equipment, the rest is spent on BBC programming and administation,  and chasing license fees. \r\n\r\nBy making the BBC private, more people will be able to watch live TV without having to pay a hefty fee for a service they don't use.",
        "background": "The BBC was created as a government funded TV channel when there were very few other options. Today, with hundreds of alternative channels, the BBC is not needed.\r\n\r\nThe TV license should ONLY be for maintenance of broadcasting equipment, and the BBC should be self funded like all other TV channels.",
