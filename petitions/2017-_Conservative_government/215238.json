        "action": "Abolish all subsidies for shotgun and firearms licences",
        "additional_details": "The cost of a firearms licence has, for some reason, barely risen since 2001. The cost of a shotgun licence renewal is \u00a349 but police forces put the cost of administration at around \u00a3200, leaving already stretched police forces, and of course ourselves, with unnecessary costs. The full cost of administrating licensing should be borne by the license holders.",
        "background": "The cost for a shotgun licence and renewal currently does not cover the full costs of licensing, leaving the public to pick up the shortfall. This is clearly unacceptable, especially when you consider that the majority of us have no interest in killing animals for enjoyment",
