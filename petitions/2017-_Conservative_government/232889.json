        "action": "Landlords should make a compulsory fee of \u00a310 from rents to support homelessness",
        "additional_details": "With London\u2019s population of 8.6 million, 50% of these are in rental properties. The average house price being \u00a3743,000 it is no wonder landlords are cashing in on the ever growing need to rent. \r\nI truly believe that a small percentage of these rental fees would not be missed and would assist homelessness and make a considerable difference ! \r\nPlease sign this petition to support this cause, Our children\u2019s generation need this massive problem rectifying before it\u2019s too late !!!",
        "background": "After seeing the incredible amount of homelessness within London and the obscene rental prices of houses, I want to see it become compulsory for landlords to give \u00a310 out of London and \u00a320 inner London per house to homelessness to fund better shelters / housing / general accomadation !",
