        "additional_details": "Voting in UK national referenda must continue to be restricted to those eligible to vote in a General Election, namely those who are:\r\nRegistered to vote, aged 18 or over on the day of the election (\u2018polling day\u2019), British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizens, resident at an address in the UK (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years) and not legally excluded from voting.",
        "background": "Those calling for a second EU referendum are also calling for the voting franchise to be extended to 16 and 17 year olds, resident EU nationals and all UK citizens resident overseas. This is a cynical move intended to influence the result towards \"remain\", should a second vote be held.",
