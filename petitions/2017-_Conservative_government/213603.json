        "additional_details": "This 'Preliminary Vote' could be in the form of a list of government departments or pressing issues that the country faces. The electorate would vote on their top 3 priorities and this would be collated to provide the future government with a democratic mandate from which to form their manifestos. To date, the people get what they are given. With a preliminary vote on issues of importance the people get to be more involved in driving the political policy of the next parliament.",
        "background": "Give the electorate a preliminary vote in the year before each General Election, that will allow them to choose the agenda of the next parliament & provide the political parties with a 'people's mandate' by which they design their manifestos to serve. For too long the word 'Mandate' has been abused.",
