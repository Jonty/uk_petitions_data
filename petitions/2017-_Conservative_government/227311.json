        "action": "Tax Break for citizens who are renting and do not own a home",
        "additional_details": "Whenever new flats are built some percentage of it goes to council. Then a huge percentage are bought by foreign/local companies. Then whatever flats are left, some of them are bought by people who already have homes. This puts a huge pressure on supply and greatly increases the supply-demand gap that triggers house prices shoot up. Home is a basic necessity as food & water, and therefore it cannot be allowed to become a business. If Government is not doing enough, then people should be compensated.",
        "background": "Government should give tax-breaks to those who are renting. Foreign investment in housing has allowed companies to make housing their business by buying/selling & renting out. This causes house prices and rents to continuously soar and has already made homes unaffordable to middle-class citizens.",
