        "action": "Remove VAT on gym membership",
        "additional_details": "The UK is in the midst of an obesity epidemic, which is putting myriad strains on the NHS. Yet HMRC requires 20% VAT on gym membership. The health benefits of regular exercise are well known.Yet only 15% of people are members of gyms, with fewer still attending regularly. Price is the single biggest determining factor in making the decision to attend a gym. Removing VAT would save 20% on the price, encouraging gym attendance and gym viability, also saving the NHS via a healthier populace.",
        "background": "We need to encourage regular exercise rather than taxing it. 20% of the cost of a gym membership is VAT. Removing VAT will increase gym attendance, make for a healthier population and save the NHS materially by reducing obesity and lifestyle related care costs.",
