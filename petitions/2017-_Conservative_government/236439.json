        "additional_details": "Spice is all too often hidden especially in restaurants where inappropriate levels of spice heat can ruin a whole meal. I have had multiple occasions where a member of staff will assure us that there is no spice in a dish and when it arrives it is necessary to send the food back. Supermarket packaging the ingredients listed as 'spices' (on many foods it cannot be avoided) can hide items which will cause serious effects.",
        "background": "Many people and businesses don't realise the damage done when someone with spice intolerance eats food that may only contain a mild/medium amount of heat. Crohns, IBD and Colitis sufferers may get  digestive upsets, severe pain, intestinal bleeding and need specialist treatment to calm the effects.",
