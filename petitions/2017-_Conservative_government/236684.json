        "action": "Ban human consumption of dog and cat meat to keep the UK ahead in animal welfare",
        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister told The Sun on the 6th August 2018 that she would look closely at the US decision to introduce a ban. Now that US legislation for a ban has been passed, the UK government must commit to consider a ban here. As a nation with the longest history and robust policies on animal welfare, Britain should show leadership and outlaw such consumption. Britain and the US could influence other countries to eradicate dog and cat meat consumption. Please support and sign this petition!",
        "background": "In December 2018, the US banned the human consumption of dog and cat meat. While there is no evidence of such practices in the US or UK, the US has set an example that a global ban is needed. The UK\u2019s PM Theresa May stated that she would look closely at the US decision. The government must act now!",
