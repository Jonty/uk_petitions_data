        "additional_details": "Long waiting times for specialist treatment can not only cause someone with gender dysphoria to go downhill, but it can be so frustrating and upsetting for trans people and their families. It takes a lot of courage to come out as trans and the long waiting times make us feel unimportant. Feeling as if you\u2019re in the wrong body and being so desperate to change is really challenging and I feel like we should be able access support sooner.",
        "background": "I\u2019m a trans young person with mental health difficulties & I\u2019m currently on a 2 year waiting list for a gender identity clinic. I feel like this waiting time is detrimental to my mental health difficulties & the long waiting time isn\u2019t fair on myself or other trans people experiencing the same thing",
