The question was binary, and did not mention the word \"Deal\". The result was that 17,410,742 (51.9%) voters registered their desire to leave the European Union. They did not vote for any type of \"deal\". They simply wanted to leave. Politicians on all sides of the house should respect that, put a stop to the Project Fear lies, and get us out!",

Almost all MPs from both sides agreed that they would respect the result of the referendum. Many MPs are now doing their utmost to overturn the result or not deliver what was voted for.",
