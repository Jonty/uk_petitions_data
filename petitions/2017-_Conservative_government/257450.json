        "action": "Create a new category of UK citizenship for Brexit: \"British European Citizen.\"",
        "additional_details": "There is abundant precedent for the UK granting different classes of  nationality & rights: British Citizen, Overseas Citizen, Dependent Territories Citizen. The EU Referendum saw 17,410,742 individuals vote to leave (51.89%), but it also saw 16,141,241 vote to remain (48.11%). This was only a 3.78% majority. Safeguards for constitutional change like a 2/3rds majority were not mandated. Many non-resident Britons did not get a vote, even though their EU rights did not depend on UK residence.",
        "background": "This would provide a legal framework for Britons to opt to become \u201cBritish European Citizens\u201d (BECs) on Brexit. BECs would have all rights of British Citizens and retain all possible EU rights (freedom of travel, to work in EU). BECs would pay into the EU directly, proportionate to their means.",
