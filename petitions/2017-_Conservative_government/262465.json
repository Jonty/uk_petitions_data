        "additional_details": "EU students make up less than 5% of all students in the UK, so such change will not result in large income for the Universities. It will damage the economy, as net contribution per one EU student is \u00a368,000, with net impact of all international students at \u00a320.3 billion. Annual costs of studying will total \u00a338,000 - \u00a370,000 - average household income in France is \u00a324,500, in Eastern Europe \u00a314,000. EU funds make up 10% of UK's research budget and 20,000 British students study for free in the EU.",
        "background": "The government wants to abolish the access to Home tuition fees and Student Loans to EU students in the UK. This will disallow future enrolment for all but the richest EU students, damage Britain's economy, affect research quality, impair British soft power and increase inequality on the continent.",
