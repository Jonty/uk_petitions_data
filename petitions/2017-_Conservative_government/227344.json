        "additional_details": "Abductions and an intensified crackdown on the opposition is ongoing.\r\n\r\nAs an activist, and with many Zimbabweans I am appealing to the UK parliament and government to: - suspend further economic, bilateral engagement with Zimbabwe's govt until there is clarity on its human rights situation; -recognise the unsafe political environment in Zimbabwe for opposition and activists; -strongly support concerns raised by EU, Zimbabwe Human Rights Groups and the USA on elections in Zimbabwe; put pressure on Zimbabwe's govt to account for the killing of innocent civilians by the army.",
        "background": "There is growing evidence that the outcome of Zimbabwe\u2019s harmonised elections was not a result of a free and fair electoral process. This was followed by post-election violence and the alleged slaughter and beatings of civilians by the army. ",
