        "additional_details": "There are limited suppliers of the pellets for these systems. We have little storage for bags, so I only buy 8 bags a week. This provides my house with approximately 4 hours heat per day. This is insufficient for this time of year. The systems are no longer being manufactured, so it takes over a week to source parts when they break down. A number of houses have small children, and when the system breaks down it could be harmful to their health. I myself have been battling with various moulds.",
        "background": "These systems were implemented in 2006 as a pilot scheme for Housing Executive houses in the area. It was believed that they would be a cheaper and more efficient source of heating for Housing Executive homes. Personally I have found this not to be the case. We spend almost \u00a330 per week.",
