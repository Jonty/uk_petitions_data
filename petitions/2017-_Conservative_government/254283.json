People with short term memory find it very difficult to manage there own basic care.It is therefore by definition discriminated against unfairly when assessing fees. The present NHS system is convoluted,obstructive and set up to ensure as few people as possible qualify and the they can pass the cost to social services which is means tested. The NHS has a duty of care to provide this care at the point of need.",
