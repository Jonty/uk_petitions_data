        "additional_details": "Britain will never heal from the Brexit divisions unless we can talk calmly about our differences. \r\nThe language of parliament sets the tone for the debate elsewhere and it is incumbent on political parties to show restraint. \r\nThis article http://theconversation.com/traitors-betrayal-surrender-british-politics-now-dripping-with-terms-that-fuel-division explains more. \r\nWe call on all parties to commit to avoiding the above terms, and military language generally, when discussing Brexit.",
        "background": "We are concerned about political violence marring an upcoming election. We want all parties to end aggressive, military language when discussing Brexit options, including 'traitor' 'surrender' 'betrayal' and 'coup'. We believe that parliament needs to set an example to the country.",
