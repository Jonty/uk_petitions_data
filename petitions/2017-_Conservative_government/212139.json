        "additional_details": "On Thursday 14th of June a Spanish writing exam of 1 hour 15 minutes takes place in the morning. On Friday 15th of June the Physics Paper 2 which is an hour and 15 minuted takes place in the morning. The Eid prayer is usually held at 9:00 am and lasts roughly an hour. It would be hard to carry out the main principle of Eid as the timings of exams are at the same time and the Exact date of Eid is unknown due to not knowing the exact moon sightings yet and it could be on either one of the dates.",
        "background": "As you may be aware Ramadan and Eid-ul-Fitr coincide with the 2018 GCSEs. The Eid celebration will most likely fall on Thursday 14th of June or 15th of June. However there  are exams in the Morning of both these days and the principle of Eid is reading the Eid prayer which occurs at the same time.",
