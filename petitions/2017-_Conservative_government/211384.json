        "additional_details": "It\u2019s no accident that the senior finance management of the large companies concerned are mainly ex-\u2018Big Four\u2019 themselves.   It is not hard to imagine an unspoken agreement or mutual understanding between both parties.  For example, the company will minimise the exposure of audit firm\u2019s work to unnecessary financial litigation if things go wrong and in return, the firm\u2019s audit work or opinion will not expose the company to any unwanted scrutiny from the industry regulator and any na\u00efve investors.",
        "background": "As illustrated recently by Carillion and numerous other major corporate failures before it, the \u2018Big Four\u2019 independent audit opinion has been confirmed again as nothing more than a farce and inherently flawed. Only the NAO or firms outside the \u2018Big Four\u2019 should conduct audits.",
