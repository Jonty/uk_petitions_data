        "action": "Legalize cannabis for recreational use after we leave the EU. As per Canada",
        "additional_details": "Cannabis has been shown in recent news and with results in Canada, Colorado etc to be highly beneficial to health, economy and public moral. To allow recreational use encourages new businesses and jobs, fueling our high streets. Desirable tourism from around the world as in Amsterdam. Frees up police money and officers. Everyone's in a better mood generally. Cancer gets a kicking from something that's naturally avaliable. Hemp plastics bio-degrade saving the planet. We already grow the most here",
        "background": "Cannabis has become so wildly used in the UK that it's not policed at a consumer level. It was estimated that in 2017 close to 5 million UK residents where smoking Cannabis regularly. This increases every year. With Brexit looming it would seem prudent to get it in the shops and subject to VAT.",
