        "action": "Ban the use of unsustainable palm oil in products sold within the UK",
        "additional_details": "There is a lot being done by local charities and conservationists but there is little help when multinational corporations can afford to do almost anything they like. We, as British Citizens, must do more to affect the demand for products containing palm oil and stop the degredation of these rainforests. In an ever-conscious world, there is no excuse to be making decisions that affect our planet in such a catastrophic way. We are the cause and we can be solution.",
        "background": "As we are all aware, the exploitation of natural rain-forests is prominent in the production of palm oil. The rainforests of Borneo are thought to be up to 130 million years old and provide a home for around 1,200 animals, of which 100 are endemic.",
