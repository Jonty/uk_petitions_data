        "additional_details": "Those of us who want to leave the EU have been left feeling let down by how this process has been going so far.  There has been very weak leadership concerning Brexit, They are not keeping to the Lancaster House Speech.  If you feel that you are being let down by this Government over Brexit please sign this petition so that the Government is more aware of what we actually voted for at our most important referendum in recent history.",
        "background": "When i voted to leave the EU and Article 50 was triggered many of us believed that we would be out of the EU by 2019,  Whilst some of us agree that a transition period is needed, we do not want to be further controlled by ECJ laws.  Theresa May is going against the will of the people in the UK.",
