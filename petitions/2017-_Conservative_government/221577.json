        "additional_details": "Bringing housing associations in line with the FOI act would mean that any requests for information relating to services that the residents wholly pay for, could not be refused outright and would be subject to intervention from the ICO.  This would enable more than 200,000 people to easily access information about their homes that they own in partnership with housing associations and therefore have more say in the running and the maintenance expenditure of their homes.",
        "background": "I pay a service charge for property maintenance on my shared ownership property which is owned by a housing association. This service is contracted out to 3rd party. I recently asked for information relating to this arrangement and have been refused on the grounds that it is commercially sensitive.",
