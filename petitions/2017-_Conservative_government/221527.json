        "action": "Clamp down on sexual harassment in clubs with nationally enforced regulations",
        "additional_details": "My suggestion is either existing staff are redistributed or new bouncers appointed to monitor the inside of the clubs. These bouncers would be easily visible so women can report any perpetuators without trouble and feel more safe and comfortable on nights out. Funding required in some cases could be provided by the government",
        "background": "Sexual harassment is an endemic issue faced by women on nights out in this country. It is disgraceful in 2018 that persistent unwanted attention and groping are just part of going out for women. Clubs and live music venues must appoint trained staff inside their premises to combat this issue",
