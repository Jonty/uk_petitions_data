        "additional_details": "The recent documentary on ITV shows what can happen in inpatient hospitals. The lack of training is appalling. Patients are at crisis point & need the right care & support. The Government must review the minimum standards required to provide proper care and pass a law to ensure that all staff are suitably qualified. It's critical that staff know how to handle people with severe mental illnesses. We need staff who are equipped with the right tools to help people who need it most.",
        "background": "Many inpatient facilities across the UK are very inadequate. This includes the level of training for the staff that work there. Teenagers & adults at their most vulnerable are put into hospital to keep them safe but sadly that isn\u2019t always the case & something needs to be done.",
