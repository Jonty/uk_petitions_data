        "additional_details": "Remain had foreign influence from high profile people including US President Barack Obama saying we would be back of the line for trade if we left the EU and the 2016 Presidential election candidate Hillary Clinton who was also urging people to vote to stay in.\r\n\r\nWhy has the leave side been constantly targeted for this when the remain side overspent by a bigger margin yet nothing has been said or done about it?",
        "background": "Remoaners keep claiming the Leave side in the 2016 Referendum broke spending rules and there was foreign influence yet nothing has been said or done about the remain side doing the same thing.  Remain overspent even before including the extra \u00a39 million taxpayers money spent on the pro EU booklets.",
