        "action": "Revoke IRA letters of comfort or provide the same to British soldiers.",
        "additional_details": "The letters of comfort were provided for purely political reasons, without legal process and following private discussion UK Government and Sinn Fein. In July 2013, Lady Justice Hallett said that controversial scheme was \"unprecedented and flawed\" with \"significant systemic failures\". In order to restore legal balance and natural justice The Government is required to revoke the letters of comfort or to supply the same instruments to British soldiers now facing prosecution in NI.",
        "background": "IRA criminals were given letters of comfort in circa 1998 by the contemporary government for its own political purposes. A number of British soldiers are facing prosecution in relation to historical events in NI. This is an imbalance in criminal process and an offence against natural justice.",
