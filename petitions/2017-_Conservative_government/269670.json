        "additional_details": "It has been seen many times that a parent often has to choose between paying court fees or paying child support.\r\n\r\nAs child maintenance is seen as a legal responsibility this takes precedence meaning some parents don\u2019t have enough funding to apply for a Child Arrangement Order.\r\n\r\nThose finding themselves in this situation should be able to have the court fees waivered to make Child Arrangement Orders accessible to all parents.",
        "background": "Parents paying Child Maintenance cannot always afford to pay for a Child Arrangement Order to be heard by the court as well. Waiving the costs for those paying their Child Maintenance would make the process for parents a more equal opportunity in accessing their children through the courts.",
