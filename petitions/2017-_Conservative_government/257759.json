After childcare it would equal that i was working full time for \u00a32 an hour, leaving me with no choice but to work part time hours.",
        "background": "After Single or joint parents take home a reasonable salary no help with childcare is provided. People that are single, not working and claiming benefits can apply for 15 hours free child care when their child hits two. Surely this would benefit full time working parents no matter what the wage.",
