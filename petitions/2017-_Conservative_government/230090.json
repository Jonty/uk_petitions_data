        "action": "Put mandatory ethical labelling on all imported consumer goods",
        "additional_details": "This labelling would empower shoppers who are unknowingly helping to destroy the environment and exploit some of the poorest workers in the developing world by buying products which they do not know are unethical. Industries from food to fashion are relentlessly driving for profit no matter what the cost. A new easily understood and comprehensive system of labelling would inform decisions and transform the lives of millions of people.",
        "background": "The British Government should introduce a compulsory \u2018ethical labelling\u2019 system on all imported items, similar to the \u2018traffic-light\u2019 system used in food.This would cover four areas of concern: worker pay; human welfare; environmental impact and animal cruelty.",
