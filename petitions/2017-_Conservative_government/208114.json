        "additional_details": "The Police can only advise shopkeepers on security and not enforce it, and the stand alone ATM\u2019s do not have trackers fitted or \u2018Smart\u2019 Water. I am asking for these cash machines to be removed from shops, and the initial temptation for these criminals will also be removed. Livelihoods, jobs, are all disrupted. Bank / Post office branch cash machines are better installed and are rarely raided, we live in a world where we pay for things via apps, so cash is not that essential.",
        "background": "Everyday the news and social media are reporting on the increasing crime of Ram Raids on shops for the stand alone cash machines (ATM). Some of these shops have been targeted more than once. This has to stop, and the only way we can help, is to have the stand alone machines removed from shops now.",
