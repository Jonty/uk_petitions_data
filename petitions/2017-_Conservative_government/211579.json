        "action": "Remove VAT from home insulation and damp proofing products.",
        "additional_details": "The laws of physics and the governments own agencies agree with the priorities for energy efficiency and reduction of environmental cost/ damage.\r\nRemoval of VAT would be the single, simplest and most effective action whilst avoiding the high administration cost of the more complex and corruptible schemes.",
        "background": "Home insulation, damp proofing and draught exclusion are the top three most effective and simple means of reducing energy cost and emissions whilst improving environmental health.\r\nCharging VAT on insulation, damp proofing and draught exclusion is hobbling those who do most to help the environment.",
