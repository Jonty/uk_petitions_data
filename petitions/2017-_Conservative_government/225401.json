        "action": "The electorate demand a vote of no confidence in Theresa May.",
        "additional_details": "In recent history, nothing has divided our nation as much as the referendum to exit the European Union. This vote offered the electorate an opportunity to forge our own path in history. Regardless of our own opinions, our society is built on democracy. The people spoke. Brexit is what the majority wants. That being said, I do not believe either side are happy with the way our PM is handling this situation. She needs to listen to the wishes and demands of the electorate, or allow someone else to.",
        "background": "This petition is not about being a Remainer or a Brexiteer. It is about our elected representatives ability to prevent an economical disaster falling on the United Kingdom. I believe Theresa May no longer has the support of the electorate and should be forced to reconsider her plan, or step down.",
