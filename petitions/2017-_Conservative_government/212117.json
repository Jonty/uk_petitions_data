        "action": "Improve post natal care for all women with pelvic floor and abdominal check ups",
        "additional_details": "Women's health physio's are perfect professionals for assessing, and treating the mother post natally. They can check many concerns like scar tissue healing, gynae health and abdominal separation issues. Sadly mothers are being left without anyone to talk to about incontinence, prolapse,diastasis recti problems and all of these can be prevented or at least symptoms managed to avoid surgery further down the line. Providing care at this stage will save the NHS money in the long run.",
        "background": "I gave birth at the end of last year to my second child and was shocked by a letter from my GP saying unless I had \"persistent bleeding/pain or wanted contraception\" a routine 6 weeks check up was not required. This left me with no checks post major abdominal surgery which is very worrying.",
