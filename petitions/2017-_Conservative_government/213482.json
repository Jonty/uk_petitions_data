        "action": "Introduce a new Act of Parliament to protect freedom of religion and belief.",
        "additional_details": "The UK led the world in developing freedom of religion, and in spreading the idea of religious freedom around the world. Today, that heritage is being turned upside down and we are turning our backs on our history. We are seeing an increasingly intolerant secular humanism and anti-Christian prejudice, often called Christianophobia, in the UK. We need to tackle this violence and prejudice towards practising Christians in the UK.",
        "background": "Freedom of religion and belief in the UK is under attack. It is time for a new generation to rise up and reclaim this great heritage of religious freedom and for the UK Parliament to pass a new Act affirming our religious freedom.",
