        "action": "Make an unlawful killing law for killing pets.",
        "additional_details": "Recently our family pet (dog) was killed by another dog owner who was 'trying to separate' six excited, playing dogs (3 of them his own) with a small branch/large stick laying nearby. He killed our dog Louie with one hit on the head. The R.S.P.C.A. say it wasn't cruelty as Louie died instantly and the police are not pursuing a prosecution. This has caused a lot of distress to the family and a lot of concern locally. A new law or a clearer defining of current laws are urgently needed.",
        "background": "Our 'family pet' was killed without justifiable cause. We have received unsatisfactory help from the 'authorities'. I feel a change in the law is needed.",
