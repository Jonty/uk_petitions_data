        "additional_details": "Following the example of Switzerland, allowing the electorate access to either creating or striking law by a declared referendum (say if 2%, 900,000 voters, of the electorate sign a petition, it proceeds to referendum). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_Switzerland\r\n\r\nReferendum rules and regulations can be set accordingly, minimum voter turnout settings certainly applied. In a system designed by humans, even the Sovereign must be checked in case of error.",
        "background": "The electorate - those citizens of voting age, represent the clearest united voice of a society. Representative democracy presents systemic risks to the law of the land. Allowing for an additional branch of Government to check and balance elected representatives would limit suffering and injustice.",
