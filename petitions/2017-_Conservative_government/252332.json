        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson described Theresa May\u2019s deal as worse than EU membership, but as soon as a there is a vacancy for the job of Prime Minister he backed the deal. \r\n\r\nHe has likened gay marriage to bestiality, he called  black people \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with watermelon smiles, and Muslim women letterboxes. \r\n\r\nHe has no interest in the betterment of society, and is solely concerned with his own career and power. \r\n\r\nWe can and must do so much better than Boris Johnson as a leader of our country.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson is a fraud, only interested in his own furtherment. He is entirely unfit to be Prime Minister of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",
