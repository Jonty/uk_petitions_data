        "action": "Put tuition fees back to \u00a33000 per year",
        "additional_details": "The government claims that this is no problem as there are loans, yet it is obvious with this year's decreasing number of people going to university that no one sees the benefit. Students can no longer afford a fun night out: they must work to top up their maintenance loan, and although the standard of tuition may have risen due to concern on whether it is value for money, the cost is putting the most disadvantaged off going as they can't face having all the debt.",
        "background": "The cost of university tuition is ridiculous. Along with the scrapping of the maintenance grant, students can expect to be saddled with up to \u00a350000 debt. \u00a33000 per year can ensure that universities maintain high standards whilst students don't have to break the bank (as much).",
