        "additional_details": "In Iceland, companies and government agencies with more than 25 staff must now obtain government certification of their equal pay policies.\r\n\r\nIn light of recent debate around the gender pay gap in the UK, including the resignation of BBC's Carrie Gracie, this would be an important step towards ensuring that equality laws are being complied with.\r\n\r\nSince workers rarely know what their colleagues are getting paid, it is all too easy for employers to get away with paying unfair wages.",
        "background": "Iceland recently became the first country in the world to make companies prove they are not paying women less than men for the same work. \r\n\r\nThis year, the 100th anniversary of women's right to vote, is a perfect time for the UK to strengthen its own equality laws.",
