        "additional_details": "A single supplement for holidays should not be charged if the room/cabin in a hotel/ship can only accommodate one person, a small supplement should only be raised if it is a double/twin being used by one person and then it should only be a small percentage above the cost for one person. With some single supplements it can be cheaper for a couple to go on holiday than a single person. Some single people are not single by choice if they have lost a loved one and these charges add extra stress.",

It is already illegal to discriminate on the basis of marital status, although decisions on charging for single occupancy rooms or single supplements would not be based on this criteria.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition making it illegal for businesses to charge a single supplement for travel and accommodation, if that is what you would like to achieve. Or, if there are other examples of discrimination, you could start a petition on that."
