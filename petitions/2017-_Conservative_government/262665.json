        "action": "Delay Parliament's summer recess until a decision on leaving the EU is reached.",
        "additional_details": "The leadership contest in the Tory party means leaving the EU will take a back seat until the end of July at the earliest. The EU have made it clear they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. The only way of providing enough time for Parliament to reach an agreement is for it to delay it's holiday. MPs have a crucial job to do which will affect the country for many generations. They have a moral duty to do everything they can to reach an agreement, including the loss of their holiday.",
        "background": "Parliament must agree on leaving the EU by 31 October or the UK will leave with 'No deal'. Parliament has consistently voted against this scenario but there is only a very short time in parliamentary terms to find an agreement. The summer and September recesses limit time available to a few weeks.",
