        "additional_details": "Eating disorders (ED) can effect people for years or lifetimes depending on the severity. It is known that the sooner someone is treated, the more likely it is for the individual to recover. However, services continue to reject 1/4 of individuals who are referred to them and offer them no support until their illness gets to a life threatening stage. This will immensely impact their mental health and make them feel invalid. Thus ED's have the highest fatality rate out of mental health illnesses.",
        "background": "In eating disorder services you get assessed to see the severity of the illness. If the individual does not reach a critically low weight required for treatment, that is a high risk to the individuals health, they will be rejected with no further support. This often causes the illness to decline.",
