        "additional_details": "A family member purchased a bakery item and gave it to my child. One hour after eating, my son passed out from an allergic reaction. Had the label clearly showed the ingredients, this could have been avoided. This could have been so much worse had it been another child/person. I want allergy info on all food items.",
        "background": "Food such as bakery items made in store that are left on the shelf for consumers to buy do not have to have allergen information. The stores cover themselves by having a small sign on shelf to imply the risk of contamination or ingredients, but the item itself doesn\u2019t contain any such information.",
