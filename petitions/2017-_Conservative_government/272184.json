        "additional_details": "The freedom of assembly, association and religious activities in HK have been violated since 9 Jun. Human rights were forsaken. The police even went to school to intimidate students in Sep. The Red Terror in Cathay Pacific illustrates that freedom of speech has been invaded seriously.\r\nAfter the handover, the rule of law and the political system in HK has been ruined. China has not only failed to fulfill the Sino-British Joint Declaration, but also triggered humanitarian crisis in HK.",
        "background": "According to the statement in the G7 Summit, The Sino-British Joint Declaration is not just a historical document. It is a legal binding document, an international treaty still in force. I request The United Kingdom to reinstate jurisdiction of Hong Kong under the contract.",
