        "additional_details": "Despite the fact that straight couples can both go on the birth certificate even when the father isn\u2019t biological and they do not require being married at time of conception. I find this totally out of order and it should be the same across the board. I am calling out for people to bring this to the governments attention so I can go on our child\u2019s birth certificate and many other LGBT families can receive the same treatment. Please help us get the signatures needed.",
        "background": "Me and my wife couldn\u2019t afford IVF or NHS prices to conceive so we did artificial insemination at home via donor. We were NOT married at time of conception but got married during my wife\u2019s pregnancy. We were told when our baby was born that I was not allowed to be on the birth certificate.",
