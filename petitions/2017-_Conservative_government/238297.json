        "additional_details": "Between 2008 & 2015 the UNHCR estimates 22.5 million people were displaced by climate/weather related events. This number will by all estimations continue to increase, as such events become more frequent due to climate change.\r\n \r\nThe current law is based on international conventions from the 1950s/60s (including the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees). Climate change is happening. This is an opportunity for the UK to be a global pioneer for action to respond to its challenges to humanity.",
        "background": "Currently those forced to leave their home due to environmental processes or disasters are classed only as migrants. This means they face huge barriers to finding a new place to live safely. The UK should update the law to help those affected by climate crises.",
