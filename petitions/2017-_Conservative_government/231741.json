        "additional_details": "\"From the time of the announcement to reduce stakes and its implementation, over \u00a31.6bn will be lost on these machines\u201d\r\n\r\n\"In addition, two people will tragically take their lives every day due to gambling-related problems and, for that reason as much as any other, I believe this delay is unjustifiable.\" - Tracey Couch\r\n\r\nProblem gamblers are often troubled, vulnerable and in self-destruct mode. An addict desires to burn quickly - the 'crack-cocaine' FOBT machines facilitate this B2 gaming/roulette can take \u00a3100 in seconds.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to reduce the misery and risk of losing a loved one",
