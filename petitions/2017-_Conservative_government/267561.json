        "additional_details": "This petition is to bring this to the notice of the Government and to ask this is debated and the present law amended so that the details on a pets microchip are those of the owner and the keeper of the pet, both being one of the same. At present if dogs and other pets are microchipped with the 'keepers' contact details this is not proof of ownership and therefore a rather pointless exercise and no use at all if the pet were stolen unless the 'keeper' can prove ownership by other means.",
        "background": "On April 26th 2016 the Government made it compulsory that owners have their dogs microchipped or face a fine. \r\n\r\nHowever, details on the microchip are not proof of ownership, they are only the details of the 'keeper' of the dog.",
