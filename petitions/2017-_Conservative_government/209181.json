        "additional_details": "- In emergency situations the user can get off/dismount the PELV at any time compared to electric bikes.\r\n \r\n- They only use 250 watts which is exactly the same as an electric bike and travel at 8-12 mph.\r\n \r\n- You are more likely to have an accident on a bicycle than on a scooter which you can get off at any point when ridden sensibly.\r\n \r\n- The Government should consider the reduction of pollution.\r\n",
        "background": "Government should clarify whether or not current law allows electric kick scooters in cycle lanes. If it doesn\u2019t, it should change the law so that they are. These scooters are great way to get about and a good way to reduce pollution and numbers of bicycles locked to every free space possible.\r\n \r\n",
