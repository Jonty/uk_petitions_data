        "additional_details": "I reported my abuser to the police, my doctor, a lawyer and nothing was done. More awareness and training is needed to protect men and women and children. They are usually too scared to make a report to the police for fear of being ridiculed. This is a major crime with devastating effects and victims need to be taken seriously. I was totally humiliated by my abuser over several years, my mental condition and self-worth was at rock bottom.",
        "background": "Victims of Coercive Behaviour are mentally, emotionally and financially abused. The Government must fund a campaign to raise awareness of the effects of coercive behaviour. Police, health care workers, lawyers and others who may meet victims of coercive behaviour also need training.",
