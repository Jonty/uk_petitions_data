The benefits are real, personally and environmentally.  \r\n\r\nThe more people on bikes means less in cars but it would be great if the government would help subsidise ebikes. I know we have the cycle2work scheme but not everyone works, many due to ill-health, not through choice. This is a way of people travelling actively, improving fitness.",
        "background": "Recently I borrowed an ebike from a council scheme. I loved it! Physical constraints limited the amount I could ride, but when I did, I felt mentally and physically lifted. Anything which helps improve physical, mental health, the obesity crisis and reduce pollution is a good thing! \r\nPlease sign.",
