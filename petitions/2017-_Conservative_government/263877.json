        "background": "On most weather forecasts the presenter will usually decide that warm sunny weather is 'gorgeous', 'wonderful' and so on, and cold weather, complete with rain or wind to be 'miserable', 'vile' or similar. \r\n\r\nSome people find those descriptors inaccurate. Therefore the BBC should not use them.",
