        "action": "Cease the subsidised bars in parliament",
        "additional_details": "Parliament has bars that MP's can frequent during work hours, these bars are subsidised by the taxpayer, i.e. we are paying for cheap alcohol for MP's.  Those same MP's are making decisions on the future of our country, your's and mine whilst under the influence.  If you or I drank on the job we would be sacked immediately.  Why on earth should MP's be different?  If anything, they are responsible for passing laws that could be responsible for someones life, can they really do that with alcohol in their bloodstream?",
        "background": "In any profession drinking alcohol during work hours is a sackable offence but it is allowed in parliament.  Not only is it allowed but the taxpayer is subsidising it.  How can we believe our MP's are acting in our best interests when they are allowed to work under the influence of alcohol?",
