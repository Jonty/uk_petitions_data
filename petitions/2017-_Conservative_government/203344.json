        "additional_details": "Many of these people have a hard enough time coping with the after effects of conflicts. I feel they have sacrificed for us so is it really too much to ask to sacrifice having our own fireworks for them? I am not asking for all fireworks to be banned. I feel an organised display is safer and probably a better experience for those who wish to see them. Ultimately though, it allows those who suffer to plan to be away from the things that trigger their fears. Please help. We owe them so much.",
        "background": "Many ex forces have PTSD and cant cope with the sight, smells and sounds of fireworks. Because any adult can legally buy and use them, veterans and serving forces have no way of avoiding them. They have no way of planning to be away from the situation because they don't know when it will happen.",
