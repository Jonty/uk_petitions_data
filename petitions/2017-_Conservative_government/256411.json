The popularity of plastic, which began rising in the 1950s, is growing out of control\u201418.2 trillion pounds of plastic have been produced around the world and there\u2019s no sign of slowing down, considering scientists say that another 26.5 trillion pounds will be produced worldwide by 2050, and it takes forever to decompose.",
        "background": "I am SO heartsick of seeing the awful pollution we are causing to our world and fellow creatures, yet we have limited options for disposing of plastic wrappings which is on EVERYTHING! We CAN dispose of these items in a better way. Just a few kerbside collections bins per street would be a start!",
