        "action": "Tax non-biodegradable plastics considerably higher than biodegradable plastics.",
        "additional_details": "Biodegradable plastic is plastic that will breakdown and is less damaging. Most plastics are non-biodegradable meaning they take a long time or don't breakdown at all. Every plastic ever made is still on Earth. No one knows the damage microplastics will have on humans. Fish are eating it and we eat fish. Plastic isn't good for the environment but biodegradable is better than non-biodegradable. Ring your local MP's and demand change - it is the governments job to listen to the people.",
        "background": "This way companies will be more inclined to use biodegradable plastics because if they don't, in theory their profit will be affected. The world is run by money. The UK is run by money. Companies run because of money, so why not use it to kick start change?",
