        "additional_details": "Feb 2018 more than 120 pregnant female whales were among 333 killed during Japan\u2019s annual summer hunt in Antarctica. Mar 2018, Norway has announced a 28% increase of its annual whaling quota to 1,278 whales to revive the declining hunt amid international controversy. Jun 2018, Iceland\u2019s whaling season have granted its whalers a quota of 161 fin whales in 2018, compared to 150 in 2017. Jul 2018, Icelandic Whalers kill an endangered Blue Whale...a protected species.",
        "background": "These countries are hunting a protected species on the pretense they're for scientific research. In reality the Whale meat is for public consumption. The three countries actually trade the meat between themselves despite an international trade ban. Whaling quotas are actually increasing.",
