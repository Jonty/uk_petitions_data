        "additional_details": "Https://helptheworld.live The proposal explains how governments can work on grants from their national banks and not worry about paying these funds back. National banks should not be restricted in their money generating capabilities and should be able to produce as much funds as their governments require as long as they spend this money on public services and good causes. This way everyone can have better living standards and we can get everyone out of poverty lot more quicker.",
        "background": "Governments don\u2019t have enough money cause they are restricted in their money making capabilities. We want to make them have unlimited funds through their national banks and not be reliant on us or businesses. These funds should not be used on bad causes but only on good causes like public services.",
