        "additional_details": "Making microchipping mandatory for cats over the age of 3 months will go a long way to reuniting lost or deceased pets and will reduce the number of cats living on the streets.\r\n\r\nThe government is already looking into making it mandatory for any deceased cat found to be scanned for a chip but without chips being law, it is only helping part of the problem.",
        "background": "There is currently no law for microchipping a cat to its owner in the UK, like there is with dogs. Thousands of cats are stolen, go missing or are killed on the roads every year. There is also a massive stray cat population that is only getting bigger due to cats not being neutered or spayed.",
