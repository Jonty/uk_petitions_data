        "additional_details": "To fix this I believe we should include oral testing with an examiner, or if you prefer coursework, then you can do coursework while maintaining the capability of what you can get in A level. This would give students the opportunity to choose the testing method that best suits their capabilities. \r\nWe need to stop limiting the creativity of our generation. We weren't made to be programmed like machines with knowledge, then check if our knowledge was retained, then continue that cycle.",
        "background": "I believe that the school testing systems need a serious change. The main way of testing are by exam papers, but this method of testing isn\u2019t adaptable to everyone\u2019s specific strengths, since you could be a mathematical genius but fail your exam papers.",
