        "additional_details": "This debate is the opportunity to recognise how they lost public trust and what they must do now to persuade the public to trust again. This crisis of trust has been building over decades and has only served to make current events even more polarising. Now only 19% of the public trust Politicians to tell the truth (Ipsos MORI). Trust will not be found in new policies, committees or changing our constitution, but only by each politician taking personal responsibility to rebuild it, as a priority",
        "background": "Are Politicians aware of the scale of collapse in public trust in politics? It\u2019s the immediate and greatest threat to our democracy, yet they never talk of it. There is a real fear for Society if trust in politics is not rebuilt urgently. How this debate is used will define the future of generations",
