        "additional_details": "It is estimated that there are half a million cats living in London, roughly two pigeons per cat. \r\nThey have feet and wings, which pretty much make them invincible. Anywhere I can go, they can go faster.\r\nHaving moved to London two years ago, I've noticed that the pigeons specifically in London are more destructive, remorseless and unruly.\r\nI can no longer go to parks, markets, rivers or open spaces with food around. They cull the monkeys in Gibraltar, we should do the same for pigeons!",
        "background": "Pigeons are taking over the City of London, you physically cannot escape them. For someone like myself, who has sever ornithophobia (a fear of pigeons), I am unable to feel safe in my own City! \r\nThey are flying rats in the sky, who carry and spread diseases as well as terrorise citizens.",
