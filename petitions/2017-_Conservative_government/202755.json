        "action": "Allow carers to study more than 21 hours a week and claim Carers Allowance",
        "additional_details": "There are 168 hours in each week, so even after deducting 35 hours of caring this still leaves 133 hours which the carer should be able to spend as they wish without restriction in the same way that anyone in paid employment can. It is completely feasible that a carer can provide the number of caring hours required to meet the eligibility for Carers Allowance and still study full time around their caring role.\r\nPlease see the film by Lucy Prentice and other young adult carers at www.fixers.org.uk",
        "background": "Carers cannot be in full time education and claim Carers Allowance even if they are caring for the 35-hours a week to make them eligible for this benefit. \r\nThis particularly discriminates against young adult carers reaching their full potential in life. \r\nSee www.fixers.org.uk (Lucy Prentice)",
