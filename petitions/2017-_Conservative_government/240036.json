        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon Parliament to debate the illegal industrial sized fly-tipping that blights our nation. Specifically, the petition calls for Parliament to debate: \r\n\r\n(i)   Whether the relevant enforcement agencies are adequately resourced to enforce existing legislation?\r\n(ii)  Whether current legislation is being implemented robustly by Her Majesty's Court Service?\r\n(iii) Whether Parliament needs to consider passing new legislation to provide an effective deterrent?",
        "background": "Millions of pounds of taxpayer's money is spent clearing up behind these unscrupulous criminals, the current legislation does not appear to be an effective deterrent.\r\n\r\nThe cost of clearance to local authorities in England in 2017/18 was \u00a312.2 million, for large fly-tipping incidents.",
