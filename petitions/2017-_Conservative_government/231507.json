A recurring explanation \u2013 they were too young. \r\n\r\nBreast cancer screening is about detecting cancer at an early stage, before there are any symptoms \u2013 or even worse, metastases. While this might not prevent the disease, it can help improve the chance of survival because a small, locally growing lesion is easier to treat than an invasive cancer. \u2013 Siemans Healthineers",
