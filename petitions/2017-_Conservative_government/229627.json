        "additional_details": "The new Growth Corridor from Oxford to Cambridge involves doubling of the region\u2019s population by 2050 & adds 300,000 new houses to Oxfordshire's current housing stock, far in excess of any local need. \r\nThe public hasn't been consulted on these New Towns or on a new Expressway across Green Belt & unspoilt open countryside. \r\nParliament must debate the full costs of the road, new schools, hospitals and services needed for this doubling of Oxfordshire's population before any decision to go ahead.",
        "background": "Instead, the proposed \u00a33.5 Billions of Government spending should be directed to improving & modernising existing roads and railways, concentrating on measures to reduce noise and air pollution and improve traffic flows and road junctions. Full public consultation must precede any decision.",
