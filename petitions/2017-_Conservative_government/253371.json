        "action": "Ensure the Prime Minister keeps her promise to deliver Brexit in March 2019.",
        "additional_details": "The damage that parliament has done to its already strained relationship with the electorate, is almost beyond repair. Never in living memory has there been such disconnect between voters & their elected representatives &, if untruths are allowed to go unchecked then our democracy is dead.\r\nBusiness thrives on certainty and the certainty of leaving the EU has now been replaced by an uncertain extension. This will damage investment in UK business & make jobs more insecure than leaving under WTO.",
        "background": "The PM has stated over 100 times in parliament & in her manifesto that, \"Brexit will be delivered on 29/03/2019.\" If she now reneges on those numerous instances of her promise to the electorate, then she has shamelessly lied to the public, to parliament, and to her party members.",
