Thankfully, the child did not require a defibrillator this particular time however the nearest one was over a five minute drive to return with one which could have been needed to save his life. The school is now installing one but the situation should not have got to that point.",
        "background": "It is an unjust that schools have to somehow find funding, sometimes through fundraising themselves to be able to afford to have a defibrillator installed on their premises. Our government needs to mandatory require their local councils to ensure their perspective schools have one.",
