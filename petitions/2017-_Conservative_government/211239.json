        "additional_details": "It's time Parliament dragged itself into the 21st century.  By relocating to Birmingham in the centre of Britain, government can truly represent all the people and not just the elite, privileged few.  \r\nEstimated costs to refurbish the existing Palace of Westminster are unacceptable:\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/28/mps-to-vote-on-vacating-parliament-building-in-need-of-refurbishment\r\nA modern debating chamber is essential for fair government.",
        "background": "The existing Palace of Westminster is no longer 'fit for purpose'.  The adversarial debating chamber is archaic and the infrastructure needs total upgrading.  The proposed cost for refurbishment could be spent on a new building in Birmingham, the centre of Britain.",
