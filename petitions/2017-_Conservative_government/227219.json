Every news station showed this, the BBC never even mentioned it, but continued to have the debate against Boris. So we the licence payer are robbed of all news except that which suits the agenda of the BBC. I am paying a compulsory licence to receive propaganda only. Disgraceful and the government should stop this now.",
        "background": "It wants to remain in the EU and won't show the leave view in a fair way, like question time where the audience is always on the side of the BBC view. The balance of remain or leave on the panel is always in remain favour.",
