        "additional_details": "\u2022Donald Trump has used the platform of Twitter to express opinions, despite condemnation from his own Government and military leaders about the damage it could cause.\r\n\u2022Britain should be seen to lead by example and rescind his State Visit. This would send a clear message to Washington that these statements - no matter who makes them - will not be allowed or tolerated in the UK.\r\n\u2022Hosting a State Visit for such an unpopular leader would be an embarrassment to HM the Queen, the PM & the UK at large.",
        "background": "The British Government should rescind its current invitation of a State Visit to Donald Trump due to his repeated inflammatory statements.\r\n\r\nHe has not treated the UK - or its PM - with respect/courtesy, and as a result, should not be allowed the honour of a State Visit for the foreseeable future.",
