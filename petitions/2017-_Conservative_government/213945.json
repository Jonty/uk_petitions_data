It is very easy for receiving parent to get more money and affect child live routine, only by reduce, control and manipulate the time that child spends with paying parent.\r\nTo solve this issue both parents must agree and communicate with CMS about the time that child spends with them. Or a receiving parent must provide an evidence if/why does not agree for the child to spend the time with paying parent",
