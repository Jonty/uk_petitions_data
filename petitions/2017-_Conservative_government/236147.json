        "additional_details": "90% of people now donate directly from their bloodstream, in a procedure known as peripheral blood stem cell donation (PBSC)\r\n\r\nThere is no government public campaign highlighting this important detail.\r\nThere are many who have never been informed that there is such a register. Yet a high number of those who do are discouraged by the myth that by donating, it is a very painful procedure. \r\nThere are more life savers out there. The government must invest in raising awareness surrounding this subject.",
        "background": "Currently only 2% of people in the UK are registered as stem cell donors. This compares to 13% in Cyprus, 12% in Israel and 9% in Germany. \r\nThis is due to the lack of public awareness of what bone marrow donation is and how further simplified and painless the procedure of donating can be.",
