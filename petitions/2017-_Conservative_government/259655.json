        "additional_details": "After years of being forced to use csa/cms I have had enough of the poor service provided and with ridiculous calculations on earnings which is now literally putting me in debt. so I\u2019d like cms to review the way they calculate things and at least take away tax national ins and pensions if not all outgoings and then calculate on what\u2019s left over. Most people already struggle day to day And this just adds to the pressure. Making people pay a sum they don\u2019t physically earn is just unacceptable!",
        "background": "For some reason they think it\u2019s a good idea to calculate cms payments without taking in to account tax, national insurance, pensions or any outgoings whatsoever. all parents should pay for they\u2019re children but making people pay more than the physically can afford is just unacceptable.",
