        "additional_details": "Climate change affects us all - why do you think our summers are getting hotter? Global warming is a serious issue that is not being helped by large industrial companies wasting enormous amounts of energy on mass producing recyclable products, that none of us bother to recycle anyway. We need to call on the gonvernment to enforce more restrictions on what is and isn\u2019t allowed. We need to stop wasting and be more environmentally conscious, and it is the job of the government to sort this.",
        "background": "Government officials are not going to be part of the generation who will be forced to face up to climate change: it will be millennials. But by then it may be too late. If we don\u2019t act now, by the time they are of an age to try to stop the destruction of our planet, there may be nothing left to save",
