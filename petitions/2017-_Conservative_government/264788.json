        "additional_details": "Under normal circumstances, an early election can only be called by parliament. The next general election is not until 2022. Our circumstances are not normal, we must act together to change this.\r\n\r\n- Our last 2 leaders have been \u2018self selected\u2019 by their own party.\r\n- Lack of clarity and delivery around Brexit, a peoples vote was side-lined.\r\n- Increasing inequality, knife crime and police cuts.\r\n- Lack of NHS protection and funding.\r\n- Leaders being chosen who we do not want to lead our country.",
        "background": "As citizens of the U.K, we have the given right to decide which government leads our county. \r\nIn the place so many of us call home, we feel removed from our own government - dishonesty, self gain, hidden agendas. \r\nBy using our collective power to call for an early election, we will change this.",
