        "additional_details": "Rescues must cross check the microchip database registration on all 'surrendered' or 'hand in' pets and scan all strays thoroughly. Once a pet has been re-homed it is a costly and complex procedure, resulting in the fact you may not get your microchipped pet back.\r\nStrays collected by dog wardens must be scanned on arrival to kennels. Owners only have 7 days to find their pets and then the council become the keeper and can either rehome or put to sleep.",
        "background": "Microchipping regulations should include standard operation procedures to scan pets with an owner, a stray or deceased.\r\n\r\nVets must scan all new registering pets and check the database registration. Stolen pets are sold on to new unsuspecting owners and missing pets can be kept or passed on.",
