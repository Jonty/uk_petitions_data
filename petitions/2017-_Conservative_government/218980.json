        "additional_details": "City minister Simon Kirby has been humiliatingly stripped of responsibility for protecting Britain's financial services and this is the man responsible  for discriminating people with Annuities against those who don't have them. We the people with Annuities want the right to have our money back like everyone else in the UK. We do not want to sell them to third parties but to have the same rights as everyone else and go to our insurance companies and be able to cash in our pensions if we so desire. After all these pension companies have made billions of pounds with our money through investments and stocks and shares and now it's time to give something back to the people who were forced by Government rullings to take these useless polocies out in the first place.",
