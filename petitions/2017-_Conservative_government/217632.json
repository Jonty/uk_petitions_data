        "background": "I am an ex-soldier that served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. During the two conflicts the army lost many sons and daughters. Historically wrong assumptions have been made and once the dust has settled it has been proven that the government was wrong to send troops to war. Let\u2019s learn from the past.",
