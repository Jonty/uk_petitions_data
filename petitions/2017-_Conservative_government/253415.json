        "additional_details": "In addition, allowing the younger population to vote will make them more aware of the political world, provoking them to better educated themselves regarding current affairs. I trust that the government has credible reasons for not lowering the voting threshold, however I also believe that including youths in a number of elections could be very beneficial for the subsequent generations.",
        "background": "At age 16, people should have a voice in the laws that affect their lives and a stake in the future of their country. Young people have a right to be heard and to have their interests taken seriously; most importantly elections which concern long-term effects, such as the environment.",
