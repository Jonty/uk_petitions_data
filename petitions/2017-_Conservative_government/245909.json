For some people, they are as important as guide dogs. Please help us to make this become a reality, we need to be their voice. \r\n\r\nMy son is autistic and has a very strong bond with a parrot. We have met prejudice against his bird in shops - not allowing him to come in and resulting in my son being told to leave the store. My son is very nervous around people and having his bird with him helps him greatly.",
