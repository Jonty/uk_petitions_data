        "additional_details": "Six months since Windrush Scandal was exposed there has been some progress and numerous apologies from the Prime Minster.The government intend to introduce a cap on all compensation claims despite the fact they did not recognise or consider any interim or hardship fund. The Windrush Generation plus others from the Commonwealth have paid their taxes and contributed to the wealth, prosperity and cultural identity of UK since WW2.The scheme needs to reflect this.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44888187",
        "background": "We want a fair compensation scheme for the Windrush Generation that is in line with compensation awarded by the courts in civil cases. There should be no artificial cap that will inadequately compensate those who have suffered emotionally, financially, lost their homes and citizenship.",
