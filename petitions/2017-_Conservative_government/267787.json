As a pet owner, I disagree with valuing one life over another. A pet is a pet, we love them like family and they should have equal rights. Men and woman have equal rights, why not cats and dogs?",
        "background": "My 1 year old cat was purposely hit by a speeding van and left for dead. I contacted the police to be told \"we can't do anything, its just a cat\". Research showed that hit and run with a dog is illegal and drivers can face prosecution but any animal smaller, is not a crime.",
