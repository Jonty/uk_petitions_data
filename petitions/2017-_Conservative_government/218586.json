        "additional_details": "You should be able to park your vehicle and get in or out without struggling. You should also not have to worry about potential damage which can often be sustained in your absence. Causing needless cost and loss of earnings, maybe even insurance hikes. Town and city planners have overlooked this for years, as have Supermarkets and retail parks.\r\nIt's time, as consumers, that we took a stand and put the onus onto those profiting from our misery.\r\nYour vote could help to change this.",
        "background": "Parking space is a premium in most cities and towns. However, most spaces are barely wider than a vehicle. A UK standard parking space is 2.4m wide, by 4.8m. The average family car is 2.1m x 4.8m. Park perfectly and you get 150mm either side to open a door. This is not enough for most vehicle users.",
