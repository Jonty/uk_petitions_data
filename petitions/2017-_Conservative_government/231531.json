        "additional_details": "The care staff that take care of others loved ones the in the community are underpaid. Most care workers will cover a 15 hour day. They will be on the road back to back with calls and sometimes only get a short break yet will be working from 7:00 - 22:00 we are only paid client time this could be only 5 hours out off the whole 15hours worked \r\nMileage is paid at 25p per mile yet travel time is not paid or paid if the adverage drops below the  NMW or paid a minimum of so many minutes.",
        "background": "I've worked in the care industry for around 13 years now, 4 of which have being in community care. Care agencies have a quick turn over of staff this is mainly down to being under paid which in turn effects the quality of care provided to the vulnerable and a lack of continuity.",
