The danger is that for political reasons (re: Naz Khan MP) the full facts will never be revealed in the name of 'inclusivity' Only an Independent Enquiry can gain the full facts and deliver these facts to Parliament. The agencies of our society Councils, Social Workers and Police must stand accountable for their actions or lack of actions.",
