        "additional_details": "Fireworks bring joy to many, however quite the opposite to many people and animals. \r\nIntroducing silent fireworks would still deliver the aesthetic look and atmosphere that fireworks bring, however reduces anxiety in those with fears. \r\nMany firework displays organised by local councils typically have loud music played at the event, and with crowds of people chatting amongst themselves, the atmosphere is unchanged. If Italy can do it, why can\u2019t the UK?",
        "background": "Why should animals suffer for the sake of our pleasure? Animals are known to suffer long term physical and mental affects because of the noise that fireworks create. 45% of dogs display signs of anxiety, and how about the welfare of wildlife, they can\u2019t be comforted by humans to block out the noise?",
