        "additional_details": "The government is well aware of the benefits of a connected society and documents them extensively: https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/broadband-investment\r\n\r\nIndividuals and businesses benefit massively from internet and telephone connectivity and this in turn benefits our economy.\r\n\r\nOther utilities which are essential, such as water, electricity and gas are subject to reduced rates of taxation. Telephone and broadband services should be treated the same, as an essential utility.",
        "background": "Telephone lines with broadband are an essential utility for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is a 20% VAT levied on all services, other essential utilities are not subject to such a high rate of taxation.",
