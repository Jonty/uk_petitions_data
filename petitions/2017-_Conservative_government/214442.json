        "action": "Grant junior doctors the same maternity/paternity rights as other employees",
        "additional_details": "Junior doctors taking maternity leave are having the location of their employment changed drastically on returning to work, often making it unfeasible to continue training. Morale is already low and this can cause added stress and anxiety to doctors with young families. There is a staffing crisis across the NHS and so it would be in the public's interest to close this loophole and allow junior doctors the same parental rights as other employees, to increase junior doctor retention in the NHS.",
        "background": "The junior doctor contract allows doctors on mat leave to be moved to a different hospital, risking being placed 100s of miles from their old job, with insufficient warning for childcare planning and despite vacancies in their previous hospital. Other professions are protected from this by UK law.",
