        "additional_details": "I have witnessed this cause people contemplating fleeing domestic violence hesitate and the bravery of people trying to escape that terrible situation should not be stopped by the idea they might not get the security of a similar tenancy again. I would ask the government to protect the rights of such brave men, women and non binary individuals in regards to allowing them priority in the new area for social accommodation and protection.",
        "background": "When a social tenant flees domestic violence and must move county they present to their local council for a place of safety, this means they lose their social tenancy if they had one and must begin again most of the time. This sometimes stops them fleeing and that can endanger them further.",
