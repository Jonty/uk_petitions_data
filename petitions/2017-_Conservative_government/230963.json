        "additional_details": "The UK government should create a UK Nuclear Power Group to manage, design, develop, construct and operate the new Nuclear power stations required for our UK national electricity grid. \r\nA UK group would not only create thousands of jobs in the UK, using the skills that are developed in the UK and ensure the security of the electric network remained in our control.",
        "background": "51% of all electricity generated in UK is by Gas and Coal powered stations. 21% is generated by old Nuclear plants. We need to replace these with new nuclear power stations. I believe that the UK should design, develop, construct and operate these with UK skills by creating a UK Nuclear Power Group.",
