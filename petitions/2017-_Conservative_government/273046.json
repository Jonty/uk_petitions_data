        "additional_details": "MPs want to have their cake and eat it, complaining that Boris Johnson is unelected but refuse to allow a general election.They know they are blocking the will of the majority of this country by derailing Brexit and fear that this will reflect in the voting. We're sick of the recycled arguments and demand a say NOW. If remain politicians are so sure of their public support then this can be their so called peoples' vote. If not, then they are running scared from those who put them in office.",
        "background": "Many MPs are going directly against the wishes of their constituents and claiming they know what's best for us. We demand a voice in order to take a broom through what has become a stale, dictatorial and contemptuous parliament. Our faith in democracy has never been so undermined - prove us wrong!",
