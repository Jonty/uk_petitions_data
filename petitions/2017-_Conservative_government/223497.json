        "additional_details": "The Telegraph UK reports that 145 children aged between 10 - 17 committed suicide due to school pressure and exam results. This is because children are led to believe that if they fail their GCSE's, their lives are over and they will go nowhere in life. 96 under 25 year olds committed suicide in April and May 2014 - 2015 which is during exam season. The English pass rate has decreased by 2.2% since the new GCSE syllabus was introduced. The Maths pass rate has decreased by 1.7% since 2017.",
        "background": "I believe that the GCSE's are too difficult and are causing an increase in mental health issues in children from years 9 to 11. Personally, I believe that the government would not be able to take the gcse's and pass with the grades our generation are predicted.",
