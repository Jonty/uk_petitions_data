        "action": "Introduce legislation permitting terminally-ill patients a dignified death.",
        "additional_details": "Oregon Death with Dignity Act 1997:\r\n1st state to legalise physician-assisted dying, with strict safeguarding criteria to prevent abuse.\r\nNo more than 250 Oregonians have died as a result from DWDA per calendar year, but knowing that it exists as an option is a great source of comfort to many terminally-ill patients and their families.\r\nI suggest that the UK government considers the DWDA as a model to adopt here, and provide those dying painful deaths dignity, control and autonomy.",
        "background": "The UK law on assisted dying is out of touch. As medicine has advanced, so too has the life span of human beings. Yet the quality of life for many is significantly reduced, often through terminal illnesses such as cancer. \r\nPublic support for some form of assisted dying law is at 80% (YouGov, 2014).",
