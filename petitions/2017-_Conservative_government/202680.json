I had a judge order my son to be seen by C.A.M.H.S to support the psychologist diagnosis but they do not commission PDA so we're stuck in limbo. To the point of social services wanting to put my son in foster care but luckily it was the judge that saw there was a problem and now back at the beginning. PDA was founded in the 1980's so it's fairly new. So many parents are being blamed for their children's behaviour. PDA is on the autistic spectrum.",
