        "additional_details": "While the principle of \"liability where actions have been taken\" is sound, in this case it results in a less beneficial outcome. \r\nGovernment advice is \"you're unlikely to be sued\", but that is hardly encouraging. https://www.gov.uk/clear-snow-road-path-cycleway\r\n\r\nThere will always be a grey area where the use of inappropriate methods (like warm water) should be admissible when determining blame, but in the absence of such proof, the intent to clear ice in itself should not bring liability.",
        "background": "The law is such that persons clearing public pavements of snow and ice, e.g. outside their house or business, are then liable for civil action in the event someone slips, whereas not clearing the ice means you are not responsible, and thus can't be sued. The result is more dangerous pavements.",
