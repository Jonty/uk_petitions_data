        "additional_details": "We call on the Equality Act 2010 to include \u201cTrade Unionism: the participation in all or any aspects of the system, practices, and beliefs of trade unions, including the participation in lawful industrial action and activities stemming from such action\u2019. Such a change would provide clarity in the workplace and a clear instruction to employers that they will no longer be able to subvert universal principles of democracy, justice and human rights through legislative loopholes.",
        "background": "The Equality Act brings previous discrimination legislation under one act.  Its main aim is to make it unlawful for employers to treat a worker less favourably because of a protected characteristic such as sex, race, religion or belief.  Trade unionism is not currently a protected characteristic.",
