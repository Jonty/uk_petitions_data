        "action": "Reintroduce restrictions on the sale of acids",
        "additional_details": "The 1972 Poisons Act only allowed registered pharmacists to sell acids, and only on registered premises. It was also required that any business selling acids was registered annually with their local council and those selling lethal chemicals needed a licence from the Home Office. Acid attacks have increased since the law was relaxed, against the recommendations of the Poisons Board, and under the auspices of saving retailers money. The government must act to reduce the ease of access to acids.",
        "background": "In 2016 there were 504 reported acid attacks in the UK. Since legislation around the sale of acids was relaxed and licencing for retailers was removed there has been a 74% increase in attacks. By reinstating previous law and tightening restrictions, further attacks could be prevented.",
