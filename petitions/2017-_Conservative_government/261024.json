        "additional_details": "Mobile phones can\u2019t be used in a emergency situation. Airwave radio has emergency red button on the top of the radio that is pushed if staff are attacked or in serious danger. Airwave radio is also tracked by the ambulance control room, so any emergency. You are able to be located straight away. Mobile phone you can\u2019t. Help keep us lifesaving volunteers safe.",
        "background": "Most CFR\u2019s (Community first responders) are issued mobile phones from the ambulance services they volunteer for, front line paid staff can\u2019t work without 2 airwave radios. (1 each) airwave radio should be issued to volunteer groups to help support PPE. Why get treated differently to front line staff",
