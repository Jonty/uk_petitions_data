        "additional_details": "Recently UEMO (the European Union of General Practitioners/Family Physicians) called for all European countries to recognise the speciality and the statement has the support of other European \r\nmedical organisations.\r\n\r\nIn August 2016 the RCGP released this press statement http://www.rcgp.org.uk/news/2016/august/gps-must-be-recognised-as-specialists-in-general-practice-say-rcgp-and-the-bma.aspx , but to date there continues to be no movement on their call.",
        "background": "General practice is the foundation of the NHS, yet even though doctors undergo rigorous training to become a GP, including an exit exam (MRCGP) they are still not recognised as specialists. The UK is an outlier compared to other countries across the globe.",
