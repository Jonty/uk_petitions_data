        "additional_details": "\"Immediately after the notification of the intended withdrawal, the other Contracting Parties shall convene a diplomatic conference in order to envisage the necessary modifications to bring to the Agreement\". Because the UK is a separate 'contracting party', leaving the European Union does not automatically result in a cessation of EEA membership. As a result,   because British EEA membership is enshrined in UK law through Parliament's 1993 Agreement Act, then triggering Article 127 requires parliamentary approval before it can be formally triggered.",
