        "additional_details": "To ensure the UK is not complicit in the death and suffering of the Yemeni people, we should:\r\n \r\n1. Stop, or make all future weapons exports to coalition countries subject to ending of the bombing campaign and rebuilding of destroyed infrastructure.\r\n \r\n2. Make all activities of any on-the-ground UK experts maintaining weapon systems subject to Whitehall and Westminster scrutiny.\r\n \r\nThe UK should set an example, provide moral leadership and lean on its international partners to follow suit.",
        "background": "The Coalition's aerial campaign has led to thousands of civilian deaths in Yemen, destroyed most of the infrastructure and led to the \"world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis\" according to Antonio Guterres.\r\n \r\n",
