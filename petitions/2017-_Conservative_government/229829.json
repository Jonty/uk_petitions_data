Currently, many young drivers could replace their own car with the premiums they are paying.\r\n\r\nPlease fix the car insurance system by;\r\n\r\n1. Either make it based on X% value of a car  (i.e. 10%) \r\n2. Make car insurance optional such as life/home insurance\r\n3. Or enforce X% refunds at the end of the year if the policy holder(s) make no claims (if none of the above changes are made)",
