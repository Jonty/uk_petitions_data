        "additional_details": "As professionals, we should have a system in place where we can raise such concerns to a professional body.\r\nI understand that we can raise our concerns with the ward matrons and managers but enough action is not being taken. I also understand that some Trusts have something in place but as far as I am aware, a professional body aiming to protect doctors and health professionals on a national level is not available.\r\nWe are here to do our jobs and help, not to be discriminated against or abused.",
        "background": "I want the government to introduce a national healthcare professionals advice and liason service similar to PALS. \r\nCurrently, when doctors and nurses are verbally, physically, racially abused or discriminated against we must document it in the patients notes and proceed with our jobs.",
