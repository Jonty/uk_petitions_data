That committee would then investigate the complaint and report its findings and conclusions to the House of Commons, and recommend any action it considers necessary. This could, in the most serious of cases, be a recommendation that an MP should be suspended or even expelled from the House. It would then be for the House of Commons to decide whether to take the recommended action. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the Privileges Committee here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/privileges/\r\n"
