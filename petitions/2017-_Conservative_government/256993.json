        "additional_details": "One MP's vote to delay brexit and remove no deal from table (which isnt a majority) overrules the majority of  1.26 million people who voted to leave.\r\n\r\nThe people have lost faith in the Government, MP's and democracy all together. Next general elections, both Labour and Conservatives will be hit hard. Stop embarrassing yourselves with your squabbling to the rest of the world. Stop wasting money with pointless debates. Leave means leave, no Deal, WTO but the corrupt remain individuals block this.",
        "background": "The people by a vast majority, voted to leave the EU 23 June 2016. The only choices at this referendum was to leave or remain. The people voted to leave the EU , without a deal. MP's are ignoring their constituents to aid their own remain agenda which is a betrayal of democracy. Just get on with it.",
