Where an MP, or their family, has an interest outside of politics which could result in personal financial gain following a decision in parliament, they should not be lawfully permitted to influence the relevant debate.",

We aren't sure that is what you intended.\r\n\r\nMPs are already required to register and declare financial interests. If there is a conflict between their personal interest and the public interest, they must resolve it straightaway and in favour of the public interest. Complaints that a Member has breached the Code of Conduct are examined by the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.\r\n\r\nYou can find the Code of Conduct for the House of Commons here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/code-of-conduct-and-rules-of-the-house/ \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for changes to the Code if that is something you would like to see happen."
