In particular we're not sure what you mean by \"take action\".  \r\n\r\nIn any case, the investigation and prosecution of fraud is a matter for the police, not the UK Government or Parliament. \r\n\r\nYou can find out how to report financial fraud here: https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/ \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the law, if that's what you want to happen. "
