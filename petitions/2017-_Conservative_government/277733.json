        "additional_details": " I am asking the government to consider requiring the courts to place automatic conditions on those charged with offences against children that prevent them from contacting any victims under the age of 16.\r\n\r\nMy daughter was seriously assaulted, leaving her with life changing injuries. Once charged by the police, her attacker was granted unconditional bail due to previous good character and a risk assessment. This allowed further contact for a further 6 months before a trial and risks of lasting psychological impact and further harm. I am asking for no other family to have to suffer what we have had to.",
        "background": "The law currently allows for persons who commit offences against children to be granted unconditional bail, leaving them to pose further risk to minors around them.",
