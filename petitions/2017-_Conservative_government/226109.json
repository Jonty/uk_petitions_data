        "action": "An independent study to find if driven grouse shooting is of  economic benefit.",
        "additional_details": "Driven grouse shooting has been implicated in the loss of wildlife and oportunities for wildlife tourism. The uplands it dominates could instead have fully fledged ecotourism, natural flood alleviation projects, be more fire resistant, have woodlot forestry to provide fuel for those without mains gas, provide cleaner water and better fishing and be considerably better for general tourism. http://water.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/EMBER_2-page_exec_summary.pdf",
        "background": "Driven grouse shooting is a minority sport which seriously compromises other activities and businesses over vast stretches of northern England. We need to determine if it is driving away more jobs and enterprises than it creates, which is likely - no country outside of the UK has it.",
