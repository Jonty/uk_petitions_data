        "additional_details": "House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has been seen driving a car with a notice reading \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d.  Many of his subsequent rulings in the House of Commons have been regarded by those supporting Brexit as biased against them.  For Parliament to be respected the Speaker must not only be impartial but must also be seen to be impartial and for John Bercow this can no longer be the case.  For this reason and out of respect for his high office he should now resign.",
        "background": "Speaker John Bercow has let his personal views on Brexit become known thereby compromising the perceived impartiality of his rulings.  To retain respect for Parliament across the country Speaker Bercow should be required to resign.",
