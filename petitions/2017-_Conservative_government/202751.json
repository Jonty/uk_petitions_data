        "action": "Cap Insurance Prices For People Under 25.",
        "additional_details": "My idea is to introduce a similar system to motorcycles and limit the power of cars young people can drive for 3 years after passing their test. A limit of 1600cc, this lowers the power that a young driver can have therefore meaning that they cannot have a car that is too powerful for them to control, insurance companies can then cap out insurance making it lower for all people as there are less powerful cars being driven by young drivers, making the roads safer for everyone in turn too.",
        "background": "Insurance prices for young drivers is too high, often being in the thousands for a car that will only cost a few hundred pounds. Similar petitions have been started in the past but this one is different as I propose that a power cap is put on cars.",
