        "additional_details": "A transparent Public Inquiry is required, now.\r\n\r\nThis Inquiry must determine urgently whether any decision-maker knew about the EU Referendum irregularities before Article 50 was triggered. \r\n\r\nWhat assessment (before Article 50 was triggered or subsequently) was made, and by whom, of any impacts illegal spending had on the outcome of the EU Referendum?\r\n\r\nThese are matters vital to the democratic process and public confidence in British politics. Until they are resolved Brexit must be deferred.",
        "background": "The UK's departure from the EU looms but questions remain about the legitimacy of the Referendum. The Electoral Commission said illegal overspending occurred during the Referendum. Were the vote/any subsequent political acts affected? Article 50 was triggered. Was the overspend known about then?",
