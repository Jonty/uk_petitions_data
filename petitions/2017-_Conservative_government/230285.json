        "additional_details": "This will make the weaker player jealous, tempting them to gambling money on the loot boxes on the pay-to-win game. Gambling can be addictive, and children are more susceptible to being addicted. All the transactions and electronically automated, so children with no concept of money will keep opening loot boxes. It's a very scummy, shady tactic used by some games companies. And it's typically the case that the only thing you can buy in the game is solely the virtual currency for opening loot boxes in one game mode\r\n \r\nPlease sign\r\n",
        "background": "Games companies are making poor quality games to maximize player spending. Players are gambling real world currency, by exchanging it for virtual currency to play built in slot machines. There are match making algorithms to match weaker players with better ones.",
