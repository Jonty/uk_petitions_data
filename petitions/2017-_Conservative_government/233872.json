        "additional_details": "These are vital procedures to take in CPR and emergency situations such as choking which could save a baby\u2019s life. Yes mums can pay for the course if they want to but in fact it is absolutely essential and necessary for new mums and this should not be an additional cost to them. The ambulance service may not get there in time and a course during pregnancy could save your baby\u2019s life.",
        "background": "We hope that it\u2019s never going to happen to us and hopefully it never does but not everyone is so lucky. Why should new mums have to be worried about the worst and better yet to have to pay to find out how to protect their child should the worst happen. It could save a baby\u2019s life.",
