        "additional_details": "Many people will not be used to DAB systems and will already own FM capable technology and would struggle to make the change.\r\n\r\nOlder but perfectly usable stereo systems will become obsolete and people may not be able to afford new equipment.\r\n\r\nThe FM signal is a historic achievement and it works. Future generations will miss out on learning of radio frequencies.\r\n\r\nA strong FM signal provides excellent sound quality for both music and speech, whereas DAB is significantly inferior.",
        "background": "In the next few years the UK\u2019s analogue radio signal will be switched off and listeners will have to tune into digital radio instead.\r\n\r\nThe UK is NOT ready. FM sounds better and has better signal. DAB sounds tinny and car DAB signal drops out. \r\n\r\nPLEASE SAVE THE UK FM RADIO SIGNAL.",
