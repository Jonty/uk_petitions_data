        "action": "Include under 25s in the National Living Wage & adopt the real living wage.",
        "additional_details": "As the Living Wage Week comes to end, we believe that workers in Britain deserve a proper wage rise. With the Chancellor preparing to announce his first budget of this Parliament, we must put pressure on the Govt to adopt the real living wage released by the Living Wage Foundation. A report released by KPMG highlighted that 5.5 million people still earn less than the real Living Wage rates. If you believe that all workers deserve a fair day\u2019s pay for a fair day\u2019s work, please sign this petition.",
        "background": "The Govt's National Living Wage is currently set at \u00a37.50/hr for people aged 25 & over. However this doesn't apply to under 25s, some of whom can be on wages as low as \u00a35.60/hr. We call on the Govt to:\r\n- Include under 25s\r\n- Adopt the real living wage (\u00a310.20 in London, \u00a38.75 in the rest of the UK)",
