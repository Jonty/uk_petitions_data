        "action": "Repeal the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 and allow sporting handgun use",
        "additional_details": "Regulation of handguns, as with rifles and shotguns, is certainly needed, and we strongly encourage a thorough system of criminal and medical background checks before the purchase or use of handguns.\r\nHowever, firearms legislation needs to respect the desire of thousands of competitive shooters and atheltes to practice their sport in their own country.\r\nWe encourage new legislation to facilitate the sensible sporting use of handguns in Great Britain in place of this act.",
        "background": "The British ban on handgun ownership and use for any purpose has severely limited the development of pistol shooting across the country, and has forced athletes to travel abroad to practice their sport in recent years. \r\nCreate new legislation permitting the ownership and use of handguns for sport.",
