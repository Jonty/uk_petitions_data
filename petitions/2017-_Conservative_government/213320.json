        "background": "As a wheelchair user who needs a Carer I\u2019ve been told when I travel by air i need to buy an extra seat at full price for my Carer. Eg. I\u2019m 6\u20195 and paralysed from the neck down and personally I cannot fit in an economy seat because of lack of room, so I\u2019m forced to upgrade at a ridiculous price.",
