        "action": "Hold European Parliamentary elections in UK if Brexit is delayed",
        "additional_details": "We call on Theresa May and the Government to bring forward legislative amendment to Schedule 9 of the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which lists the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 and the European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003 among the Acts to be wholly repealed. This must be done to ensure that the European Parliamentary elections can take place in the UK on 23rd May 2019.",
        "background": "If the UK is still a member of the EU on May 23rd, British citizens and EU27 citizens in the UK must have representation through their MEPs in the European Parliament. Having representation in these elections also crucially allows the UK time to arrange a second referendum on EU membership.",
