        "additional_details": "The UK has sold over \u00a31bn worth of arms to Turkey in the past decade, especially fighter and military transport aircraft - the Turkish government have been using air power already to attack Rojavan-held areas.\r\n\r\nRojava is a multi-confessional, multi-ethnic region, with a large Kurdish population, whose forces have been on the front line of fighting ISIS in recent years. The Turkish attack comes after recent moves by their government against elected Kurdish officials in eastern Turkey.",
        "background": "The Turkish government has invaded the pluralist and democratic Rojava region of Syria. This assault could lead to many civilian deaths, likely inflicted with British-made weaponry. We call on the government to revoke, and stop newly granting, arms sales licenses that fuel this destructive violence.",
