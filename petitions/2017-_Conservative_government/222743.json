        "additional_details": "I work in retail where I have experienced the effects of colleagues who have been on or who are currently on zero contracts. There is always concerns on how many hours they can get, sometimes their needed for  stock take time when they may have to stay away from home in a hotel  but then later there is hardly any hours at all for them for a month or so. How can people live like this with so little clarity? In many cases people move on which leaves the work place short staffed.",
        "background": "In certain sectors of the economy ie. retail many people are employed on low paid zero hour contracts. In some cases this can lead to lack of full employment rights, unpredictable hours in which case you may be asked to work at short noice, making it difficult to plan. New rules would benefit all.",
