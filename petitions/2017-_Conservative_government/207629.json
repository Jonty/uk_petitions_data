        "additional_details": "The Government could introduce an exemption from, or reduction in, IPT for all UK Charities. A further rise in the rate of standard UK IPT was announced recently. From 1st June 2017 IPT charged on charities' insurance premiums increased to 12%. This represents a 100% increase in an 18 month period. These increases have and will continue to negatively affect charities who have already suffered in the last few years from reduced income while seeing an increase in the demand for their services.",
        "background": "We believe the Government should be doing everything it can to support the vital work charities are doing, not imposing unnecessary costs on them. We call for charities to be exempted from Insurance Premium Tax (IPT).",
