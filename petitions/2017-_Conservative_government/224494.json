        "action": "Create a UK wide waste and recycling system.",
        "additional_details": "The UK Government has said it will reduce plastic waste and increase recycling rates. This coupled with China no longer taking plastic waste means that more needs to be done to recycle items in this country. Currently councils are only able to recycle certain items meaning that a lot of recycling across the country actually ends up in landfil/waste to energy.We need one system for the whole country so that no matter where you are it is clear which bin an item should go in and it will be recycled",
        "background": "The current waste and recycling system is broken down into counties or smaller regions of the country which are able to recycle different products, have different coloured signage, and for the most part a complete lack of public reycling facilities.We could be recycling more and not adding confusion",
