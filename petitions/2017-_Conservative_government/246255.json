        "action": "Address teachers unmanageable workload by increasing protected PPA to 30%",
        "additional_details": "I am an experienced teacher who, like many others, am considering leaving a job I love due to workload. I am currently entitled to 10% PPA (planning & preparation time) this equates to roughly 6 minutes to plan for, resource and mark for each lesson I teach. This is nowhere near enough time to adequately plan and doesn't even contribute to the time I spend marking. All of this work is done at home. Addressing this would keep teachers in the profession as well as enhance the quality of education.",
        "background": "We are facing a teacher retention crisis as the out of school workload is so high it is unsustainable. Help address this and keep experienced teachers in classrooms by increasing PPA so teachers can plan and mark during the working day instead of at home in the evening or at a weekend.",
