        "additional_details": "This is completely wrong we joined HM Forces to serve our Queen and Country and did so proudly. We were often sent to countries to deal with issues by the government. We often witnessed violence and even lost brothers and sisters this leaving many of us with PTSD. The government does nothing to help us deal with our lives yet we still suffer issues. Combat Stress programmes help us to help ourselves have a better way of life without this many have committed suicide, self harmed etc.",
        "background": "From July 2018 funding from NHS England for the 6 week PTSD residential treatment programme is being withdrawn. This loss of funding amounts to \u00a33.2 million. This means that Combat Stress charity will rely heavily on public donations.",
