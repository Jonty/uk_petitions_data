        "action": "Protect one third of UK waters from all commercial fishing.",
        "additional_details": "At present, we are rapidly destroying the nature we depend on, nowhere more rapidly than the sea. The 2019 IPBES report identified this, and attributed it mostly to commercial fishing. Marine 'Protected' Areas allow destructive practices like trawling, and less than 0.1% of these exclude commercial fishing. Commercial fishing should be excluded from at least 33% of UK seas, protecting nature whilst boosting catches (Sala, 2018). Installing monitoring equipment would cost just \u00a35mn (WWF, 2017).",
        "background": "Nature is collapsing in the sea even faster than on land, and fishing has been identified as the primary cause. Protecting one third of UK waters from all commercial fishing would increase catches due to the 'spillover effect,' improve biodiversity, and would be relatively inexpensive to monitor.",
