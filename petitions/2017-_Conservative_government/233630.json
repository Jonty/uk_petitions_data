        "additional_details": "The well-publicised explosion in on-line gambling illustrates how vast fortunes are made by small numbers of owners, at the expense of huge numbers of vulnerable gamblers, including the young and those who can ill afford to spend on gambling. Gambling profits come from one single source: the gamblers' losses. It causes hardship, family rifts, depression and suicides. On-line gambling specifically presents easy opportunities 24/7/365 for people to succumb to temptation to bet beyond their means, without even leaving their homes, and without regard for consequences. There is only one effective solution, which is to ban on-line gambling completely, by making it illegal in the UK",
