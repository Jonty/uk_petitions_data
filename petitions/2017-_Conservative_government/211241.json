        "action": "Change the Numeracy and Literacy Skills Tests to unlimited attempts",
        "additional_details": "Each question from the mathematics section is timed putting a huge amount of pressure on trainee teachers. The maths and literacy skills tests should be revised and adapted depending on the age of the children the candidate wants to work with. For example primary and secondary trainee teachers should sit different tests, with the secondary teaching test being harder as the level of teaching required would be more challenging due to GCSE's.",
        "background": "All trainee teachers have to sit numeracy and literacy skills tests in order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status. This should be changed from 3 attempts to unlimited attempts. Currently after 3 failed attempts the candidate cannot take these tests again for another 2 years.",
