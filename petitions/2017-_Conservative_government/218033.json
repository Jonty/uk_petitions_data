        "action": "Abolish the House of Lords; replace with an elected Second House.",
        "additional_details": "The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament, after the House of Commons. Its role is to review and amend Bills sent from the Commons, check and challenge the government, and provide independent expertise. \r\n\r\nThere are 787 sitting Lords including 90 hereditary peers, 26 bishops, with others appointed by the Queen under advisement. Some have undisclosed sources of income eg pension arrangements (some receive over \u00a380k in EU pensions), or substantial EU subsidies for their lands.",
        "background": "Please sign this petition if you agree it is time to replace the House of Lords with an elected Second Chamber.  \r\nDespite multiple attempts at reform and regulation, some Peers persist in abusing their position; it is time therefore to replace the House of Lords with an elected body.",
