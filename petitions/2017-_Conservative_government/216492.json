        "action": "Introduce a reassuring EM radiation limit for homes and schools (eg 1,000 \u00b5W/m2)",
        "additional_details": "The World Health Organisation continues to rate this type of radiation as a Class 2b Carcinogen and many studies link it to childhood lukemia and other illnesses. Sufferers of electrosensitivity are also becoming increasingly common.\r\n\r\nA phone network continues to work at 0.000002\u00b5W/m2 (source: powerwatch.org.uk). Before it stopped auditing it, over 10 years ago, the highest level Ofcom recorded inside a residence was 790\u00b5W/m2. Other countries have sensible limits without affecting reception.",
        "background": "There is no specific limit for mobile phone radiation in homes. We use the out-dated 1998 ICNIRP recommendation for incidental public exposure, which includes no risk management. \r\n\r\nBadly sited masts result in unnecessarily high levels which are never turned off and the health impact is unknown.",
