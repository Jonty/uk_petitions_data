        "additional_details": "If you have ever called the police because fireworks are being used in dangerous ways you may have been told its not a priority despite a firework being able to cause major injuries, with a permit and ID required to purchase fireworks less youths will be able to purchase fireworks, to reinforce this \r\nAll retailers should record the details of who bought the fireworks, when, how many of which type. In doing so it will be easy to identify law abiding retailers by checking sales records and stock",
        "background": "The number of emergency calls received by police relating to fireworks & their misuse could be reduced if retailers recorded who they sell to & require the buyer to present a firework permit issued in a similar way that a person may apply for a private event permit meaning less antisocial behaviour",
