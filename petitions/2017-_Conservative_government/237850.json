        "additional_details": "If AED is used and effective CPR is performed within 3-5minutes of cardiac arrest, the patients chance of survival increases from 6% to 74%. The Emergency services average response time to a cardiac event related incident in an urban area is 11 minutes. For every minute that goes by a victim of a sudden cardiac arrest does not receive treatment, their chance of survival decreases by 10%. If defibrillation occurs within 1 minute of the victim collapsing the patient survival rate increases to 90%.",
        "background": "Elderly parients are at higher risk of life threatening cardiac arrest and very few Nursing / Care homes have static AED (Automated External Defibrillator) units in place which delays life saving treatment to the parient. without immediate treatment 90-95% of sudden cardiac arrest victims will die.",
