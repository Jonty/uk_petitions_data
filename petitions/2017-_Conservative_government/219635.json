        "action": "Prohibit operating tractors & other agricultural vehicles between 07:30 - 09:00",
        "additional_details": "Many of us have experienced considerable delays due to these vehicles, whose operation at peak rush hour is generally dispensible and subservient at these hours. Tractors also breed anger into the drivers who are stuck behind them, with no hope of manoeuvring unless subjecting themselves to an incident. The difference in time between agricultural vehicles travelling at 8am rather than 9am is negligible and should be considered when contemplating this petition.",
        "background": "A tailback of cars stretching miles behind a tractor during rush hour in the morning is a sight many of the British public are accustomed to. Their use not only causes huge delays to travel times but puts other drivers at risk of incident as a result of forced manoeuvre.",
