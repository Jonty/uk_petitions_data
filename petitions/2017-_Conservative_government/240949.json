If you question police forces they will say they heavily rely on CCTV as part of any investigation. Consider the implications for crime and security. Especially with the current heightened security levels that are often reported on the news. Reducing the distance between cameras would effectively relieve many properties from requiring planning permission or having to remove cameras Small change big difference.",
