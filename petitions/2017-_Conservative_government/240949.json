If you question police forces they will say they heavily rely on CCTV as part of any investigation. Consider the implications for crime and security. Especially with the current heightened security levels that are often reported on the news. Reducing the distance between cameras would effectively relieve many properties from requiring planning permission or having to remove cameras Small change big difference.",
        "background": "Current planning states CCTV cameras should be 2.5m off the ground and a minimum of 10m apart if on the same wall. Most property in the UK is less than 10m in width/length. Public can easily purchase cctv which provide vital evidence for the police in the investigation of crime and security",
