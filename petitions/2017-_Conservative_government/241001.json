        "action": "Reject any UK hard border in Ireland or down the Irish Sea.",
        "additional_details": "The Good Friday Agreement includes guarantees that the interests of both communities will be respected. It attempted to ensure that no decision would be taken that disparately affected one section of the community without the consent of all.\r\n\r\nWhile the Withdrawal Agreement rightly ensured there would be no hard border in Ireland, it failed to ensure there would be no border down the Irish Sea. As guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, it is wrong to put the concerns of one community above those of another.",
        "background": "The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has focused on avoiding a hard border in Ireland due to the effect this would have on community relations in light of the peace process. However a border down the Irish Sea has raised similar concerns that are equally valid, yet this threat has largely been ignored.",
