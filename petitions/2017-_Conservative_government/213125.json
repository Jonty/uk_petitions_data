ISPs generally offer a way to do this through their routers/by signing into their online accounts - or you can install software onto your computer. \r\n\r\nThis means the Government (and websites) can track our internet use, and have the ability to force ISPs to block any website that doesn't comply - censorship of the internet. What will they block next?",
