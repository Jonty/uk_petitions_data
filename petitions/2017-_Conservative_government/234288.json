        "additional_details": "Some \u00a3150 million of \u2018festive bonuses\u2019 was shared among 15 million people last year, although many may not have noticed. While any contribution is of course welcome, surely it is time to increase the bonus to at least \u00a325 and start linking the payment to inflation.",
        "background": "In 1972 the Xmas bonus was introduced at a respectable \u00a310, enough for a good Xmas family dinner. 46 years on and it is still \u00a310, enough for half a chicken, a few potatoes and a splash of gravy. If the bonus was index linked to inflation, it would be worth an equally respectable \u00a3128 today.",
