        "additional_details": "You'll see in recent current affairs that Boris is backed into a corner, he's unable to negotiate with the EU with a strong grounding. No-deal should never have been off the table, because it gives us a chance to pull out if we need to. We need to focus on what is best for our nation, and its evident that the EU don't want to let us leave with favorable terms that will benefit our country. We the people need to put our politicians to rights.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson is under pressure in Parliament. He doesn't hold a majority. Labour doesn't want an election. Our politicians are failing us. We the people are sovereign, we need to pressure the government into a snap general election so that we can get through the Brexit mess. We need a strong hand.",
