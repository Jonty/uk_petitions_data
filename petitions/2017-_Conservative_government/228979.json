        "additional_details": "Six months on and into a new school year, the children from Studio School have been forgotten and the standards of our Plymouth Secondary Schools are well below the national average. Exam results are well below what they should be and although MPs have spoken out, I can see no action or improvements. The promises made to the Studio School children haven\u2019t been upheld and they have been swept under the carpet. The current system is failing our children. The Government must accept responsibility.",
        "background": "Government and local authorities need powers to take over failing schools. After the notification in March this year to close Plymouth Studio School, it was acknowledged that the secondary school system in Plymouth is failing our children. The Government must intervene. ",
