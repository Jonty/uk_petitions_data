        "additional_details": "Right now there is technology known as \"Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDC)\" and \"Direct Air Capture (DAC)\" that can remove carbon from our atmosphere. If this technology was rolled out on a national scale it will save lives, it will improve our Air. Powered by Renewable energies evidence suggests this tech could capture 1 million tons of CO2 Per Year. Recent studies show 1 in 6 deaths are linked to all forms of pollution in the UK. This is unacceptable.",
        "background": "Carbon pollution is acidifying our oceans, killing our wildlife and destroying our planet. This is unacceptable considering technology already exists that can extract Carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDC) and Direct Air Capture (DAC) can catch 1 million tons of CO2 per year.",
