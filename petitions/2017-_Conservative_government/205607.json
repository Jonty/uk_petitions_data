        "additional_details": "A group of solicitors are now forming an action group as there is a real concern smaller firms may be being targeted by insurance giants who may be using the SRA to ensnare the smaller firms in tangles of red tape that handicap their ability to represent the general public against the insurance giants. This risks preventing access to justice for the public who can\u2019t afford to pay a bigger law firm.",
        "background": "We already have the Legal Ombudsman to protect the Public Interest. The Police and Fraud action cover any crimes. The fees generated by the SRA should be paid to the Government to set up an independent, fair and balanced body.",
