        "action": "Fund an A&E facility in Wellingborough",
        "additional_details": "These towns are growing rapidly and the two existing hospitals struggle to cope with their own population - even without the ever increasing workload from Wellingborough.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate that funding is always limited when it comes to healthcare - however the expansion of the town and the dependence (for many) on public transport, means that effective, timely A&E treatment is often pivotal on ambulance availability.\r\n\r\nWe already have a superb Hospital in Wellingborough (The Isebrook) but it lacks the crucial A&E facility the town so urgently requires.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade will also result in reduced patient-load on both Kettering and Northampton A&E departments too.",
        "background": "Wellingborough is an expanding town and predicted to continue growing over the coming decades, but our nearest A&E facilities are either in Kettering or Northampton.",
