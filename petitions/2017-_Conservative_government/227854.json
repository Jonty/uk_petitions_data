        "additional_details": "We need to accept we need more time to organise our departure from the EU and request an extension to the article 50 process. This will give the UK time to continue talks, hold an general election or seek further opinion from the public to determine how Brexit should proceed.  Most importantly we will avoid a damaging no deal scenario which will harm poor and vulnerable people the most",
        "background": "The government has let us down with its negotiations with the EU and we are heading for a no deal scenario, which leaders in all fields say will be hugely damaging to the UK in many areas of life, from health to air travel to food imports. We must avoid a no deal situation.",
