        "additional_details": "Gluten free has become quite faddy and coeliac disease has fallen under the shadow of that.\r\nThere is a huge lack of education and sometimes full questioning and reassurance is needed in a restaurant before ordering and even then mistakes happen.\r\nbeing glutened causes damage for about a week. Coeliac is an autoimmune disease not an intolerance.",
        "background": "I have coeliac disease which means if I have gluten I can be violently ill. I have been given gluten more than 3 times in 3 separate restaurants and cafes. On one occasion a paramedic was called as mine and my friends spaghetti's were mixed up by the waitress. I was violently ill for over 2 hours.",
