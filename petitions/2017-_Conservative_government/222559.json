        "additional_details": "Section 50(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides:\r\n\r\n\"An employer shall permit an employee of his who is a justice of the peace to take time off during the employee\u2019s working hours for the purpose of performing any of the duties of his office.\"\r\n\r\nThe petitioner proposes a simple amendment to the Act:  after \"justice of the peace\" insert \"or a special constable\".  This would provide recognition to thousands of special constables in the country, providing them with the right to undertake their duties.",
        "background": "There is no right to unpaid time off work to undertake duties as a special constable.  Other public duties benefit from this right such as magistrates and council members. Special constables patrol side by side with paid police officers undertaking the same duties and tasks but on a voluntary basis.",
