        "additional_details": "Www.nhspay.org payscales are different to www.nhsemployers.org. NHS employers told employees to use www.nhspay.org to see pay progression but the two are different. Also follow #nhspay on twitter to see the mass employees annoyed about the situation with no comments made by Old Secretary of Health nor New Secretary of Health. This has been left as an absolute disaster",
        "background": "The NHS went out to consultation for the 19/20 agenda for change pay deal. The payscales and material released wasn't necessarily made clear and as such voters voted on unclear material. The payscales themselves also changed between the consultation and what has been implemented.",
