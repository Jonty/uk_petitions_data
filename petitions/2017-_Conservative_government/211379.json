        "action": "Moped riders must have a full license. Not a provisional one.",
        "additional_details": "The number of thefts in London has skyrocketed in recent years. Within the twelve months leading up to June 2017 the metropolitan police recorded 16,158 thefts on mopeds alone. The majority of these thefts is by teenagers with learner plates; who require no experience or background checks before being able to ride. We propose that all people wishing to obtain a moped require a full license.",
        "background": "Recently the number of mopeds thefts on main streets has increased drastically. This is primarily caused by teenagers on mopeds snatching phones while riding. This is enhanced by the fact that to get a moped you only need to have a provisional license which is exceedingly easy to obtain.",
