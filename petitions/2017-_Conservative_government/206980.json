The Borough's only greenbelt will be destroyed, losing this vital, natural, historical countryside. Local communities will be lost as they merge into towns and our area's rural land will be annihilated for ever for future generations. The government is committed to protecting the greenbelt and must insist that brownfield sites are built on first before considering the destruction of the greenbelt.",
        "background": "Wokingham Borough Council has plans in place to develop over the rural greenbelt in Ruscombe. The plans involve building thousands of houses and even a railway station on the Borough's only greenbelt. Please sign to protect our beautiful countryside for our future generations.",

Local planning issues are the responsibility of your local council.\r\n\r\nYou could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nOnce an application is made for the development to take place, all local residents have the right to request that a planning application be \u2018called in\u2019 by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed. For more information, including the criteria and how to request the call in of a planning application, see:\r\n\u00a0\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00930/SN00930.pdf \r\n\u00a0\r\nIf you want the UK Government or Parliament to take action, for example to amend the legislation and policy framework which governs planning and development decisions taken by local authorities, you could start a new petition specifically asking for that action.\r\n"
