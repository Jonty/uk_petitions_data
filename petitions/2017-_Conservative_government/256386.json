        "action": "Ban all single-use plastic bottles and all plastic bags by 2020.",
        "additional_details": "There is an impending environmental crisis affecting our whole world and there is a strong minded minority of people who are campaigning to effect change by avoiding single use plastic and making bold statements, but it needs to be the majority. \r\n\r\n5.5 billion plastic bottles go un-recycled every year in the UK alone and they are the main source of plastic blocking up our waterways. We need to act now. Major companies need to take responsibility, and the government needs to make them do this.",
        "background": "More and more people are starting to acknowledge the plastic crisis we are having on the earth but as a nation we are not acting quickly enough. We know there are alternatives to these items e.g. glass bottles, paper bags and even cans of water, so these should be implemented as soon as possible.",
