        "additional_details": "There have been multiple studies that show the effects of viewing harmful websites such as pro eating disorder, pro self harm and pro suicide. Many list that the participants experienced lower levels of self-esteem, more willingness to engage in activities being encouraged and distorted perception of self. We believe that discouraging engagement and signposting to support would prevent individuals from being negatively affected by these websites.",
        "background": "From personal experience, we know how access to certain websites can trigger the encouragement to engage in harmful behaviours related to diagnosed, or diagnosed mental health conditions. We want a pop-up to be introduced that discourages people from posting content or viewing the website further.",
