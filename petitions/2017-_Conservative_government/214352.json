        "action": "Toughen UK knife laws, raise the age to buy knives over 3 inches to 21 years old",
        "additional_details": "London has a huge issue with knife and gang related crime, minimising the amount of people able to buy knives must surely impact this. Nearly 13000 recorded incidents of knife crime in Just London last year, with less knives on the street in the wrong hands surely this statistic would also plummet.",
        "background": "Knife crime is an epidemic in the UK, surely raising the age to buy knives would shrink the culture our country has normalised. It would mean teenagers can no longer buy knives to use as weapons. Knife crime was 6x more likely to occur in 2017 than gun crime. I wonder why?",
