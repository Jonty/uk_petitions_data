Councils are making too many cuts in the health care sector. In 2017 council tax had a rise to pay for health and social care. Where is the money going ? It\u2019s not going towards health and social care if more and more cuts are being made.",

Carers currently receive minimum wage for this for the hours they are in the work place. Local authorities have tried to stop this",
