        "action": "Encourage greater use of driverless trains by TOCs across the UK rail network.",
        "additional_details": "- Automated de/acceleration patters help energy recovery and savings, making trains more environmentally friendly\r\n- Drivers are no longer involved in monotonous tasks of driving a train. Some can be re-qualified and deployed along the line, providing more customer service and fewer staff-less stations\r\n- Average speed of the system can increase\r\n- 32 cities globally use fully automated metro systems\r\n- Ticket prices and govt subsidies are unnecessarily high due to extortionate drivers wages",
        "background": "TOCs' greatest cost is the wages of train drivers. Driverless trains have existed in the UK for decades, yet only a minority of the network use them. Driverless trains would increase efficiencies, make TOCs profitable, reduce the need for government subsidy, and enable a reduction in ticket prices.",
