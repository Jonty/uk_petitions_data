        "additional_details": "The Benin Bronzes originate from the Benin Kingdom,  which is now modern day Nigeria. They were apart of a collection of art known as the 'Benin art' which was created by the Edo people.  \r\n\r\nThese artifacts were stolen by the British empire in 1897 and are still kept in Britain to this day. Britain has no right to keep the Bronzes as Nigeria is an independent nation. This is why I'm asking for the return of the Bronzes back to Nigeria. It is time Nigeria reclaimed what is rightfully theirs.",
        "background": "The British museum is home to many cultural artifacts throughout the world. However it is important to recognise that many of these artifacts were stolen or pillaged from their respective countries as a result of colonisation by the British empire. A great example is the Benin Bronzes.",
