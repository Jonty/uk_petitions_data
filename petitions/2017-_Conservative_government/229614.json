        "additional_details": "Up to 1/3 of all neurological referrals are diagnosed with FND. Sufferers end up relinquishing their independence & become reliant on Carers, Aids and Adaptations. They are left unable to function & it\u2019s vital we improve prospects. Medically Unexplained Symptoms (including FND) directly cost the NHS approximately \u00a33.1 billion, with an additional \u00a318 billion in indirect costs. With an NHS already under pressure, improving services and treatment for those with FND would greatly lift this burden.",
        "background": "Funding is needed to set up and increase service provision for multi-disciplinary treatment centres. Treatment requires specialist care with a team of neurologists, physiotherapists etc. which must be integrated to create an effective plan. Current options are limited & insufficient.",
