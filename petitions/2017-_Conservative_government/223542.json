        "additional_details": "If you know there is going to be a display you can be prepared for this but people are randomly setting fireworks off at all times of the year.   This has to stop. Also the elderly are often very anxious when hearing the loud banging and people  with dementia too.   Shops should get on board too with when they are to be sold. A government ruling needs to be actioned. The public could still be able to purchase but a ruling to say that only for Events, Firework Night and New Year etc.",
        "background": "Fireworks are great but can cause unnecessary harm to both humans and animals. Fireworks are being used all year round although amazing they should be used at controlled events. Pets are often very frightened by them. A local pet slipped his lead recently and sadly passed away due to being run over",
