        "additional_details": "The reasons for overturning this are plentiful:\r\n\r\n- Those with severe, unusual allergies will be able to see the suitability of a drink to them from the ingredients list.\r\n\r\n- People with dietary restrictions, such as vegetarians and vegans. Many drinks are unsuitable for these groups, and they often have to pursue contacting company headquarters to find an answer.\r\n\r\n- Those who wish to view calorie content, sugar content, or other factors that have health impacts. Many long drinks are highly calorific, and many liquors are very high in sugar.\r\n\r\n- Every reason for including them on food products and juice drinks also applies to alcoholic beverages.",
        "background": "All food and drinks must display all ingredients and certain nutritional facts, such as calories, sugars, and more. Alcoholic drinks are, for an unknown reason, an exception to this. Many societal groups would benefit from an ingredients list, as well as mandatory energy and sugar content.",
