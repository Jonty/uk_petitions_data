        "additional_details": "Tenants are given opportunity to move through mutual exchange and being forced to give up their secure tenancy because they need extra space or to downsize. Now it\u2019s a choice of quality of living or a secure tenancy. With these new laws coming in no one is secure people with vulnerability should be excempt from these laws. It would be better that those who need to move through mutual exchange should keep their existing tenancy status ie secure tenancy and move that over to the swapper property.",
