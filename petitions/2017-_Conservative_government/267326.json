        "additional_details": "Mandatory labelling would make it easier for consumers who don't have time to study ingredients.\r\n\r\nShowing something is NOT vegetarian-friendly or NOT alcohol-free is equally as important as the reverse. This would help a huge section of society across multiple religious and lifestyle choice backgrounds.\r\n\r\nStandardised symbols that stand out, eg green or red V or A symbols would help even more, eg for consumers with dyslexia or inability to read, and it would be easier to find the information.",
        "background": "People rely on products being labelled as suitable for vegetarians or alcohol-free to make informed purchasing choices. All food products should be mandatorily labelled in this regard, including the negation, ie a standardised green V or A for vegetarian-friendly or alcohol free, and red when not.",
