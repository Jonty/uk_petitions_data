        "additional_details": "There is a regular service which is run from London Kings Cross to Lincoln daily. It takes 1.55hrs from London to Lincoln. To get to Grimsby from Lincoln, it would take around an extra 20 -30mins directly. \r\n\r\nThis would be overall a journey time of 2.30hrs - 2.40hrs from London to Grimsby. \r\n\r\nGrimsby is a great town and always has been. A huge amount of grimbrians have moved to london for work and have family still in Grimsby, more importantly it would bring much needed businesses to the area!",
        "background": "For many years we have had to deal with the loss of business from Grimsby, the big blow was the loss of our direct connection to London via train.\r\n\r\nI am starting this petition because I want to see the now publicly owned ECRL extend their London to Lincoln service to Grimsby or Cleethorpes.",
