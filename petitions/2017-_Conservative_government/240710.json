        "action": "Implement a scheme to make political voting more accessible for autistic adults.",
        "additional_details": "Autistic individuals are often affected by interruption in their daily schedule. Voting stations can cause stress due to unfamiliarity and the inability to plan the process. In addition to the practice vote, we would introduce a designated quiet hour.\r\nAssociating information with voting slips can be difficult for some. Introducing colour representation of each party will be easier to remind individuals about the information they have learnt with colour assosiation.",
        "background": "Voting can be challenging for people with autism, and there aren't many resources available to assist individuals with this process.\r\nWe would like to propose a [Government Run Practice Vote event] which will help reduce the pressure individuals may face from voting.",
