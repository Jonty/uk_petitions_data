            "details": "The Government takes the security and integrity of our democratic processes very seriously. It is unacceptable for any nation, not just Russia, to interfere in the democratic elections of another country. \r\n\r\nWith regard to cyber interference, the UK electoral system is a difficult one to manipulate directly through cyber-attack as we operate a system of manual counting of paper ballots. Nevertheless, the Government is not complacent and will continue preparing for the future. The National Cyber Security Centre is currently working to deploy active cyber defence measures. These seek to block, disrupt and neutralise malicious cyber activity before it reaches citizens. This is part of the Government\u2019s on-going work to make the UK the most secure place to live and work online.\r\n\r\nConcerning disinformation, the Government is proud that our country benefits from a free, open and accessible media. However, others may try to use this to manipulate and confuse the information environment to suit their own ends. Managing this in all its forms is a long-term priority for the UK and the Government will continue to work to effectively constrain the effects of disinformation. This includes regulation through independent bodies, such as Ofcom who \u2013 through the Broadcasting Code \u2013 require broadcasters to present news with due accuracy and due impartiality. \r\n\r\nThe Russian government persistently uses disinformation as a tool to destabilise perceived enemies. This is not a new evolution in methodology or approach and has been evident in Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea; its rhetoric on the Syrian regime backed chemical weapons attacks on innocent civilians; and as a method employed by the country in its destabilisation of east Ukraine and beyond. The UK is actively engaging with international partners, industry and civil society to tackle the Kremlin\u2019s use of disinformation and propaganda, which is damaging Russia\u2019s global reputation.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office",
