        "additional_details": "The Stonewall riots were a series of demonstrations by the LGBT community against a police raid that began on 28/06/1969, at the Stonewall Inn, Greenwich Village, New York. They are considered the most important event leading to the gay liberation movement & modern fight for LGBT rights around the world and a key catalyst for social change. 50 years on, millions of LGBT people continue to be imprisoned or put to death for the way they are born. Our children must be informed of their sacrifice.",
        "background": "Without this event & the brave people involved, I & millions alike would be in prison or dead & yet it is one in which I had to learn about in adulthood, thanks to it not being taught in school. This must be covered in our national curriculum, alongside the way the Civil Rights movement is.",
