Parents using childcare have to typically fund 3 months of payments, before they start to get 1 of entitlement back. My UC payment date is 14th, but as my landlord will not get the deducted Housing Part of UC until early next month, I am being told I have to have a payment plan in place, to cover the arrears that build up due to direct payment",

This means that the landlord gets paid up to 3 weeks after the claimant would've got the money, if not on direct payment.
