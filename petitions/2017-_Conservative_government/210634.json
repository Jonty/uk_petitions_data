        "action": "Grant student mothers the same protections as working mothers",
        "additional_details": "In spite of the Equality Act 2010,  the rights of student mothers are primarily determined at their institution's discretion. Student mothers are easily marginalised and often squeezed out of the education system as a result.\r\n\r\nAccess to flexible working, maternity leave and breastfeeding facilities are examples of legal entitlements held by workers. There is no reason for student mothers not to be equally protected, when they are just as vulnerable to maternity discrimination. This must change.",
        "background": "Higher education institutions are required under employment law to make maternity provisions for working mothers, yet there is no legal requirement ensuring the same protections for students who are mothers. This blind-spot has led to student mothers facing avoidable adversity in higher education.",
