        "additional_details": "Although British Public voted to leave the EU, they did not vote to leave without a deal! To date our politicians have been unable to agree on a safe Brexit & will run out of time on 31st October, demonstrating that leaving the EU was much more complicated than they had anticipated. The only way to leave the EU without massive disruption to the U.K. economy, peoples\u2019 health, & deprivation to the poorest in society is to start again, spend time researching, planning & preparing to leave safely.",
        "background": "Three years ago the British public voted by a relatively small margin to leave the U.K.  This has proved too difficult in the time.The EU are under no obligation to agree an extension so the only way to ensure sufficient time for preparation and planning is to Take Back Control, & revoke Article 50.",
