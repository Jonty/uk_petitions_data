It feels like I am being stabbed with a jaggerd knife from the inside everytime I move.\r\nSo many women suffer and need help. The pain is often dismissed and Dr\u2019s say it is in our head, which can lead to years of this disease not being treated. \r\nIf Endometriosis was recognised as a disability I believe it could help so many women.",
        "background": "A chronic and debilitating condition that causes pain, fatigue, depression - the list goes on! It can lead to infertility and bowel/bladder problems. Around1.5 million women in the UK are currently living with the condition. Recognised as a disability in many other countries, but not yet in the UK.",
