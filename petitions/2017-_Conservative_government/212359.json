This report was total fallacy, all professionals were disgusted and relayed that I'm a great mum. \r\n\r\nNSPCC refuse to place a warning about making these calls and protect the rights of the \"informant\" over the innocent families. \r\n\r\nWe need: \r\n\r\n> laws to change with regards to malicious, false reports.\r\n\r\n> a deterrent to prevent this type of report.",

This needs to change.",
