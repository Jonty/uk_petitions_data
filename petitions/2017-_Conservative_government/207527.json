        "additional_details": "The South West Railway franchise service levels have reached new lows culminating in a total loss of service on the 11/12/2017,failure to properly debate and redress the situation could lead to major negative socioeconomic impact as a best case, and danger to life as a worst case(see the awful scenes at Waterloo station on 11/12/2017).  It is imperative that parliament debates this matter in order to see what relief if any the government can provide in order to avoid further losses of any kind.",
        "background": "The franchise provides suburban and regional services in areas of economic importance and emergency measures should be debated urgently to avoid further decay to the regional & national economy.  Service levels are now impacting both the social and economic lives of constituents who have to use it.",

For example, if you'd like the House of Commons to debate the levels of service currently being offered by South Western Railway, you could start a new petition asking for that. "
