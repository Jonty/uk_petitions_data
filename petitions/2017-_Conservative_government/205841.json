        "action": "Include animal sentience in the EU Withdrawal Bill",
        "additional_details": "This was done on the grounds that the UK's existing animal welfare bill gives adequate protection. However, existing UK legislation does not cover wild animals, and does not accept that animals feel pain and fear. The UK needs animal sentience to be enshrined in law to ensure its high animal welfare standards continue after Brexit, and it's hunting bans are not eroded.",
        "background": "On November 21st parliament voted to exclude an EU provision that wild, domestic, and farmed animals are sentient (and so feel pain) from the EU Withdrawal Bill.",
