        "additional_details": "These people have controversial far right political views which Britain disagrees with, but if they don't provoke violence, we will fight for their freedom to say it.\r\nThey claim they wanted to have a meeting on free speech, which shines a bad light on the police for arresting them, and sparking fear of an Orwellian police state.\r\nBritain stands against hate speech, which is easy to say, but words like \"racist\" and \"extremist\" are too subjective and vague for the police to use as a benchmark.",
        "background": "Brittany Pettibone and Martin Sellner were detained for 3 days before being deported from the UK with little to no reason given from the police. This has sparked concern across Britain of political oppression and erosion of free speech. With no crime committed, people don't know what they can say.",
