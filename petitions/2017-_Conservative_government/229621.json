It is also estimated that 250+quotes will need to be memorised for this exam. On top of an average of 20+ examinations.Even if students were able to bring in a copy of the un- annotated anthology it would be better than nothing at all. GCSE pupils also need to memorise maths and science formulas.",
        "background": "For the last two years GCSE pupils have not been able to take in their anthologies, maths and science formulas into their GCSE exams. Students find it very stressful trying to remember all of the information from all of the subjects.",
