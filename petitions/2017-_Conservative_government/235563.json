        "additional_details": "Section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 already legislates against unnecessary suffering.  This Act should be amended to ensure any dog left outside for long periods of time during the winter months also has access to a heated shelter.  \r\n\r\nIf the owner fails to comply, then steps should be taken to prosecute the owner and the dog seized.",
        "background": "Frequently when the community contact the RSPCA with concerns about a dog being left outside in the cold for prolonged periods of time, they are told that nothing can be done if the dog has access to shelter. Often this consists of a wooden kennel which provides no protection from the cold.",
