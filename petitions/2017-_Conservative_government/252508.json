        "additional_details": "In todays votes a call for a referendum to endorse any deal was rejected by 295 to 268 votes. However, this had more support than both votes on the proposed withdrawal agreement.\r\n\r\nI propose:\r\n1. Government revokes Article 50 or seeks a longer extension period, in order to hold a time-limited public consultation on the key points of the proposed withdrawal agreement. \r\n2 Followed by a referendum to see if there is support for this proposal.\r\n3. If there is not, we halt Brexit and stay in the EU.",
        "background": "The results of todays indicative votes, combined with the fact the proposed withdrawal agreement has been rejected twice, make it clear that parliament is unable to find a consensus regarding Brexit. \r\n\r\nThis stalemate has gone on long enough. It's time for the UK electorate to take over.",
