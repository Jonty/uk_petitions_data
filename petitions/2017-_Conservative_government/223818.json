        "additional_details": "Asherman's Syndrome is scarring (adhesions) of the uterus. This scarring causes lighter periods or no periods at all and, in almost all women who are affected, infertility. It most often develops after a common minor operation called a D&C (dilation and curettage) and often following a missed miscarriage. In this case it's called an ERPC (evacuation of retained products of conception). It is estimated that around 60,000 - 100,000 D&Cs are carried out each year and many women remain undiagnosed.",
        "background": "In 2009, I was pregnant with my one and only pregnancy. At my three-month scan, I was told there was no heartbeat and that I needed to have an ERPC. Following this I was diagnosed with Asherman's Syndrome, which then caused me to become infertile. This Silent Syndrome has been recognised since 1948.",
