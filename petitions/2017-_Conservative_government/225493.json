        "additional_details": "We are Team Ward from Preston NCS \u2013 Wave 4. NCS, which stands for National Citizen Service, is a programme which encourages young people to engage in social action and make a difference in society. Recently we visited Briary Court \u2013 a local care home. We were shocked at the visible lack of staff to help support the service users when we arrived. After this experience, we decided we were going to try and make a difference by starting this petition.",
        "background": "How much do you think care homes cost per week? You\u2019d be surprised to find out the national average is \u00a3600, excluding nursing. This high price tag does not match the quality of the services provided. Help us to change this, as well as your possible future.",
