        "action": "Debate the relevance of the Right to Buy legislation",
        "additional_details": "I recently saw a discussion on the television where the particular Council responding to a question concerning their inability to house homeless families/single people said that for every three properties they built, two others of their stock went for 'right to buy'. I know little of the problems of Councils housing people nor of the Right to Buy Legislation but it seems to me possible that those that introduced the legislation may not have anticipated todays number of homeless.",
        "background": "Because of the increasing number of homeless families/single people, this request asks that Parliament debates the relevancy of the Right to Buy legislation, considering whether by revoking it thereby leaving more homes under Council control the numbers of homeless might decrease.",
