The consumption of processed meat causes an additional 34,000 worldwide cancer deaths a year,  four times the number of people killed annually on Britain\u2019s roads.\r\nConsuming just 9g of bacon a day \u2013 less than a rasher \u2013 could significantly raise the risk of developing breast cancer later in life. Jill Pell from Glasgow University says that \u201cit would be misleading\u201d for health authorities to set any safe dose for processed meat \u201cother than zero\u201d. The Guardian.",
        "background": "Processed meat has been classified as carcinogenic to humans by the WHO. As little as one serving a day increases the risk of diabetes by 50% and heart disease by 42% (guardian) and causes 8,500 cancers every year. Advertisements of it should be banned completely.",
