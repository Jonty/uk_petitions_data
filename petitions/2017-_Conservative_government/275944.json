        "additional_details": "Many schools, hospitals, prisons, restaurants and supermarkets are now using halal meat yet over 90% of the British public are not Muslim and are against the use of non stunned meat. We, the majority, should have the choice to whether we eat this type of meat or not, yet there is no way that we can differentiate what is halal or not. The supermarkets and restaurants force it on the masses because it is easier for them. I am totally against non stun slaughtered meat but am not being given choice.",
        "background": "Halal meat is now routinely being used in restaurants, schools & hospitals yet only 7% of the population is Muslim. I, along with many other do not want to eat meat which has been slaughtered without stunning.",
