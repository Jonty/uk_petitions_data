        "additional_details": "Currently you can obtain an A1 license at 17+ Years old Which allows you to ride a motorcycle up to a 125cc with no more power of 11kw (15 bhp) you no longer display L plates, you can carry a pillion and have access to the motorway. \r\n\r\nCbt allows you to ride a motorcycle up to a 125cc with no more power of 11kw (15 bhp) as long as you display L plates front and back, don\u2019t Carry pillions and don\u2019t go onto the motorway.\r\n\r\n17 year olds have no restriction on what car they can drive after passing.",
        "background": "My suggested change is if you are 18+ Years old and obtain an A1 license you can ride a motorcycle up to a 300cc with no power greater than 23 kw (30 bhp) Restrictions can be placed on the bike. This will give people an incentive to obtain this license. Making more people do motorcycle training.",
