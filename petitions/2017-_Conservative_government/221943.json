        "additional_details": "This was recently highlighted by several shows including, most notably, 'Last Week Tonight with John Oliver' (HBO). \r\n\r\nThis prevents all satirical shows, one example of many being 'Have I Got News For You', broadcasting Parliamentary proceedings in the UK.",
        "background": "A condition to broadcast Parliamentary proceedings is that \"no extracts of Parliamentary proceedings may be used in any light entertainment programme or in a programme of political satire\". Parliament should repeal this condition in the name of transparency and encouragement of freedom of the press.",
