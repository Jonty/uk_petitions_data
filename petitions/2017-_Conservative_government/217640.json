        "additional_details": "The British public have not been given a choice whether to intervene or not and this matter has not been put forward to debate in parliament.\r\nA recent survey found that 80% of the public did not support intervention and this shows these strikes are not in the interest of the British public. \r\nThis is not even considering the damage these strikes could do to civilians and other non-combatants  \r\nA recent US strike hit a residential area killing civilians",
        "background": "Due to the alleged chemical attack in Syria by President Assad the UK government has decided to launch military strikes against the Syrian army. As the British people have had no say in this and this matter has not been put to parliament the strikes should cease immediately",
