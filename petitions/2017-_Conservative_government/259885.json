        "additional_details": "They would be a very good alternative to antibiotics as we know antibiotics can lead to \u201csuperbugs\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis means that instead of stopping, some bacteria become resistant or immune to antibiotic treatment. Resistance happens when bacteria evolve or change to become stronger than the antibiotics. \r\n\r\nThey can even spread this \u201csuperpower\u201d to other bacteria. This may trigger dangerous infections that cannot be treated. Untreatable bacteria can be deadly.",
        "background": "Phage Therapy is the therapeutic use of bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infections. Bacteriophages are much more specific than antibiotics. They are typically harmless to the host organism, and other beneficial bacteria, eg gut flora, reducing the chances of opportunistic infections.",
