        "additional_details": "Highways England manages our Strategic Road Network that includes most motorways and significant \u2018A\u2019 roads. This covers only 2% of our total road network and yet accounts for a third of all travelled miles. However, \u00a321.6 billion was spent on the SRN last year whilst only \u00a31.8 billion was granted to the minor road network.\r\n\r\nWe need to temporarily redress this financial imbalance to rebuild our local roads to ensure that the \u2018first and last mile\u2019 of our journeys are improved to a safe standard.",
        "background": "I propose that we utilise the skills of Highways England to manage the reconstruction of our potholed and increasingly dangerous minor roads. Funding to be provided by reallocating some funds from the Strategic Road Network budget. We need to stop further deterioration of our roads and rebuild.",
