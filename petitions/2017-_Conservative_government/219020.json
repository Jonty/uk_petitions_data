        "additional_details": "Britain proscribes Hizballah\u2019s \u201cmilitary wing\u201d but, at the behest of the Foreign Office, not its \u201cpolitical wing\u201d. Hizballah mocks the distinction. For example in 2012 its Deputy Secretary-General said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a military wing and a political one\u201d.\r\n \r\nHizballah seeks the extermination of Jews. For example in 2004 its Secretary-General said: \u201cIf Jews all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide. It has been responsible for terrorist attacks murdering Jews from Buenas Aires to Burgas, and has even been blamed for two bombings targeting Jews in London in 1994.\r\n",
        "background": "Supporters of Hizballah annually parade through London and are permitted to do so on the grounds that only Hizballah\u2019s \u201cmilitary wing\u201d is proscribed. Even Hizballah admits there is no \u201cmilitary wing\u201d. We must stop these parades on our streets.",
