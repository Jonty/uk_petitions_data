        "additional_details": "Due to the closure of all Sandwell clinics, 41,000 young adults aged 15-24 will be affected and excluded as a result of this. Young adults will have to travel further causing more of a struggle to see an 'expert' regarding their sexual health, which could lead them to being uneducated about safe sex. Also, there will be an extra strain on our NHS due to an increase of people having to visit their GP, and there will be a loss of jobs for staff who work at the Brook clinics.",
        "background": "www.brook.org.uk state: \"We believe that young people should have access to great sexual health services and well-being support\". If this is the case, why are they reducing the Sandwell and Dudley region clinic hours by 70%? We should be making access to sexual health education easier, not harder.",
