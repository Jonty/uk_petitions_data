        "action": "Increase the National Minimum Wage for those aged 16-18 and 18-21.",
        "additional_details": "Of those in part-time work, many work minimum contracts of 16 hours.\r\nThis at a minimum produces a working week of 51 hours. This doesn't take into consideration the travel time to and from their further education establishments which can total at least 2 hours with a returning journey.\r\nDue to the exploitation tactics of many employers, young people are often working long hours to try compensate for their pay. This leads to a severe disruption to study which can increase mental health issues.",
        "background": "Further Education students face expensive study material and extortionate travel. Many are working 16+ hours a week to compensate for wages causing extreme stress combined with their studies, they often work and study for combined hours more than those in full time employment. Same age, same wage.",
