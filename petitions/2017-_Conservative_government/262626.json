        "additional_details": "I\u2019m currently volunteering myself to support and educate schools on children with food allergies. \r\nWith no legislation in place for schools to be educated on fatal food allergies puts vulnerable children at risk of anaphylaxis. By ensuring there is a law in place for schools to educate and support each other and the children, will save lives. We need a change today instead of tomorrow, when it could be too late.",
        "background": "As a mother to a 6 year old with multiple FATAL food allergies I am yet to see any support from his school. It\u2019s vital schools are given the right support to educate themselves as well as the children on food allergies. The lives of our children are put at risk everyday.",
