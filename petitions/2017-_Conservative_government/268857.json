        "background": "When parties \u2018whip\u2019 MPs, there's an implicit suggestion that party endorsement at the next election depends on the MPs voting according to the party line. Whether done openly or through coded messages, this undermines MPs\u2019 ability to vote in good conscience, and should be tightly regulated.",
