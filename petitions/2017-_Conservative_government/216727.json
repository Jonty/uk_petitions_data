        "additional_details": "Considering fiat currency isn't backed by anything of value the government can but choose not to write itself a cheque to payoff all the national debt. Thus saving the interest payment it could use to pay itself back. \r\n\r\nThe government should consider bankruptcy as the only option to clear its debt and to reinstate proper spending to public services immediately. \r\n\r\nCrime is out of control, the NHS is at breaking point, local councils can't keep up with road maintenance. The country is a insolvent.",
        "background": "As the uk government can no longer meet its financial obligations to the NHS, Schools, Fire Service, Police to name a few under uk legislation any other company would be prosecuted for trading insolvent. The government should consider bankruptcy to stop the overwhelming interest payments it makes.",
