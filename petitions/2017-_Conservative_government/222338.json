        "action": "Reform Private Member's Bill procedure so that an objection needs to be seconded",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to request that parliamentary procedures be modernised. When an opportunity arises where an MP may object to a reading of a Private Bill or Private Member Bill, any objection must be seconded by another MP for it to be recognised. This change will allow for the democratic process to represent the electorate without it being compromised by a lone voice.",
        "background": "Evidenced today; Friday 15th June 2018, a Private Members Bill was objected to by a lone MP. The Private Members Bill process allows for Bills to be introduced by MPs and Lords who are not government ministers, furthering the democratic process. The objection by one MP hinders that process.",
