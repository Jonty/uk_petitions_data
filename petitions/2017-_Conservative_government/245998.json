        "action": "Leave the EU with no deal on 29th March 2019 in defiance of Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "The government and Parliament owe the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland an apology for the way they have behaved since the EU Referendum; the 9 month delay to invoking Article 50, the machinations of the Chequers/Withdrawal Agreement, the use of Northern Ireland as a political football and the threat of an extension to our legally-enshrined leaving date. The entire country has suffered as a result of their attempt to thwart democracy. Announce now that British democracy is fulfilled.",
        "background": "The British people are stressed out and in suspense waiting to leave the EU on 29th March. We don\u2019t want the Withdrawal Agreement, we don\u2019t want any delay at all. We want to leave all EU institutions on time with no delay and rely on WTO rules and the Governments proposed tariff regime on 1st April.",
