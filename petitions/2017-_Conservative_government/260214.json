Let us protest for the sale of British meat, supporting British farmers.\r\nMany people are unaware that the meat they are buying does not meet UK animal welfare standards as it is falsely advertised, as \u2018produced in the uk, *small print* sourced in the EU\u2019.\r\nIf the UK does not produce the product, such as Italian palma ham, this should be clearly labelled as non British.",
        "background": "All British farms and farmers have to comply with British animal welfare guidelines, which is fantastic. However, this means that supermarkets can sell European meat which is cheaper to source but does not comply with UK regulations.",
