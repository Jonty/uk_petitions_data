If the government is not willing to recommend this action, it should say why tax evasion is worse than killing gay men.",
        "background": "The Sultan of Brunei has implemented anti-LGBT laws that means gay men can be stoned to death. He is the ruler and Prime Minister - it was a personal decision. He should not be stripped of UK Honours as others have been for far less than actively promoting the killing of gay people.",
