        "additional_details": "I worked for 15 years in Education for Citizenship.\r\n\r\nPolitical facts in schools have always been strongly guarded so that no party achieves advantage: the students develop their political thinking through critical reflection on a range of opinons.\r\n\r\nThe government purports to be preparing the country for Brexit. Yet its contrived narrative portrays the prime minister as 'pupil friendly' before implying that parliament is stopping him achieving the will of the people.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptably biased.",
        "background": "Education for Citizenship in schools has always been designed to stimulate debate and widen student's knowledge on political issues. Recent examples of government communication in primary schools have been thinly veiled propaganda for Boris Johnson and Brexit and fall short of educational standards.",
