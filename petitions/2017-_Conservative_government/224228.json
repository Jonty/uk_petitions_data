        "action": "Introduce a health and safety law on the maximum temperature in a workplace",
        "additional_details": "In some fast food restaurants, kitchens are reaching highs of 36 degrees Celsius. Staff working in kitchens of all kinds are surrounded by grills, oil fryers, and heated surfaces, and cannot drink within their station for fear of cross contamination. All of these factors combine to make workplaces unbearable, and especially those working around food who sweat profusely in these conditions, it is not just them but the consumers at risk.",
        "background": "With the current heatwave in the UK employees all over the country are suffering and struggling to continue working. Many institutions lack working air conditioning systems and without a law on the maximum temperatures within workplaces, employers are doing very little to aid the welfare of staff.",
