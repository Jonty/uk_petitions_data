        "additional_details": "This petition is for the government to commit to leave with No Deal but defer the leave date so as to leave in an orderly fashion.\r\n \r\nAfter six months in October 2019 we leave, no deals, no if's, no but's, no delays. We adopt all law as our own and we trade under World Trade Organisation rules.\r\n \r\nWe are then free to build a future relationship from this position without any time constraints, on an equal basis without one side holding all the cards. Our future relationship with the world would be for the government of the day to decide, as it does on all other international issues.",
