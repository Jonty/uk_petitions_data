        "additional_details": "The \"Money to Burn\" Campaign:\r\nThis practice has been known as \"Ash Cash\", as \u00a3164 is paid for each set of cremation forms . The fees are for checking a patient IS dead and writing it down. Some doctors have been known to attend mortuaries in the hopes of a bulk of 'crems' meaning they can earn a lot of money, in one go, for the weekend. We need to put a stop to these fees as funeral poverty rises. Some people don't have money to burn, and they shouldn't have to pay EXTRA money to burn.",
        "background": "There are two forms which need to be signed, by law, for the cremation of a decedent to take place: one by the doctor attending the death, and another by a more qualified doctor. These are already part of any doctors' duties and shouldn't have extra fees associated with them",
