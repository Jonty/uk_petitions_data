These were letters that gave factual information about whether someone would risk arrest if they entered the UK. They were not intended to preclude investigation or prosecution based on new evidence emerging, or on the basis of a fresh assessment of the existing evidence.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland made a statement to the House of Commons on 9 September 2014 explaining that the scheme is at an end and these letters should not be relied on. \r\n\r\nYou can read the full statement here:\r\n\r\nhttps://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2014-09-09/debates/14090934000002/HallettReport\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign these petitions instead:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/219576\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/215715"
