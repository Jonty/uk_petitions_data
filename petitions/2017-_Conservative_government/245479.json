Presently this method of voting on such a key issue to our nation is  simply ridiculous. The MP's are there to represent the people and should be doing so with clarity that they understand the agreement on our behalf adequately to make the vote. Demonstrated through reasoning. Particularly as they are voting against the people having a right to vote on the deal.",

The people have the right to understand on what grounds each NO vote is made to understand if we are represented fairly and correctly. Alternative proposals for each listed required for a NO vote to be counted.",
