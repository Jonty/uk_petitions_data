        "additional_details": "Putting a pet in cargo (if your pet is not snub nosed like mine) is very risky and traumatic, especially for long flights. For those with pets that comply with cabin regulations, it is simply unnecessary to either not be able to fly into Britain or have to leave a pet behind for an extended period of time. \r\nWhy are we able to fly out with pets in cabin and not back into the UK? \r\nThe British are among the biggest animal-lovers in the world. Let's make it easier to enjoy family holidays together!",
        "background": "Ever tried going on holiday with your best friend? \r\nUnfortunately for pet owners that live in the UK the options are limited: 1. leave your dog in a kennel (If family/friends is not an option) 2. take your pet with you and return via ferry or car 3. ship your pet as cargo in the hold.",
