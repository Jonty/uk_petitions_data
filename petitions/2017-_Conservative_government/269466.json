        "action": "Give grandparents legal rights surrounding their grandchildren",
        "additional_details": "If the mother of a child refuses to allow access to grandparents then the only thing to do is through court, although this is not guaranteed to be successful.  Either parent has rights to see their child but a child can easily be denied the love of the extended family and the valuable experience of having a grandparent or parents in their life, which can enrich their lives in so many ways.  There is no reason for this it's just the law in this country",
        "background": "Under current UK legislature, grandparents do not have any rights regarding their grandchildren. The current rules mean relatives have to apply to a court to gain access rights to a child and then have a child arrangement order put in place, access is not an instant thing for grandparents.",
