Some fathers have to pay for court to see the children. Mothers income should be taken into account too.",
        "background": "Child maintenance is currently based on the other parents gross income. It should actually be calculated per child, their age, per week based on the costs of bringing up the child eg. clothes, food, nappies etc. The way they work it out now is too much of a persons income leaving them unable to live",
