        "additional_details": "If education is the key to a better life, then why is 'work experience' the lock keeping people barren. This may predominantly affect millennials, but it affects others too. There are people who want to work, but get rejected; when they just want to give back to society. \r\n\r\nIf I can't obtain a job, due to a lack of work/job-related experience. Yet, to obtain work/job-related experience, I need a job. However, an employer won't hire me; due to a lack of work/job-related experience. Then the system becomes a punishment for those who desire knowledge and to be better & productive members of society.",
        "background": "Coffee houses, supermarkets, clothes stores and others demand experience to work on tills, stock shelves and make drinks. The average person can cook, clean, hang laundry and treat people decently. So, why do these daily tasks, skills and experiences need to be gained from previous employment?",
