        "additional_details": "We are students in the University of  Leeds and we demand \u00a31200 of compensation for every student who loses lecture and contact time due to the upcoming 3 weeks' strike action from the 22nd of February to the 16th of March 2018. We request the refund due to the unequal value of learning time for the high annual tuition fee we have paid, which could be \u00a39000 for local students and over \u00a319000 for international students. We request for academic refund of our tuition fees for the whole 3 weeks' academic strike because we stand in solidarity with striking lecturers and hope to see the renegotiation. We need a positive response from our University as soon as possible.",
