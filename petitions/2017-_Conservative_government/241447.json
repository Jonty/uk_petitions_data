Running a car is expensive in general but having to pay out funds to fix up your car due to it being vandalised is not okay !! Please take a few moments to sign this petition",

Alongside having to go placements, students have to struggle with fees of parking which can be a large amount depending how many hours they have to be on placement that day and where it is located . This creates a lot of  inconvenience .",
