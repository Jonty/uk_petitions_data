Former Northern Ireland secretary Shaun Woodward defected from the Conservatives to Labour in 1999 and faced considerable criticism for not resigning his seat.\r\nIn 2007, Quentin Davies also quit the Tories for Labour and remained an MP until the 2010 general election",
        "background": "An MP has called for all Members of Parliament who defect to another party to face an immediate by-election.\r\n\r\nConservative Chris Skidmore said the vast majority of constituents voted for a particular party, seeing their MP as \"the embodiment of the party locally\".",
