        "action": "Seek an Independent Inquiry into the death of Kishni Mahay ",
        "additional_details": "Kishni Mahay was killed by a police patrol car. We believe that the car was not being driven appropriately according to the road conditions. We believe that key facts were missed by the investigating team (Police Complaints Authority: PCA). The Police Officer was never prosecuted. The post mortem examination declared that Kishni Mahay was an alcoholic with Cirrhosis of the Liver, which may have confused the inquest jurors.",
        "background": "For the last 29 years our family have vigorously believed that a gross injustice has reigned over my mother\u2019s death. An unbiased Independent inquiry would conclusively reveal justice and bring Kishni Mahay dignity in death. She will be able to rest in peace and we can achieve the closure we yearn.",
