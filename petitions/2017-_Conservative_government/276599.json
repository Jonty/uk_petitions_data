        "additional_details": "Marmalade's survey of Driving Instructors in Sept 19 (https://bit.ly/2oloEkT) found that 90% of pupils were subjected to tailgating & aggresive overtaking. \r\n\r\nIn addition to pupils becoming more nervous & likely to make mistakes, they reported 1/3 had to pull over & 8% became too scared to carry on learning to drive. 69% report being honked at & 49% cite verbal abuse.\r\n\r\nThis aggressive behaviour needs to stop. Learners are vulnerable & dangerous drivers are putting them & other road users at risk.",
        "background": "77% of learners are regularly experiencing intimidation/abuse from other drivers during lessons. As a result, 85% are making more mistakes and some have given up driving.\r\nA minimum fine of \u00a3100 and 3 penalty points on the offenders licence should be implemented to deter this abusive behaviour.",
