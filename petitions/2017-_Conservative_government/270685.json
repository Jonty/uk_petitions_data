        "additional_details": "There are many factors that affect how sustainable a food product is, meaning there are a variety of ways you could present this information to consumers. To give an idea of how food sustainability labelling might work, I have created 3 different designs that would help consumers make more well informed choices about the food they eat.\r\n\r\nDesigns and explanations of how they work can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/cw39hc/sustainability_labelling_for_food_packaging/",
        "background": "The food we eat has an impact on our planet as well as our health. But when we buy our food, we aren\u2019t given any information about whether a product is bad for the environment or not. Food in the UK has nutritional information printed on it. So why not have sustainability information on it too?",
