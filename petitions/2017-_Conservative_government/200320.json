        "additional_details": "The local authority have stated that they cannot install or police a box junction. If a box junction was to be installed it will likely be ignored anyway. Access to the M25 could be maintained via the junction and roundabouts at junction 2",
        "background": "The anticlockwise slip road at junction 1b is used as cut through when the M25 traffic is bad. This then blocks the flow of traffic in and around Dartford resulting in major conjestion and air/noise pollution in the local area.",
