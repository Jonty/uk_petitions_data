        "additional_details": "Provide more awareness and clarity on menopause through leaflets at Health Care Providers, emphasising that it's not just hot flushes that signal menopause. Target women in their 40s, 50s and 60s to cover all stages of menopause. Many women on contraceptives such as the mini-pill or the coil do not menstruate so need guidance. Integrate the information into the NHS website so that if you search for subjects such as memory loss, tiredness, anxiety etc. it states menopause as a possible cause.",
        "background": "Menopause affects half the population at some point in their lives, but menopause is often not acknowledged, taken seriously or knowledgably by Health Care Professionals. As many women are now employed and work for longer, greater awareness is needed to be more healthy and productive for longer.",
