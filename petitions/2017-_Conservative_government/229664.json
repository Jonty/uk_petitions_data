These noise levels are potentially harmful to health and are definitely harmful to people\u2019s rights to the peaceful enjoyment of their homes and gardens. \r\nMany users feel it necessary to wander the streets blowing around detritus that isn\u2019t even on their own property. Doing so should be regarded as an automatic reason to caution offenders to desist.",

The sheer decibel level generated by older style equipment, particularly petrol models, is anti social at best and harmful at worst.\r\nThe use of these models should be limited or even banned.",
