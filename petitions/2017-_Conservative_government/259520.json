        "additional_details": "Currently, the separated parent can only gain access to their child/children by applying to family court. They cannot go to the police for support. From the moment children are taken from a parent, a long process is required. Firstly, to attempt mediation, then finding a lawyer and applying to courts. Courts then take a month before the first hearing is given. The parent is separated from child/children for 2 months: ALL BEFORE A FIRST HEARING.",
        "background": "Make it a criminal offence for mothers to deny access to the father without a court order or legitimate concern (e.g., Risk to child). The current law allows one parent to deny the other parent any access to the child/ children without any court order or legitimate concern.",
