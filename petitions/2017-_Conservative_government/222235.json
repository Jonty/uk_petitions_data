        "additional_details": "Attachments styles forms the basis of all children's relationships. The bonds that are created in the child's early life, impact the way a child develops all the way through their life. A secure attachment can create a child who is self-confident, self-resilient and has the support network to overcome barriers. An insecure attachment can affect a child in the opposite way. A child may become insecure, limited self-regulation and may struggle to form and maintain relation/friendships.",
        "background": "John Bowlby started his research in the 1960's - importance of a primary bond to a main person. He discovered that this role was vital in for survival, not only through infancy but long into adulthood. I struggle to understand in the 2018, this information is still not taught in antenatal classes.",
