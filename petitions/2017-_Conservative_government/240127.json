        "action": "Allow serving Military Personnel to suspend services during overseas deployments",
        "additional_details": "Last year I was deployed overseas for 4 mths. I had to cancel both my Sky & PlusNet services which totalled approx. \u00a380 per mth because neither would suspend the service to be restarted on my return. There were no issues restarting Sky but with PlusNet I have had to pay \u00a345 to install a new line and wait over 5 weeks for the service to reinstated. Potentially this could occur every 1-3 yrs dependent on turn around of deployments",
        "background": "Some companies do not allow Serving Military personnel to suspend contracts when deployed overseas for periods of 3-8 months when they are not able to use those services during the deployment. Contracts have to be cancelled and restarted with additional costs involved.",
