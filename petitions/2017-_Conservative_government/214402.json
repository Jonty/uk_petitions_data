        "action": "Scrap tuition fees for paramedic science and nursing degrees",
        "additional_details": "Tuition fees were supposed to be a way of ensuring students who went on to earn higher salaries by virtue of their degree paid by the tax payer. Yet this now includes nurses and paramedics who have to have a degree rather than learning the skills on the job with time out for classroom based learning. \r\nThey also have their salaries capped by the government and at the same time there are a shortage of nurses and paramedics who are essential to the smooth running of the NHS.",
        "background": "Tuition fees for students studying in England are \u00a39250 a year regardless of the course being studied and the expected salary.\r\nThis means that students studying degrees such as nursing or paramedic science who will largely go into the NHS where salaries are capped are having to incur huge debts",
