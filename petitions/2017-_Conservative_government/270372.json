        "additional_details": "A previous petition with a similar aim received more than 6,103,000 signatures but was only given cursory consideration by the government. The citizens of the United Kingdom deserve better. The national interest can ONLY be served by revoking Article 50 and remaining in the EU on our current membership terms.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson stated in his campaign to become PM  that a no-deal Brexit was not what he wanted BUT his government appears to be actively seeking such an outcome. Leaked details of Operation Yellowhammer suggest that leaving the EU in this way will not be in the national interest.",
