        "background": "As we are already aware, the production of methane from livestock, in particular cows, is a huge factor adding to air pollution (14.5-18% (Pierre-Louis, 2018)). By introducing dung beetles into pastoral farming we can reduce levels of methane caused by agriculture by up to 40% (Holland, 2013).",
