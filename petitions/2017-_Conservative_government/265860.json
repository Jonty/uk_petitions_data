        "additional_details": "Currently rights are on side the parent that a child lives with. This is about helping a child have two support networks, not empower a single parent. I believe it will decrease child mental health problems & male suicide rates. Adults need to support each other to help children grow up as peacefully and happily as possible. There\u2019s more to parenting than money.",
        "background": "Give mothers and fathers the same rights to support a child\u2019s upbringing. Please make it the law to offer joint custody to all suitable parents before making the \u201cabsent\u201d parent pay thousands of pounds to go through court or pay CM. It is damaging and distressing for all parties involved.",
