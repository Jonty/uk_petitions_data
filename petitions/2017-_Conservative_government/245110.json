        "additional_details": "Diet companies often use 'influencers' to promote their detox tea or appetite suppressants. These 'influencers' are often followed by many young, impressionable teens/adults allowing them to be sucked into an unhealthy ideal that skinny means healthy. Often half the time not even being made aware that these influencers are doing a paid promotion with the brand, resulting in them being influenced to buy the product, all of which can lead to disordered eating habits and a lack of self worth.",
        "background": "Diet companies and influencers promoting these companies on social media are creating a toxic culture of diet and eating disorders, impacting many young, impressionable audiences, resulting in a growing epidemic of eating disorders. It is our duty to fight against this toxic culture.",
