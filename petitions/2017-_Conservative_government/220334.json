How many babies could there be that have been wrongfully categorised as Stillborn?\r\nWe need to change the law so that every single baby who the midwives/doctors believe to be stillborn receives a coroner's inquest. If this was the case back in 2011 it would have saved our family 7 years of heartache. \r\nNow our son's birth will be registered and he will forever be on our family tree, he will never be forgotten, what every baby deserves.",

He survived for 1hr10minutes, he suffered a neonatal death and should have received a Birth and Death certificate.",
