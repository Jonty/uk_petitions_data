How many babies could there be that have been wrongfully categorised as Stillborn?\r\nWe need to change the law so that every single baby who the midwives/doctors believe to be stillborn receives a coroner's inquest. If this was the case back in 2011 it would have saved our family 7 years of heartache. \r\nNow our son's birth will be registered and he will forever be on our family tree, he will never be forgotten, what every baby deserves.",
        "background": "In 2011 a midwife signed by baby off to receive a stillborn certificate. 7 years I have fought and in March this year the coroner found that my baby was NOT stillborn. He survived for 1hr10minutes, he suffered a neonatal death and should have received a Birth and Death certificate.",
