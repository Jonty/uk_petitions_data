        "additional_details": "We fear this treatment of this tribe enshrines the very problem that sees the nurturing ecosystem for radicalisation, extremism and Islamists calls for Jihad. The issue is the underlying racism and racial mistreatment of the black libyans and other North Africans is what makes the environment welcoming to ''all-for Muslims'' (and equality) Jihadists in the region. As well as making recruitment of the angry young people readily available. We, British & Muslim, as a local grassroot NGO we support.",
