        "action": "Impose time limits for developers upon beginning and finishing construction.",
        "additional_details": "All Local Authorities have a statutory obligation to ensure that they have a 5 year supply of new homes. The efforts of Local Authorities trying to meet their quota is being hampered by developers who do not begin construction once permission is granted. The five year supply is measured by newly completed or dwellings under construction. At present developers are at liberty to submit planning applications on any site if the Local Authority does not have an approved five year housing supply",
        "background": "The law should be changed so that Local Planning Authorities must revoke Planning Permission after 18 months if work has not begun. They should also be able to impose financial penalties upon developers who fail to begin construction within 18 months and time limits for completion of projects.",
