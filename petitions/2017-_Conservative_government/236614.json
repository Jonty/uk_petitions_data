        "action": "Make recycling free for all schools in England.",
        "additional_details": "I am the leader of my school's eco-club and I have been campaigning for there to be facilities where we can recycle our plastic waste for the past two years. Due to a tight budget and the council's insistence that we pay for them to dispose of our recycling we have been unable to get such facilities.",
        "background": "Currently, schools are expected to pay in order for the council to take away their recyclable waste. I propose that all schools in England are given free recycling and that it is made mandatory that they should dispose of all of their waste in the most environmentally conscious way possible.",
