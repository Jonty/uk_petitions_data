        "action": "Introduce a compulsory current affairs GCSE encouraging engagement in politics",
        "additional_details": "Politicians need to have a role in the introduction of this course. Local councillors are often overlooked in our democratic process but they should be in schools, both secondary and primary to introduce political debate and their political arguments to students and be prepared to be confronted by views they disagree with from their future electorate.",
        "background": "Ignorance and apathy in politics currently is rife and so we need to talk about this and introduce compulsory education on our democratic systems within schools. This petition seeks the introduction of a compulsory current affairs GCSE taught by a tutor who will lead but not influence debate.",
