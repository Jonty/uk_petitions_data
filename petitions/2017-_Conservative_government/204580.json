        "additional_details": "Council CCTV is a massive resource to police, has a huge impact on bringing down anti-social behaviour, crime, drug dealing and is extremely valuable in securing convictions.  It\u2019s argued that the money the council will spend on putting things right such as vandalism, theft from local premises, etc it will pay for itself twice over.\r\n\r\nIt is also invaluable in tracking the movements of terrorists or monitoring potential terrorist activity as well as keeping residents and visitors safe.",
