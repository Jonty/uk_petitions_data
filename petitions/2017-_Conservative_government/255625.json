        "additional_details": "I believe the government at the time didn't really understand the implications of leaving the EU.  The government aren't legally obliged to implement results of a referendum, just morally obliged as its in their manifesto. By making results of a referendum law, more upfront work would take place between the government and the houses of parliament and lords ensuring that they fully understood the implications of the specific referendum prior to instigating the vote process.",
        "background": "In June 2016 the UK voted to leave the EU. In March 2017 Article 50 was triggered to leave on 29th March 2019. Its not happened and looks like its going to be extended to 2020.  The vote was to leave or remain.",
