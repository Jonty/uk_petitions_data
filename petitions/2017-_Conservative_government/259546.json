        "additional_details": "Not only would this hand a private company a successful NHS agency which makes a profit and has an effective monopoly on staffing, it would also divert crucial funds away from the NHS at a time when it is struggling more than ever with successive budget cuts and increasing pressure on services.\r\n\r\nThis inevitably increases costs to the NHS  by prioritising the taking of a profit from the process,\r\nPrivate companies put profits before patients. The Government must not be allowed to sell off yet another part of our NHS.",
        "background": "NHS Professionals is the in-house recruitment and staffing agency of the NHS. The government is planning to 'seek external investment' for the organisation - i.e. sell it off to a private, profit making company.",
