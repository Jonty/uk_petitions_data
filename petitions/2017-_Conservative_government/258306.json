        "additional_details": "If it becomes law for cyclists of ALL ages to wear helmets then it will become the norm and people (children especially) will not be teased over the wearing of helmets.\r\nMy son use to ride his bike everyday come rain or shine and was quite happy to wear his helmet. Until he went into year 6, when he was teased, so much so he stopped wearing his helmet altogether.  We said no helmet no bike and now he hasn't ridden his bike for 8 months!!",
        "background": "So many deaths and brain injuries happen because adults and children are not wearing helmets. Motorbike enthusiasts have to wear helmets, so why not those on pushbikes?",
