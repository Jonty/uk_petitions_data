        "additional_details": "https://www.parliament.gov.za/news/national-assembly-debates-motion-land-expropriation  The link refers to Settlers taking land in 1660. The problem of correcting this now without compensation is unfair. Families have owned and bought this land for generations. The current occupants are not guilty of stealing land. If South Africa goes ahead with this it is not only a violation of occupants human rights but will severely damage the South African economy. Britain should speak out against this.",
        "background": "On the 27th of February the South African National Assembly passed a motion brought by the EFF leader MP Mr Julius Malema to have their Constitution amended to intensify land redistribution though the introduction of \u201cexpropriation of land without compensation\u201d.
