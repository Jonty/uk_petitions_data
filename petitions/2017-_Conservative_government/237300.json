Residential properties should not be left empty while individuals in the local area are in need of housing.\r\n\r\nMore than 11,000 homes in the UK have been empty for at least a decade, research from the Liberal Democrats has found. \r\nThe data showed that 60,000 properties had been empty for two years or more, 23,000 for five years or more and more than 11,000 for ten years.",
