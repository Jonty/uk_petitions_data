Over 7000 miles of Motorway & Major A roads are managed by Highways England.\r\n\r\nGovernment should review the impact of these roads on biodiversity and invest in natures recovery, with the objective to benefit both wildlife and local communities. This supports a 'Greener Future' as promised by the 25 Year Plan, and by implementing strategies to include Green Bridges overall road safety can also be improved.",

Reconnecting our landscape across Britain will add to a network of positive solutions already being implemented to combat the climate crisis, and will actually make the goals currently ink on paper, a reality.",
