        "action": "Hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EU or leave, before  end of 2018.",
        "additional_details": "By the end of 2018 the British public will know what sort of arrangements the government have made to leave the EU. Furthermore, by holding the referendum then, uncertainty will be eliminated and Britain will be able to go into 2019 with the certainty of remaining in the EU or with the certainty of leaving it. Most people agree  this is a very important decision for Britain. The result of the first referendum was close and many say it was biased. A new and fairer referendum is needed.",
        "background": "Like this petition, the right to vote in the referendum should be open to all British citizens and all UK residents of age. The right to vote should not be taken away because of previous non participation in elections. UK citizens abroad should be able to register to vote online or in UK consulates.",
