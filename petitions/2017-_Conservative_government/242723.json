After giving a witness statement, and supporting the victim to prosecute, my colleague supported the client to court. Prior to the court hearing, my colleague was told the case had been rejected by the CPS due to my colleague being an 'unreliable witness' - the reason being my colleague's historic (13yrs ago) offences directly linked to past drug/addiction related crime",

Although the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act states convictions are 'spent', people with such history experience inequality",

For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Parliament and Government to prevent the disclosure of spent convictions of people in recovery, if that's something you'd like to happen. "
