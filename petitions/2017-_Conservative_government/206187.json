        "action": "Stop Ofsted from questioning Muslims schoolgirls about why they wear a headscarf",
        "additional_details": "Other faiths too have specific dress codes e.g. the Sikh Joora (topknot) and the Jewish kippah (skullcap), and religious symbols e.g. the cross. For Ofsted to single out an aspect of Muslim dress is worrying and discriminatory.\r\n\r\nAs a society, we are proud that our country gives us freedoms and equality. Now let us make sure these laws are acted upon.",
        "background": "Ofsted's chief inspector has announced she will encourage inspectors to question Muslim girls in primary schools who wear a hijab - without mention of children of other faiths being questioned about their religious dress/symbols. Such discriminatory actions have no place in our society.",
