This tradition has been taken from us and after going to last years \u2018River of Light\u2019 festival we won\u2019t be going back. Huge crowds, traffic jams, being squashed in to a small space, not being able to see a thing - not to mention the firework display itself was a complete disappointment! We then spent 3 hours walking between bus stops trying to get home in the cold. Disaster!",

My Mum went with her Mum as a child, and I\u2019ve been every year with my family since I was a baby.\r\n\r\nIt was a family tradition, that\u2019s been stolen from local residents.",
