        "additional_details": "Despite promises from the top universities to improve their systems for admissions, figures released by MP David Lammy, show the situation to be worsening. 82% of offers from Oxford and 81% from Cambridge went to students from the top two socio-economic groups in 2015, up from 79% at both universities five years earlier.* \r\n\r\nThe government must act. A withdrawl of public funding, plus significant fines for offending institutions should be implemented immediately.\r\n\r\n*The Guardian 19 10 2017",
        "background": "7% of children in Britain go to an independent school. In this age of soaring inequality, the fact that around 40% of offers of a place at Oxbridge, and around 25% from the Russell Group of top universities, go to these students is simply shocking. It is 2017, not 1917. Enough is enough.",
