        "additional_details": "In the year 2017,  4,315,500 crimes were recorded. \r\n74,784 were the arrests of young children and the youth. \r\nOn average a custodial sentenced youth sentence length would be around 16 months long.\r\n13,500 youth cautions were given to young people throughout the UK.\r\nWe believe that if we can read signs and tackle them with suitable guidance then we will be able to reduce these numbers and hopefully provide a better future for the next generation.\r\nWith proper support, counselling and guidance from the government real changes can be made. Help create sustainable futures for OUR youth.",
        "background": "This is for our citizenship GCSE campaign and we strongly believe that if changes were made, then crimes within the youth would be significantly reduced.",
