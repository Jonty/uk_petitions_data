        "additional_details": "Unecessary life-time disclosure causes sustained upset, distress and humiliation. Being asked for disclosure of convictions for such things as car and home insurance creates regular stress and anxiety for many individuals. Applications which are NOT exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 still have the right to ask this question which in turn raises unnecessary discrimination. The current situation is causing unfair alienation and separation. Please help Reason 4 Change by signing.",

Once at least 10 years has past and no further offences have been committed, there needs to be eligibility for a \u2018spent\u2019 status.",
