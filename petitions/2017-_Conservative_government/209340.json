        "additional_details": "The government has done nothing to push stores in to offering an alternative to their customers, such as a paper bag. As such this seems to be merely a money making scheme for them. The viscious cycle of using plastic bags will not stop unless they ban them completely and offer a biodegradable alternative, we all know that in the US they have the option of \u2018paper or plastic\u2019 in their supermarkets and shops, why can\u2019t we be offered the same. So please sign to get this debated!!!",
        "background": "We all know that we have to cut down on plastic and since 2015 there has been a 5p charge for plastic carrier bags in stores with more than 250 employees, however this week the conservative government have now extended this to all stores.",
