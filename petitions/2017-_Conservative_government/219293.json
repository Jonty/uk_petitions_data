        "action": "Redesign the taxation system to support families with children",
        "additional_details": "With an aging population, we need children who will be the taxpayers of the future. Our tax system should therefore support and encourage families to have children, not make it unaffordable. Children are currently the population sector most likely to be in poverty, while single adults without children enjoy some of the lowest tax rates in the developed world. The existing system with child benefit and child tax credits is unfair and cumbersome. A tax system that includes an option of combined household income is common sense and is the standard in most countries in the western world.",
        "background": "Give families the option to be taxed on their combined household income and design a tax free allowance as a function of the number of people who depend on that income. Single-earner families and single-parents carry the highest effective burden of the tax which is an unfair and short sighted policy",
