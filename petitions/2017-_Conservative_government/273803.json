It's therefore not clear what action could be taken. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7612\r\n\r\nWe're not sure exactly what question you'd like to be asked in a referendum. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions calling separately for the Government to seek an extension to the date the UK leaves to EU, a general election and referenda of various types. You may like to sign one or more of these petitions if they call for things you'd like to happen, for example:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/269499\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/264215\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/266973\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/253636"
