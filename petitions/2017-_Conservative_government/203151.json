        "action": "Secure the release of Jack Letts who is detained in northern Syria",
        "additional_details": "The British police told us there is no evidence Jack was involved in violence in Syria. However, the government believes it has public opinion on its side in keeping Jack without charge in foreign detention. The press has condemned him as a jihadi, despite evidence showing he courageously stood against Isis. His detention conditions are appalling, including no exercise and months in solitary confinement. If there are charges against him, he should be allowed to defend himself in a British court.",
        "background": "Our son, Jack Letts, has been 'disappeared' in a Guantanamo-style \u2018black site\u2019 in Kurdish territory in Syria and has had no contact with the outside world since July 8. The British government is refusing to engage with the Kurdish authorities to secure his release. We greatly fear for his life.",
