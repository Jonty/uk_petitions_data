        "additional_details": "Technology has moved quickly with many older people only recently becoming familiar with basic I.T. The option of using e-mail to communicate, contribute and participate is being taken away from them (presumably to save costs on monitoring and replying). Legislation needs to be ammended to ensure that contact options include e-mail as an alternative wherever the Social Networking option is provided. Many older people for example are now unable to send meter readings without social networking.",
        "background": "It is becoming obvious that a significant proportion of the population are being disenfranchised and excluded from participating in activities and events if they do not choose to subscribe to Social Networking. An example of this is the BBC Programme 'Springwatch' as well as some energy providers.",
