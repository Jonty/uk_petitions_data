        "action": "Have one exam board.",
        "additional_details": "I believe exam boards have an incentive to make their exam the easiest as possible while remaining within regulations so that school pick them so that they buy their resources and textbooks. Students do not all learn the same material, this means it is harder for young people to work together when passing exams, having one exam board would mean that resource and teaching could be universal across the country. It would also mean that resources would become cheaper due to the economy of scale.",
        "background": "Having one exam board would remove competition and provide a level playing field and continuity between students. Some boards are considered to be easier than others. In addition, this exam board should be rounded so not only focused on passing the exam but also teach more \"soft skills\".",
