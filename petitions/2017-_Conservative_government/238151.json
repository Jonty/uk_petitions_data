Yet, after 13 years the process has proven to be unworkable; the industry still has ineffective training courses that remain entirely unfit for purpose. \r\n\r\nThrough SIA Board member change and implementing proper training core competencies, service levels would improve, satisfaction to the consumer would improve and the generally low wages to the security worker would be increased.",
