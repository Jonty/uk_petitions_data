        "additional_details": "I\u2019ve been disabled for over 10 years and in my experience, DWP are rude on the phone and there is no care for the individual. I felt humiliated by the assessor who wouldn't even open a door for me. Despite clearly seeing that you\u2019re ill, they try to make you bend, touch your toes, and lean forward which is so humiliating for people. They even look to see if you\u2019ve got nail polish on and whether your clothes are clean. This humiliating process has to stop.\r\n",
        "background": "DWP assessments should take place in hospitals, not offices, and by doctors, not nurses or other staff. Currently assessments are based on errors, they humiliate people and absolutely no care is shown. Too many people are pushed to appeal.",
