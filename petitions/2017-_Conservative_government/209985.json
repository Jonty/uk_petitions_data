Only a tiny percentage are filled for collection with the majority ending up straight in the homeowner\u2019s bin and off to landfill. This unnecessary use of plastic bags must stop.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that 500,000 plastic charity collection bags are sent to landfill every year. Each bag is delivered inside another plastic bag envelope, so about one million bags are disposed of every year. \r\n\r\nCharities rely on the donation of goods. Unwanted goods can be taken to local charity shops or conveniently located collection points. \r\n\r\nIf you agree, please sign and share.",
