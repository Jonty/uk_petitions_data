In particular, we're not sure to which care workers you want a minimum wage to apply. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThere's already a petition calling for all employed carers to be paid the Living Wage, which you might like to sign. You're more likely to get action on an issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/236151\r\n"
