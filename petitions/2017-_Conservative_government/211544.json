        "additional_details": "Car speedometers have an error margin. All are calibrated differently and in different time periods  Police speed traps/guns also need to be calibrated with and have a nominal error margin also. Police will be able to issue a ticket if their gun says 71mph and your car says 69mph! There is no way the police can actually know to 1mph how fast you are going! People will spend more time lookong at their speedometer rather than the road and hazards ahead.",
        "background": "The police chief is proposing a zero tolerance approach to speeding. Good motorists will become criminals if they accidently creep slightly over the limit. Car speedometers are calibrated with an error margin that could see you given a ticket even though your new or old car said you weren't!",
