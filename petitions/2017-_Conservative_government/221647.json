I thought this was unfair and I feel that this needs to change and should be a basic right. \r\n\r\ngov.uk website \r\n\"pay, your employer may pay you for time off to look after dependents but they don't have to. check your contact, company handbook or internet site to see if there are rules about this. \"",
