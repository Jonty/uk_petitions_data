        "additional_details": "\u2022 17.5 billion pieces of junk mail are distributed each year in the UK, the average household receives 650 pieces. The majority remains unopened and/or unread.\r\n \u2022 Direct Mail results in roughly 550,000 tons of household waste, 2.1% of the municipal waste stream. \r\n\r\nJunk mail wastes material & energy during every stage of its life cycle (Manufacture, Distribution, Collection, Recycling). This petition calls upon the Government to put the Environment before the Economy.",
        "background": "This petition asserts that unsolicited physical mail, for the purpose of marketing, is unacceptably wasteful & damaging to the environment. This mail (\u2018Junk Mail\u2019) is delivered to households either through the postal system, or as inserts within other deliveries (such as Newspapers).",
