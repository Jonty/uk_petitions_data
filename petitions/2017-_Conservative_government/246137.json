Now she is asking for extension. \r\n\u201c No deal better than bad deal \u201c her proposal takes us out of the EU but locks us in without a say.\r\n\u201cWe will leave the customs union \u201c this is correct BUT we will align all our laws to the EU\u2019s which restricts the trade deals we can do around the world. Whole point in leaving is that we make our own laws not mimic the laws that are holding us back and ultimately the majority of voters voted to leave.",
        "background": "Theresa May is a EU supporter & voted as such in the EU referendum. She has renegaded on all of her promises on leaving the EU. \u201c leave means leave \u201c & \u201c No deal better than bad deal \u201c . She has done so much damage to the UK with her middle of the road approach trying to please both remain & leave.",

This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. \r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about a particular policy or decision that's the responsibility of Government or the House of Commons, you could start a petition about that. \r\nPetitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want. \r\n"
