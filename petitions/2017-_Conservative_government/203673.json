        "additional_details": "We need an awareness campaign and funding for more research and support services for sufferers. Most people don't know about Lyme and most Lyme sufferers don't know they have it. It can ruin and also take lives. My mum has lived with Lyme for 8 years and her health is declining due to no support or treatment, other than what is available privately which many of us can\u2019t afford.  Why should people suffer in silence with no support? Everyone supports cancer, why can\u2019t we support all diseases?",
        "background": "Lyme disease and its co-infections get more difficult to treat the longer it is left. Early detection is essential for the right course of antibiotics for the right amount of time. This disease is often misdiagnosed as other diseases such as: MS, ME, Fibromyalgia and many more.",
