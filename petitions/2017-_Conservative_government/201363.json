        "additional_details": "Please help us to get the speed limit reduced on our road. There are lots of families around here and the speed limit outside is so dangerous. I often see young children walking on these roads. I believe that having a speed limit this high on this road is going to cause more accidents in the future, specially as children are walking around outside the houses. Please help us to get the speed limit reduced to 30 miles an hour as it is in the rest of the village.",
        "background": "The road is so dangerous outside our house and it has a 60 mph limit. We are a young family and there are many families around here. People often speed on this road and unfortunately we have had 2 cats killed within 3 months! There are children walking on this road and the speed must be reduced.",
