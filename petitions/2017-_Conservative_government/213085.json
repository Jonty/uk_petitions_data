This cannot happen.\r\n\r\nWe have done so much good, some of the guests have moved on after securing jobs and accommodation, but more people need help. The Shelter needs to stay open, but we need somewhere with beds, a kitchen and an indoor bathroom.\r\n\r\nWelwyn Hatfield Council, please do the right thing.  You have the funds to help so many.",
        "background": "We would like Welwyn Hatfield Council to keep the Hatfield Night Shelter open all year, in memory of the late Cllr Lynne Sparks.\r\n\r\nFather Darren kindly opened the doors of The Church of St Luke in November, giving our guests a roof and a safe place to stay.  We have a home.",
