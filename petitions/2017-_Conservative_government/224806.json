I have since been led to believe that they hold information back from the parents. Every child has different strengths and abilities so why do the councils follow a standard chart? My child is just as important as everyone else and it\u2019s in his best interest he has the right surroundings. Do not be bullied into the wrong choices for your child. They all matter.",
