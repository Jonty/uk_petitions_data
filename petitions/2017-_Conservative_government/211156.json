        "action": "The government should introduce a truly FAIR funding formula for all schools.",
        "additional_details": "Some additional funding was given recently but is outweighed by inflationary pressures (increased costs) and additional government requirements.  Schools in some areas are either having to make redundancies or are using up remaining cash reserves.  This is therefore a looming crisis that the government must address before this impacts further on outcomes.\r\n\r\nAll references to funding made above are \"per pupil\" and take account of separate funding such as the pupil premium and London weighting.",
        "background": "The current funding of schools is unfairly distributed meaning that some schools receive millions of pounds more than others.  A \"fair\" funding formula was to be introduced for schools but this was dropped, leaving many schools underfunded due to lower real terms funding (i.e. due to inflation etc).",
