        "action": "Amend the Gender Recognition Act 2004 to remove the need for a medical diagnosis",
        "additional_details": "Currently, the GRA04 requires a psychiatrist or medical practitioner to diagnose someone with gender dysphoria in order to gain a gender recognition certificate. This is wrong because:\r\n\r\n1) Not all transgender people experience dysphoia.\r\n2) There are often considerable waits to see a psychologist or medical practitioner about gender issues, and so this delays the whole process.\r\n3) Seeing someone about gender issues is often invasive, or otherwise uncomfortable.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, urge the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain to remove any requirement for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (as endorsed by a psychiatrist or medical practitioner) to receive a gender recognition certificate under the Gender Recognition Act of 2004.",
