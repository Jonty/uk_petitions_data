        "additional_details": "The digital economy is borderless yet depends on consumer trust and business confidence. Leaving the Digital Single Market will tax that confidence in more ways than one. We ask the HM Government to start being responsible for publicly addressing:\r\n(1) future relations to EU agencies such as ENISA and EDPB \r\n(2) participation in EU funded research \r\n(3) regulatory alignment to EU rules for telecoms (incl. free roaming), data protection, consumer rights, audio visual media services, and copyright.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call upon HM Government to specifically negotiate the UKs future relationship to the Digital Single Market in the final Brexit deal.  Ignoring the digital economy would put the UK\u2019s future prosperity and thousands of jobs unnecessarily at risk.",
