        "additional_details": "Mental health staff numbers are not increasing at anything like the rate the government claims. The government announced additional funding for mental health, but not all the money pledged is reaching the front line.\r\nTwo years ago, the government announced additional funding for mental health - \u00a31.4 billion over five years to deliver the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health and \u00a31.25 billion for the Future In Mind programme for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. \r\nWe know however that not all the money pledged is reaching the front line. Too many Clinical Commissioning Groups \u2013 the bodies that decide how money is spent locally \u2013 are using the money for other services.",
        "background": "Mental health patients are not getting the help and support that they need due to the lack of funding. The country runs out of beds so quickly and patients are left feeling alone and struggling to cope. We need to have more beds available , more help instantly for adult and adolescent mental health.",
