        "action": "Rescind the invitation to Donald Trump to visit the UK.",
        "additional_details": "From his inauguration Donald Trump has shown disdain for other countries and refused to engage in meaningful diplomatic relations with them. His preference for promoting his puerile, personal prejudices on Twitter - from name calling the leader of North Korea to spreading misinformation about terror attacks in London - has been hugely damaging. To go through the charade of a formal visit to the UK would not only achieve nothing diplomatically, it would be an endorsement of his behaviour.",
        "background": "Re-tweeting Britain First's propaganda - and arguing with the UK government about doing so - is the latest incident demonstrating the US President's unwillingness to engage in constructive diplomacy. Allowing him to visit the UK in a official capacity would be an endorsement of his approach.",
