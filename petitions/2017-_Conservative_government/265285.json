        "additional_details": "BHM was based on either the start of the academic year and /or the birth month of Marcus Garvey. The rise of other activities (eg Halloween) in October now detract from the value of BHM. \r\n\r\nMany descendants of African continent's diaspora are unaware of the heritage or history (eg Emancipation Day) - as it is not core education curriculum, linking BHM to academic year is no longer worthwhile. \r\n\r\nBHM should be the month of August. there are already events in that month that celebrate black culture.",
        "background": "The timing of UK Black Heritage/ History month (BHM) is out of step with the modern black community it impacts.\r\n\r\nStarting with Emancipation Day and ending with celebratory carnival, August should be denoted as UK BHM specifically for the diaspora of people within the UK from the African continent.",
