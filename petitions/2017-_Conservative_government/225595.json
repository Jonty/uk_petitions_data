        "action": "Provide option to pay an extra 10 to 20% Council Tax & choose where it's spent.",
        "additional_details": "Many of us are unhappy & frustrated with the spending cuts that have impacted so many services. There is too much emphasis on keeping Council Tax down without giving people the OPTION to pay more if they want to and have a say in where it is spent. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to pay an extra 10% provided it went on local policing and I am sure many people who could afford it would feel the same, albeit with differing priorities.",
        "background": "With all the cuts to services I suggest people are given the OPTION to pay an extra 10, 15 or 20% on their Council Tax via a tick box AND be able to choose where the money is allocated via a few more tick boxes i.e.\r\n- Policing\r\n- NHS\r\n- Schools\r\n- Local Town Council\r\n- Social Services",
