        "additional_details": "I have noticed \"pop up\" shops selling fireworks with Managers Special Deals and they are not asking for ID from purchasers.\r\nThis must end. Poor defenceless animals are terrified of the noise. I have watched videos of owners trying desperately hard to comfort their pets to no avail. \r\nThe Government needs to take action and end this now! Make it the responsibility of local authorities to organise controlled displays on November 5th only and use of fireworks in built up residential areas should be completely banned.",
