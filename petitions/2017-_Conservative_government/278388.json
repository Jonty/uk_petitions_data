        "additional_details": "Given this ongoing lack of resolution we should put the matter back to the general public in consecutive binding referendums:\r\n\r\n1) Leave the EU with the current negotiated deal vs Leave the EU with no deal vs Remain within the EU.\r\n\r\n2) A run-off vote between the two preferred options from referendum 1.\r\n\r\nWith the result of these votes to be committed to in a non-partisan agreement by parliament and enacted with due regard to preserving the national interest of all parties.",
        "background": "Since the 2016 advisory referendum on whether the UK should remain a part of the EU there has been little consensus within parliament regarding how its result should be enacted.\r\n\r\nThis has resulted in increasingly damaging rhetoric from both sides which has not helped to resolve the issue at hand.",
