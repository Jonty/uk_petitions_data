        "additional_details": "The legendary wine critic Oz Clarke was recently spotted at the Real Wine Fair. His enthusiasm for wine (conventional and natural) is infectious, his knowledge unparalleled. He was there until the bitter end tasting all sorts of weird and wonderful wine, the security guards were chucking people out and he was still smashing the orange wines.",
        "background": "My aim is to get the government to persuade Oz to get an Instagram account. There are many wine lovers missing out on interacting with the great man, we wan't to learn from him and see what he is having for breakfast etc. Jancis is on there so why not Oz, this is an outrage. \r\nThe Geordie Wine Guide",
