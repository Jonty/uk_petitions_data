        "action": "Stop plans to exempt vehicles more than 40 years old from roadworthiness tests",
        "additional_details": "When respondents to the Government\u2019s consultation were asked whether these vehicles \u2013 including many classic cars  and motorcycles \u2013 should be exempted from MoT tests, more than half were opposed. The DfT's own figures indicate that only 6% of pre-1960 vehicles, already exempt, are voluntarily tested. If this is also the case for vehicles over 40 years old when the exemption is introduced then there is a risk that safety-critical faults on more than 293,000 vehicles will not be detected.",
        "background": "The Department for Transport has announced that it intends to exempt most vehicles that are more than 40 years old from annual roadworthiness tests (MoT) from May 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Government should reconsider this and aim for all vehicles to be given independent annual inspections for safety reasons.",
