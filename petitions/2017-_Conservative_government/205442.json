        "additional_details": "I would like it made mandatory that all products ie, tyre, decorating materials, household cleaners, garden products, clothes and footwear, to be clearly marked that they contain animal derivatives such as gelatin, animal based glues, and shellac.  In other words, everything that is sold in the UK. The Co-op already state on the front of their cleaning products etc. whether there is no animal ingredients.\r\nMany items marked cruelty free still contain animal ingredients which causes confusion.",
        "background": "Full labelling on ALL goods regarding animal ingredients e.g. animal fat in fabric softener and isinglass (swim bladder of fish) in wine production.  A simple label that there IS or IS NOT any animal ingredient or derivative used at any stage of manufacture without constantly searching the internet.",
