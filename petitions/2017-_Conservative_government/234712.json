        "action": "Make it a UK law for premises selling food or drink to hold EpiPens",
        "additional_details": "There have been many cases where a second EpiPen has been needed to treat an anaphylaxis shock. If food establishments were to hold EpiPens for consumers with allergies they could prevent serious illness and in some cases death. It is understandable that EpiPens can't just be handed out to any member of the public so I propose that allergy sufferers carry a card with them, provided by the NHS to state that they have a serious allergy and can be administered with an EpiPen.",
        "background": "Allergies are on the rise in the UK and there are an increasing amount of stories of people who have suffered severely or even died from the unawareness and ignorance surrounding food allergies. Many cases of anaphylaxis could be prevented if epipens were provided by food and drink establishments",
