        "additional_details": "Horses are being left dead on the roads because drivers do not allow down or pass wide, resulting in injured or dead horses with rider injury, no driver can be prosecuted for hitting a horse the only way is for the rider to be admitted to hospital, this is wrong. We see over the hedges, we know if our horse might spook so sometimes we need drivers to stop and give us a few seconds. At the moment legally drivers do not have to abide our signals, we are on a living, sometimes unpredictable, animal.",
        "background": "Horse riders are confronted with drivers driving too close and too fast causing many accidents to horses and riders, even death, with no convictions. Drivers need to be accountable for their actions, we need to be able to legally ask drivers to slow and stop to keep us safe.",
