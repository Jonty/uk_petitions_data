        "additional_details": "Suicide can happen to any family at anytime & it leaves them devastated. We need to reach out to those who are susceptible and ensure that they are able to get any assistance they need before they make the difficult choice to take their own life. It is a silent killer and more most be done so that individuals considering it are able to open up and discuss their problems rather than feel that suicide is the only option.",
        "background": "As a mother raising children in the UK, I have a burning desire to find out why suicide is on the increase, especially amongst the male age group 18 - 49, support needs to be given to stop it & assistance mechanisms should be put in place to stop these unnecessary deaths.",
