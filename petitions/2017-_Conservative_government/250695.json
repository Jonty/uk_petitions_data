        "additional_details": "Getting a Kiwi in will both intrigue European politicians and infuriate British power brokers. While this would be enough of itself Jacinda Ardern is clearly a leader who can make hard decisions and build consensus to get things done. Theresa, Jeremy et al are clearly so mired in Westminster as to be incapable of effective action. An outsider with proven track record, and who is not loathed by most of the UK, could possibly get us out of the mess we have created.",
        "background": "Theresa is obviously overwhelmed by the task of delivering Brexit. She clearly worships Margaret Thatcher and is now paying for her delusions. Giving a REAL leader a go is our only chance of resolving the current impasse with an intact country.",
