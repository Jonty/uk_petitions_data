        "additional_details": "Payment would then be made at a later date. It would mean no one would have to suffer. We don't fall into the low income bracket but we also cannot afford dentistry on the spot. My practice doesn't even do emergency slots. I'm sat here with a hole in one of my molars, the pain of the exposed nerve is worse than childbirth yet there's no way I'll be able to get treatment within the next month.\r\nThe whole point of paying national insurance and tax is to guarantee our healthcare!",
        "background": "The NHS dental services in England are a shambles. There is no free at the point of delivery service for patients in need of treatment who don't fall into the low earnings category. I am petitioning to make all UK NHS dentistry free at point of delivery giving everyone a chance to access it.",
