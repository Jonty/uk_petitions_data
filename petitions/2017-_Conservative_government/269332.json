        "additional_details": "Specifically:\r\n- statutory limitation of the period of time such operators are afforded for issuing a PCN to 24 hours of the infringement.  \r\n-a cap on the charge that can be made where a single innocent infringement (e.g. oversight of the expiry of a season ticket) leads to multiple notices\r\n- where the car park is at an NHS facility, for there to be a  requirement for the NHS to set the operating parameters (e.g. payment on exit rather than in advance) and for the NHS to benefit from the income.",
        "background": "Owing to the increasing number of examples (including my own recent, very distressing experience) of the cynical and unethical operating procedures of private parking providers I am calling for the regulations relating to this industry to be tightened.\r\nSee for examples: https://dailym.ai/2YRB6Jl",
