The monarchy is responsible for deciding how to spend the Sovereign Grant and so the UK Government and Parliament are not responsible for making these spending decisions. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the grant here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sovereign-grant-act-2011-guidance/sovereign-grant-act-2011-guidance\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for a reduction in the Sovereign Grant, if that is something you would like to see happen."
