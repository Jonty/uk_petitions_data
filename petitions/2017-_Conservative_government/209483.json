        "action": "Devolve Corporation Tax to the Scottish Parliament",
        "additional_details": "If the Scottish Parliament had the power to set corporation tax at a lower rate, then it would encourage more businesses to move up to Scotland. In my opinion, this would probably suit a lot of businesses. And I would also call on all parties at Westminster to work together to achieve this.",
        "background": "We want lower taxes for businesses in Scotland, which probably means lower corporation tax rather than lower income tax. So now, I call on the UK government to devolve corporation tax.",
