        "additional_details": "Denying doctors who have secured jobs in the NHS from entering the UK does not make sense. Hospitals are wasting money on recruitment and are being forced to cover shifts with locum doctors - if they can find them. \r\nGaps in rotas mean doctors are juggling large numbers of patients and stress among the profession is rising.  \r\nInternational doctors are ready to work in the NHS. Scrap the cap and let them take up their posts. \r\nhttps://www.bmj.com/scrap-the-cap",
        "background": "We call for the removal of visa restrictions preventing international doctors from working in the UK. Since Dec 2017 over 1500 visa applications from doctors who have secured NHS jobs have been refused. Meanwhile 100s of posts are vacant, waiting times are rising and patient safety is under threat.",
