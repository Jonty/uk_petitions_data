        "action": "Legal Aid, funded by UK taxpayers, should not be available to Non-UK citizens",
        "additional_details": "This case sets the dangerous precedent that a non-UK citizen is entitled to receive UK-funded legal aid paid for by UK taxpayers. This could be relied upon not only by terrorists stripped of UK citizenship but potentially by any non-UK citizen  whose application for citizenship has been rejected. This is a misuse of public funds and the government should intervene, with appropriate legislation if necessary, to prevent non-UK citizens having access to public funding for their legal cases.",
        "background": "On 20/02/2019 Shamima Begum was deprived of UK Citizenship. From that date forward she was no longer a citizen of the UK. On 15/04/2019 she was granted legal aid to fight that decision in UK courts. The UK taxpayer will therefore be paying legal costs for both sides, likely to be millions of pounds.",
