        "action": "To ban plastic bottles to be sold at the top 4 football division stadiums",
        "additional_details": "Alternative options could be having the drinks on tap and sold in cardboard cups or having recycling bins to separate plastics and other rubbish such as left food. Due to the cost of these, I recommend that only stadiums in the top 4 divisions, Premier League, Championship, League 1 and League 2, should put the proposal in place as I understand that lower league clubs do not have the financial power to do so.",
        "background": "Climate change is an issue that everyone is wanting to prevent. We've seen from Blue Planet, the damming effect of pollution in the sea. Many plastic bottles that end up in the ocean are sold at football stadiums and then thrown onto the floor or placed into bins that are then not recycled.",
