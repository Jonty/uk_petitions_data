        "additional_details": "I'm asking you to sign this petition if you think this is unfair for someone to pay on average more a week on TV licence than they do on electric a week. Your average BBC worker makes \u00a337 an hour is it fair that the ones that watch the BBC less in a week or not at all are made to pay the same amount of the ones that watch it a lot more. Let's get this debated in Parliament and let's get it where they go on your circumstances and how often you watch the BBC rather than if you have a colour TV or a black and white TV.",
        "background": "I have had enough of how much I got to pay the BBC for watching each year it cost's \u00a3147 for a colour TV licence. I have worked out that I only watch the BBC for 2 hours a week this working out on average of \u00a324.50 a week.",
