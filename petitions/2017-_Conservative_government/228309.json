        "additional_details": "It has now been almost a year since the release of the slave auction video footage. The media's interest has significantly lessened, and public discussion has waned.\r\n\r\nI am therefore asking the UK government to again put pressure on Libya to put an end to modern-day slavery. I am also asking the UK government to provide the public with a full and transparent update on the UK emergency interventions and UK programmes designed to specifically target Black African migrants and refugees in Libya, including a response containing details of further plans to support the complete eradication of modern slavery in the region.\r\n\r\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/14/africa/libya-migrant-auctions/index.html",
        "background": "Last year CNN released video footage of Black African migrants being bought and sold in to slavery in Libya. The horrific events happened openly in slave auctions and migrants were being sold for as little as $400. There were also many accounts that women and girls were being sold in to sex slavery.",
