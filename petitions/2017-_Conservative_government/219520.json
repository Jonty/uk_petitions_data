        "additional_details": "It has been all over the news about the soaring house prices, which will make the possibility of buying a house for the first time a far, out of reach, reality for millennials and anyone else who permanently resides here in London. London is the most expensive city in Europe, and if nothing is done about the rising cost, slowly people will leave London and they will go elsewhere for jobs, leaving London to be nothing  but just an old expensive landmark where nothing happens anymore.",
        "background": "London is becoming overwhelmingly expensive even for the upper middle class, part of the reason is because of foreigners buying up property in London and never even using them! These properties need to be forced by the government to be sold. This will create a domino effect, which will reduce cost.",
