        "additional_details": "We also ask that all overseas aid should be means tested before any Country is allocated any money at all. This will stop the waste of hundreds of millions that goes to Countries with space programs for example or are fighting wars with their neighbours and their own people.",
        "background": "We should reduce our overseas aid budget of 0.7% of (GNI) to 0.2% of GNI to come in-line with other European Countries and America. Based on the \u00a312b budget of 2015 this would leave us with an additional \u00a38b which should be immediately allocated to the NHS and social care budgets.",
