        "additional_details": "In the 2016 EU referendum, 71% of 18-24 year olds voted to remain, as opposed to just 36% of people aged 65 or over (statistics from YouGov). This shows how underrepresented both the interests and views of our youth were in the final outcome. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, since the creation of the European Union's Erasmus student exchange program, over 200,000 students have studied abroad in the EU. These opportunities, which could be lost as a result of BREXIT, should not be denied to future generations.",
        "background": "Leaving the European Union will affect everyone in the UK, but the most affected group will be the youth, who will be left to deal with the consequences for years to come. Therefore it is only fair to give 16 & 17 year olds a vote in any future referendums or votes regarding this issue.",
