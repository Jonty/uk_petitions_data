        "additional_details": "The Mother of Parliaments should be a bastion of democracy.  The current incumbents of the House of Commons are intent on denying democracy to the people of the UK and are determined to bind the Government in order to renege on the result of the 2016 Referendum and in contradiction to the 2017 manifestos of the main political parties.  The situation must be resolved and democracy returned to the People.",
