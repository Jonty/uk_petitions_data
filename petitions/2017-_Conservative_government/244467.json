        "additional_details": "Whilst we understand that by paying our annual fee, we are part of a governing body and thus it is essential to be recognised within the nursing community.A reduction in the NMC fee registration would make a difference to those who struggle on nurses wages in these times of austerity. What is the reason for such high increase on professionals who work tirelessly to help others whilst many of us are having to use food banks, carrying out extra shifts or working second jobs just to \"make ends meet\". You may understand the frustration felt by many nurses after studying for a degree that will not be recognised unless we are part of a governing body that we MUST pay for.",
        "background": "Nurses wages remain the same with little to no increase for most, whilst the NMC fee registration has risen through the years, with potential to increase again in the coming years.",
