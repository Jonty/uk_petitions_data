        "additional_details": "The EU Referendum that took place on the 23rd June 2016 resulted in a \u2018majority\u2019 vote to leave the EU by 1,269,501 votes. However, 46,501,241 people were eligible vote and only 17,410,742 voted to leave the EU. This means that only 37.44% of people eligible to vote voted to leave. Polls also suggest given another referendum, many leave voters would change their vote to remain. Therefore the British people did not vote to leave the EU and the government should not continue to use this phrase.",
        "background": "Since the Referendum the government has used the phrase, \u201cThe British people voted to leave the EU\u201d many times. They also used this phrase in a recent email I recieved following a petition regarding Brexit. However, this is not a valid statement and should not continue to be used.",
