        "additional_details": "It is possible to pay to have the jab at a pharmacy, but they are not all equal. Some are better than others.\n\n'For otherwise healthy people, flu can be very unpleasant.' - NHS Choices. They acknowledge this is the case for those deemed not to be at risk, yet still do not offer us protection. \n\n'The surge sparked fresh pleas from doctors for the millions of people who have not had the winter flu jab, including those at particular risk from the virus, to get immunised urgently.' - The Guardian",
        "background": "Many people considered 'at risk' are fortunate enough to be vaccinated for free, however not everybody is. The recent outbreak has caused lots of people to suffer and even more strain on the NHS. It is counterproductive to deny the flu jab to 'healthy' people as we are not invincible and do get flu.",
