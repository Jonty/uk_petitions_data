        "additional_details": "For these hospitals, such as West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth, to take advantage of their staff who have to use the car parks while at work is completely wrong and it should be stopped.\r\n\r\nTo be an essential part in saving lives, you should not have to worry about receiving fines while at work.",
        "background": "At hospitals in England, NHS staff have to pay for their parking. To be charged to spend your day dedicated to helping others is unjust.\r\n\r\nStaff can get permits to reduce the parking prices but they are only valid in the staff car park where there are not enough spaces for all of the staff to park.",
