        "additional_details": "I have had three incidents myself recently involving loose dogs, which have been frightening for myself and my dog, but also which could have resulted in accident or injuries. In one incident a dog ran accross a busy road to get to mine, the owner said 'sorry, but he's friendly' - lucky he wasn't 'dead friendly'. I also know personally of several cases where dogs have been attacked by loose dogs, one of which was on their own driveway. Sadly the owners seem to think this is acceptable behaviour.",
