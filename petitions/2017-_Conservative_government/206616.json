        "additional_details": "A visit by Donald\u2019s Trump could be perceived as condoning his behaviour and sends out a suggestion that British people approve of him and the message he is giving. A vast amount of people do not approve. A tough stance should be taken against a world leader that advocates racial hatred. Britain is a multicultural country and should be seen to celebrate that. We should demonstrate to the world that racism will not be tolerated.",
        "background": "On Wednesday 29 November 2017, Donald Trump retweeted three tweets originating from Britain First \u201cBF\u201d. BF are known to have fascist/right wing ideology. The retweets were designed to incite racial hatred against members of the Muslim community. Allowing Trump to visit sends out the wrong message.",
