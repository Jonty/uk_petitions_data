Pollution/climate change already negatively impacts the marine habitat.  Japan financially subsidises its whaling fleet.  There is no justification to resume the practice of whaling, either from a commercial, demand or ecological basis.\r\n\r\nhttps://awionline.org/sites/default/files/press_release/files/AWI-IWC-report-final-2018.pdf",
