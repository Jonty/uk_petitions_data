        "additional_details": "How can an MP justify holding the views of their constituents when they vote different ways on the same subject? Why is it that an MP's personal opinion and motives are placed higher than the general public who put them in power?  \r\nKeeping in mind the length of time that a public vote is held over the same issue - 5 years for general elections, 15 years for Scottish devolution, no 2nd vote on Brexit. MP's should be held to the same standards as the general public. 1 person, 1 vote.",
        "background": "In recent memory there has been several major public votes. All of these have had one vote. Despite changes in policy, hindsight, poor handling none of these are put back to a public vote. So why do MP's get to vote multiple times on the same subject within a relatively short period of time?",
