A recent road accident meant people had to be airlifted at \u00a38000 per trip! He is not listening to the voters who want a CHOICE. Both visitors and islanders are forced to take unreliable, extortionately priced ferries. These people are stuck without a voice.",
        "background": "MP Bob Sealy is unfit for his duty and is deliberately blocking any attempts to give both islanders and mainland visitors the opportunity for a fixed road link to and from IOW. Forced to pay unreasonable prices with no other option.",
