        "additional_details": "A politician with a limited timescale has to make their term count. Would the country stall on any major decision if politicians knew they could do what they believed was best for the country without fear of losing their \u2018golden goose\u2019 career? \r\nFresh blood is required to bring new ideas and a fresh perspective to the way this country is run. New and exciting representatives are out there waiting for their chance to make a difference for the country, and they should be given the chance.",
        "background": "A politician should only be allowed to serve 4 years (consecutive or not) in parliament to prevent the blatant complacency and contempt for the British public that has been on display for years.",
