        "action": "Improve economic support for new parents, by increasing pay and length of leave.",
        "additional_details": "Parents feel the need to return to work as early as possible, to ensure their economic stability. We feel that they should be allowed to focus on the upbringing of their child, especially in these vital first years of their life.\r\nFurthermore, some parents can't even qualify for statutory pay because they are self-employed. This discourages those who are self-employed from taking the necessary parental leave to raise their child.",
        "background": "As a powerful internationally influencing country, Britain should be setting a better example of how to support new parents economically. While we are far superior to America in this area, we are by no means as supportive as other High Income Countries such as Sweden.",
