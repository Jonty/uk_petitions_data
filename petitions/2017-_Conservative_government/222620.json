        "additional_details": "The closest counselling services available for face to face sessions are Melksham, Southampton and Andover. For full time employees, receiving time off work is very difficult. There\u2019s also the cost of paying for travel on top of the sessions. There are regular suicides in our city and people are crying out for some kind of regular service. Services should include DBT and more in depth CBT therapies and classes.",
        "background": "There is a serious lack of mental health services and support in Salisbury. This particularly affects full time employed persons who need to pay for treatment because counselling is no longer available on the NHS.",
