        "additional_details": "the first prorogation was referred to the supreme court, which ruled it illegal. The second, from 7th to 14th October, was allowed on the  arguments of the government presented to the Queen. The constitution requires the monarch to accept the advice of government - no wider debate is needed. Thus parliament's job of checking the executive can be blocked by the executive and precedents have been set for the future.",
        "background": "the government has twice prorogued parliament, the first time checked by the supreme court. Only the agreement of the Monarch is currently needed to stop parliament doing its work. This must cease and by law the agreement of the Commons should be needed by majority vote",
