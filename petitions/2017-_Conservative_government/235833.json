        "action": "Take Northern/TransPennine franchise off Arriva NOW AND sack Chris Grayling MP.",
        "additional_details": "Wikipedia sets out just how badly Northern/Transpennine Rail has performed this year.  The services are woeful and wholly unreliable and customer service is diabolical. I would like to see the removal of the franchise (which is meant to run up to 2025) and, as Chris Grayling MP refuses to take action to alleviate the ongoing misery of travellers, he should be sacked. People in the North West won't get anywhere with this until it affects London - which is why this petition needs to be HUGE.",
        "background": "The impact of Northern's absymal service this year has been felt accutely by hundreds of thousands of people.  For us; my son has missed work and lost wages; I have ended up driving my daughter most days to/from college because of train delays/cancellations/overcrowding and I'm almost always late.",
