        "action": "Remove Magid Magid as Lord Mayor of Sheffield.",
        "additional_details": "Help the people of Sheffield feel proud of their city by getting a mayor that attracts people to the city rather than dividing them due to their political views and disturbing language. A mayor that represents this city well and doesn't make a mockery of the way he dresses for such role in office is needed and someone that isn't in this role just to boost his own ego. \r\n\r\nAs a refugee, the British welcomed him with respect and he is doing nothing to give the British people the same mutual respect.",
        "background": "Magid Magid is ruining the heritage of Sheffield and abusing his role as Lord Mayor by making disgraceful comments that do not bring people together. He's branded Donald Trump a 'wasteman' and expressed political views at the Tramlines Festival in Sheffield whilst also using inappropriate language.",
