For child care for my 8 month old child for four days only would amount to \u00a3782 add to that the extra hours for my four year old son and meals \u00a31312 . Then out of what\u2019s left there\u2019s household bills to pay which doesn\u2019t leave enough to cover , and being only fours days at that , that means loosing \u00a396.15 every week on a four week month that totals \u00a3384.62 taking the total month loss up to \u00a31696.12 leaving nothing for house hold bills of any kind .",
