        "additional_details": "However, in the UK, many restaurants and manufacturers are defaulting to this food, as it is cheaper than providing options.\r\nThis is not in the spirit of the law and many people of other religions, including Christians (the majority religion in the UK), have requirements not to eat food blessed before other gods. As halal and kosher foods are blessed before the respective gods of those religions, which means that they should not be eating it. Often they are not even notified that they are eating such food.",
        "background": "Under current UK legislation, there is a requirement for halal and kosher food to be available to those to whom it is a requirement. The law also states that this food is to be solely for the consumption of the people of those religions.",
