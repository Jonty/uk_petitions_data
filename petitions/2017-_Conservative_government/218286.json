        "action": "Non transitioned transgender* members of military serve as identified gender",
        "additional_details": "Our country prides itself on tolerance and acceptance of all people, regardless of their sex, race, sexual orientation, religion, but why in the British military do we not accept them for their gender (change). Being treated as someone who you are not can make you feel extremely uncomfortable, dysphoric and could even lead to mental health issues. The UK army has recently had a \"This is belonging\" campaign, but why don't trans* people belong in their identified gender? Please change this",
        "background": "Currently, transgender people must have completed transition to be treated as the gender they identify with. It takes years and years to fully transition, meaning some people may have their dreams of joining the British military destroyed. We should allow people to serve as who they are.",
