        "additional_details": "As a society we have advanced enough for there to be jobs in a variety of different industries. There are opportunities to go down career paths besides a scientific one. Creativity and individuality should be something we teach the youth of today, it's dissapointing that the education system has rules set in place that make students feel they aren't clever enough just because they are not as academically gifted as others. Science is compulsory, but wouldn't it seem wrong if Drama or Art was made compulsory at GCSE? Students are not shunned for \"lack of creativity\" so why should it be the other way around? Please sign this petition so the government may consider debating this.",
