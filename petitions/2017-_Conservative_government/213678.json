        "additional_details": "The consistent deaths of children and young adults is a world wide issue and the UK Government has the power to help stop it. By putting pressure on the US in passing gun control will save countless lives and will strengthen the bonds between the UK and the future leaders and voting populace of the US. Saving the lives of children shouldn't be a brave stance or one that requires self gain but a position that should be taken by every free man and woman. Help make the world safer for all.",
        "background": "The mass shooting in Florida sparked the #neveragain movement, their mission is to remove the National Rifle Association's money from Congress and to pass gun control laws that limits the availability of semi automatic rifles.
