        "additional_details": "If approved by Parliament this would pass the responsibility to the EU to decide whether this serious sticking point is worthy of further discussion and negotiations to hopefully stop the risk of the UK having no other alternative other than possibly Leaving Without a Deal.\r\n \r\nWithout your support for this petition Brexit could be lost forever or further uncertainty for UK businesses could cost many UK jobs as there appears no clear majority for any other way forward in our Parliament.",
        "background": "The UK Government cannot get support in Parliament for its EU Brexit Deal \r\n\r\nTaking the Backstop Out of The Deal is thought would be supported by the majority of MP's, allowing its fourth vote by the Speaker whilst showing its support for people of Northern Ireland as with the rest of the UK",
