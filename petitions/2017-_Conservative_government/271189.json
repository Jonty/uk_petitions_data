        "action": "Legalise marijuana for 18+ UK residents.",
        "additional_details": "Marijuana even when unregulated has been proven to be much less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes as THC psychosis (which may occur from THC consumption) is nulled by CBD which can actually be used to treat psychosis vastly reducing it's damage; If the CBD content of marijuana is regulated it will help stop people who are currently at risk, as let's face it, marijuana is going to be used whether it is legal or not, so it would be well worth considering legalization to stop the current harm.",
        "background": "Marijuana is slowly being legalized across the world and I belive this is for good reason. As a recreational drug it is far less harmful than alcohol or tobacco however due to marijuana not being regulated THC levels are rising and CBD levels are falling, if CBD was regulated weed would be harmless.",
