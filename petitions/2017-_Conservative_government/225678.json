        "additional_details": "A year after being promised stability and the Government could at best be described as precariously balanced atop a mountain of lies and threats being distributed by the Prime Minister and her government. \r\n\r\nIn light of this and having lost two crucial cabinet members within the past few weeks, Mrs. May is rapidly losing the faith of the general public, I believe that it is time for Mrs. May to call a general election; giving the public the opportunity to decide whom they wish to run the country going forward into the crucial next 12 months and into the early stages of Post-Brexit life. \r\n\r\nIt's time for Mrs May to do the best thing possible for this country and call a General Election.",
