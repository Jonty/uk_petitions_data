        "additional_details": "Our MP's should be held to the highest standards in public life, however they should not be permitted to make comments in the Houses of Parliament which if they were made in a public domain could lead them open the charges of slander or libel. Parliamentary privilege should not apply to deliberate misrepresentation and if a member of the public were to be misrepresented they should have the right to challenge this in a court of law, or within Parliament itself.",
        "background": "In instances where MPs uttered comments about an individual which in a public place, rather than parliament, could lead to slander or libel charges because they were a deliberate misrepresentation, then parliamentary privilege should not apply.",
