        "additional_details": "Theresa May (Home secretary at the time) and the home office banned Tyler for 3-5 years after his album 'Goblin' was deemed 'unacceptable in the UK' and was backed up by the 2005 guidelines to prevent suspected terrorists enter the UK. However, since then, a Neo-Nazi group have played in Glasgow and Cardiff. Tyler has released many songs that promote peace for example, his latest album 'Flower Boy' which shows somewhat a softer side of his creative persona.",
        "background": "Tyler, The Creator, a creative American Rapper was banned from entering the UK back in 2015 for what Theresa May said 3-5 years. It has been 3 years and his fan base in the UK have struggled to make movement with this idea. We would all love to see him tour the UK in the near future.",
