        "additional_details": "Following an agreement, the area of the alleged incident was being evacuated of rebels, their families and civilians, so it seems unlikely that this incident took place.\r\nEven it it had then the UK should not add to the damage already done, largely by outsiders, to this unfortunate country over the last seven years. Any attack will tend to prolong the war and delay rather than advance possible reconciliation between the moderate rebels and those who support the Syrian Government.",
        "background": "The UK Government is considering taking part in a possible attack on Syrian Government forces following what is alleged to be the use of a gas weapon against civilians, including children. \r\nIt seems that they intend to do this before there is independent proof.",
