        "action": "Stop schools being able to confiscate phones for more than the shool day.",
        "additional_details": "Our school has created a rule where if any phone makes a noise or is seen during the school day (including break) it will be confiscated and you will have to collect at the end of the following day. This is also the case in many other schools. Due to kids signing a 'home school agreement' which apparently gives them the right to do this. The government should assign rules that restrict schools from being allowed to take phones over night.",
        "background": "Many schools confiscate phones if they are seen or heard. However the problem arises when schools confiscate a phone overnight or sometimes over multiple days. Kids should have right to bring their phones to school and also take them back at the end of the day.",
