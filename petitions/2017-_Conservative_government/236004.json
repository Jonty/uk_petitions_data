        "additional_details": "> Mandating schools to undergo a genuine consultation with parents will ensure parents' voice is heard by their child's school.\r\n> Parents play a vital role in the education of their children, therefore, schools must be mandated to include parents in the decision making process.\r\n> This factor has not been given the consideration it is due. Therefore, it gives certain lobby groups opportunities to push their own resources and agenda, at the exclusion of parents and at the risk of our children.",
