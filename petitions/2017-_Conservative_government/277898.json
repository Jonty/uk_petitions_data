They encourage people into work and to make money for themselves rather than claim benefits and say there\u2019s not enough houses for people. Property developers and landlords are turning derelict buildings and buildings that need work into accommodation",

This has now made it harder or nearly impossible for people to use property as a form of income or investment.",
