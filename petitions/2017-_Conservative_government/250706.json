        "action": "Parliament to vote in favour of the Prime Minister's EU Deal as soon as possible",
        "additional_details": "We trust that the many electors who voted for Brexit at the Referendum will sign this petition, in order to avoid the alternatives, all of which are undesirable: e.g. the Art 50 revocation, no deal, delays, so-called 'compromises' which, contrary to our intentions, would keep us partly in the Union to our long term detriment.  The May deal is not popular precisely because it is a well-considered compromise.  It moves us on to the next negotiation stage and asserts our ability to be pragmatic.",
        "background": "We normally expect Parliament to enact international agreements (i.e. implementing EU Referendum result) , but this is proving extremely difficult and disruptive.  Our guidance will therefore be beneficial to MPs, especially as other petitions revoking Art 50 & against 'no deal' are being signed.",
