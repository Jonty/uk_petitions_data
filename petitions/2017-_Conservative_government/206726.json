        "additional_details": "We do not want to pay any Brexit Bill.\r\nWe do not want to send any more cash to other countries.\r\nWe do not want the European Court to continue to rule us.\r\n\r\nWe want to live in an independent United Kingdom, free of EU law.\r\nWe want to have full control of our country, laws and finances.\r\nWe want Foreign Aid cut right down to fund our own services.\r\nWe want additional funding for our military, NHS and schools.\r\n\r\nWe voted you all in your positions, listen to your own people for once.",
        "background": "In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.  We are sick and tired of simply being used as a bank to fund the unelected European Commission.  Theresa May needs to listen to those who voted her in and look after our own country instead of being held to ransom by the EU.",
