        "additional_details": "Up to 1/3 of all neurological referrals are diagnosed with FND. Sufferers end up relinquishing their independence & become reliant on a carer.  They are left unable to function & it\u2019s vital we improve prospects. Medically Unexplained Symptoms (including FND) directly cost the NHS approximately \u00a33.1 billion, with an additional \u00a318 billion in indirect costs. With an NHS already under pressure, improving services and treatment for those with FND would greatly lift this burden.",
        "background": "Functional Neurological Disorder sufferers are often left with limited & insufficient treatment options. Treatment requires a team of neurologists, physiotherapists etc. which must be integrated to create an effective plan. Currently, services are not equipped for this kind of specialist care.",
