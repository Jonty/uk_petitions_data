        "additional_details": "The main reason for scrapping ICT was to promote more academic subjects such as Computer Science however not everyone wants to program and students are missing out on key skills needed for many industry jobs such as spreadsheets, databases, word processing, photo editing and rapid web development which Computer Science does not cover.\r\nVocational qualifications in ICT are available but they are not nearly as rigorous as GCSE and many academic students are put off studying them.",
        "background": "GCSE ICT was scrapped in favour of promoting Computer Science. According to JCQ (Joint Council for Qualifications) over 110,000 pupils studied for the qualification in 2015. Not all students want to program and many are missing out on vital skills.\r\nWe ask you to sign to have GCSE ICT reinstated",
