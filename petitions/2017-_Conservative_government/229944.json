        "additional_details": "Food packaging can clearly label food allergens, however all ingredients can be an allergen to someone in the world. When you don't have a top allergen and then said allergen can be hidden in a group of ingredients it can lead to deadly anaphylatic shock and death. All ingredients used should be listed separately to stop allergic reactions. Mis-information of food labelling needs to stop and the food industry needs to be forced to be transparent of all ingredients used in the products.",
        "background": "Food packaging can group ingredients into categories like \"spices\" not stating the ingredients can be deadly for those with allergies. I myself have been put at risk from lack of all ingredients being listed. The law should make it safe for all people to be able to eat without deadly consequences.",
