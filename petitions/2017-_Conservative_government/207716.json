        "action": "Ban unsafe sleep products such as bumpers, sleep positioners and pillows",
        "additional_details": "There is sufficient evidence that babies have died as a consequence of using these products. They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be sold in the UK. There has been 2 infant deaths related to baby hammocks yet they are still sold. There have been cot bumper related deaths and they are banned in certain states in America . New studies show sleep positioners to be unsafe. Baby pods and nests should carry a warning that they are not safe for overnight sleep.",
        "background": "I lost a child due to SIDS and now want to spread awareness about the importance of safe sleep. New \u201csleep\u201d products are hitting the market and new parents are fooled by their false claims. Using these products (sleep positioners, pillows, bumpers) can increase the risk of suffocation.",
