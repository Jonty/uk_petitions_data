The uplands it dominates could instead have more fully fledged eco and  general tourism with associated jobs, natural flood alleviation projects to benefit homes, businesses and farms downstream, be more fire resistant, have woodlot forestry to produce fuel for rural communities without mains gas, and provide cleaner water.   https://water.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2017/06/EMBER_2-page_exec_summary.pdf",
        "background": "Driven grouse shooting is a minority sport which seriously compromises other activities and businesses over vast stretches of northern England. We need to determine if it is driving away more jobs and enterprises than it creates, which is likely - no country outside of the UK wants it.",
