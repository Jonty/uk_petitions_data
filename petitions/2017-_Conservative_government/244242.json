        "action": "Make vaccinating children a legal requirement to enrol at a school.",
        "additional_details": "I call on the government to consider making it a legal requirement that all parents immunise their children before they can enrol them at a school. I ask that the government takes into account the rise of the \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d movement and the damaging effects it is having on not only our children, but the rise of preventable diseases. Cases of measles, mumps and rubella have been rising in the UK which is completely unacceptable in this day and age. The government needs to take action immediately.",
        "background": "Many parents are misinformed about the risks of vaccines, for example the misconception that the MMR jab causes autism. This is causing an increase in preventable diseases which is unacceptable. Immunisation should NOT be a choice, but a legal requirement in order to enrol a child at a school.",
