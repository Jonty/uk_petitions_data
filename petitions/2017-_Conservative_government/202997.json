It does not apply to \"either way offences\" or \"indictable offences\" such as more serious forms of physical assault and the child sex offences set out in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, or the child cruelty offence under section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.\r\n\r\nWe're therefore not sure what further action you want the UK Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
