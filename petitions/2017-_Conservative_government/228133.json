The Government should intervene as a matter of urgency and take direct action, including the allocation of public funds, to ensure the hospital\u2019s completion. It is grossly wrong that patients and NHS staff should have to put up with the old hospital, which is falling into disrepair and demonstrably impacting on patient care.",
