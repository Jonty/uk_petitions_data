All these loopholes must be addressed and an Amnesty given to all citizens, from whatever origin, who arrived here legally in the late 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, but didn\u2019t realise they did not have their papers in order.",
        "background": "Be fair to the migrants of the Commonwealth.  Following World War II they came to work in the UK and help put us back on our feet. People from South Africa, the USA and Canada are being deported too. Why should we want to deport these hard working pensioners?",
