        "additional_details": "Around 500,000 people hold NS&I's index-linked savings certificates. From May 2019 NS&I is switching its measure of inflation from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index.\r\nThis will lower the interest the certificates pay as CPI is usually lower. NS&I says the switch is in line with Government policy. Yet rail fares and student loans increase with RPI. The Government should honour the original terms of the certificates until such a time as taxpayer costs are also increased with CPI.",
        "background": "Reverse Treasury-backed NS&I's decision to switch the formula for increasing its index-linked savings certificate from the RPI to the CPI from May 2019 \u2013 and protect half a million pensioners' incomes.",
