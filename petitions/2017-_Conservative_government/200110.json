        "action": "Scrap credit card age verification on pornographic sites",
        "additional_details": "This will lead to porn companies storing vast amounts of credit card information which could easily be subject to hacking. Porn sites wont necessarily have the proper security. VPN, Tor Browser, proxy search or a torrent make age verification pointless with easy work arounds. Tor Browsers could lead to young people accessing content that is banned/illegal in the UK such as rape & child pornography videos on the dark web. Fraudulent porn sites could also potentially steal credit card information.",
        "background": "The approach to the UK Digital Economy Act Section 3 on Online Pornography which requires every pornographic site to have age verification by holding credit card information of users is completely misguided and shows ministers have a complete lack of understanding of how the internet works.",
