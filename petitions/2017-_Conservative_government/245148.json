Her concerning behaviours at home have been strongly documented by supporting professionals over a 2 year time frame, but my assessment referral has been denied due to the lack of school based presentation.\r\nThis petition to seek equality for my little girl and the many others in a similar position. Awareness of Autism in girls is increasing but the referral pathway still strongly bias towards a typical male presentation. Why?",
        "background": "School-based presentation is a required element for an assessment referral. Girls typically don't present at school until later in their development, making a referral unaccessible for girls to seek a diagnosis. The referral pathways need to be reviewed for girls to have equal to access services.",
