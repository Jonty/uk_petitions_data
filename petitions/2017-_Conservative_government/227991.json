        "action": "Start making cyclists put some form of identification on the cycles.",
        "additional_details": "With the rise of cyclists on our roads come a rise in cyclist related incidents. From riding four abreast to running red lights to hit and runs on pedestrians. Motorists can be identified by their registration plates so why shouldn't cyclists be registered and given a plate to display for identification purposes. This would help to trace those involved in incidents and give motorists/the public a sense of a more even playing field when sharing the roads.",
        "background": "Recently a cyclist kicked the door of my car because I pulled him for running a red light. And more recently a woman is in hospital after a hit and run cyclist incident. It's about time cycles/cyclists had some form of identification plate on the cycles much like a car registration plate.",
