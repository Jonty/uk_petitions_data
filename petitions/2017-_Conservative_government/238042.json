        "additional_details": "The costs for providing grants for affected owners to purchase new vehicles that meet the criteria will be substantially lower than the cost of the new infrastructure required for the vastly extended zone, as well as the costs involved in pursuing the fines that people will simply be unable to pay. \r\nThe poorest in society should not be penalised by this punitive stealth tax.",
        "background": "The extension of the ULEZ will cause grave financial harm to 3.5 million people living in the affected areas. These boroughs are home to some of the poorest people in London.The charge of \u00a3350 per month is a stealth tax on the poor and will be hugely damaging to people's quality of life.",
