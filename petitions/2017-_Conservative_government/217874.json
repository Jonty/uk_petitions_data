        "action": "Build and repair road surfaces using the plastic waste produced in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The Netherlands have recently introduced the usage of recycled plastics in the re-surfacing and building of road surfaces. Not only does it recycle the waste that we create, but it also reduces CO2 damage caused by the original asphalt. This surface can withstand extreme temperatures from -40 degrees to 80 degrees. Many road surfaces desperately require repair and this is a quick, simple solution that forces our country to take responsibility for our negative environmental impact.",
        "background": "Households in the UK produce 22 million tonnes of waste per year and only 44% is recycled. Our country keeps exporting our waste (particularly plastic) to other far shores. Since China have introduced a ban against this, the government are searching for new places to export.",
