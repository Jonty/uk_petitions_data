Politicians voted to allow the electorate to make this decision and are expected to implement it, even if they do not agree with it. MPs now need to make a choice; either accept the EU's deal or leave with no deal. People are fed up with MPs indulging their own self-interests and are weary of the Brexit process. Deliver Brexit and end the uncertainty. No more Article 50 extensions!",

The winning side expect to see their decision implemented. Many MPs are trying to frustrate and even overturn that decision. No more extensions to Article 50.",
