        "additional_details": "It is becoming clearer everyday, that either a Bad Brexit Deal or a No Brexit Deal is the likely outcome of the governments negotiations with the EU. Neither of these outcomes is in the best interest of the UK.\r\n\r\nAdditionaly the ability for the UK to revoke article 50, looks to be a realistic option, legaly, constitutionaly and politicaly.\r\nRevoking article 50, may be the best thing the UK could do, and for parliament not to consider this as a realistic option, would be a betrayal of the people.",
        "background": "The Government is failing to deliver on the promises made in the Referendum & the country now faces the peril of a bad/no-deal which was never put to voters.\r\nIn the circumstances, MPs must be free to pursue all options, including Remaining & Revoking article 50, if that is in the national interest.",
