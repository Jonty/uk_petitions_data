        "additional_details": "This Government has triggered Article 50 before it had properly investigated the effects of leaving the EU and before it had made any adequate preparation for a smooth departure. It appears to be at war internally on how best to effect Brexit.\r\n\r\nRecent revelations of sexual misconduct have implicated many politicians at senior and junior levels.\r\n\r\nForeign policy is being handled in an undiplomatic and self serving manner causing risk to both UK policy and UK citizens.",
        "background": "The Government is failing. A string of scandals and revelations concerning politicians and internal bickering within the Conservative Party has removed confidence in the competence of our Members of Parliament and Prime Minister. \r\n\r\nThe status of the UK is damaged, the country needs new government.",
