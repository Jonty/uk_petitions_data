        "additional_details": "Many small business owners who need LCV's but are being kind to the environment by getting a newer more eco friendly van instead of a cheaper black smoke machine have no choice but to pay the outdated flat rate fee. It should be replaced with a variable rate which reflects emissions.",
        "background": "The current fee is \u00a3250 a year when many modern engines have very good CO2 emissions, when older LCV's that spit out black smoke pay \u00a3140 a year.",
