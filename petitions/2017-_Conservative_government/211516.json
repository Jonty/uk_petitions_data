        "additional_details": "For minor and unintentional errors It would be less contentious if the motorist could pay a much lower penalty on exit or even within  a 24 hour grace period similar to payment for Greenwich Crossing or Congestion Charges. Local Authorities should determine a local tariff and an overall parking time limit, beyond which the Operator could access DVLA data. I suggest charging for all time parked up to 150% of original free period plus a handling charge",
        "background": "Supermarkets, Leisure Centres, Motorway Services etc. provide time limited free parking, but need significant deterrents to abuse. The current cliff-edge penalty for minor infringement creates unnecessary ill-will towards the land users and car park operator and has unnecessary cost.",

In particular, we're not sure whether you'd like to change the rules about who can access information held by the DVLA or whether you'd like to introduce new laws about parking charges. \r\n\r\nAnyone with a \"reasonable cause\" can request data from the DVLA. You can find out more about that here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/request-information-from-dvla\r\n\r\nThe UK Government and Parliament are not responsible for how car parks are managed. Car park operators decide which types of vehicle can use the car park, how long they can stay and how much they must pay.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
