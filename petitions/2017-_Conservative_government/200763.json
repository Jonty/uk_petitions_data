        "action": "Change law and tax rules to ensure equal pay for equal work for agency workers",
        "additional_details": "There must be equal take-home pay for equal work for agency workers. Umbrella companies say that workers agree to work like this, but we know in the industry that this is not so and that workers are not given a choice and must go umbrella if they want to get employment. This is a widespread practice that is  hurting the pockets of vulnerable workers.",
        "background": "Many workers work through agencies using umbrella companies to handle pay. This is used to pay workers less by avoiding Employers NI. ENI is deducted from workers\u2019 wages. This petition seeks a law to prevent workers getting less take-home pay than directly employed people doing work of equal value.",
