        "action": "Ban shorting of London AIM stocks.",
        "additional_details": "In challenging times, shorters seek to borrow the company's shares from a holder for a consideration and to buy them at a later date. They immediately sell these shares which, due to the relative illiquid market, sends the price much lower and hence the shorters can buy them at that lower price - pocketing the difference. The only beneficiaries are the shorters and the market makers with the losers being the reputable company and it's bona fide investors.",
        "background": "The AIM stock market is where smaller companies list their shares rather than using the prohibitively expensive main London Stock Market. This is an important market for the growth of smaller UK companies.",
