        "additional_details": "We are undergoing a climate emergency.  Scientists have already said that we have little time to take action to save the planet.  This Act could help create jobs, reduce climate change and spur investment and industry.  It may even allow the U.K. to become exporters of climate saving technologies to the rest of the world.  Further down the road, it could help to stem the flow of climate refugees by reducing the damage done to other countries due to climate change.",
        "background": "Some companies have patents on technologies which can help the climate or make processes more efficient. Having listened to someone in manufacturing, companies are often unwilling to invest due to sunk costs elsewhere. Powers could include compelling the company to manufacture or award it elsewhere.",
