        "additional_details": "Should a pet be showing signs of distress or ill health it is the owner's responsibility to seek veterinary treatment. If an employer says no, owners are expected to leave their pets or delay treatment that prolongs the suffering of that animal. This can include leaving the pet alone, unobserved for a length of time. It needs to be compulsory for employers to grant workers time off for a pet emergency, like it currently is for an emergency involving a spouse, partner, child, grandchild, parent, or someone who depends on you for care.",
        "background": "At present it is at an employer's discretion whether to allow leave for pet owners who need to seek medical treatment for an ill or injured pet, yet the Animal Welfare Act of 2006 deems it a criminal offence if an owner fails to act and causing unnecessary suffering as a consequence.",
