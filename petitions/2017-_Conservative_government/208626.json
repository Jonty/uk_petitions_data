        "additional_details": "If Wales (one of the oldest, most respected European countries) is considered an annex of England, it will obviously do great injustice to its growing standing on the world stage.\r\nPlease recognise the damage that promoting this ancient, beautiful, yet ultra-modern country as a principality will cause to our pride, progression and international image.\r\nWales isn't a principality, just as the USA isn't a colony! It is a country; one that's as proud and as diverse as both England and Scotland are.",
        "background": "Plaid Cymru MP, Lord Elis Thomas, wants to refer to Wales as a principality rather than a country. He thinks the romantic notion of us being viewed as such will boost tourist numbers! \r\nWales hasn't been a principality since 1536 and this retrograde step can only be viewed as negative in every way.",
