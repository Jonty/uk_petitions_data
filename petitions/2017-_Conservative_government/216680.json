        "additional_details": "I propose we make it legal that if you have 1 or more children under 16 and you request a week off during the school holidays to cover childcare, your company cannot refuse. Currently each company have their own rules around staffing, 1 person off at a time for example. Meaning you need to find a stranger to watch your child and pay for the risky privilege. Companies refuse to pay for cover for that week and we lose out. It helps families financially in a big big way and also stops worry.",
        "background": "For those being told that they can\u2019t have a certain week off and then left to find AND PAY for childcare because their existing provider is closed! Leaving them to give their child to a stranger which is expensive and potentially puts them at risk. All requests to be accepted even if they overlap",
