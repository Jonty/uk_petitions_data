        "additional_details": "Trump has said he wants the UK to lower their food standards and demands the UK\u2019s NHS pays more in pharmaceutical drugs. \r\nParliament should take a page out of Hugh Grant\u2019s performance in Love Actually and stand up to the school yard bully: I fear that this has become a bad relationship. A relationship based on the President taking exactly what he wants, and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to Britain. \"We may be a small country, but we're a great one too.",
        "background": "The president's last visit in 2018 was marked by demonstrations around the UK. In London, tens of  thousands of people took to the streets to voice their concerns. The Queen should not have to endure such an event.",
