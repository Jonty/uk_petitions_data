        "additional_details": "In recent years we have seen the acid attack becoming all too common in the UK. This type of attack is particularly nasty because it spoils a woman's looks for life and is totally psychologically damaging. In view of the horror inflicted by an attack with acid, a clear message needs to be sent out to anyone who is considering such an absolutely disgusting deed such as the acid attack on Sophie Hall which is currently on the TV news. A 25 year minimum term should be considered fair retribution.",
        "background": "To properly punish persons convicted of an acid attack. A minimum term of 25 years, before considering parole options, must be served from a life sentence for inflicting the life long physical and psychological damage resulting from this despicable crime. Acid attacks must be stamped out.",
