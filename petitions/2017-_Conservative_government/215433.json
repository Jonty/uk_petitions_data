        "additional_details": "All I am asking is for people to be taught about what the signs mean on trucks that are designed to warn other road users of the dangers the vehicle poses. And for potential car licence holders to be educated on stopping times and blind spots of different vehicles. 75% of accidents between HGVs and cars are the car drivers fault and being given more awareness as part of a small vehicle licence could drastically improve those figures and even save lives!",
        "background": "I feel that not enough people driving small vehicles are educated about the dangers of sharing the road with Heavy goods vehicles, Dangerous goods and long loads pose a threat to life if the proper information hasn't been given to all including those who are simply sharing the road.",
