        "additional_details": "I have been doing my best for a while now to try and reduce my impact, including reusing and then recycling items to reduce the amount going to landfill. A lot of people do the same and some councils are very good at encouraging this. However I hear a lot of people saying that it is too complicated to recycle as they don't know what goes in which bin, etc. \r\n\r\nIf we were to have a standardised system of labelling, with all packaging showing what it is made from it would assist people greatly.",
        "background": "The UK has various systems of recycling with geographical differences in what is recycled. This is made more difficult as it's not always obvious what an item or packaging is made from. This is particularly important re plastic as some types are recyclable and others not. Clear labelling may assist.",
