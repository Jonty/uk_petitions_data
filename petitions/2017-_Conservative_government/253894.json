        "additional_details": "By holding an Election, candidates can state clearly if they wish to see a WTO exit, soft EU exit or revoke Article 50 and then let the people decide.\r\n\r\nWhen the current Parliament cannot agree to ANY proposal, it is clear that it isn't the question being posed that is wrong, it is the people elected to represent us that can't get things right.",
        "background": "Following the recent 'Meaningful' and 'Indicative' votes, it is clear that the current Members of Parliament are unable to reach any form of agreement that eliminates uncertainty.\r\n\r\nA General Election will allow the people to decide who they believe best represents the  interests of the country.",
