        "additional_details": "Since 1945, the only two Political Parties to reach a majority in Parliament are Labour and the Conservatives. \r\n\r\nIn the 2015 election, UKIP received a total of 3,881,099 votes and achieved 1 MP; the Liberal Democrats achieved 2,415,916 votes but won 8 MP's. Nearly 4 million people were left without a significant voice in parliament. \r\n\r\nAustralia currently operates under Single-Transferable vote and this has allowed many smaller parties to gain traction in their Government.",
        "background": "The UK voting system favours the mentality of 'tactical voting'. People vote for a party they do not very much agree with in order to keep a party they heavily disagree with from reaching a majority in Parliament. This leads to a stale two-party political system which leaves many disenfranchised.",
