        "additional_details": "The last 3 restaurants I have dinned in, I had to settle the bill with cash. At no point did the staff or the business owner display any payment instructions either within the premises/website.\r\n \r\nWe live in a modern society where everything is digital. Contactless, mobile payments etc.\r\n \r\nPlease help me sign this petition so all businesses in the UK are required to accept card payments.",
