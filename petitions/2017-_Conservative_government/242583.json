        "additional_details": "The TIG have claimed dissatisfaction with the parties they have left and as such they should be compelled to enter by-elections running on an independent platform. Their constituents should have the choice between maintaining a local allegiance to the respective parties they voted for in the 2017 GE or a switch of allegiance to a member of the TIG. Failure to do so would be inherently undemocratic.",
        "background": "The Independent Group were elected as representatives of their respective former parties. As they have formally distanced themselves from the policies of those parties, the policies and values which their constituents voted are no longer being represented.",
