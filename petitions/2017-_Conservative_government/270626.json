        "additional_details": "Housing developments through the UK are not planting enough trees or hedges to make their project carbon neutral.  As an example the A14 infrastructure project has removed approximately 29,000m2 of trees and 32 significant individual trees.\r\nAlthough the project is to plant 690,000 trees, these are between just 40cm and 150cm high. There a only a few larger trees which will be just 3m high. The UK has just 13 % tree cover. A like for like Co2 absorption law will help stop this decline.",
        "background": "Millions of trees and hedgerows are being removed to facilitate construction projects. A mature tree absorbs much more Co2 than the small saplings, which are often planted as replacements. It will take decades before these can begin to remove the same amount of Co2 as the felled mature trees.",
