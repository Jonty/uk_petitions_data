        "additional_details": "Legitimate reasons for pulling out after such a deadline can be defined and accepted, such as negative findings in surveys, searches or mortgage offer issues. However, 40% of pull outs are due to \u2018finding a preferred property\u2019 once conveyancing is underway which has to be prevented and made illegal or subject to heavy penalties. This is stifling the property market and causing people to fall in to debt, stress and depression on multiple fronts. This issue affects thousands of people every week.",

Other countries incl Scotland have a time limit in place shortly after an offer is accepted before which pull outs can happen.",
