With 9 MPs, to the DUPs 7. Following a public consultation, to which the DUP responded, the proposals were changed to favour the DUP. This in turn helped the Conservatives to retain a majority in Parliament. If the DUP truly want to be the same as the rest of the UK they must insist on this unjust, partisan rule (which does not apply to the rest of the UK) being removed.",

The proposals reduced the number of seats from 18 to 17 (as part of the overall plan to reduce the number of UK seats from 650 to 600).",
