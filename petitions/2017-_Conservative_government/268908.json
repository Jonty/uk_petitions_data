        "additional_details": "Current UK standard of tanks deemed suitable for cetaceans is laid out in\u00a0Klinowska and Brown\u2019s Review of Dolphinaria, (1968).\r\nModern studies have proven captive cetaceans have shorter, more stressful lives than their wild counterparts. It is now clear that these intelligent animals cannot thrive in captivity, and our law should reflect that.\r\nThis ban should exclude sea pens\u00a0designed for cetacean\u00a0rehabilitation should any sites in the UK be identified as suitable for this purpose in the future.",
        "background": "Although presently there are no captive cetaceans in the UK, if there were, it would not actually be against current UK law.\r\nKeeping cetaceans in captivity is cruel as there is no way their needs can be met. This outdated law needs changing to ensure the UK will never house captive cetaceans again.",
