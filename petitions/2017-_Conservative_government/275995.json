The chairs on the service are shockingly uncomfortable, and the procedure for claiming refunds is extremely difficult and time-consuming. The bad service has gone on long enough.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gwr.com/about-us/performance",
        "background": "GWR has one of the lowest satisfaction rates of any train line in the UK. The trains are often overcrowded and delayed, the reservations system doesn\u2019t work and the ticket prices increase unreasonably highly every year. Despite the importance of the line, GWR are out of touch with the public.",
