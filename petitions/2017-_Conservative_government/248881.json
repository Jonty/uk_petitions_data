        "additional_details": "It is clear that our Parliament has lost its way and needs reminding that the People of this Country voted with full faith in the Political class that their decision would be honoured respected and implemented. Overwhelmingly the most popular way forward is no deal WTO, on time, no matter what various polls may say. Our Parliament must listen to its People or this Country will lose its treasured Democracy.",
        "background": "We believe the government should implement leaving the EU with no deal WTO on the 29th of March 2019 as promised. We also believe the government is unaware of the strength of feeling in the UK to do so and should be made aware by as many means as possible. No Deal No Delay WTO is the only way.",
