        "additional_details": "So funding has to be found from other sources, adversely affecting education, social services, NHS or increasing the Governments borrowing.  This is not right.  Why should such funding not be used for hurricane relief in British territories?  Why do we continue to fund Pakistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and South Sudan but refuse help to countries with direct British links and Heritage?  We call on the Government to immediately change the rules so that foreign aid can be used to support British territories overseas in dire need.",
        "background": "During September 2017, British territories in the Caribbean have been decimated by hurricanes.  Property has been wiped out and residents left homeless and without food.  However, the British Government says it cannot use any of the \u00a313bn Foreign Aid budget to support them as they are \"too rich\".",
