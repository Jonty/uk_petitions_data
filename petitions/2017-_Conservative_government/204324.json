        "additional_details": "What is this doing to their mental health and wellbeing? \r\nHow is it fair to charge someone who is ill and on a low income 10 pound a day to watch TV. \r\nThere are so many elderly patients waiting to be able to go home but can't until they are assessed and a care plan has been put in place. This can take months. Mental health becomes effected and the risk of catching something else could cause a longer stay in hospital. Please sign to help make hospital TV free.",
        "background": "Ill patients are being charged extortionate prices for TV while in hospital. An example of this an 77 year old with learning disabilities who has been in hospital for two wks has been charged over 100 pounds to watch TV. They can not read a book or play on their Ipad due to being illiterate.",
