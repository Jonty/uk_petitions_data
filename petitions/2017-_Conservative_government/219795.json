        "additional_details": "The NHS, particularly hospitals, are one of if not the busiest body of workers in the UK. Nurses work tirelessly 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide a service that treats over 1 million patients in just 36 hours. There is a critical shortage of nurses with 1 in 11 NHS posts currently unfilled. Nurses are important, and it makes no sense to charge them to be able to simply go into work. It\u2019s unfair, its uneconomical, and it is clearly not helping in people staying within NHS employment.",
        "background": "My friend, an amazing nurse, is forced to pay \u00a324 per week to park at the hospital she works for. She only works 16hrs, yet a substantial percentage of her pay is used enabling her JUST to GO to work. Nurses are already ridiculously underpaid for their role in saving lives. How can this be fair?",
