        "additional_details": "The Hunter groups are not vigilantes, they do not take the law into their own hands.  They are evidence gatherers & they expose peapophiles then hand them over to the police, along with all the evidence needed to enable a conviction.\r\nInstead of working against them, recognise the important part they play in keeping our children safe.  \r\nLicence them if needs be.\r\nRecognise they provide a service our Police force can't.\r\nHunters are proactive - Police are reactive.\r\nOur children need their protection",
        "background": "There are over 70 Peadophile hunting groups working hard to keep our children safe.  They work within the law so why have local Police been given orders from 'above' to try & arrest them & not to work with them.",
