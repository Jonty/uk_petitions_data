        "additional_details": "I'm not alone, I'm just part of the many that are in the same position as me: 50% of students struggle to keep up with the rent. And it is crazy that for many in halls have to source extra cash to pay their rent, even though Halls of Residence are managed at a reasonable price for students. 63% say the cost of accommodation impacts mental health\r\n37% find their studies are affected too (Save the Student, 2018).\r\n\r\nStill, the costs continue,  upfront costs for renting a property too are not considered in the maintenance loan, and many agents call for it in advance, so students maintenance loan just keeps getting smaller.",
        "background": "The cost of living across the UK varies only by \u00a320 between London and the South East, yet the maintenance loan increases by more than \u00a31,000. Beyond London, living costs range of \u00a337 (Save the Student, 2018).",
