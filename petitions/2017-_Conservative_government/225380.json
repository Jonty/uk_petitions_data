        "additional_details": "I believe this because if someone has killed multiple people then (s)he should be put to death because if someone loses a life then the person who took it should lose theirs as well. Also, it will act as a deterrent for people because no one really wants to lose their life. I hope you can all share my views on this by signing this partition and help make the country a safer place to live in, for all.",
