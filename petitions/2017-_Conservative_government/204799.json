She had said thy could overdose the child or give it to the wrong one the fact that all medication is named and has the dose on it so basically she is saying they are incompitant, I feel they are putting our children at risk.",
        "background": "i believe that 4-6 year olds are too young to understand and administer inhalers by themselves, I have just been told by our school that it is not policy and they must either do it themselves or a parent can come into do it.",
