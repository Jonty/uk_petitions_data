        "additional_details": "We have a private education and health insurance and aren't incurring expenses from the government. Our employment situation made UK our home, we grew up here and are about to enroll to universities; it is unreasonable to look elsewhere. Our parents are committed to careers in an international company; they will bring back their international earnings to UK to finance our education and settlement. As such, it is a win-win situation that merits consideration",
        "background": "We have lived in the UK for 5 years and are not allowed to settle equally to colleagues on Tier 2 (general). Our parents are paying the same amounts of taxes, and not receiving any government services. It is not currently possible to apply for leave to remain with this visa made after April 2010.",
