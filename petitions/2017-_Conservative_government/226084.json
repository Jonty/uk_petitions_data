        "action": "Revoke Section 74 of the LLA Act 2007 that permits the reuse of graves",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon Government to develop new legislation in this field to ensure re-use of graves is only permitted where permission from the grave owner or their relatives, as defined by the regulation, is given.\r\n\r\nGraves and memorials provide a tangible link to our past, assist genealogical research but primarily form part of our heritage and encourage acts of Respect and Remembrance, but they are currently being abused.",
        "background": "Section 74 of the London Local Authorities Act 2007 permits a burial authority to disturb human remains for the purposes of re-using the graves, but Cemeteries are failing to locate people who may have an inherited right. The current procedure is not adequate to identify potential owners of graves.",
