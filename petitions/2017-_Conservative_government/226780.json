        "background": "The U.K. does not have jurisdiction to revoke the European Citizenship of those who wish to keep it.\r\n\r\nTo clarify; by \"European Citizenship\", we mean a \"Citizen of the European Union\", and not someone who has citizenship from a country in Europe, although they may have both.",
