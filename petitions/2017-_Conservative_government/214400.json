        "additional_details": "This morning I witnessed 3 different cars parked in the parent and child spaces after I drove round for 5 minutes trying to find one. Eventually I saw a lone lady get into her car who didn\u2019t have a child. She eventually pulled out the space and whilst I was unloading the pushchair, the car that was parked next to me, had four adults walk to it and get in.\r\nIt\u2019s extremley useful to have the extra space either side of the car when you have a car seat to get out.",
        "background": "Having a child myself when out and about is stressful enough. When you come to park your car in parent & child space it would be nice not to see so many people using the spaces that are reserved for people who have children.",
