        "additional_details": "The changes have also been particularly distressing for those who require routine. Favourite restaurants have stopped serving some drinks. The changes are causing people who struggle with isolation, who try their hardest to endure the stress of life in public just so they can have some normalcy, to feel even more stress and isolation. Purchasing drinks that fall under the levy from shops has become terribly expensive for disabled adults who rely on small PIP payments to live off.",
        "background": "The Government hasn't considered the impact of the levy on those with \u201cunseen\u201d disabilities. People with sensory issues can't change what they drink without distress. While you may think it is acceptable to replace one flavour with another, people with sensory issues can find such changes revolting.",
