        "additional_details": "Cyclists are constantly getting away with dangerous manoeuvres. This includes not waiting for the light to change green and riding on pavements to skip traffic. Currently anyone can take a bike and ride the streets of London with no testing, monitoring and tax system in place. If a car was to do this then they can face proesucution and even lose their license. If a car passes a red light they are fined but a bike gets away with this. Where is the justice in this. This needs to change.",
        "background": "All cyclists need to be licensed so they are monitored through DVLA. A minimum standard should be introduced which includes a basic MOT checking all safety aspects of Bike. They should also undertake a road safety course before being allowed to ride the streets of London to ensure competency.",
