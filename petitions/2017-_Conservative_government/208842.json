It is already legal to attach a newer number plate to an older car, so we're not sure what else you'd like Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about how to put a private registration number on a vehicle here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/put-registration-number-vehicle\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, if you would like the Government or Parliament to remove the condition that you cannot use a number plate if it makes the vehicle look newer than it is, you could start a new petition asking for that to happen.
