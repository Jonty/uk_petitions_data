        "action": "Increase school transport funding for 16 to 18 year olds in full time education.",
        "additional_details": "Currently the eligibility for free school transport ceases at age 16. This is because the old school leaving age was 16. Now that the school leaving age has effectively been increased to 18, the eligibility for free school transport should also be increased and should include any young person remaining in full-time education be it at a school or college. The justification for free school transport for 4-16 year olds also stands for 17 to 18 year olds.",
        "background": "In 2015 changes to the Education and Skills Act 2008 made it compulsory for young people to continue in education, employment or training until the age of 18. Therefore, school transport funding to local authorities should be increased to include 16-18 year olds that remain in full-time education.",
