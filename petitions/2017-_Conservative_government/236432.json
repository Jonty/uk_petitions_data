        "additional_details": "\r\nThese websites don't specialise in pets or regulations in that industry therefore you never really know what you're getting yourself into selling your pet on these sites. Professional agencies trusted to rehome your pets should be used. dogs are being sold on hundreds of sites for extremely cheap prices with no questions asked by the seller to the buyer regarding whether the requirements will be met for housing needs, food and dietary requirements. We must keep pets safe.",
        "background": "This is becoming a huge issue, people buy pets sometimes with bad intentions or purely for breeding therefore aren't buying your pet as a 'pet' to love and care for. This is massively on the increase and unwanted pets should be rehomed through trusted places such as dogs trust rather than eBay etc.",
