        "additional_details": "Alternative milk eg: oat milk contains 36% RDA for calcium; 1 serving of whole milk contains 28%. An allergy can be considered a disability. It is discrimatory to exclude low income families from their non-dairy nutritional needs: the Equality Act (2010) is not being upheld. If it is sufficient to expect the sole purpose of non-dairy users to use them on fruit & veg, then why include cows milk or formula at all?\r\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=396559724104198&id=296629500763888",
        "background": "Approx 2 million people live in the UK with a food allergy (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2011). Cows milk costs 43p/L. Oat milk costs \u00a31.79/L The cost of alternative milks on low income families is detrimental. Alternative formula costs more than \u00a330 per tin.",
