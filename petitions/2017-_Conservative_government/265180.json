        "additional_details": "Commercial extraction of peat from our peat bogs can remove more than 500 years worth of peat growth in a single year. But despite alternatives available such as compost, sales for peat are at 3 billion litres a year and rising! We need to fight against climate crisis in all areas.",
        "background": "The peatlands of the UK are one of our greatest assets; we cannot underestimate their importance for carbon capture. In the UK they hold more carbon than forests. Peat extraction in the UK is estimated to release a million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere every year. Governments need to act.",
