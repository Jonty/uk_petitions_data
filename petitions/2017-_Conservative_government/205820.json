        "action": "Reverse the decision to exclude animal sentience from the EU Withdrawal Bill.",
        "additional_details": "How can parliamentarians decide by a vote whether a being is self aware enough to feel pain or emotion? Have they really never seen an animal in pain or fear? Have they never seen a dog wag its tail and loll its tongue when experiencing joy? What about a pig squealing in terror when caught? Are these not the emotions of sentient beings? It is arrogant beyond belief to think that by a simple poll a group of politicians can change well known facts that both science and common sense has taught us.",
        "background": "MPs have voted to reject the inclusion of animal sentience \u2013 the admission that animals feel emotion and pain \u2013 into the EU Withdrawal Bill. This poses a massive threat to animal welfare. You can't be said to mistreat a being that neither has emotions, feels pain or is self aware.",
