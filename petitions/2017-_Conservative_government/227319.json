        "action": "Introduce a constituency and MP to represent British voters living abroad",
        "additional_details": "The proposition is to introduce a new constituency and MP to represent UK expatriate voters. Alternatively, a current MP could be nominated to represent expatriate voters in addition to their domestic constituency. The needs and views of expatriates are not represented under the current regime. A similar system is in place in France, (Fran\u00e7ais \u00e9tablis hors de France), suggesting that the proposition is feasible. The interests of UK citizens living abroad are valid and should be recognised.",
        "background": "Many UK citizens who live abroad have the right to vote for up to 15 years after leaving. To do this, however, they must be registered in the constituency where they were last resident in the UK. The issues affecting expatriate voters are often not aligned with the local issues of UK constituencies.",
