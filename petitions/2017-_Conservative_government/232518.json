        "action": "Introduce heavy taxation on palm oil so businesses remove it from their products",
        "additional_details": "Iceland state that they're removing palm oil from all of their own label products which shows that it is more than possible for businesses to do and to follow suit. Therefore, I am calling for heavy taxation on palm oil so it is not financially viable for businesses to use it, and therefore they find a less damaging and more ethical alternative.",
        "background": "We lose 25 orangutans per day, largely due to the palm oil industry which requires the burning of trees such as the oil palm, which is their natural habitat. The government should heavily tax palm oil so businesses are discouraged from using it in their products and find other, better alternatives.",
