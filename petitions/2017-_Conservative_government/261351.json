It would also save \u00a310.8m on the cash support it provides. Asylum seekers are most vulnerable and many Asylum seekers are suffering from PTSDs, depression, anxiety and several psychological problems that adds burdens on GPs and hospitals.",
        "background": "Asylum seekers in the UK could make a contribution of \u00a342m to the economy if restrictive rules for work were lifted. This means people are essentially banned from working while they wait for a decisions. Asylum seekers are forced to live on \u00a35.39 a day which is sometime really hard to apply.",
