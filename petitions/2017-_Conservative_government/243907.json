        "additional_details": "In 2013, a girl was forced into isolation until she dyed her hair back. This has been the case many different times and the issue still continues today. Many schools even suspend students because of it. Every child has a right to their education and should not be refused an education because of the colour of their hair. Punishment because of a student's hair colour should be stopped and the rules against it should be banned as it can often cause a lot of stress to students with dyed hair.",
        "background": "Many schools have rules against getting your hair dyed. In some schools, children get in a lot of trouble just for dying their hair. I am starting this petition to allow students to dye their hair without being judged by their teachers.",
