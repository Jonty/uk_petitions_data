        "additional_details": "MetroWest are consulting in relation to the reopening of the Portishead to Bristol rail line. In connection with their proposals which are broadly welcomed they are attempting to 'steamroller' local 'soft' landowners into surrendering open green land in the middle of conservation belt and without regard for the damage that this will cause to the heritage views of the Grade 1 listed Clifton Suspension Bridge and the Grade 2 and 2* buildings which have defined Bristol for centuries.",
        "background": "We want the government to insist that MetroWest locate their proposed industrial rail construction and maintenance yard in a more appropriate location than they are currently proposing at a greenfield site at Clanage Road, Bower Ashton which will blight historic Bristol defining views.",
