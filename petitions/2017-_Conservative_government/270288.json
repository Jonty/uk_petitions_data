        "action": "Introduce economic sanctions against Brazil to stop deforestation in the Amazon",
        "additional_details": "The Amazon is home to over 1 million indigenous people, 3 million different species of plants and animals, and is essential in the fight against climate change. However, the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, is allowing the rainforest to be destroyed for economic gain. When the world is facing climate breakdown, we cannot allow this recklessness to become profitable. We need economic sanctions to disincentivise further deforestation.",
        "background": "The Amazon Rainforest is one of our greatest defences against global warming but it's burning without consequence for those setting the fires. This petition calls for the UK parliament to consider economic sanctions against the Brazillian Government to stop the heinous destruction of the rainforest.",
