        "action": "Immediate shut down of oil or gas wells that are cold venting methane gas.",
        "additional_details": "We call for production at these wells to be immediately stopped until they can be adapted to no longer require the use of permitted methane release points.",
        "background": "Some UK wells are operating under old style permits which allow them to 'cold' vent methane to the atmosphere if capture or combustion and flaring is technically or economically not viable. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and venting is inconsistent with the UK's climate change commitments.",
