        "additional_details": "The dairy industry is on the decline uk wide, with more people becoming aware of the hidden practices such as this, used to make farms run as more profitable businesses. Due to tighter financial margins, rearing male calves or selling them on for slaughter to enter the food chain is becoming less common as farmers turn to shooting the babies at birth instead. The UK government subsidises these practices and in essence, allows the slaughter of these baby animals to continue unchecked. \r\n\r\nIf a businesses cannot afford to raise a calf because of its inability to make money, it simply shouldn't be allowed to impregnate further cows. It is outrageous that in 2019 such practices are not just allowed but encouraged and paid for by tax payers money.",
        "background": "The completely legal practice of 'early disposal' is leading to the deaths of over 95,000 day old calves a year in the UK. This is half the population of Aberdeen per year and only the ones we know about, as there is no requirement for a farmer to declare the birth of the calf or register the death.",
