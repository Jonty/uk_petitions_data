        "additional_details": "The lives of these innocent people are stolen, and if they survive they are damaged for life. The same as murder. I've read cases where the abuser has had lots of women locked up and raped all day long , even children. When he is found guilty he might only get 2 years in jail while these innocent people are destroyed. If this evil becomes a guaranteed life sentence it will decrease the numbers of victims. Any other punishment for such evil is too low. Please see: Hope for Justice, and Love for Justice international.",
        "background": "Sex slavery one of the many forms of slavery, under the banner Human Trafficking. An estimated 4.8 million (mainly) women and children are sex slaves worldwide. They are stolen, locked up, beaten, can't leave the home , forced out as prostitutes and raped by up to 200 men a day.",
