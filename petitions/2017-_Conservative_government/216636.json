        "additional_details": "Most straws end up in the ocean where they cause a lot of damage to animals by being mistakenly ingested. Since the 1950s it is estimated by the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Georgia that just 9% of the 9.1 billion tonnes of plastic produced has been recycled.\r\n\r\nWe need to reduce our reliance on single use plastic and find biodegradable and sustainable alternatives, such as paper straws.",
        "background": "Plastic straws are wreaking havoc across the world. Each straw has a lifespan of just 20 minutes, but it;s estimated it can take up to 400 years to completely break down. The UK uses approximately 8.5 billion straws a year, so lets make a positive change and get rid of them once and for all!",
