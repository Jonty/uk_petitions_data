        "additional_details": "The local council have put forward planning ideas to build 1000+ homes on the caravan site, this is not a problem, moving us two miles into the forest is, we should be able to stay in our homes and not be forced to move for others, the travelling community is one of the biggest and longest around and we feel as if we\u2019re being victimised by forcing us out to bring others in, build the new homes around us and make us feel as part of the community to which we do belong, don\u2019t take our homes from us",
        "background": "Halfhide lane caravan park has been in the Hertfordshire county for nearly a century, generations after generations have grew up and lived on this travelling site, we are part of this community as much as everyone else, it is unfair and discriminating to make us leave our home to build a dozen more",
