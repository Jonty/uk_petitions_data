        "additional_details": "As a Royal Navy veteran (23 years under the waves) I feel it unfair that there is no mechanism in place to obtain a railcard other than the normal route, ie Family & Friends, Disability, 16-25 or wait until I reach 60. Serving our country is an honour and requires a massive commitment for many years, so I do not feel it is too much to ask for a small token to help with travel costs, especially when none of the other cards are valid for the lone, uninjured, pre-State Pension Veteran traveller.",
