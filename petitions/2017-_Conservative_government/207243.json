The maximum available penalty for this offence is a \u00a31,000 fine, endorsement points and/or a disqualification. It is also a Fixed Penalty Offence, which means that instead of going to court, offenders can get a \u00a350 fine and 3 points on their licence. \r\n\r\nWe're therefore not sure what further action you want the UK Government and Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking the Government to provide more money for roads policing on motorways, if that's what you want to happen. You could also start a new petition asking the Government to launch an awareness campaign aimed at drivers about the dangers of breaking this law, if that's what you want to happen. "
