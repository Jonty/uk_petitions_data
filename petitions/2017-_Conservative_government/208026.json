        "additional_details": "Children with autism starting secondary school are only given support for the first term of year 7 in parts of Essex.  This lack of support for children with autism is having a detrimental affect on kids that need the support more than ever when they change to big school. How can it then just disappear, this should not be allowed and funding should be provided by the government to senior schools in Essex in order to provide it. This MUST be changed now as we are failing these bright children.",
        "background": "Currently in parts of Essex the Specialist Teacher team are funded to go into primary school and support children on the Autism Soectrum. Senior schools are unable to afford the funding to pay for the Specialist teacher support. This needs to change and the government need to provide this.",
