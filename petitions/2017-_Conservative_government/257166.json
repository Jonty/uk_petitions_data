This leads to ill-informed public opinion which is not how a true democracy should function and it has gone on long enough.",
        "background": "The public rely on elected officials to govern our society responsibly. In turn, they have a responsibility to establish trust with the general public. We must be able to trust what they say in public and in open debate. Too often, our representatives are ill informed or careless with the facts.",
