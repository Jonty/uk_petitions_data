        "additional_details": "There have always been concerns regarding the long term impacts that e-cigarettes & vaping could have on people and these impacts are potentially starting to show themselves in people who use these.\r\n\r\nE-cigarettes & vapers seem to show huge benefits in comparison to normal cigarettes which is tremendous; however we don't know if they come with risks. Let's take precautionary measures to not repeat old failures.\r\n\r\nSHS: https://ash.org.uk/category/information-and-resources/secondhand-smoke/\r\nParagraph: The Unknown About E-Cigarettes and Vaping: https://mphdegree.usc.edu/blog/understanding-the-implications-of-vaping-and-e-cigarettes/",
        "background": "Smoking indoors was banned because second hand smoke (SHS) can cause serious health issues in non-smokers, most of all, children.\r\nFor years SHS existed because precautions weren't put in place to protect people from what they didn't know.\r\nLet's prevent similar consequences with this petition",
