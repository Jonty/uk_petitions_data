The County is being ruined for those who live here and for tourists during the summer, who have to battle through traffic for hours only to find that wherever they are going is being built on and their day is ruined by loud construction work and a return journey full of traffic.",
        "background": "In Cornwall there are inadequate facilities available to those who live here. With so many houses being built in the county the amount of traffic and accidents are increasing. Houses should not be allowed to be built by companies unless they help improve Cornwall for those that already live here.",
