        "additional_details": "Expanded wording of the Petition -\r\nIn addition to fines payable for fly-tipping, those found guilty of fly-tipping should have the vehicle(s) they own or vehicle(s) knowingly provided to them for the purpose of fly-tipping, seized and crushed. Perpetrators hiring or borrowing vehicles for the purposes of fly-tipping will pay the equivalent cost of crushing and replacing the said vehicle in addition to any fines imposed for the offence.",
        "background": "Fly-tipping is the illegal dumping of rubbish. It scars the landscape and costs millions to remove. I can't imagine anyone not being appalled at the level of fly-tipping in this country, apart from those who make money from the activity or those with no respect for their communities and environment.",
