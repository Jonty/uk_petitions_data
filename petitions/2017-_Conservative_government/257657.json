        "additional_details": "As operating cabin crew - I see the huge amounts of waste simply thrown into landfill or incineration, every day.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of waste collection onboard aircrafts, separation of refuge by crew will be easy if the correct equipment is invested in, to allow for the correct separation of recyclables and safe stowage of waste.\r\n\r\nIf waste is separated onboard - caterers and cleaners will be able to transfer this waste to larger recycling bins to be collected by waste management companies.",
        "background": "Airlines across globe produce masses of waste which is not recycled. If alternative to single use items cannot be found, then airlines and airports must be forced to recycle the vast majority of their waste. Waste carts onboard aircraft should facilitate the separation of recyclables.",
