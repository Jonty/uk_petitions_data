        "action": "Review decision to merge councils in Dorset to stop huge council tax increases",
        "additional_details": "Three councils rejected option 2B, the consultation was flawed and 18 months is insufficient to complete work needed for successful reorganisation. Creation of new coucils distant from communities must be supported by Parish/Town councils in both the Rural and Urban Authorities, supported by funding and accountable to local parish councillors.  Council tax needs to be equalised across the areas but this must be done over a long enough period to avoid increases over 2% as per consultation papers",
        "background": "If the Sec of State approves the creation of new new Unitary Authorities we call on him to make sure that council tax rises are kept within the limit before a local referendum is triggered (2% per year) \r\nWe also want to see Parish (or Town) councils for ALL communities so decisions are made locally",
