        "background": "We were in the Royal Air Force for just under 30 years.  We had met and holidayed in Cyprus towards the latter part of our service.\r\nWe decided that we would like to remain in Cyprus after our years were up.\r\nThe amended DTA would reduce the amount of household income Veterans' have to live on.",
