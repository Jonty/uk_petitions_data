Their reply was that they no longer wanted the dog! \r\nMax and I lived a happy life together, but sadly not all dogs are that lucky.\r\nAround 1000 dogs are being put to sleep each year due to lack of room in rescue centres. \r\nBull breeds being the hardest to rehome.",
        "background": "Max was my dog and he was dumped by his previous owners in October 2016 when he was a 16 year old.\r\nMax was a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\r\nI adopted him on December 8th 2016 and he sadly went over the Rainbow Bridge 20th February 2019 aged 18. \r\nMax's law will be in his memory.",
