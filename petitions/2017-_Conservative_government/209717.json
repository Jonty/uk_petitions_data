        "additional_details": "Like 6,500 other carers, I spent time providing evidence for government on our caring role. It was expected that government would publish the results in a Carers Strategy by the end of 2016. Nothing has happened since the consultation closed. In October 2017, I was quoted in a debate in Parliament https://goo.gl/vN27L2 (Parliament web link). An Action Plan was recently mentioned but an Action Plan is not a Carers' Strategy. Signing this petition will show government that carers matter.",
        "background": "I am one of the 7 million unpaid carers in the country. You can read about me here http://bit.ly/2lGLpxc (Guardian web link) I took part in a government consultation for unpaid carers in early 2016. Carers have been waiting for a Government Strategy ever since.  I know unpaid carers deserve better.",
