Refusing to clarify if that can deliver a mandate (for the 1st time) would be undemocratic.",
        "background": "There was never any mandate for any specific deal at the Referendum (52% split between multiple paths, 48% united on a single path) or at the General election (no party gained a majority).\r\n\r\nThere *could* now be public backing for a specific deal but that must be proven through a public vote.",
