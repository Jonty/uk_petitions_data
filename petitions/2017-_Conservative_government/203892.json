        "action": "Make National Living Wage apply equally to all workers over 18 years old.",
        "additional_details": "For example in France all workers over age 18 are eligible for a minimum living wage which is the same for all regardless of their age.  This works very well and, unlike our system, does not discriminate against younger workers. To discriminate encourages exploitation of a cheap labour force. This is surely counter to the spirit of the Equality Act 2010.",
        "background": "There should not be an age discrimination against working 18-24 year as they contribute to society in the same manner as people over age 25. They are fully expected to pay council tax, NI, bills, prescriptions etc.",
