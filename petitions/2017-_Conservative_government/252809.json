        "additional_details": "We are one of the oldest democracies in the world - and it shows. There has been no major reform of Parliament since the civil war; our Parliamentary democracy and electoral system is no longer fit for purpose. Constituents are alienated, disenfranchised, and distrustful of MP\u2019s. We demand a full reform of Parliament and the election process to rebuild trust in our politicians. We demand Proportional Representation and an end to safe seats, to make sure every vote counts, every voice is heard.",
        "background": "If Brexit has done anything, it is to highlight the shameful failure of our political system to actually work in the national interest. FPTP, a two-party system, and a network of safe seats, all combine to put party interests first. This has led us to our current crisis, and the brink of disaster.",
