        "additional_details": "Strode's College's Student Union Executives support the NUS' motion of #myFEjourney - public transport is extremely expensive for students as we are required to pay adult fares on most public transport. As we are in full time education and due to the low minimum wages for under 18s, our monthly incomes can barely support this price. We believe that  transport fares for students in Further Education should be the same as child fares so that we can afford to attend school or college everyday.",
        "background": "According to the National Union of Students, 50% of students in Further Education spend over \u00a320 a week on public transport to attend school or college. My own journeys to college cost me \u00a385 a month. For a student with a Saturday job on minimum wage, this is over half of their monthly pay.",
