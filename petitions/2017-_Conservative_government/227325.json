        "additional_details": "A central Government initiative, in the form of national protocol or code of practice, would help to ensure that certain standards are achieved by all those involved in transferring the terminally ill from home to palliative care.\r\n\r\nAny central Government protocol or code of practice would need to be embedded in the various safeguarding procedures and this should lead to improved collaboration, better communication and a more collaborative way of working for all those involved.",
        "background": "Transfers from home to palliative care usually involve a number of public and commercial services, each following their own safeguarding procedures. However, if serious omissions are to be avoided there is a pressing need for a mechanism which locks these different safeguarding procedures together.",
