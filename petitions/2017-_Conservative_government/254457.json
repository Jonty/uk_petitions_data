So we can kick the can  years down the road and hope we all forget?\r\n\r\nGeneral election - it won't break deadlock it is just a tactic.\r\n\r\nWhen anyone else is unable to carry out their job they are not paid or are sacked so why not these?",
        "background": "MP's have been following their own agendas rather than the mandate given to them to leave the EU. Rather than work in the interests of the country they continue to   enforce what they want, including cancelling Brexi or another referendum which is pointless as they just want a different answer.",
