        "additional_details": "The public was promised leaving the EU would provide the NHS with an extra \u00a3350 million a week but this has now been realised false and unrealistic, and this was a main campaign point and a big reason for people choosing to vote leave. In addition, departing the EU would also have a large effect on the UK's economy caused by the large leaving fee and the decrease in our trade deals. Now we have a complete idea of the principles and terms of Brexit, we should be allowed a second chance to vote.",
        "background": "In June 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU with a majority vote of 51.9%. We believe that the public deserves a second chance to evaluate this decision because of the political discoveries made about the \"leave\" campaign and the difficulties our country has already faced because of this decision.",
