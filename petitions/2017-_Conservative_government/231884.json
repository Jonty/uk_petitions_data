Therefore, we're not sure which crimes you would like this to apply to.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government and Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking to increase sentences for people convicted of sexual offences against children, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to happen."
