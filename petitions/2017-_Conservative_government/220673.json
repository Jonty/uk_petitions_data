        "additional_details": "Banning smoking in public places had been a great intervention, however many still do it at bus stops and play areas or while pushing a pram... I start this petition as I feel that we need to start somewhere protecting the children from the harmful chemicals or at least raising more awareness around it. I also feel it would be relevant to the Public Health England policy drivers regarding smoking cessation.",
        "background": "Since I have started doing school runs I have increasingly noticed the amount of parents/carers who gather at the school gates, sometimes having toddlers with them, and smoke while discussing the day. I believe it is general knowledge to all of how harmful smoking and second hand smoking are.",
