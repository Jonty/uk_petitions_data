        "additional_details": "It is shocking to see how little black people are acknowledged in history, and I would like to put across that being forgotten is no longer going to be an option. As a young black girl I feel that is is important that I am taught about the history of my forebears and everything that they have done to make the world we live in the way that it is today.",
        "background": "In the WW1 roughly 180000 black soldiers fought for the British however only a small portion of those were remembered. As young black youth in secondary school, we fail to see acknowledgement of black people in British history. This is why we believe that there should be a black version on poppy's",
