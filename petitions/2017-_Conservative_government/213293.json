        "action": "Remove Widows Parents Allowance as an income on Universal Credit Claims",
        "additional_details": "Widows Parents Allowance is exactly that, an allowance to help a widowed parent support and provide for their young children following the loss of the child's/children's parent.\r\nI alone will not be able to make changes to the Universal Credit criteria, but feel strongly that the inclusion of Widows Parents Allowance in any Universal Credit claim should be reconsidered. Support should be given by our Government to those trying to better themselves following the devastating loss of a husband/wife",
        "background": "Universal Credit claims currently see Widows Parents Allowance as an income. Therefore any claim made by a widow is penalised resulting in the total amount of Widows Parents Allowance being deducted from their claim resulting in a far lesser payment of Universal Credit.",
