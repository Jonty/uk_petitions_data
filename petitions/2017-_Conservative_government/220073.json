In other words, kept in the EU in all but name. \r\nWe voted to take back control of our country and our sovereignty. \r\nThe Government must sever all ties with the EU.\r\n",
        "background": "Leaving the EU must mean leaving the Single Market, Customs Union, the jurisdiction of the ECJ, the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fishing Policy. \r\nThere must be a clean break from the EU so Britain can take back control of its laws, borders, trade and money.\r\n",
