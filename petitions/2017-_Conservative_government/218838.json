Lie detectors, offered to both sides, should be allowed as partial evidence \r\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/16/liedetectorshave-used-send-160-sex-offenders-back-prison/\r\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britains-hostility-to-lie-detector-tests-misguided-and-irrational-says-leading-psychologist-10349313.html",
        "background": "I\u2019m a crime victim & have experienced the horrific tactics adopted by defence barristers determined to get perpetrators off regardless of guilt. I propose, in the interest of fairness, that both accused & victims can voluntarily submit to lie detector tests & that this evidence can be used at trial.",
