        "additional_details": "How many times do we read of multi million pound prizewinners lives being blighted because of too much money?  \r\nBy capping the first prize others with winning numbers, would share a bigger prize fund.\r\nHaving a payout of about \u00a330 to \u00a350 for three numbers must be welcomed.\r\n I believe that charity begins at home.\r\nI would much prefer UK good causes, like young people, the elderly or injured military personnel being helped, rather than Ethiopian Spice Girls or Chinchilla breeding in Peru.",
        "background": "I think winning \u00a33 million would alter, for the better, 99.9% of peoples lives. All prize money shared out weekly.\r\nGood causes supported in UK only.\r\nNo more Ethiopian Spice Girls.",
