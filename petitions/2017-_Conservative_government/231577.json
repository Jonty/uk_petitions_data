        "additional_details": "Researches show that RJ satisfies 85% of the victims and reduces the re-offending rate by 14% [https://restorativejustice.org.uk/criminal-justice]. Young offenders are offered RJ where appropriate, but this does not occur enough for adult offenders. We would like the government to introduce legislation that makes it mandatory to offer RJ to adult offenders where appropriate. Please sign if you agree that this would be a positive move forward for victims, offenders and the Criminal Justice per se. #RJ4EVERYONE",

The meeting is assisted by a mediator, and the aim is to discuss the offence and its consequences as a group.",
