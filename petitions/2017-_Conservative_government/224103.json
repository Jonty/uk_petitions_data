        "additional_details": "In 2014 Glassdoor found that 78% of women would not ask about maternity policies at interview, and only 1/3 of them received this information in induction packs. Yet salary, holiday, pension entitlements and health insurance are all routinely discussed at the point of hiring.\r\n\r\nThese policies could be included with gender pay gap reporting for large companies. This would be logistically easy for companies to do. We call upon the government to adopt this position.",
        "background": "There is already a requirement that companies have such policies (which may match the statutory minimum). However, this information is not generally publicly available and often is not shared with potential employees. Sadly, individuals risk discrimination if they ask for it.",
