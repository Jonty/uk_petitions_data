        "additional_details": "The European Free Trade Association is the intergovernmental organisation of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. It was set up in 1960 by its then seven Member States for the promotion of free trade and economic integration between its members. EFTA\u2019s budget is prepared in two currencies: Swiss francs (CHF) and euros (EUR). The total budget for 2016 was equivalent to CHF 21 677 000 and the EFTA Secretariat has fewer than 90 employees.",
        "background": "The European Free Trade Association is outside the EU, (Norway, Switzerland,Iceland & Liechtenstein are members) For the next 2 years we could be in the single market, which gives us the time to negotiate a good deal. It\u2019s a common sense solution for all the incompetent moves by Parliament.",
