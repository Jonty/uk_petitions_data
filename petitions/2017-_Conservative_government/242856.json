        "additional_details": "I ran None of the Above petition and many asked why not spoil paper. It seems disrespectful to our democracy. What\u2019s wrong with option for None of the Above and if  won, move to re-open nominations so constituency can remove a sitting MP. \r\nAnother point was to move to mandatory voting - could be with NoTA? \r\nProcedures re resignations and by-elections need review. \r\nParl procedures seem so out of date. \r\nIn order to heal UK from Brexit division people need to feel confident in democratic processes.",
        "background": "Brexit chaos has highlighted that our electoral system is not fit for purpose. Huge amounts of electorate do not feel represented. From First Past the Post vs Prop Repres to selection of candidates and \u2018life qualifications\u2019 to \u2018none of the above\u2019 with repercussions rather than spoiling ballot paper.",
