        "additional_details": "I am a security expect and have been for over ten years. The British Government of the United Kingdom need to Dr-criminalize pepper spray for the reasons of self defence. If citizens of the United Kingdom had access to legal proper spray its a fact that less crime would happen, rape would be cut in half, even the elderly would love in peace more easier. I understand right now that it's considered a firearm. But in the eyes of a security expert it's a legitimate form of self defense.",
