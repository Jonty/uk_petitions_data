        "additional_details": "Alabama rot (CRGV) is a fatal condition in in 9 out of 10 dogs. The initial symptoms are skin lesions on the legs, chest and abdomen followed by renal involvement.\r\nThis information can be found on the Alabama Rot website and on your browser as this will bring up numerous cases which have been found throughout the country.  \r\nDylan's lesions started on his abdomen, he stopped eating (which was very unlike him as he loved his food) and was sleeping all of the time. \r\nHow many cases have gone unreported?  \r\nHow many areas are infected that we are unaware of? Vets are only morally obliged to report cases.\r\nCan this be called Dylan's Law if passed?",
        "background": "Dylan died with Alabama Rot & we have heard of other unconfirmed cases in other local areas. We were told Dylan's case didn't need to be reported as he had a trace of New Forest Syndrome (the same as Alabama Rot) & he died of Vasculitus (Alabama Rot caused the Kidney Failure).",
