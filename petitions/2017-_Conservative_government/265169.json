        "additional_details": "On average, University fees cost \u00a39,250 yearly (source = Reddin Survey of University Tuition). This doesn't include accommodation, which costs \u00a3125 per week, which means that the overall cost is around \u00a316,000 per year. This also doesn't include the cost of human essentials. Student Finance loans for living away from home only cover around \u00a39,000, leaving students \u00a37,000 in debt per year, and as the typical degree lasts 3 years, the total debt not covered by the student loan is \u00a321,000.",
        "background": "University fees simply cost too much money. It is increasingly becoming less affordable to go to University, making the entire ordeal less ideal, lowering the amount of people wishing to go further in education, which means less Scientists, Doctors and less skilful workers in our nation.",
