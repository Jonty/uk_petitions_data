But the developers came in started to build all around then they weren\u2019t close any more!\r\nWe must preserve the countryside for future generations as we know in a few years time it will be gone too much is disappearing before our eyes we must not let this happen!\r\n\r\nI am calling on the government to make change and build bridges with all the electorates and constituency to stop any more building!

Also our wildlife is disappearing and this is a issue close to my heart as I feel like many others that in a few years we won\u2019t have any land left or green.
