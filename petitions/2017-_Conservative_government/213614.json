        "additional_details": "Environmental Healrh do not have enough power to stop this practice due to an outdated NFU code of practice. The laws need changing to include this as a\r\nNoise nuisance. It effects shift workers, pets, sale of houses, mental health and every day life. Birds fly away, humans can\u2019t. Birds get used to it and go to where the sound is as they know there is food. \r\n\r\nThey need to be banned completely in residential areas. They cause untold misery for many.",
        "background": "Bird scarers are being used more frequently in residential areas by farmers. Their noise level is 165 dB, their frequency during the day is too often and they are disturbing people trying to live a normal life. Everyone has the right to a quiet life. This is antisocial behaviour which needs ending.",
