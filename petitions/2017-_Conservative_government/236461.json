        "action": "Bring science class size restrictions in England/Wales in line with Scotland/NI.",
        "additional_details": "Regulations do exist in Scotland, where no practical class\r\n(including science) may exceed 20 pupils [Schools\r\nCode, 1956]. Similarly, in Northern Ireland, Regulation 15 of\r\nthe Secondary Schools Regulations\r\n(Northern Ireland) 1973 No 403 requires that practical class\r\nsizes shall not exceed 20 where the pupils are under\r\ninstruction by one teacher. \r\nHowever, this only applies to technology classes in England and Wales, not science classes. Students do not get a fair deal from this inequality.",
        "background": "The importance of practical work in STEM subjects is at the forefront of the new GCSE and A-level reforms, but regrettably this is not currently supported by legislation to limit class sizes to 20, as is the case in Scotland/NI. In England and Wales science is not counted as a 'practical' subject.",
