        "additional_details": "Men are nearly twice as likely as women to suffer from IPF.\r\nThere are 5000 new cases of IPF every year in the UK.\r\n50% of IPF sufferers die within 3 years of diagnosis.\r\nMore than 30,000 people will be diagnosed with IPF in the EU each year.\r\nIPF is more common than all leukaemias combined. Treatment options for pulmonary fibrosis are limited as the disease is progressive. The prognosis is poor for pulmonary fibrosis. The survival (life expectancy) for most patients is less than 5 years.",
        "background": "Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which the lung tissue becomes thickened, stiff & scarred over a period of time. The lungs lose their ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream. As a result, the brain and other organs don\u2019t get the oxygen they need.",
