        "action": "Reduce preventable negligence cases within the NHS",
        "additional_details": "Over the last decade, negligence claims against the NHS have quadrupled to an annual payout of \u00a31.7 billion. This is set to double by 2021. This suggests a growing problem that isn't being dealt with effectively. Health leaders propose to address this issue by capping the amount of compensation that is paid out to victims. Yet this won't reduce the number of negligence cases. We need to invest more resources into identifying the root causes of the problem and in turn implementing a solution.",
        "background": "Thousands of patients are being let down by avoidable errors made by the NHS. Errors such as failing to provide emergency care, mistakes in dispensing the correct drugs and dosages, misdiagnosis, delays in treatment, and incorrect treatment. This is harming patients and causing unnecessary deaths.",
