        "additional_details": "As humans, we are transforming the natural landscapes so dramatically that as many as one million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction, posing a dire threat to ecosystems that people and animals all over the world rely on. If we don't slow the rate in which we are altering the natural world, at some point we will be compromised in terms of food, water and shelter. We are destroying the very ecosystems that support our society. We need to halt the destruction, and work towards making a more sustainable society.",
        "background": "Climate change is destroying our wildlife and putting people's homes and lives at risk, especially endangered species.  The Government needs to make climate action a priority across all parts of the government, end all support for fossil fuels and invest in the clean economy and renewables.",
