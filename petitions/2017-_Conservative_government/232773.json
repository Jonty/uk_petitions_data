        "action": "Introduce a Deposit Return system for plastic bottles in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Plastic pollution is an urgent issue. Plastic production is set to increase rapidly by 2025, and the amount of plastic that can be recycled is very low. Consumers want change, but alternative options are limited.\r\n\r\nDeposit schemes have been successful in other countries (e.g Germany, 97% are recycled), and the UK should follow the lead.",
        "background": "1 million bottles are purchased every second. Most are used for less than 30 mins. Less than half are recycled, and each takes 450 years to degrade, with increasing impacts on fossil fuels, the food chain and ecosystems. The UK should follow the lead from other countries.",
