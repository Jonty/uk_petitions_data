        "additional_details": "The war is nearly at an end, whether you support Assad or not is not as important as ending this war. \r\n\r\nGovernment forces are succeeding. Assad, with no doubt, has blood on his hands but the factions the they are fighting, such as ISIS and other militant factions are far from innocent. \r\n\r\nThey themselves have been guilty of chemical attacks too.\r\n\r\nAny strike against Assad will weaken their position and prolong this war and the suffering of innocent Syrian people. \r\n\r\nPlease Teresa May, step back.",
        "background": "We urge the Government not to get involved with the pending military action that is being threatened by the Trump administration in light of the recent, and most critically, unverified Chemical attacks on Douma.",
