It is therefore essential for England and Wales to harmonise and show a consistent approach to the disclosure demands upon the judiciary nationwide.\r\n \r\nThe current lack of judicial disclosure is undermining public confidence where it is in the public interest for the judiciary to be required under law to declare their interests in line with all other branches of the Executive.",
        "background": "The public expectation in 2019 is for transparency and accountability across all branches of Government.\r\n \r\nThe judiciary hold significant powers directly affecting all aspects of public life yet remain exempt from publishing their financial and other interests, unlike Members of Parliament.",
