        "additional_details": "Ideally all passengers should wear seat-belts in any vehicle. Why are buses different? The drivers are in front of a huge window that they would easily fly through on impact. Coach drivers and passengers are equipped with seat-belts, but local buses are not. Below are some links to show what happens when the driver does not wear a seat-belt.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44612842\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meIPoFQkdPs\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZk1rjjpu6M",
        "background": "The fact that bus drivers are able to drive buses that don't have seat-belts for their drivers is an outdated concept. It is based on the fact that buses don't reach high enough speeds to warrant it. Now a lot of routes contain duel carriageways and reach their top speed of 60 mph.",

The only exceptions to this requirement are taxi drivers and private hire vehicles. We're therefore not sure what further action you want the Government and Parliament to take. You can find out more here: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/176/regulation/6/made\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government and Parliament to change the law to require the drivers of private hire vehicles to wear seatbelts, if that's what you want to happen."
