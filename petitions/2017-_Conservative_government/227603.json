She was playing in the long grass when the two dogs saw movement and hunted her. The dogs were too strong and she couldn\u2019t be saved. \r\nWe need to fight to save all other dogs lives from dangerous dogs which are not correctly restrained. \r\nWe can\u2019t bring Emma or the other dogs who have lost their lives back but we can try and change the future. \r\n#EmmasLaw",
