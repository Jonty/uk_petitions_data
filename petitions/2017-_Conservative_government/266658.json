        "action": "Make targeted political advertising via social media illegal in the UK",
        "additional_details": "All voters should have access to the same information. By targeting messages at particular demographics, political organisations can conceal the true nature of their campaigns by ensuring each individual only sees the messages they want them to see. Campaigners avoid acknowledging any negative impact of their proposals by promising different outcomes to different voters. The irreconcilable promises made undermine faith in our political system as voters are inevitably disappointed and let down.",
        "background": "Targeted advertising via social media allows organisations to restrict certain messages to a particular demographic. When used for political campaigning this technique undermines democracy by allowing political organisations to get away with making conflicting and contradictory promises.",
