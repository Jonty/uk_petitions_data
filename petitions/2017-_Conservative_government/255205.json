        "additional_details": "The industry controlling private parking has seen an explosion in the level of fines over the past few years.  Typical \u201ccharges\u201d are \u00a3100 discounted to \u00a360 if paid within 14 days.  These are in many cases for such trifling offences as overstaying by just a few minutes or parking a few inches over a white line.\r\n\r\nThere is no way a parking company can justify a charge of \u00a3100 in any shape or form, my proposal is much more realistic and fair",

Parking tickets issued by private companies are claims of breach of contract by the car park owner. The enforcement of contracts is the responsibility of the courts, which are independent of the UK Government and Parliament. It would ultimately be for a court to decide whether the amount charged was unreasonable. \r\n\r\nYou can find more about how to appeal against a parking ticket here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/parking-tickets/appealing-parking-tickets/appealing-a-parking-ticket/"
