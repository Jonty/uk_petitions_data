        "additional_details": "Invite Tommy Robinson to the Donald Trump visit to represent the British people and their point of view and make time for an online interview. There is no proof to the mainstream claims that he is either right wing or racist, in reality he just represents common sense. This petition is neither offensive or extremist, merely and expression of wishing to be heard which is the right of all citizens. We have a right to be heard.",
        "background": "Tommy Robinson represents millions of the British people as shown by his social media followers and has far of a mandate to represent their views than most politicians.",
