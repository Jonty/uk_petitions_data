This is currently unavailable on the NHS potentially leaving 1000\u2019s of sexual active men pre surgery impotent post surgery because their nerves have been taken just in case. https://www.gregshawurology.com/neurosafe",
        "background": "One in 8 men get prostate cancer at some point in their life. Often thought an older mans cancer and you can\u2019t die from it. Wrong ! Prostrate cancer can affect men at any age and though surgery can cure the cancer it can leave men with impotence and incontinence. The neuroSAFE technique can help.",
