        "additional_details": "As the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, stated: \"Julian Assange is not being pursued to protect US national security. He is being pursued because he has exposed wrongdoing by US administrations.\" The extradition will serve as a mockery to the failing notion of free speech and free press. The UK has already ignored the UN's findings that Assange is entitled to release from detention and compensation. Will the UK government ignore the UN Human Rights experts condemning the extradition?",
        "background": "Allow Julian Assange to serve his sentence for breaching bail without fear of unlawful extradition to the US, where the UK cannot be certain he will be free from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment due to the publishing of damning materials under freedom of press and speech.",
