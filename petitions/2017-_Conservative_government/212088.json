        "additional_details": "Many are still aware that this help will be turned into a loan in 10 weeks and help will stop. Out of over 100k people less than half have taken the offer up. The government has said that to help us people on SMI it has become unsustainable, but they are still paying rent for those in private rented places which effectively is the landlords mortgage! How is that fair? Please help me get this debated in the house of commons and at least put on hold!",
        "background": "I've received help from SMI -mortgage support since falling on hard times whilst this has never fully covered my mortgage I have always had to find the most substantial amount of it, but the little help I do get makes that difference. Now, the government are turning this into a loan.",
