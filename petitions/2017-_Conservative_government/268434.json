        "additional_details": "The Amazon rainforest in Brazil is being cut down so fast that it is approaching a \"tipping point\" from which it will not recover, according to the Guardian. Scientists warn that the forest is in growing danger of degrading into a savannah, after which its capacity to absorb carbon will be severely diminished. Bolsonaro has called his own government's satellite data lies and says he is fulfilling a mission from God.",
        "background": "Under Bolsonaro, the rate of destruction of the Amazon Rainforest has increased by 88%. The biggest source of biodiversity and home to indigenous people, the forest also produces oxygen and is a vast carbon sink. Losing it will massively speed up climate change, threatening life on earth.",
