        "additional_details": "If your pickup exceeds a unladen weight of 2048 kilos it has speed restrictions on certain roads which is rubbish as most modern cars such as range rovers weight sometimes over 3 tonne, just because a vehicle is deemed commercial doesn\u2019t mean it should be restricted, personal use commercial vehicles not being used for business shouldn\u2019t be subjected to this law, as new pick ups have better safety equipment than when this law was written,",
        "background": "Vehicles such as Dual Cab pickups are still subjected to commercial speed restrictions on certain roads due to their curb weight even thou they are someone\u2019s personal vehicle and not used for commercial use, remove these restrictions for personal use vehicles,",
