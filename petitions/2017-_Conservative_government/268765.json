There are laws already but no prosecutions. Giving false assurances for financial gain, public office, it was called deception and is now covered by the Fraud umbrella. the voters need a route where if their MP states they have changed their mind the voters should also be allowed to change their vote",
        "background": "Many MPs gave assurance and once elected either refused to honour their assurances or devised a route where they could betray their constituents. We need the electoral law changed so the voters are represented fairly and honestly",
