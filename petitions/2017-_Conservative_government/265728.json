Frequently misdiagnosed as less than 22% of medics know it (*based on a recent poll carried out by M4RD). The body lacks enzymes to digest sugar or starch, it is a condition for life that the patient will NEVER grow out of. Its symptoms include: vomiting, diarrhoea, extreme bloating, burns on bottom, exhaustion, failure to thrive. INVERTASE is LIFE CHANGING and means the patient can lead a more normal life.",
        "background": "INVERTASE is just a food grade yeast. It costs \u00a360 to produce. It is sold to the NHS for between \u00a3280 and \u00a3500 per 60ml bottle (smaller than a teaspoon). No research into the medecine or the condition it treats (CSID) is carried out to justify this profit.",
