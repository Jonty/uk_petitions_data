        "additional_details": "The government was wrong to offer \u00a320 billion as a Brexit \u201cdivorce bill\u201d.  We should not pay for free trade.  No further money should be added to the offer.  The existing \u00a320 billion on the table should either be withdrawn, or at least be made explicitly contingent on a free-trade deal.  Rather than having Brussels require us \u201cto make sufficient progress on the divorce bill\u201d before trade talks, we should demand that Brussels make sufficient progress on the free trade deal before we pay a penny.",
        "background": "The government has offered the EU \u00a320 bn as a \"divorce settlement\", although it has no legal obligation to do so. It is reportedly planning to offer a further \u00a320 bn, despite getting no concessions from the EU.  Brussels has said that the payments cannot be conditional on a satisfactory FTA.",
