        "background": "The UK goverment has just taken the ill informed decision to extend the Badger Cull even though many reports have shown the ineffectiveness of such a cruel kill reducing the incidence of bovine TB amongst herds.\r\n\r\nA cull of badgers is insane. Many species are capable of carrying Bovine TB.",
