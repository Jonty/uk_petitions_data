        "additional_details": "People on benefits or financial support receive prescriptions for free, however working people have to pay \u00a39.00 for a prescription and that\u2019s for each time they become ill. Health will deteriorate if prescription prices aren\u2019t dropped or removed. Some people can\u2019t afford to keep paying for medication and sometimes it\u2019s for a matter of urgency. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not have to pay for there\u2019s. So why should we in England? NHS comes free healthcare but is it? Remove the prices.",
        "background": "People work very hard, sometimes too hard and become ill very quickly, with the rise of stomach bugs and flues, and other severe illnesses, it\u2019s only fair that People in England shouldn\u2019t have to pay for Prescriptions to be able to treat themselves. As prices keep rising! Health will deteriorate.",
