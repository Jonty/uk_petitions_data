        "additional_details": "An example of how this can disadvantage a pupil is that the foundation-higher crossover questions on the Edexcel papers equated to 70 marks in June 2017. This means a student on the higher paper could've answered these ONLY and dropped two marks in the process to receive a grade 5, whereas a foundation pupil could have gained full marks on these and all their other questions and only obtained a 5.\r\n\r\nI must highlight that papers do not need to be more difficult as a result, only that students more capable than others should be recognised accordingly and not left at the peril of the school's choice of foundation or higher.",
        "background": "The June 2017 9-1 GCSE Maths Foundation papers from Edexcel, AQA and OCR have grade 5 boundaries of 66%, 66%, and 58%. The November 2017 papers were 60%, 65%, and 50%. Given the difference from grade 5 to full marks, it is a lack of recognition of pupils who gain higher marks, ie. a grade 6.",
