        "action": "Recognise the independence of Catalonia. For freedom and democracy",
        "additional_details": "The United Nations recognise the right for self determination to a group of people who have their own language,tradition and decide to democratically vote. The independence of the rich Catalonia would also be useful for the UK as it would be another important European region that leaves the EU. A weak EU will be useful to the UK for the Brexit negotiations. The less solid and stable the EU is, the better for the UK on Brexit negotiations. The Pound would also benefit from the first Euro break up",
        "background": "The people of Catalonia have voted with a landslide majority for independence. Despite the brutal violence by the paramilitary Guardia Civil they stood up and went for their right to have their freedom. They can't be left alone, oppression and violence in Europe is unacceptable in the year 2017",
