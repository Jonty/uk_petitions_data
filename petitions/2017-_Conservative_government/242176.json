Reports of MPs continuing to abuse The Expenses System continues to erode Public trust in MPs. Abolishing Expenses in exchange for a Salary Increase as has happened in other Professions, would prevent abuse.",
        "background": "An Expenses system allowing for claims of up to three times an already good Salary is open to abuse. It is incredibly difficult for the Public to understand how expenses of up to \u00a3200,000.00 or more can be justified, when the Salary albeit a good one, is a third of that figure at around \u00a377,000.00.",
