        "action": "Make it a legal requirement that all unpaid carers receive appropriate training",
        "additional_details": "Local authorities are charged with supporting unpaid carers under the care act. Local authorities already ensure regular routine training and support packages to other carers, I.E. foster carers, with a dedicated support team which is made available 24/7. Local authorities should be legally bound to manage, support, provide and ensure ongoing training for unpaid carers. Without certified training, unpaid carers are being left vulnerable, unprotected and isolated.",
        "background": "Adult unpaid carers save the UK economy billions of pounds each year and despite being under supported, carers are delivering cost effective day to day invaluable care and support which for most carers becomes a full time job. Carers should have a legal right to receive appropriate ongoing training",
