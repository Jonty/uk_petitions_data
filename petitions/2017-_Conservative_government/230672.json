Local authorities already ensure regular routine training and support packages to other carers, I.E. foster carers, with a dedicated support team which is made available 24/7. Local authorities should be legally bound to manage, support, provide and ensure ongoing training for unpaid carers. Without certified training, unpaid carers are being left vulnerable, unprotected and isolated.",
