        "action": "Remove the verbal option from Food Information Regulations on Allergens.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, it is considered acceptable for food businesses to provide allergen information verbally, however, with the high staff turnover for which the hospitality industry is renowned, this is not adequate, safe, reliable, or practical. \r\nIt is much more practical to provide written documents with full ingredients lists, to use standardised recipes, and have staff trained on accredited courses. In a court of law, a business must 'prove due diligence', this, surely, cannot be achieved verbally.",
        "background": "With so many people now suffering food allergies and other food related conditions, it is not acceptable for anyone to rely on word of mouth about the ingredients used.\r\nIt is not possible for staff to remember every ingredient in a dish, and there needs to be documentation to prove due diligence.",
