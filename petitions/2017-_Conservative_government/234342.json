        "additional_details": "Packs of hounds, dogs used in sport (what sports I dare not imagine) and dogs used to catch vermin are among the dogs excluded from this law, which is clearly there to serve the landed gentry and aid prosecution if a dog does damage. Other laws are there to quite rightly aid prosecution in such cases. This 1992 Order needs to be updated make it easier for owners to be reunited with their lost dogs. As it stands at the moment, it makes this that much harder.",
        "background": "People are compelled by the 1992 Order to put their address on their dog's name tag. This outdated law fails to acknowledge both mobile phones and microchippng, law since 2016. A mobile number is a far more effective way of reuniting a lost dog with its owner.",
