The SLC has a monopoly and graduates have no choice but use them.\r\nFrom September 2017, the interest added each month to the average loan will be \u00a3223 and as most starting graduates earn \u00a325000 they only pay back \u00a330 per month (9% of income over \u00a321000) so the debt grows each month by \u00a3193 !\r\n Students will vote to change this system, as more  graduate,they will become a powerful voice demand action.",
