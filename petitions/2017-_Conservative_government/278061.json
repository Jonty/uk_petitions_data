        "additional_details": "The reason we are lacking staff in the NHS and teachers in schools is because not many people are applying for university courses. Why? Because it is a lot of money which us students feel we cannot pay off. In 2012 there were 14,965 students who attended Brunel University, now in 2019 there has been a drop in that number. It is not fair that we have to pay so much to finish our education. Please half it so that it is at least possible to pay off.",
        "background": "Going to university is very expensive and it is the cost which puts people off going! How do you expect the less privileged people to go to university? What about those who come from poor backgrounds and want to make a change in their family? It's simply not fair and doesn't give everyone a chance.",
