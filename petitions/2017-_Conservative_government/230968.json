        "additional_details": "There should be specific exemptions for single parents to claim child benefit when they earn between \u00a350,000 and \u00a399,998 so that they receive the same treatment for child benefit as a couple that are claiming. \r\nIf both scenarios have a household income of \u00a380,000, why should 1 household miss out just because the parent is single?",
        "background": "Currently, if a couple both earn 45k and so a combined income of 90k, they can claim child benefit with no tax impact. However, if a single parent earns 55k, they will have 50% of their child benefit taken in tax. Even though the couple have an extra 35k coming into the household.",
