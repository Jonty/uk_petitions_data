        "additional_details": "People should not be allowed to sell goods or services door-to-door without an invitation. We need to ban cold calling to protect the elderly and vulnerable by cutting off access for the cruel people that use this as a means of access. Most people now will go online to source builders, windows etc and look for reviews of companies. We do not need people knocking on our homes leaving some scared and open to being subjecting to robberies, fraud and being harmed.",
        "background": "A neighbour was brutally attacked and murdered in her own home after answering the door to her assailant. It\u2019s common knowledge that conmen use cold calling to steal from vulnerable people and gain access to homes often leading to devastating consequences.",
