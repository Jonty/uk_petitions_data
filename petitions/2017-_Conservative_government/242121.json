        "additional_details": "The Human Rights Act and Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights provide the right to have religious belief and to freely practice beliefs. Currently, individuals are not free to legally possess or use cannabis for religious purposes despite supposedly having a right to practice religious beliefs. Members of religions where use of cannabis is permitted, such as Rastafari, are not allowed to use cannabis to practice religious beliefs and the law should be changed to allow this.",
        "background": "The possession and use of cannabis for religious purposes remains a criminal act. Those who use cannabis for religious purposes are currently denied the right to legally practice religious beliefs. The government must respect human rights laws and legalise the use of cannabis for religious purposes.",
