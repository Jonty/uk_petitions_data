Where are the rights for the victims or vulnerable adults that need protection? \r\nSomebody needs to be their advocate, the law needs to be changed to allow this to happen.\r\nThe message from social services is unless something is done directly to the vulnerable adult, their hands are tied. Why should it have to take something happen for them to act. Lets give them the protection they need and fully deserve.",
