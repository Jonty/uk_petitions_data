        "additional_details": "British Citizenship costs almost two  thousand pounds per person including each child making it a huge challenge for families. To show that Britain still welcomes the EU citizens settled in the UK the government must provide a free of charge option to convert settled status to full British Citizenship without further cost or bureaucratic hurdles.",
        "background": "Brexit has brought a permanent threat to the lives of over three million EU citizens in the UK. Only British Citizenship can help all those affected for whom the UK is their one and only home. \r\nThose qualified for settled status should be able to get British Citizenship without further cost.",
