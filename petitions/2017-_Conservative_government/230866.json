It is estimated that 100,000 birds are shot every day in the UK during the shooting season. the 'shooting season' goes on for 4 months. They often survive being shot and are only killed by having their necks broken or being hit over the head, if the shot has been missed. we need to put a stop to this and ban it COMPLETELY.\r\nEnough is enough and we need this to be banned.",
