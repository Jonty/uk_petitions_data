Taken away in July 2017 saying he's fit and healthy.  An Illnesses with no cure but according to the assessor he's ok. They're not medically trained or specialists in his illnesses but they over ride the doctors opinions and diagnosis. We want to prevent this from happening. We are Living/surviving with these illnesses that can't be cured.",
        "background": "People with invisible illnesses i.e.: Addison's disease, diabetes, Crohn's disease, cancer and many more . They have the same assessments as non able bodied people. This is unfair and unjust. The assessors have no knowledge of their illnesses and they override the doctors diagnosis and reports.",
