        "action": "Change the law to make it illegal to use fox cage traps in an urban area.",
        "additional_details": "Foxes can live in harmony in an urban area. Living next to a business that has recently admitted to legally capturing foxes and releasing them nearby, potentially leaving Cubs to perish. Local cats could also get trapped at any time. This distressed many people on a Facebook post, clearly the current law does not address animal welfare needs or society's current view on trapping foxes, alternative deterrent methods could be used avoiding moving foxes from their environment to protect income.",
        "background": "Foxes are being caught in cage traps in a built up residential area where many cats roam free, clearly creating a welfare issue of any animals caught in the trap. It seems the law is morally outdated and needs to be amended to make it illegal to use this kind of device commercially.",
