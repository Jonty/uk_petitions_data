We would also have some thought given to us before shutting roads for 6 weeks.",
        "background": "Hawkhurst and the surrounding villages are suffering a massive hike in the amount of criminal offences because of the lack of police \r\npresence and response times of minimum 40 mins which is just easy for criminals and too long for victims",
