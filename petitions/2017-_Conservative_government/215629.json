        "additional_details": "Please refer to the articles resulting from the excellent investigative journalism of Carole Cadwalladr and others, who have worked tirelessly over the past 21 months to uncover the truth about Cambridge Analytica, despite death threats and other menaces, as well as the recent expos\u00e9 by Channel 4 News.\r\n\r\nWe must root out cynical, nefarious forces that seek to undermine our democracy and sow division in our country, and verify Brexit really is the \"will of the people\" before proceeding with it.",
        "background": "Recent revelations about covert/corrupt practices by Cambridge Analytica in public votes call into question the integrity of the 2016 Brexit Referendum. Please hold a referendum on the Brexit deal (with option to remain) in good time before 29 March 2019 to be able to revoke Article 50 if necessary.",
