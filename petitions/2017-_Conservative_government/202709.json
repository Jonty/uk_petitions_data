        "additional_details": "For those who do not watch channels such as BBC, S4C. They shouldn\u2019t be made to pay for a TV license. I think the providers should encrypt these channels with a subscription based service and viewers should be given the option to watch BBC channels and other channels that require a license and only pay for a TV license once you have access to these specific channels. If you choose not to watch Channels that a license is required for, Then you shouldn\u2019t have too pay for a TV license.",
        "background": "Providers like Sky, Virgin, EE. All have the power to encrypt they\u2019re channels with a subscription based service so that you have the choice to purchase the Channel or services before watching them, This option should be able to include BBC channels & other channels that a license is required for.",
