        "additional_details": "As a current university student I experience this first hand. Many people pay upwards of \u00a36000 for accommodation which therefore means their loan simply does not cover it. This also leaves other costs of living such as food and transport uncovered too.  Some people may not have the financial support of their family which may prevent them from going to university all together. If the government increased the minimum a student loan can be, students would not be placed in this postition.",
        "background": "Currently student loans depend on your household income and personal circumstances so it means that if your household income is over a certain threshold you'll receive the minimum loan payment of \u00a34168 (for the academic year 19/20). In many cases this is simply not enough to even cover accommodation",
