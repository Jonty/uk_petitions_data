        "additional_details": "It would be simple to legislate to require delivery companies to keep a log of:\r\n\r\na) Origin Company\r\nb) Delivery Postcode\r\nc) Declared value of item\r\nd) Unique Shipping ID\r\n\r\nIssue each company with an annual tax bill based on a fair percentage of the total value of all items delivered in the UK.\r\n\r\nFailure to declare adequate value of a package would invalidate its insurance.\r\n\r\nSpot checks would be simple - make occasional test orders to random addresses.  Incorrect declarations would be fined harshly.",
        "background": "Big companies like Amazon, with turnovers in the UK in the billions, get away with paying next to no corporation tax.  Introduce a Delivery Sales Tax, based on the postcode being delivered to.  Claw back this money which is currently flowing overseas.  We could do this by monitoring at the courier.",
