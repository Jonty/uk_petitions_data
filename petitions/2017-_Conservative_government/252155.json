Not according to one leading expert: https://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-03/uks-top-child-protection-officer-says-online-sex-offenders-can-be-rehabilitated-instead-of-jailed/\r\n\"There are half a million offenders in the UK viewing & downloading images of child abuse, the NSPCC says. And police are arresting 420 offenders a month, according to Cheif Cons Bailey.\"",

At present a SO given a sentence of 30 months or less only has to stay on it for 5/10 years. We want to see this sentence requirement reducing to 12 months or less.",
