The children were travelling on a bus that was hit at a market in Dahyan, in the northern province of Saada. The health ministry run by the rebel Houthi movement put the death toll at 43, and said 61 people were wounded. The coalition, which is backing Yemen's government in a war with the Houthis, said its actions were \"legitimate\".",
