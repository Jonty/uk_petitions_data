        "additional_details": "In 2015, at the age of 15, Shamima Begum travelled to Syria and joined IS. She lived willingly under IS and married an IS member. She is now pregnant and requesting to return to the UK. She has publicly stated she doesn\u2019t regret joining IS - she claims she never saw any executions, but did find a beheaded head in a bin and wasn\u2019t \u2018fazed\u2019. She is in no way remorseful for leaving the safe UK to join the terrorist organisation. Now she wants back in but poses a serious potential threat to the UK.",
        "background": "Shamima Begum has now requested to return to the UK after leaving the UK to travel to Syria to join IS. \r\nDon\u2019t let the fact that she is pregnant draw her sympathy - she is a threat due to her links. The Justice Secretary has said that she cannot be made \u2018stateless\u2019. Yes she can and she should.",
