If our children and the next generation can be educated to realise we or anyone is not alone, we can fight this. We can try to help every individual fighting mental health issues to realise they are not alone. Let\u2019s supprt each other!",

We feel we can\u2019t turn to anyone. I think if there is early education we can beat the stigma and help young people going forward. Fight together.",
