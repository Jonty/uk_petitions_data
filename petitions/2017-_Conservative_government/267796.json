        "action": "Suspend Parliaments summer recess until a deal with the European Union is agreed",
        "additional_details": "The deadline set by the Government and the EU to finalize Brexit is the 31st of October. Time is running out to sort out what is happening with Brexit. Parliaments recess is 40 days long. The longer we leave agreeing to a deal, the more of a possibility a no-deal Brexit becomes, something the country is unprepared for. Parliaments recess could instead be used to; make a deal with the EU, hold a general election, extended the Brexit deadline or to agree to hold a 2nd referendum",
        "background": "Parliament enters recess on the 25th July and does not return to session until the 3rd September. This leaves just 58 days for a course of action to be agreed on regarding Brexit. Parliaments summer recess should be cancelled to give more time to reach a conclusion regarding Brexit",
