        "action": "Force UK rail firms to offer Mon-Friday season tickets, to reduce ticket costs.",
        "additional_details": "The RPI formula means rail ticket prices regularly go up faster than UK wage growth. The year-on-year increase in rail ticket prices is also outstripping many nations in the EU, making rail travel in the UK some of the most expensive in Europe. Unreliability and overcrowding aside, allowing customers to exclude weekend travel could pass on savings, whilst creating fairness and flexibility to customers too.",
        "background": "Weekly/Monthly/Yearly rail season ticket prices are expensive and inflexible, with season ticket pricing including weekend travel. Weekend travel isn't essential for all. We ask that the government force rail firms to offer season tickets which exclude weekends and reducing the prices for them.",
