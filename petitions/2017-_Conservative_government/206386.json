However, the council says no decision has been made.\r\n\r\nThe libraries which could become community-run, or close, include Danesholme, Earls Barton, Wollaston, Abington and St James.\u2019\r\n\r\nSource: BBC News",

This would mean that vital services would be taken from vulnerable people and communities would lose a valuable resource.",
