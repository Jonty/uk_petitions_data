        "action": "Change employment law so that jobs cannot be described as full or part time",
        "additional_details": "Less than 10% of all jobs in the UK are advertised as open to any kind of flexibility. And yet most companies are actually set up to offer a range of flexible options. With the gig economy and technology supporting flexible working, the UK could actually be a world leader in flexible working but 90% of qualified candidates don't ever get to have the conversation with an employer because jobs are classified as Full time. The change would open a dialogue and lead to more employment.",
        "background": "Currently employers advertise roles as full or part-time. Therefore automatically millions of potentially qualified people are excluded from applying. Removing this would mean applicants were selected for interview based on ability not availability in the first instance.",
