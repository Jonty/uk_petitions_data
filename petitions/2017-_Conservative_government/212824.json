        "action": "Compensate students for the strike - deadlines changed and tuition fee refunds",
        "additional_details": "Due to the 4 week strike, students should be able to claim a refund on their tuition fees. All deadlines affected by the strike should be moved and all marks should be lenient as course material will be highly affected. Dissertation deadlines should be moved to later in the year in order to compensate for the lack of communication while staff are striking. Although it is understandable that this strike must go ahead, it is highly affecting university students. Please make a difference.",
        "background": "University staff are set to strike over pensions for the next 4 weeks, the busiest and most stressful time of the year. It is unfair on many students with looming deadlines including dissertation deadlines. It is a lot of contact time to be losing and students should be compensated for this.",
