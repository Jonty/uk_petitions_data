        "action": "Expand driving penalties to include the charge vehicular manslaughter",
        "additional_details": "Although courts now have to power to sentence those who cause death by dangerous driving to 14 years to life, this penalty is rarely, if ever used. I feel that if the charge included the term manslaughter, not only would the perception of motorists change, but judges would be more inclined to sentence those who have caused death or life changing injuries, whilst driving at excessive speed, whilst using a mobile device, under the influence of drink/drugs to an appropriate custodial sentence.",
        "background": "I think that the increase in dangerous, reckless and careless driving needs to be properly addressed. In the wrong hands a car is as lethal as a loaded gun. Death should be charged as vehicular manslaughter and life changing injuries as attempted vehicular manslaughter.",
