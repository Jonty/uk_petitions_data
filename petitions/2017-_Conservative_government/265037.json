        "additional_details": "We call for a change in the current way that local recycling schemes is dealt with and the confusion it causes. Currently, different areas have different rules about what they do and don't recycle, and this causes real confusion. \r\n\r\nRecent TV programmes have revealed that a large proportion of the public are confused about what they can and can't recycle, especially when the packaging tells them to check what is allowed locally. If all areas and councils followed the same recycling rules, there would be much less chance of large amounts of perfectly good recycling being wasted because of one wrong item being included.",
        "background": "We call for an immediate change to the current recycling procedures. We support all local councils taking a consistent approach and set of rules across the UK. This will make recycling easier and make sure that everyone can recycle correctly across the UK and so reduce waste.",
