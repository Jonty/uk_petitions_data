Money makes the world go round!\r\n \r\nFire the firm IF you can get a enough leaseholders, and money. Hope the next ones better!\r\n \r\nFormal complaint, court or a tribunal. All require significant time, courts/tribunals require money. Neither likely to succeed since proving wrong without any regulations to define \u201cwrong\u201d is near impossible against their lawyer armies. Also, all formal proceedings are public, potentially devaluing your property.",

Without regulation, it is near impossible for leaseholders to resolve cases where the charge is excessive for the service level. Regulation is desperately needed.",
