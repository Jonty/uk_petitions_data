        "additional_details": "My late mother was diagnosed with cancer last year and sadly lost her fight but the use of the oil reduced her seizures dramatically & made her final days more comfortable and less stressful. A last resort and we as a family saw the benefits first hand. All I ask is you ask yourselves what would you do if you had months to live and there was nothing that could be to save you?? ITS TIME TO CHANGE and I will fight to get cannabis legalised in the medical profession. Please help me fight for this.",

A natural plant with huge medical benefits and proven to work as research In Other countries prove. STOP THE COVER UP NOW!",
