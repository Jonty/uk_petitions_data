        "action": "Legalise the permanent removal of front number plates.",
        "additional_details": "The ability to permanently remove the front number plate could also reduce the risk of number plate theft by criminals as there are less possibilities. People say that it gives more opportunities for crime to be committed using the car but if the police never chase from the front so their DVLA scanners would still be able to correctly operate. The issue of speed cameras could be resolved by simply making them double sided so that they can capture criminals from both sides of the road.",
        "background": "As an avid car modifier and petrolhead, I and most people know find that the front number plates on our vehicles can really stand out more than we want and slightly ruin the look and aesthetic of the vehicle.",
