        "additional_details": "We all have seen the rise of inequality in our socieities all around the world. Homelessness has risen sharply while at the same time so has large corporations owned by tax dodging billionaires.\r\n\r\nThere has been plenty of stories shared via social media of shops & supermarket staff refusing to give homeless people food because it is their policy not to.\r\n\r\nInstead they chose to throw away or destroy this food. Food wastage as a time when so many are going hungry should be a crime.",
        "background": "France recently passed a law banning supermarkets from throwing away or destroying unsold food, forcing them instead to donate it to charities and food banks.\r\n\r\nWe believe the UK government needs to consider changing our laws around this issue also.",
