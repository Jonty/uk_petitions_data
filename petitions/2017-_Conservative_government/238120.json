        "additional_details": "For anyone that is unaware about this topic, 16-year-olds can legally ride 50cc Scooters/Mopeds which are limited to around 30mph, but when he/she reaches 17, they can legally ride 125cc which can usually reach around 60mph. Myself and many others believe that 16-year-olds should be allowed to ride 125cc mopeds to help the issues I stated before",
        "background": "Allowing 16-year-olds to ride 125cc Mopeds would improve lots of areas, firstly, it would reduce traffic on 40mph roads as most 50cc mopeds are limited to 30mph, secondly, it would decrease the amount of tailgating to riders of 50cc mopeds which is dangerous and could cause accidents",
