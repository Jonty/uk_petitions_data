However, the court decided that the council had no duty of care so they wouldn\u2019t listen to all the evidence. Please sign this petition for future cases. If councils had a legal duty of care towards those on their housing waiting lists ALL of the evidence in this and similar cases would be heard and not decided before!

Lee then passed away at my home from catching influenza when he should have been isolated from the public. I was suing my council but lost as we could not have our case heard.",
