        "additional_details": "While the government have given a green light to a deposit scheme, this only lends support to the companies producing these bottles, allowing them to continue produduction. It doesn't solve the problem.\r\n\r\nApproximately 13 billion plastic bottles are used each year in the UK. Only around 56% are recycled, meaning 44% go to landfill.\r\n\r\nPlastic can take up to 500 years to decompose.\r\n\r\nWe need to end production of new plastics now and change our culture towards drinks.",
        "background": "The UK currently consumes millions of plastic bottled drinks on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nThe after-effects of this are clear to see, in our countryside and towns. \r\n\r\nWe propose a full ban on new plastic bottles below the size of 1ltr, to drastically ease plastic production and save our environment.",
