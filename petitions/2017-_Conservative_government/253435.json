        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister's deal has been rejected. No further deal is available from the EU. Remaining in the EU is not an option. Extension or revocation of Article 50 is not an option. I believe the British people voted to leave with no mention of a deal and that WTO rules, to which Britain will now default on 12th April 2019, are in Britain's best interests. We may get a better deal after, but not until, we have left.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister should advise Her Majesty the Queen to prorogue Parliament suspending the current parliamentary session until 15th April 2019 to prevent any attempts by parliamentarians to thwart Brexit on 12th April 2019. Preparations for no-deal/WTO will continue.",
