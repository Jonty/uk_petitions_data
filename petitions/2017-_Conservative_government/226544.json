        "additional_details": "What I am describing does not make a good Escort Operator but does bring a more safety conscious driver to the mind of the motoring public therefore safety becomes more paramount. If you like, wearing a uniform describes our profession at a glance. \r\nThere are many of us who adhere to this practice including the equipment we should be carrying for emergency or breakdown and can be found on social media where we share some experiences.",
        "background": "I would like the Highways Agency Code of Practice for Escort Vehicles markings and lighting made mandatory.\r\nI am increasingly observing so called Escort Vehicles without adequate safety warning markings front or rear including width of vehicle lighting.\r\nI doubt they are fully insured or equipped.",
