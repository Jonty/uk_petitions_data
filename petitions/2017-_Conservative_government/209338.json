        "additional_details": "Many local Rugby independents and shoppers are dismayed at WCC decision to increase the already high rates for off street parking. Sales have already shown a decrease in shops within the town centre. We have noticed that comments on social media platforms are angry and dismayed, especially after reading this article \u2018 https://trib.al/0cQS2r1\u2018. \r\n\r\nWe feel that as businesses owners we are not getting the support from WCC and RBC and more support is shown for Elliotts Field.",
        "background": "As of Tuesday 9th january WCC responsible for off-street parking in Rugby, agreed to increase charges by 10%. We have already seen a decline in footfall and trade which had already started to affect businesses by this increase. Please sign this petition to help support local independents survive",
