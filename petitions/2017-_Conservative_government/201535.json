Without in-depth evaluation of NHS 111 the new service will offer little improvement to patients.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to commission an independent body to evaluate NHS111 including analysis of calls and decision support software. Evidence and methods for such an evaluation are here:\r\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614008107 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/11/e003451.short",
        "background": "Research strongly suggests that:\r\n1) Non-clinicians using computer software to manage calls to NHS111 may compromise patient safety.\r\n2) Computer software used by NHS111 may lead to too many people being referred across to the 999 service with a consequent ambulance call out and attendance at A&E.",
