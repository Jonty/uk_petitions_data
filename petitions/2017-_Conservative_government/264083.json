(This may vary) This price does not include taking a patient to hospital, however. \r\n\r\nEvery year, Thousands of calls are made to emergency services across the UK in an attempt to waste precious time and resources by faking a life-threatening situation in order for the services to arrive. This will usually mean real emergency situations are put on standby and may have to wait up to an hour longer. As you already know, this is horrible.",

Many of these hoax callers go unpunished and without discipline meaning they will have no problem doing it again.",
