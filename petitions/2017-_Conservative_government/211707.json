        "additional_details": "There are numerous examples of neighboring countries which have made their education either free or extremely cheap compared to the UK. For example, in Germany the fees for undergraduate students have been abolished and are free for anybody who is an EU citizen. However, if you are a non-EU citizen, the fees are still only \u00a31,256 (approx. 7 times less). Another case is Netherlands, where the university fees are around \u00a31764 (approx. 5 times less).",
        "background": "The fees of the modern university education system has prevented those who are intellectually capable from justifying their talent. Education should be made available for our people, regardless of the financial capabilities of the people. Our journey requires as much support from you as possible.",
