        "additional_details": "6/8/2018 I was told mum had only days left to live, but I was told I couldn\u2019t have compassionate leave as I was not entitled to any and would have to phone in sick. \r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s disrespectful not to be given compassionate leave for a dying relative, my mum passed that week. And basically lost two weeks wages. I think this is wrong for anyone to go through.\r\n\r\nUnlimited compassionate leave for those with terminally ill relatives, would solve this issue for a lot of people.",
        "background": "My mother at the beginning of 2018 became seriously ill, and was admitted to hospital. Work was very good about it and gave me compassionate leave so I could go and see her",
