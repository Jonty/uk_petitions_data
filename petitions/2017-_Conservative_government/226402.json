        "additional_details": "In January, polling showed that 87 percent would like to see the UK remain in the single market, and 78 percent want a referendum on the final deal. \r\nNobody during the referendum campaign knew or explained what the Leave vote meant. \r\nThe Leave campaign lied to the country on a scale never seen before in a modern UK poll, promises about Brexit were made which can never be met.\r\nClaims, deceptive and disingenuous information were made about the EU that was and is demonstrably wrong \u2013 the Leave campaign acted dishonestly.\r\nThe Electoral Commission alleges a 'common plan' between different Leave campaigns broke rules",
        "background": "By refusing to hold another referendum the government is not acting in the best interests of the people of the United Kingdom. \r\nThe refusal to hold another referendum is un-democratic. \r\nThe last referendum was purely party political and the refusal to hold another is the same",
