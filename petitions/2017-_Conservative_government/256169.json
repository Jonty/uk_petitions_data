        "action": "Initiate a public inquiry into irregularities related to the 2016 referendum",
        "additional_details": "This petition asserts the will of the people to initiate a public inquiry into the 2016 Referendum in order to establish the extent and nature of any illegal activity, and to identify specific actors to be held to account and, where grounds to bring criminal charges exist, prosecuted for activities such as fraud, malfeasance or misconduct in public office. The UK's democratic and political processes must not only be beyond reproach, but must also be seen to be so, before exiting EU can continue.",
        "background": "It is widely known that the 2016 non-binding referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union was tainted with various irregularities, not least those related to funding. The public is increasingly concerned that serious breaches and dubious funding sources remain uninvestigated.",
