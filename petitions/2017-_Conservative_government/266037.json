Trump has scrapped the deal which was meant to prevent the development of nuclear weapons there, has imposed sanctions aimed at destroying the Iranian oil trade\r\n\r\nIn this he is being encouraged by his national security advisor, John Bolton, an architect of the Iraq war and a man committed to military solutions. Speculation that 120,00 US troops are being deployed to the Middle East to confront Iran is worrying.",
