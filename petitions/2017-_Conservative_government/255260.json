It also sets a very dangerous precedent because any similar characters from Romania will be using this and it will open the door to every criminal who will want to come here if they know they can just walk free. It\u2019s absolutely outrageous.\u2019\r\n\r\nPreda is the latest in a string of Romanian criminals exploiting a legal loophole to head to the UK before using human rights laws to prevent themselves",
