        "action": "Allow dogs and cats to travel on Eurostar in a designated carriage",
        "additional_details": "We are campaigning for pets to be allowed on Eurostar in a designated carriage. Eurostar\u2019s policy forbids pets on their trains with the exception of guide dogs. Trains allow pets either side of the Channel and by car through Eurotunnel, but with no vehicle, there is little option. A pet-friendly Eurostar carriage  would provide a much requested service , without affecting the quality of travel for other passengers. We agree pets would need to follow the same rules as on the Eurotunnel.",
        "background": "Almost half of all UK adults own a pet. 70% of UK dog owners holidayed with their pet in 2018, yet the Eurostar doesn\u2019t allow dogs or cats to travel. UK has a population of 8.9m  dogs and 11.1m cats. Changing the rules would boost the leisure industry and ease stress for both pets and their owners.",
