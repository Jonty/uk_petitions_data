The dog in question was straying/not on a lead by the owners.  The dog has appeared at my front door since the incident.  The police and myself have photos of the wounds inflicted on my dog, as evidence of the incident.  Worried neighbours/witnesses, have logged their concerns/fears, with the police.",
        "background": "My dog was recently viciously attacked by a straying dog, whilst mine was on a lead.  My dog died a few days later.  I want the law changed; that no dog should be allowed in public places e.g. pavements, parks, without a lead/left unattended; to cause harm to animals/humans or to foul.",
