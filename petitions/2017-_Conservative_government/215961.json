        "additional_details": "De La Rue is a British company with a 200 year history, working for Government departments producing sensitive documents and products including stamps, bank notes & passports. It is a truly innovative and global company flying the flag for the UK.\r\n\r\nWe need to show the Government that they have got this very wrong and that they know the cost of everything, but the value of nothing. If they can negotiate a thing as complex as Brexit they should find a way to keep this work and the jobs in the UK.",
        "background": "Recent reports in the media have suggested that the Home Office is on the verge of moving the production of the new UK passport to a French-Dutch company. After Brexit the Government wants the world to back Britain, but are not putting the UK first when awarding contracts. We should challenge this.",
