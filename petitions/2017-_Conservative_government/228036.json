        "additional_details": "Nearly every child has a scooter and they ride extremely fast,often with both feet on the scooter. We need to protect our children's heads. Pavements are notorious for trip hazards-tree roots, drain covers, cracked paving and when scooting at the speed they do, they don't have time to react or brake to prevent the scooter tipping and risking a head injury.  Bones and scrapes heal but a head injury is extremely dangerous and could be easily prevented by protecting the head using a helmet.",
        "background": "We need to protect our children heads when scooting. Pavements have uneven surfaces, so as not to single out any children,it should be law that all children should be made to wear helmets.It seems bizarre that there is not a law in place currently to protect our children from head injuries.",
