        "action": "Make booking fees illegal where tickets are only available from one vendor",
        "additional_details": "When using sites such as Ticketmaster there is the added cost of a booking fee with the purchase of tickets. In many cases the ticket is only available from this website allowing a monopoly over their sale, this in turn leaves customers open to exploitation as vendors can charge excessive booking fees under this monopoly. Under this proposal booking fees would be banned unless tickets for the same event were on sale elsewhere creating competition among ticket vendors to offer the best price.",
        "background": "Ticketing websites regularly charge customers the added cost of a booking fee when using their services despite it often being only website on which tickets are available. This enables vendors to charge whatever price they want knowing if people want the tickets they must pay the charge.",
