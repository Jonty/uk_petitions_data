        "additional_details": "When booking holiday packages, it is obvious that the price increases relate directly to school holiday periods. The exact same package can be purchased either the week before or after, for sometimes half the cost. \r\nThese price increases also encourage parents to take their kids out of school early in order to get the holiday at a cheaper price. \r\nThese price increases are unfair and discriminatory and these practices need to be challenged by the government. \r\nWe need a complete review.",
        "background": "During school holiday periods, the price of travel, accommodation and package holidays increase dramatically for families wishing to travel with their children. Sometimes doubling in price.\r\nThis overpricing has a direct impact financially on families.",
