        "additional_details": "Its come to light that the MOD & NHS are having a battle with who is responsible for the aftercare of veterans, especially amputees are struggling with prosthetics departments nationwide leaving them unable to use the limbs they was given. I feel that any Injury attributable to service with life changing affects should be dealt with at Stanford hall. The MOD have duty of care to help these veterans during & after service. That was the CO's selling point of the move from Headley.",
        "background": "Being an injured veteran and having amputation looming over me due to an Injury I had during service, I've looked into where I can get help for my Injuries. One of selling points to move was that Stanford hall would help veterans with serious injuries and illness but that seems to be not the case.",
