        "action": "Change the definition of rape to make it possible for a female to rape a male.",
        "additional_details": "In cases where a female has forced sexual intercourse of some kind on a male -or indeed female- the likely charge for such is sexual assault. The maximum penalty for rape is life in prison. The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 10 years. Victims need justice and hard as it is to secure a conviction in rape cases, male victims are denied one by law. This must be changed.\r\nThe legal definition should be altered to \u201csexual intercourse of any kind without consent\u201d to protect victims.",
        "background": "Current legislation defines rape as \u201cthe penetration with a penis of a vagina, anus or the mouth of another person when consent has not been given\u201c which limits rape to men. Common sense dictates that a woman can force intercourse on a male yet they cannot legally rape one.",
