        "additional_details": "Using constitutional irregularity to seize control of the order of government procedure, in order to remove 'no deal' scenario and hand control of Brexit negotiations to the EU, the very body we are leaving, is unacceptable, unreasonable, totally without merit. It weakens and undermines the mandate of the people completely. We deem the current Parliament as unfit for its elected purpose. This parliament must be dissolved now so that the people may elect a Parliament of their confidence.",
        "background": "We have no confidence in this Parliaments intentions as to the full implementing of the will of the people, as mandated in the 2016 Referendum to leave the EU. The House of Commons is acting in contempt of constitutional regularities, thereby handing control of Brexit negotiation to foreign powers.",
