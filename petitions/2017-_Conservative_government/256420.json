In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"labelling\" excessive packaging as false advertising. Marketing and advertising are subject to codes of practice and Regulations. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/marketing-advertising-law/regulations-that-affect-advertising\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what changes you would like the Government or Parliament to make.\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions about unsustainable packaging, for example this one about plastic food packaging, which you might like to sign. You're more likely to get action on an issue if you sign and share a single petition:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/232684\r\n"
