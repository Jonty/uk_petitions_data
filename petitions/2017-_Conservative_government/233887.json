        "additional_details": "Many women will never disclose rape to anyone. Reasons include trauma, self-protection, shame, and fear for others - including their child. To force them to do so is cruel and risks danger.\r\nThere is already evidence that it is influencing decisions on pregnancy termination.\r\nHow could it be paid for?\r\nThe Government says the two child limit will save just over a \u00a31bn in 2019/20. Since the policy was announced, OBR forecasts for spending on personal tax credits in 2019/20 have reduced by \u00a32.2bn.",
        "background": "It is a glaring injustice. It breaks the link between the assessment of children\u2019s needs and the support they receive. \r\nIt will worsen child poverty.  \r\nNot all women have control over their reproductive destiny. Compulsory disclosure requirements will re-traumatise rape victims.",
