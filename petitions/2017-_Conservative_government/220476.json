I know of three from the most recent local election alone. \r\n\r\nWe the undersigned would also like to see a uniform approach taken to any new developments in the UK \u2013 ensuring that letterboxes are approximately midway and horizontal on the door, creating an easier route for postal workers, deliverers, and campaigners alike.",

Dog owners must have either a letter cage affixed to the reverse of their door, or an external post box to ensure the safety of all delivery workers.",
