He never asks permission and I am unaware of his presence on my roof until I get back and look at the security camera footage. What's the problem? Single ply membrane roofs are NOT designed to be regularly walked on. It causes damage that cannot be seen until we get a leak that we have to then repair. Costing money and inconvenience",

Yet if they injure themselves whilst on your property you can be prosecuted?",
