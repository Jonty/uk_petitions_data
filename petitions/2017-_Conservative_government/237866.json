        "action": "Stop the Congestion Charge and the Injustice to Private Hire Drivers.",
        "additional_details": "The charge is discriminatory in nature - private hire drivers will experience a drop in their gross earnings by up to \u00a3250.00 per month. Workers in no other sector will accept this change.\r\n\r\nThe charge is unfair and a tax on the poor - private hire drivers are amongst the lowest earners in the workforce. \r\n\r\nPrivate hire drivers are amongst the most vulnerable in society, being denied the standard workplace rights and benefits that permanent employees get, such as sick pay and holiday pay.",
        "background": "On 19 Dec 2018 the Mayor of London announced that from 8 April 2019 private hire divers will be required to pay the TFL congestion charge, of \u00a311.50 per day, to drive their private hire vehicles in central London.  \r\n\r\nThe Minicab Drivers Association demands the Mayor cancels his plans immediately.",
