You can find out how many bedrooms you're entitled to here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/housing-benefit/housing-benefit-restrictions-for-social-housing-tenants1/housing-benefit-bedroom-calculator-for-social-housing-tenants/\r\n\r\nYou may also be able to apply for help to make changes to your home:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/moving-and-improving-your-home/help-with-home-improvements/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for the housing allowance rules to be changed so that children with more than a 10-year age gap are not expected to share a room, if that's what you'd like to happen.
