        "additional_details": "The average woman's income annually is \u00a322,381. Take out their tax and their personal allowance. They spend \u00a32,160 approximately on food annually and approx \u00a3492 annually on feminine hygiene products. That's money that could be better spent on themselves or on their families. For low income women and students who struggle to eat, this is atrocious. They are still finding the money to look after their bodies. The government should start to pay for such products.",
        "background": "Women are expected to pay a significant amount of their income each month to pay for essential feminine hygiene products. The process women go through is completely natural and not their choice. The idea that they pay for such necessary products while contraception can be free is ridiculous.",
