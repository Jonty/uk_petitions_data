        "additional_details": "It's about time paedophiles are scared of the sentences given at court to deter them from their crimes. No crime is victimless; children are abused so others can download the pictures therefore facilitating this crime. Parents and non parents are outraged when a shoplifter can get a heavier sentence than those who destroy the souls of our children and it's about time that stopped.",
        "background": "Paedophiles who arrange to meet children, help facilitate attacks over the internet, download child pornography or sexually abuse children are often getting very little if at all any jail time; this is not a deterrent to those who seek out our children for their own twisted needs.",
