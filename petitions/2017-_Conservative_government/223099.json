        "additional_details": "My wife's visa was refused for financial reasons when I have earned \u00a329,500 this year and the Home Office didn't believe it to be a genuine relationship when I have lived with her in Chile for 12 months and she has lived with me in the UK for 12 months. Considering the amount of money and time it takes to apply for a visa and the length of time an appeal will take the government should ask for further information if needed. The governments visa website is misleading and inaccurate.",
        "background": "We want the government to stop charging people for visas they do not receive. The current policy is to make the visa applicant pay for the visa upfront and then keep the money when the visa is refused. This is immoral, unjust and scandalous.",
