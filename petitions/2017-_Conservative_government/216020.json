We're also not sure how it would apply to students eligible to vote in UK elections, but whose \"home\" is outside the UK.  \r\n\r\nThe Electoral Commission is responsible for looking at voter fraud. You can find out more about it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/electoral-fraud/data-and-analysis\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking to change the law so that students can only register to vote in one constituency. "
