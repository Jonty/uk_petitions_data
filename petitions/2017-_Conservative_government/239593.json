        "additional_details": "Ports continue to use 3rd Party Dock Workers through agencies who only provide zero hour contracts.  The ports side step any labour issues by claiming they do not employ these people the agencies do.\r\nZero hour contracts lead to unsafe practices as training and experience is often lost as these skills are replaced by the untrained and inexperienced staff.   People die in this industry because of this.",
        "background": "The National Dock Labour Board,\r\nset up in 1947, registered all port\r\nworkers and guaranteed that dockers\r\nhad a basic minimum fallback wage,\r\nwhether there was work for them or\r\nnot.  In 1989 the Tory Goverment used legislation to remove these rights to fall back pay.",
