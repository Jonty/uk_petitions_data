        "additional_details": "Parliament is using every tool in its power to ignore the will of the majority of the people in a democratic referendum result. \"Leave\" voters are all being wrongly being derided as uninformed, racist or stupid individuals who would change their mind if the referendum were reheld. Apart from being incorrect, this attitude is not acceptable and is not how democracy should function. Parliament is attempting to sidestep democracy and thereby standing in contempt of the majority of voters in the UK.",
        "background": "In June 2016, the UK held a once-in-a-lifetime referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. The majority (~52%) voted to leave the EU, fully aware this would also mean leaving the EU single market, in order to stop EU freedom of movement and gain back control over migration.",
