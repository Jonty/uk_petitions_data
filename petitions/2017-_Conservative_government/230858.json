        "additional_details": "The recent (and quite rightly so........) Feminist outrage at the utter disgraceful sexist naming of a well known brand K*****x 'man size tissues', serves as the realisation that men (and all people not included within brand names) are being oppressed everywhere with branding. Did K*****x not know the damage they were causing, children everywhere confused about what's right or wrong. \r\n\r\nPeople care, not just Mothers. Everyone's opinion matters, it's 2018 let's not offend anyone ever again.",
        "background": "The blatant sexist and very exclusionary brand name against men 'Mothercare', should be changed to 'Personcare'. 'Parentcare' would exclude people who have unfortunately lost their parents (biological or otherwise).",
