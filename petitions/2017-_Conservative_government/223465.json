        "additional_details": "The UK government needs to invest in good solid UK infrastructure NOW that helps create good safe jobs, reduce our impact on climate change, reduce the need for fracking and nuclear power and in a reliable and safe way. It will also help power the transition to electric vehicles and a cleaner cheaper future. The Tidal Lagoon is a perfect project that fits this but was scrapped based on incorrect costing information. We have some of the highest tidal resources in the world and should use them!",
        "background": "Please help overturn the decision to scrap the Tidal Lagoon in Swansea bay. This wonderful project will provide power that is much cheaper than Hinkley Point C Nuclear plant, in a renewable, predictable & safe way, that will help lower our CO2 emissions & bring more good jobs for people in the area.",
