        "additional_details": "https://twitter.com/My_Metro\r\n\r\nThe twitter account shows some of the major inconveniences commuters experience on a regular basis. This includes, trains being cancelled, accessibility issues such as lift breakages at major city centre stations and information boards failing to display the correct information. This reflects the need to increase funding for repairs on the nearly 40 year old transport system.",
        "background": "The Metro is a crucial transport service in the North East and represents the Government's failures to fund public transport systems outside major cities such as London or Manchester. The Metro system needs urgent repairs as there are constant delays, system failures and general renovations needed.",
