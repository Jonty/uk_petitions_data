        "action": "Ban plastic cotton buds",
        "additional_details": "If the Scottish government can take action and ban plastic being used to make cotton buds so can we. People flush plastic cotton buds down the toilet and many end up in the ocean and as a result they are washed up on our beaches. Not only is this devastating for ecosystems but also for the health of our beautiful coastline. With alternatives such as paper cotton buds available, there is really no need to use plastic.",
        "background": "The sale and manufacture of plastic-stemmed cotton buds is to be banned under new Scottish government plans. England should follow suit as the plastic stems of cotton buds kill 1000s of marine species every year along the coastline.",
