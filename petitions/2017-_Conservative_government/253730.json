        "additional_details": "The humble balloon and fragments produced when they burst have been identified as the number one risk of causing death from floating rubbish by University of Tasmania scientists.\r\n\r\nPhD student Lauren Roman said the study found that although hard plastic accounts for the vast majority of debris ingested it is far less likely to kill than soft plastics such as balloons.\r\n\r\nSea turtles are particularly at risk because they eat Jellies which balloon fragments can easily be mistaken for.",
        "background": "All released balloons return to Earth. They kill animals and add to the plastic waste clogging our oceans.\r\n\r\nEven so-called \u201cbiodegradable\u201d latex balloons can take years to break down.",
