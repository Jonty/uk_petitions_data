If there is fireworks that don\u2019t make a loud bang then why should loud ones be used? There\u2019s no reason. It\u2019s the colours of the fireworks that people like not the sound! They give the exact same colour quality. There\u2019s been multiple petitions about banning the sales of fireworks to the public, you could at least ban loud fireworks that aren\u2019t needed.",
        "background": "UK supermarkets have started selling quiet fireworks that don\u2019t make a loud bang so why should loud fireworks still be sold? There\u2019s no excuse for needing loud fireworks anymore. If people enjoy loud fireworks they should only be able to see them at a professional display.",
