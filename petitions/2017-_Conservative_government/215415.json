        "background": "Neuroblastoma is an aggressive cancer which mainly affects children under the age of 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnti GD2 therapy is standard in the US but is not available on the NHS. Around 60% of patients relapse with current NHS treatment options compared to 10% of patients after anti GD2 treatment.",
