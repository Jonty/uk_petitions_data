        "action": "Full British Citizenship for all EU citizens with settled status free of charge",
        "additional_details": "The Home Office also routinely rejects applications from EU Citizens who fully meet all criteria for minor technicalities that after another fee payment are overcome. \r\n\r\nThis is why the government should provide a free of charge route for those EU citizens who have been granted settled status. \r\n\r\nSettled status also not allow those who have it to vote in the way they could before.\r\n\r\nThis route should be streamlined on the basis of the evidence already required for settled status.",
        "background": "Settled status is likely to be undermined or reversed by the government.  Only full British Citizenship adequately protects EU citizens whose permanent home is in the UK. \r\n\r\nCurrent fees for citizenship are over \u00a31250 per person and thus unaffordable for many families of NHS staff and others.",
