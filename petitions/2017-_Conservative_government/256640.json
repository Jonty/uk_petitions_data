        "additional_details": "North Norfolk District Council (NNDC) put up over 1km of netting on the cliffs to deter the birds from nesting during work on the Sandscaping project intended to protect the cliffs from erosion. RSPB East said \u201cWe are disappointed that North Norfolk District Council (NNDC) has placed netting on the cliffs at Bacton to prevent sand martins from nesting. \u201cWe can confirm the council\u2019s actions do not follow RSPB advice, or indeed their own plans.\u201d",
        "background": "Sand Martins fly over 5,000 miles from Africa each year to nest in Bacton Cliffs only this time finding them covered in anti-bird netting installed by North Norfolk DC. The netting does not follow their plans nor RSPB advice. It is dangerous and cruel, putting these birds at risk of injury and death",
