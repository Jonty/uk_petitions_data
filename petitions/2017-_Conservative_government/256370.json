However in moving to the gross pay method of calculation this judicial decision has been lost and is not being applied by the CMS",
        "background": "The current calc by the CMS includes benefits in kind as if they were paid income. For those who need company cars to carry out their employment this is a child maintenance charge against a \"tool\" that facilitates earning income. It, as with other benefits, should not be included in maintenance.",
