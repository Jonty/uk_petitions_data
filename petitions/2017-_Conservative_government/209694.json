        "action": "Put teaching of life-saving in the national curriculum for schools at KS2",
        "additional_details": "Outside of hospital only 7% survive CPR in the UK whereas in parts of Europe, Scandinavia and USA the figure is up to 56%. The key difference is that those countries train their junior school children and keep training them through their education. I am proposing that we change the national curriculum to improve our ability as a nation. Adults do not feel confident in life saving situations because they have not been trained as children. Train our children, change the future.",
        "background": "To put life-saving skills on the national school curriculum from 8 years old until 11 so it becomes obligatory to train students in CPR, Defibrillation, Recovery Position and Choking will vastly improve our ability as a nation to save lives outside of hospital. Gives confidence to help as adults.",
