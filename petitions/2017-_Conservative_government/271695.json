        "action": "Add a 'None of the Above' option to all ballot papers in UK General Elections.",
        "additional_details": "On entry to polling stations, voters are rightly instructed to tick one box for a chosen candidate, but not informed of the option to tick all boxes in protest if unhappy with the choice of candidates or parties. There should be more education, and more widespread discussion in the media, of this legitimate option in holding to account our representatives in the House of Commons. This would give a voice to the disenfranchised, non-voting public, who currently feel that their vote is valueless.",
        "background": "Voters should be given the option to legitimately protest political incompetence with a 'vote for nobody' in all future General Elections. The action and consequence of spoiling a ballot should be given fair air-time across media, and the option to do this clearly laid out on all ballot papers.",
