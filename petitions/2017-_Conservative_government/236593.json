        "action": "Increase Police numbers and capability and take crime seriously again",
        "additional_details": "The last 20 years seems to have seen a deliberate softening of the police force, trying to recruit from a less traditional background and this has seen a decline in respect for the police, but also a lack of capability for the police to be of practical use when it comes to any apprehension of criminals. Too great a percentage of police are not full police officers and do not command the same respect. Numbers need to be greater. Capability to deal with everyday crime needs to be more robust.",
        "background": "Policing has been softened over the years and most areas are under resourced to the point where people in many areas watch by helplessly as they see their communities in decline. Theft, dangerous motoring practices and poor social  behaviours go untouched. This needs to change.",
