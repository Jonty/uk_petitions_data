        "additional_details": "There are loopholes within EU regulation that allows companies to legally not be required to label individually for allergens and ingredients. The EU regulation states that allergens have to be listed on \u2018pre-packaged\u2019 foods. However, foods l made fresh and wrapped daily are not required to be labelled. It\u2019s in the best interest of the estimated 44% of British adults who suffer from at least one allergy, and children who live and suffer with allergies, for all foods to be correctly labelled.",
        "background": "I recently visited a food outlet with a friend who has a severe nut allergy. She requested a butter croissant and was mistakenly given an almond croissant which was stored with the butter croissant. This could have killed her. We should be made more aware of food allergies and their consequences.",
