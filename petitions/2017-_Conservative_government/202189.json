        "action": "Make government condemn the violence of Spain's police against the Catalans",
        "additional_details": "The response to a peaceful referendum should never be violence, especially not by the police force that should serve and protect the Catalans. The UK foreign ministry has refused to condemn the Spanish authorities. This is unacceptable to me. I therefore would like to express that I and my fellow citizens do condemn the heinous violence of Spain's national police towards their citizens . Hopefully we will be heard.",
        "background": "On the day of the Catalonia independence referendum, Spain's national police used batons and rubber bullets to attack people who were peacefully attempting to cast their vote. Approximately 890 Catalans were injured. Let's make our government stand against brutalising peaceful voters.",
