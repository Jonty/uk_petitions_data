By someone I know. \r\n\r\nAt the moment there is no law against this but this needs to change as it causes so much hurt and embarrassment, and is a nasty form of bullying. \r\n\r\nPeople are also lured in by the photo and think they are talking to this person when they actually aren\u2019t which again just causes hurt and embarrassment.",
