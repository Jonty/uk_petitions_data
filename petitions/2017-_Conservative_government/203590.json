        "additional_details": "In early 2017 a petition 'Ban all non-recyclable/non-compostable packaging in the UK' was debated. Although this raised many valid and relevant points, it did not provide a clear strategy dealing with the problem. With the bio-plastic alternatives available, legislation is required to tackle this.\r\n\r\nAlthough some big corporations have paid lip service to sustainability (E.G. In store coffee cup recycling schemes), the impact will alway be superficial.\r\n\r\nPlease read the original debate responses.",
        "background": "With current bio-technological alternatives to almost all disposable food container and utensil, it is unacceptable that current wasteful practices have not been eliminated from our society.\r\n\r\nUntil organisations can prove that all materials used in packaging is recycled, a total ban is required.",
