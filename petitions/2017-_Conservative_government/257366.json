        "additional_details": "Hammersmith Bridge is a vital piece of London infrastructure for businesses and residents. It has been closed indefinitely due to the need for critical repairs. This closure causes traffic congestion in all surrounding areas, creating pollution and wasting thousands of hours for all road users, including emergency services. The UK Government can make funds available to the local authorities to make sure the bridge is brought back into service as quickly as possible.",
