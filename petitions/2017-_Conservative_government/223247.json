        "action": "Make PIP accessible to people with Autistic spectrum diagnoses.",
        "additional_details": "Despite the points mentioned above and additional needs often including but not limited to: difficulties interacting with others, severe anxiety and frequent comorbidities, the DWP will understate their difficulties and deny their claims. Fortunately, when people with ASD appeal, the majority of appeals are allowed, meaning the DWP is compelled to pay PIP to them. But this in itself is a problem as it wastes tax payer money due to the extra costs associated with the process.",
        "background": "PIP, it stands for personal independence payments. Yet there is a demographic comprised of one hundredth of the UK population who struggle to live independently because of their additional needs, those with a diagnosis on the autistic spectrum (ASD), but rarely do the DWP permit them to claim PIP.",

We're not sure exactly what you you'd like the UK Government or Parliament to do to make personal independence payments more accessible for people on the autistic spectrum.\r\n\r\nLaws and policies don't usually list specific conditions and define them as disabilities. In most cases, it\u2019s the impact on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for protection under the law or makes them eligible for support. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about how eligibility for PIP is decided here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/pip/eligibility\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do to make PIP more accessible.
