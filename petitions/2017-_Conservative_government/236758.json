        "action": "Stop building on Green Belt and make Consultations more visible to all impacted",
        "additional_details": "Current practice is that Government and local authorities operate by stealth and only consult with residents in an area - for example BANES with their proposed homes/roads not making Bristol residents aware of proposals literally on their doorsteps. We have an ageing population and not everyone uses computers - hence the postal system MUST be used to consult. Green belt is there for a reason to enhance the environment and there are plenty of Brown Space that can be used along with tunnels.",
        "background": "No roads or housing developments of over 25 houses shall be built on Green Belt. Public Consultations MUST last 6 months for each stage & people must be contacted by post that live within 2 miles of any proposed road/housing & not just those in the relevant parish/council area. Contact all impacted.",
