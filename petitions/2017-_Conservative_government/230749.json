        "additional_details": "It seems almost inevitable that the divisions between and within the political parties are such that one faction or another will vote down any Brexit deal that the Prime Minister may put before Parliament. Any deal also has to be passed by all the other members of the EU, a not insignificant hurdle. Hence the probability of a 'No deal' is becoming increasingly high, with disastrous consequences for the UK's future economic health.",
        "background": "The consequences of leaving the EU have taken over two years to be uncovered and even remotely appreciated. To be truly democratic and give political legitimacy to whatever the Government's future path may be, the public should be asked whether or not it wants a re-run of the original referendum.",
