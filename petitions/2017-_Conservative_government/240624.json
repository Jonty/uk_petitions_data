        "additional_details": "Joining Ireland after A 'Hard Brexit' would technically deliver Brexit but also mitigate all the obvious downsides of Brexit. As Ireland is in the EU CM and SM no 'Hard Broder' would be required on the island of Ireland either - protecting the Good Friday Agreement. Dublin would take control of all affairs with limited powers 'devolved' to England, Scotland & Wales until a UK constitution is written, 'first past the post' voting is changed to a PR type system & the UK returns to stability.",
        "background": "The UK is in crisis. 'Brexit' is impossible. Impossible in any way that would satisfy all the promises made during the referendum. With this in mind, we the under signed offer a solution. We propose that the UK leave's the EU as planned but simultaneously joins the Irish state one minute after.",
