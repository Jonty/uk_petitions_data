        "additional_details": "We have previously created a questionnaire to gather peoples views and opinions on whether we should bring back the death penalty or not. We asked 22 local residents a range of different questions when we got the questionnaires back out of the 22 people asked 55% feel as though it should be brought back too create a safer environment for our future generations where as the other 45% feel as though it shouldn't be brought back because it is not right to commit the \"an eye for and eye\" because it is too harsh of a punishment and what if they were framed then they loose their life for nothing.",
        "background": "We believe that bringing back the death penalty will help to reduce crimes being committed and to create a safer community for us and future generations. Also it will help to get murderers and rapists off the streets to make us less worried when going out or letting our children out.",
