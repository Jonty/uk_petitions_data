        "action": "Pass Mrs May's negotiated deal subject to confirmation in a referendum",
        "additional_details": "The proposal would almost certainly attract a majority in the Commons.  It would provide certainty of outcome, and the pre-referendum period would allow Parliament and the people a period of recovery.  The arguments for the 3 options have all been analysed, discussed and broadcast in huge detail over the last 3 years, so the referendum could take place as soon as arrangements could be put in place.  During this period, both major parties could heal their wounds and/or elect new leaders.",
        "background": "The referendum should be simple, clear and based on outcomes that do not require us to re-open negotiations with the EU.  Thus it should offer 3 options - Leave with No Deal, Mrs May's Deal or Remain  and Revoke Article 50.  This should be single transferable vote in order to provide a majority.",
