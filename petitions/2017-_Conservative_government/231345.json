        "action": "Publicly condemn the actions by the US government to erase transgender people.",
        "additional_details": "For the approximate 1.4 million Americans who are transgender, the actions taken in recent years by the Trump administration have been severely damaging. And for the 1 in 12 trans people in America who have been murdered, their government's unwillingness to help the community has been deadly. This petition calls upon the UK government to exert it's influence on the US and call for a change in favour of basic Human Rights that seem to be so easily overlooked. We call upon you to do what is right.",
        "background": "A report on a memo from the US Department of Health and Human Services alleges that the department has proposed to amend their civil rights laws to determine gender based on their genitalia at birth. This is both scientifically and ethically, an incorrect stance. The Trans community is under attack.",
