Brexiteers spared no thought for British citizens living in the EU, many of whom are not in a position repatriate to the UK. The weak pound has also caused problems, and anti-British sentiment is rising. We should be compensated as this compares to crimes against humanity.",
        "background": "UK nationals have been placed in a procarious position after Brexit, and a no deal will cause financial hardship and loss of basic rights. Brexit was not agreed to by many expatriates, and many couldn't vote. It's only fair that expats should be generously compensated should the UK leave the EU.",
