        "additional_details": "Payrises as a rule are awarded for good performance hard work and following instructions from your employer. Our current parliament does nothing of the sort, they are a disgrace. Their failure to implement the referendum result, despite all standing in the 2017 election with manifesto commitments to honour that result is shameful. They have collectively made this country a laughing stock. Three years of dithering, and now they want to take the true Brexit, the no deal option out of the equation.",
        "background": "The sheer indignation towards the British electorate shown by Westminster, coupled with the refusal to carry out their manifesto commitments to take the UK out of the eu means to most it hard to justify yet another pay increase for mps. It should be stopped, it's just wasting more taxpayers money.",
