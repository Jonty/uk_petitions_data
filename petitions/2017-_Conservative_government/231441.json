        "action": "Continue the renewable energy 'feed in tariff' beyond March 2019.",
        "additional_details": "The Feed in Tariff is the government scheme to provide reward for consumers for renewable energy production by paying people for the energy created and exported to the National Grid.\r\n\r\nThere are no plans to extend the Feed in Tariff beyond March 2019, which will remove any incentive for consumers to install renewable energy devices, as any energy created will simply flow to the National Grid, with no financial compensation.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call for this scheme to be continued.",
        "background": "The Feed in Tariff is the government scheme to provide reward for consumers who install renewable energy devices at home or business. This tariff pays people for the energy created and stimulates green energy growth. This scheme is due to expire in March 2019, we call for this to be continued.",
