        "additional_details": "There is currently no collective data on statistics of transgender people living in the UK, however it is estimated to be around 650,000, imagine 650,000 having to go through one of 7 severely underfunded and understaffed clinics. THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE. Please sign this petition to show support and ultimately MAKE CHANGE. The unfortunate truth is that, for some transgender people, the waiting time can be the time between life and death.",
        "background": "Currently transgender people around the UK are facing waiting times of up to 2.5 YEARS simply for a first referral (THIS IS NOT TREATMENT!) The UK government needs to increase funding to Gender Identity Clinics, Decrease waiting times for GIC\u2019s, as well as open more (there are currently only 7!)",
