        "background": "After struggling to pass my test for years i decided to calculate how much money i spent on test fees, currently a driving test fee stands at \u00a362 and \u00a375 on weekends.However, many people do not pass 1st time so having to pay \u00a362 like i did for every test adds up to a fortune.",
