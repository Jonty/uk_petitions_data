        "additional_details": "There are more Remain supporting MPs than Leave supporting MPs. Parliament cannot be trusted. The Government now seems intent on making a transitional deal from March 2019 and giving the EU large sums of UK taxpayers` money from that date. The period from June 2016 to March 2019 should be considered sufficient for everyone to adapt to a full break from the EU in March 2019.",
        "background": "Ask that the Government now give the British people a referendum on whether or not we have a transitional deal from March 2019. If the vote is no, then there must be no transitional deal, and we must be out of the single market, the customs union and the rulings of EU courts from March 2019.",
