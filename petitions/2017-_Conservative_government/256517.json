        "additional_details": "President Trump's previous trip to the UK was downgraded from a full state visit to a \"working visit\" last year, supposedly due to security concerns, whilst in fact there was massive popular opposition to granting him such an honour, and there is little to suggest that the great British public have changed their opinion of this odious and divisive character at such a difficult time whilst our nation faces such uncertainty.",
        "background": "The government is apparently planning to afford President Donald Trump a state visit with full honours in June when he comes to Europe to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the D Day landings. This would send entirely the wrong message to our friends in Europe at this crucial time in our history.",
