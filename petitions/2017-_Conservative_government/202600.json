        "action": "Hold a General Election if there is no deal on Brexit by September 2018",
        "additional_details": "When people voted leave in the EU Referendum, there was no suggestion that we would choose to, or have to, leave without a deal. The government has not made any practical preparations for a no deal scenario, and  negotiations are not progressing fast enough. If the government cannot deliver, Parliament should take over and use whatever means necessary to avoid a no deal scenario. As this will involve a loss of confidence in the current government, a General Election should be held.",
        "background": "Leaving the EU without an agreement on our future relationship would be catastrophic in economic and human terms. If the government cannot deliver, our sovereign Parliament should be allowed to implement alternative arrangements, including dissolution and a General Election, to avoid this outcome.",
