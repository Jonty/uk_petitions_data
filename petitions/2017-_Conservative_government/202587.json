        "action": "Allow the collection of store points when purchasing stage one infant formula.",
        "additional_details": "The Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula Regulation 2007 prohibits the promotion of formula feeding & this includes allowing families to earn points for buying stage one formula, points can also not be used to buy formula. Points are available when purchasing items relating to breastfeeding (breast pumps/ pads etc). Therefore I believe it to be discriminatory against those who can't or don't want to breastfeed their children that points cannot be collected against stage one formula.",
        "background": "You are unable to earn Boots Advantage Card points, Tesco Clubcard or Nectar points when buying stage one baby milk, as it is perceived to discourage breastfeeding. \r\nI believe this law should be changed so that families who can't or chose not to breastfeed their children are not being penalised.",
