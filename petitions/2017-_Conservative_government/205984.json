This government has acknowledged our widespread housing crisis, but still the wait goes on for tangible action to get housebuilders building genuinely affordable homes.\r\n\r\nThe last time that 300,000 homes were built in one year in England was in 1969, when councils and housing associations were also building new homes. The private sector has never and does not have the inclination to reach these numbers.",
        "background": "We are calling upon the Government to grant Local Authorities the right to build and the right to buy so that housing can be let to families on low incomes at social housing rents. If the Government target of building 300,000 new homes is to be achieved, councils will have to play their part.",
