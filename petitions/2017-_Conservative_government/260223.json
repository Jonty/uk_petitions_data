        "additional_details": "Hit-and-run figures are on the rise in the UK \u2013 one in five drivers now fails to stop after an accident, and the law isn\u2019t helping. Drivers under the influence of drink or drugs especially are incentivised to flee, and face lesser charges when they sober up. Lifetime bans for hit-and-run drivers would make sure that if you hit someone with your car and leave them to die, you\u2019ll never be given the chance to do it again. This isn't about punishment \u2013 it\u2019s about keeping people safe.",
        "background": "A driving license isn\u2019t a right; it\u2019s a hard-won privilege, given only to those who have shown they can be trusted with the responsibility of driving. Fleeing the scene after hitting someone with your vehicle shows you don\u2019t have the regard for human life needed to be a safe road user.",
