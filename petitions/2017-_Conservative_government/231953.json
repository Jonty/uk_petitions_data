        "additional_details": "It has been debated in parliament on many occasion and knocked back about lowering the age limit of smears, yet young women are still developing and dying from cervical and ovarian cancer under the age of 25. \r\nWomen who have had children young, no HPV vaccine and a family history are at a higher risk of developing cancer. \r\nSmears should be given to women under the age of 25 but especially to those with these three circumstances.",
        "background": "In the UK smears for under 25s aren\u2019t allowed, in a very rare occasion and long process for a woman under this age to have one. \r\nAll women should be allowed from the age of 16, but especially those who have had children young, a family history and didn\u2019t have the HPV vaccine under the age of 25.",
