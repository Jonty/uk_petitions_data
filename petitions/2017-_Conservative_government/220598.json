        "additional_details": "An example of reduction in services from Royston in Hertfordshire. The old timetable had 7 trains starting from the town in the morning peak into London. This has been cut to 3. \r\nThe so called fast 08.24 service replaces two services, 08.29 and 08.34 which no longer exist and is now only 8 coaches long and starts further up the line so capacity is reduced to standing only.\r\nDespite price rises being justified with better improved services, they have got worse.",
        "background": "The changes to the GTR timetables on 20th May 2018 have resulted in delays, cancellations and reduction in services as well as reduced capacity for a number of commuters across the network. \r\nThis has resulted in people being late for work as well as having less family time at home.",
