        "additional_details": "Since my experience, I have discovered many other similar stories where parents are publicly shamed. We are an invisible group who are discriminated against but have no protection under the law. We would like to enjoy going out as a family knowing that our children are safe.",
        "background": "We were recently humiliated and almost refused service when we brought home made food for our son, who has life threatening allergies, to a play centre. We believe that this is a form of discrimination. Parents should have the right to provide safe food for their children without being shamed.",
