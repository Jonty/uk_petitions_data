Priority should be given to British passport holders just as every other country does by having U.K. passport ONLY lanes too.\r\nEven the queues for non EU/UK passports is often smaller and quicker and it\u2019s really a kick in the teeth to queue when in other counties airports at the border and then also at the border when you get home!",
        "background": "Every time I fly throughout the year I am constantly in a huge queue to enter my home country!\r\nIt is so frustrating to have a UK/EU passport channel where 75% of the people are not UK citizens. We are one of the only countries where our own citizens queue to come HOME.",
