        "additional_details": "We\u2019ve encountered many people who have had their birds die in their hands as there have been no local specialists. We have struggled finding someone who knows about birds and have been passed from pillar to post. This petition aims to ensure that 1 vet from every medium size practice gets trained adequately to be able to offer a a basic check up. Likewise, breeders should inform buyers of their local specialists. Therefore I also recommend a specialists register for easy accessibility for all.",
        "background": "2017 saw a big change for us. We obtained a new home. And we increased our family by buying 6 feathered friends. We bought these one by one after falling in love with each new companion. But there aren\u2019t any vets in the local area who can even perform a check up on our friends. This is not unusual.",
