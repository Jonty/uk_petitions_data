But when you are photographed going into a restaurant car park with signs high up on lampposts that you do NOT notice, as you\u2019re concentrating on driving, then have children to tend to when you get out of your car to go inside, you do not see a ticket machine so therefore do not think you have a time limit. Only to then get sent a parking charge for staying too long is immoral",

This needs to be outlawed as immoral!\r\nAll car parks with restrictions should use pay and display machines so you are fully aware of them.",
