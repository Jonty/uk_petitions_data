        "action": "Stop nurses having to work 13 hour long shifts",
        "additional_details": "If we cut down the bucket of Horus we force nurses to work in a day, this would improve their work life balance and lead to a reduction in the level of voluntary quitting from nurses. Our nurses are so overwhelmed with the amount of Horus they are doing that they spend all their time off trying to recover from work just to do it all again. \r\nIt seems both cruel and unreasonable to force nurses to work such punishing hours.",
        "background": "forcing nurses to work 13 hour long shifts negatively affects their mental health causing them to have depressing, anxiety, hopelessness and have a lack of enjoyment in life. On top of being overworked due to staff shortages this causes both a reduction in level of care and high levels of quitting.",
