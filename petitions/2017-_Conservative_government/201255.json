        "action": "Enforce all dog groomers must be qualified & registered under a regulating body.",
        "additional_details": "I spoke to the animal welfare who told me there is nothing anyone could do and the rspca wouldn't be interested! My dog is a teddy bear looking Lhasapoo with gorgeous teddy bear paws sadly he has now  been completely shaven, almost to the skin,she has even cut him on his chest and he has lost his whiskers.he was terrified when I picked him up. We really need the law to be changed and for all dog groomers to be qualified and accountable to a regulating body so this can not happen again to others.",
        "background": "I have recently had a terrible experience with a dog groomer,when investigating who I needed to report her too I realised that there is no one! no qualifications are needed and no regulating body to be accountable to. Please sign this petition,  together we can make a difference for our dogs.",
