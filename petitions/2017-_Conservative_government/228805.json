        "additional_details": "Law graduates who struggled to privately fund a Masters as they could not afford the LPC, are not-eligible for the Post graduate loan. The LPC is the main practice course which enables them become Solicitors. The additional LLM on top of the Legal Practice Course(LPC) is an additional dissertation to qualify the LPC for the Masters Loan. I pray that the eligibilty rule which exempts Law graduates with a previous higher qualification from applying for a Masters loan to study the LPC be reviewed.",
        "background": "A long distance Masters degree, which I struggled to pay for in instalments, has now made me ineligible to apply for a Postgraduate loan to study the Legal Practice Course, which I need to become a solicitor. I now face trying to fund this course via expensive loans or not qualifying at all.",
