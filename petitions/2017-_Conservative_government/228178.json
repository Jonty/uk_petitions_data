        "additional_details": "A report has warned that one in five local roads is plagued by potholes and around 20% of carriageways in England and Wales have less than five years\u2019 life remaining. Thus, 40,000 miles of UK Roads will become unusable. A cyclist Kevin Farrell, was critically injured recently by a pothole and claimed, it will kill the next person who falls into it. Despite paying road tax, other taxes, we are being deprived of a basic necessity of reliable roads. Additionally, potholes are damaging our vehicles.",
        "background": "The deterioration of our local and major roads continues to accelerate significantly, because of the scarce maintenance funding and resources available to local councils, to fix dangerous potholes. This is resulting in serious accidents and potentially life threatening injuries to all the road users",
