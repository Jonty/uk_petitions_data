        "action": "Ban all Non-Stun meat slaughter in all UK abattoirs and slaughterhouses.",
        "additional_details": "The Food Standards Agency have released figures taken from their 2018 survey that some 94 million cattle and sheep were slaughtered without first being stunned. The survey figures reveal that some 750,000 sheep who were not stunned before slaughter were exported out of the UK contrary to UK legal requirements.",
        "background": "In the UK it is only legal for meat to be slaughtered without first stunning the animal due to religious considerations and only for meat consumed within the UK. This petition argues that the current legislation is being abused and that the legislation itself is not consistent with animal welfare.",
