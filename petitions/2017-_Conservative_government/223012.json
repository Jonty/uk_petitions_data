        "action": "Increase financial support for Midwifes and Nurses at university.",
        "additional_details": "There is a national shortage of midwives & nurses, yet pursuing this career is highly challenging as its virtually impossible to afford the basics e.g. Accommodation, food & travel.\r\nThis is specially challenging for mature students supporting a family.\r\nHealthcare students are timetabled for min 45 weeks per year. Working unpaid clinical hours alongside studying, means a part time job is not possible. Universities strongly recommend against extra work.\r\nThe current government plan needs reviewing.",
        "background": "2017/18 student midwives and nurses are the first group of students not to receive bursaries. Due to the high number of unpaid clinical hours it is not possible to take up part time work. Financial support is based on family income and not the outgoings or personal circumstances of students.",
