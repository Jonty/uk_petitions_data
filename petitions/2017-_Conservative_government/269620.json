        "additional_details": "I\u2019m a 16 year old girl with a severe peanut and tree nut allergy. I spent 18 months raising a significant sum of money when all my hard work and dreams were crushed when I had to make a decision of flying with an airline that serves nuts on board or, it meant missing out going on the trip of a lifetime. I feel I should not of been put in this position and I should feel safe and at ease when travelling. I would love to urge the UK government to work with the EU to prevent this happening again.",
        "background": "Recently, I was told I could not join my classmates in Nepal because I would be taking a severe risk flying with a certain airline. This should be a problem and having an allergy should not stop you from experiencing new countries and cultures, just because getting there is a problem.",
