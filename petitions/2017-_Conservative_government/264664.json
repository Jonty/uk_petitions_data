        "additional_details": "FUND THE BBC, OR BE FINED \u00a31,000 FOR WATCHING ITV?\r\nThe BBC is increasingly criticised for its social engineering, political bias, establishment propaganda, selection and publication bias, unbalanced programming, hiring policies, echo-chamber, censorship, tokenism and metro-liberal-elitism. Whether repudiated or substantiated, such criticism demonstrates that viewers should have the right to cease funding BBC services (especially over 75's), without being criminalised for viewing another channel.",
        "background": "Viewers of live commercial TV channels, both free-to-air and subscription based, are forced to fund a BBC service they don't watch, or be criminalised. This is undemocratic and coercive. It diminishes the BBC's incentive to tailor output to a target audience and allows it a self-serving agenda.",
