        "action": "Don\u2019t charge parking fees at Bradford Council leisure facilities car parks.",
        "additional_details": "They claim this is to offset government grant cuts. A short sighted, short term gain which will lead to facilities being under utilised and traffic congestion in the towns. The government are supposed to be encouraging people to get active yet are introducing financial penalties for doing this. The funds raised are not even going to be used to upgrade the facilities affected. Bradford council appear to be continually asset stripping/pillaging communities rather than effectively managing budgets.",
        "background": "Bradford Council intend to introduce car parking charges at leisure facilities across the district, including Ilkley swimming pool and St Ives Estate in Harden. This action will push cars to park in the surrounding roads, deter people from taking exercise, lead to children abandoned at drop off.",
