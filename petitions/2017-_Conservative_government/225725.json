        "additional_details": "The UK has suffered from the increase of crime especially knife crime as well as an increase of burglaries over the past year, this is the result of decreased funding the government has given the police. We now need the government to give police forces in England and Wales enough funds to be able to put more police officers on our streets to keep the public safe and to increase funding. They should also increase funding to Scotland and Northern Ireland so that they can do the same.",
