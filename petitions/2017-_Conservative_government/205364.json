        "additional_details": "There's 1000s of people who have birds of prey, some of these birds can kill animals up the the size of deer, so effectively they're equivalent to a dangerous weapon. \r\nThere needs to be control on the ownership or at the least, a strict mentoring system.",
        "background": "Here in the UK, we are one of the only countries in the world, that does not have a falconry license.\r\nThere is a huge issue where anyone can own and breed and sell birds of prey, to people who have no experience. \r\nI encounter 10-12 owls and Hawks each year kept in parrot cages and rabbit hutches",
