Our parents & grandparents have been humiliated by the Wind Rush scandal. Forced to check-in to a detention centre weekly or face a \u00a35000 fine or 6months in prison. \r\n\r\nImagine the knock-on effect. \r\n\r\nIts time to break-away from the UK",

Then being told you are no longer welcomed, forced from your job, arrested & deported.\r\n\r\nHow British would you feel?",
