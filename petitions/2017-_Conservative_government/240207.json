        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nMy sister suffers with epilepsy and dissociative seizures and episodes. She has been signed off of university and work for a year due to the severity of her condition. She has medical evidence from her neurologist and video evidence of what happens to her during a seizure or episode. However, following a PIP assessment she has been rejected. We have been contacted by thousands of other people, this is not an isolated case.",
        "background": "Following on from a widespread open letter to the DWP regarding the rejection of my sisters claim for PIP we have started this petition with an aim of abolishing the current PIP assessment and replacing it with one which considers the effects of non visible disabilities and illnesses.",
