        "additional_details": "16 year olds were given the vote in the Scottish referendum, it increases the legitimacy of the vote as it increases suffrage. It is our future, I was born an EU citizen and that right is being taken away from me without me being aloud to vote, the government, the false promises in the leave campaign and our system of democracy have failed the young people who will be left to fix the society that will be destroyed by leave the EU.",
        "background": "700,000 gathered in London desperate for a people\u2019s vote and their voices were ignored. 48% of the population voted remain and to leave the EU without giving the people a say on the final deal is completely undemocratic. If democracy cannot chance it\u2019s mind it ceases to be democratic!",
