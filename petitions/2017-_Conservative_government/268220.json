        "additional_details": "Less than 0.002% of the population chose him to be Prime Minister as only 96,000 conservatives voted for him out of the UK population of 66.04m people. \r\n\r\nIn his first speech at Downing Street he and his cabinet have made many promises including: \r\n- leave the EU by the 31st October even with no deal \r\n- boost school spending by 0.1% \r\n- create new \u201cFreeports\u201d which would have revenue and customs implications \r\n- increase growth of genetically modified crops\r\n \r\nNone of these were in the 2017 manifesto",
        "background": "Boris Johnson became Prime Minister in July 2019. In his first speech outside Downing Street, he outlined new government policies and chose a new cabinet that support policies significantly different to the conservative manifesto in 2017. Therefore he should fight on this new manifesto for a mandate",
