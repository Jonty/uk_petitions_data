        "additional_details": "I believe the health and wellbeing of all animals and people are affected by these excessively loud fireworks, I would like mortars bomb fireworks to either banned or the decibel output be limited as set by health and safety factors, in this time of terrorism and wars these mortar bombs cause unnecessary suffering and trauma! I'm sure that the majority of people will support this petition and I hope that the good people within parliament will take decisive action, I thank you. \r\nColin Brooks.",
        "background": "Over recent years fireworks have become larger and more noisy, these are mainly mortar bomb fireworks which are normally launched using thick cardboard tubing, the tubing is either buried in the ground or a bucket of sand, after being lit these mortars can reach various heights depending on size.",
