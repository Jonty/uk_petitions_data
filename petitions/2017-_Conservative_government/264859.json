        "additional_details": "The climate crisis demands that the UK switch over to 100% renewable energy as soon as we can. The justification for ending the FIT is that solar panels are affordable now, but many of us know that is still not true.\r\nArticle stating that solar panel installations have fallen 94% in a month - https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/home-solar-panel-installations-fall-by-94-as-subsidies-cut\r\nThe IPCC report on climate change states the urgency for change - https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/",
        "background": "To many UK households, installing solar panels could only be affordable if they are paid for the electricity they generate and give back to the grid, but this scheme (FITs) is no longer taking applications. We need the feed-in tariff to be restored, and take on as many new households as possible.",
