        "additional_details": "Olsen and Allen (2001) found that 51% of outdoor-access cats that suddenly and unexpectedly died were the result of road traffic accidents.\r\nThere isn\u2019t much that can be done about cats going near busy roads as cats love to wander, but what we can do is make sure people drive safely and if they do happen to hit a cat, the least they can do is stop and report it/take it to the vet.",
        "background": "I feel so strongly about this after my cat was hit by a car down the road from my house,the person who hit him didn\u2019t stop they just left him. Somebody else had to pick him up for me.Cats deserve as much justice as dogs do they\u2019re still both animals and not one is more important than the other",
