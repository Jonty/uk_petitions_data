        "additional_details": "The former Chairman of Eurostar, Adam Mills, wrote that the claimed social and economic benefits of HS@ were \"away with the fairies\". He added, it would be far wiser to spend the money on traditional  rail enhancements given the relatively short distances between UK cities. In economic terms HS@ is unjustifiable. Existing trains  between London and Birmingham are underused at present and saving business men 30 minutes of travelling time does not justify the destruction of 1740 buildings including 888 homes, together with 60 irreplaceable ancient woodlands being destroyed.",
        "background": "With the projected cost of HS2 rising towards \u00a3100bn, it would be better to stop the project now and use the money saved to provide free solar panels to the whole of the country.",
