        "additional_details": "4 months ago I had a serious accident which resulted in a major foot injury however I can't have a Blue Badge. I rely on a wheelchair/crutches to get round as I still can't walk. We can't use disabled spaces. My wife struggles to get the wheelchair out of the car and I often can't open the door wide enough to get out.\r\nAllowing doctors to write a prescription for a temporary Blue Badge (or something similar) for a set period of between 3 to 12 months, would be a massive help to many families.",
        "background": "People with mobility issues who require wheelchairs to get around for several months currently cannot get a Blue Badge. I have experienced this difficulty myself and think that doctors should be able to give a temporary Blue Badge prescription of between 3-12 months for a temporary disability.",
