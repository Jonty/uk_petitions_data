        "additional_details": "This petition is very simple; under Donald Trump's leadership the United States of America is currently locking children in cages and separating them from their parents in the name of \"the law\" and \"the bible\".\r\n\r\nI know there have been similar petitions in the past, but what is happening in America now changes everything.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to demand that the government do not permit Donald Trump to visit until every child is out of a cage and back with their family and loved ones.",
        "background": "The current President of America is planning to visit the UK on Friday the 13th of July. The British government are busy finalising plans to meet with a man who is holding children ransom.",
