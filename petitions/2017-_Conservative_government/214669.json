        "additional_details": "This petition does not support in any way, those that attempt to avoid their child maintenace obligations. It asks only that the government be forced to consider realistic calculations based on real earnings. \r\nThe government takes tax and national insurance off citizens for public services, yet for the purposes of child maintenance, NRP have endured crippling CM calculations for years based on gross earnings, tax and NI included.",
        "background": "Non resident parents (NRP) presently pay child maintenance that is calculated on gross earnings. We request that the government change this policy to calculating child maintenance on realistic take home earnings (nett earnings).",
