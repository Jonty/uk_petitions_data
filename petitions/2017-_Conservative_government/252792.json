        "additional_details": "People who supply and produce class A drugs get life imprisonment. People who supply class B drugs such as cannabis get up to 14 years imprisonment. If you sold cannabis you could face more time than a rapist. WHAT??!! Let that sink in. you rape someone you shouldn\u2019t have the chance to live your life. Raping someone should land you 40 years minimum. No Parole. No decreased sentence for good behaviour. More people would speak out about this happening if their attackers were given larger sentences. 5 YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH! You should spend the rest of your life in prison if you do this to someone. PERIOD.",
        "background": "In the UK you get 5 years in prison if you rape someone over the age of 16. This is pathetic. The penalty needs to be increased... How can somebody ruin someone\u2019s life and only get 5 years.",

You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/rape-and-sexual-offences-chapter-19-sentencing\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like to happen.\r\n\r\nThere's already a petition about minimum sentences for rape, which you might like to sign.
