        "additional_details": "UK citizens, working and living in the EU for more than 2 years before the Brexit referendum, were arbitrarily disenfranchised  by the UK Government, and were ineligible to vote on an issue that affected their future and legal standing in the EU. Parliament must ensure that any future referendum affecting the governance of the UK must consult all UK citizens, regardless of residence. Local Consular offices charged with registering all UK citizens abroad, can verify their voting eligibility.",
        "background": "The recent BREXIT referendum limited the right of UK citizens to vote on the UK's future on the basis of residence. UK citizens, resident abroad, but still registered in electoral roles, were eligible. However, many others were disenfranchised and unable to vote on issues affecting their future.",
