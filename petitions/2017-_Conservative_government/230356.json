        "action": "Hold a referendum on Proportional Representation for parliamentary elections",
        "additional_details": "This is unfair and unsustainable: since 2005 two general elections have produced no overall majority, and two have produced majorities which each resulted from just over one third of the votes cast.\r\n20 years ago the Jenkins Commission recommended a proportional system to replace First Past the Post. A 2011 referendum offered instead the AV system which Jenkins had rejected as it is not proportional.\r\nWe therefore call upon Parliament to hold a referendum on the Jenkins Commission recommendation.",
        "background": "Under our present electoral system the distribution of seats among the political parties bears no close relation to the total votes cast for those parties. In 2017, the average number of votes cast nationally for each party varied between just under 28,000 and over 525,000 votes per seat won.",
