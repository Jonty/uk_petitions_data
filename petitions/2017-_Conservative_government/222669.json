        "action": "End Prohibition - make recreational cannabis legal.",
        "additional_details": "It is also ridiculous to claim any negative impacts of legalising cannabis. Alcohol causes people to get angry and fight. This becomes a serious threat to the life of a lone commuter walking home at night. It is a crime that cannabis; which makes people calm and peaceful, remains illegal. It is time for the UK to move past the propagandist lies that state cannabis is dangerous. If cannabis is truly as dangerous as falsely claimed, then why does the government allow alcohol and tobacco? If you make cannabis illegal, then so to must alcohol and tobacco be illegal...otherwise the government is simply a hypocritical ill-informed mess.",
        "background": "Two of the most dangerous drugs in the world that cause more than 10 million deaths a year are declared legal, alcohol and tobacco. Both are drugs that have no medical benefit whatsoever. It is, therefore, a joke that a natural plant with proven healing properties remains illegal.",
