        "action": "Increase the funding and support for the production of shale gas by fracking",
        "additional_details": "Local communities would see significant benefits from fracking economically with an increase of job opportunities. The first 100 sites could create 74,000 jobs.\r\n\r\nLocal communities which host sites will also be rewarded more directly. In June 2013, UKOOG announced its first industry-wide community benefits scheme where the local community will benefit to the sum of \u00a3100,000.\r\n\r\nThe industry estimates that it could add up to over \u00a31.1bn in a 25 year period or about \u00a35m to \u00a310m per site.",
        "background": "Fracking has the potential to boost the UK economy. It will increase job opportunities, lower imported fuel, whilst bringing a higher tax revenue with greater energy security.\r\n\r\nThe production of shale gas would reduce volatility within the wholesale market.",
