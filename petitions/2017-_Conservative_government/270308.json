        "additional_details": "The target ambulance response time to a Category One Emergency such as a cardiac arrest is EIGHT MINUTES. Although there are occasions where that\u2019s not quick enough. Teaching young people how to perform CPR and resuscitation skills could save lives as well as free up call handlers that are getting flooded with Emergency calls. If a call handler is told there is a member of the public who is CPR trained, then they could alert the ambulance and deal with another patient.",
        "background": "There are over 30,000 deaths a year because of Cardiac Arrests and that figure is OUTSIDE OF HOSPITALS. If the emergency services get the patient to hospital, ONLY one in ten survive to be discharged from Hospital.",
