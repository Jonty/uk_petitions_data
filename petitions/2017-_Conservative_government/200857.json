        "additional_details": "In 2015 Andrew Davis was diagnosed with SCC of the tonsil. He underwent 30 radiotherapy and 1 chemotherapy. He was then given the all clear in June 2016. After this his life started to get better. In June 2017, Andrew became unwell and was given the news he had Secondary Liver Mets, no evidence of disease in head and neck area but the cells in his liver were from that source that had broken away during treatment. We are petitioning for head and neck patients to be scanned routinely.",
        "background": "Head and neck cancer patients are not routinely scanned after remission due to protocol. Even though a certain amount of patients have had metastasis from this source of cancer, which has gone from a highly curable cancer to a terminal diagnosis. Scans every 3-6 months should be a requirement.",
