        "additional_details": "In 2017 it\u2019s estimated that 4 million adults between the ages 16 and 59 in England and Wales were victims of sexual assault, and things don\u2019t seem to be getting better. Around 5 in 6 victims did not report their experiences to the police.",
        "background": "If we can introduce rape awareness as part of children\u2019s curriculum we can teach boys and girls that if your sexual partner says no and you proceed without consent, this is rape. It would not only prevent sexual assault, but also give knowledge on how to deal with rape if they become a victim.",

Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in schools teaches children about a wide range of issues, including the concepts and laws relating to sexual consent.\r\n\r\nAll schools in England will be required to teach RSE from September 2020 and the Government has published draft guidance. You can read the guidance here:\r\n\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/781150/Draft_guidance_Relationships_Education__Relationships_and_Sex_Education__RSE__and_Health_Education2.pdf\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons library has published a summary of current RSE requirements and what's changing here:\r\n\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/insights/relationships-and-sex-education-in-schools-whats-changing/\r\n\r\nWe're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do."
