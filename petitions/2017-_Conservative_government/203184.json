        "background": "In the UK, rape laws are unequal.\r\n\r\nThe 2003 Sexual Offences Act is explicit in its several references to rape being an exclusively male act.\r\n\r\nThis undermines and stigmatises the experiences of many victims. This must change, if we wish to pursue gender equality in this country.",
