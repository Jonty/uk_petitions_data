This means people who are stanuchly against austerity but for BREXIT will be forced to vote for Conservative MPs. Or those who are stanuchly against a labour government but also against Brexit will have to vote to get in a government they don't want. To see the kind of Brexit the people want hold a referendum asking that question not a GE!",
