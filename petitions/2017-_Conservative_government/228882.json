        "additional_details": "The government has chosen (quite rightly) to construct a memorial to the Holocaust. We believe that the Holodomor was horrific enough to merit this same recognition. A memorial to those who died in the Holodomor (some 7.5 million people, according to some estimates) would serve as a message that the UK truly rejects this kind of evil in whatever form it takes, whether blatant or less conspicuous and whether from the left or the right of the political spectrum.",
        "background": "The Holodomor was a famine that occurred in the years 1932-33 in what is now Ukraine. It is recognised as genocide or as a criminal act of the Stalinist Regime by 22 countries. While the undersigned support the government's decision not to join these countries, we believe it deserves recognition.",
