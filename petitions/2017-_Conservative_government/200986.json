        "action": "Abolish tuition fees",
        "additional_details": "With more people attending university than ever before and it becoming more and more necessary in order to succeed in the world of work, our young people are being left saddled by huge financial burdens that can often lead to anxiety among students. In modern Britain education should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it. Even with measures which attempt to relieve this burden, the problems created by this debt can only be resolved in one way: abolishing them entirely.",
        "background": "Charging students for a near-essential requirement for future employment is discouraging even the best and brightest students from furthering their education and achieving their full potential, leaving students in \u00a336,000+ of debt before even starting work. Education is a right, not a privilege.",
