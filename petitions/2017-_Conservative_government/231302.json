        "additional_details": "The rollout of Universal Credit has left many people in poverty. \r\nOnce a person has claimed UC, all their benefits stop until the UC claim has been processed. \r\nThis takes around 5 weeks to process.\r\nWe believe the Government should abolish the waiting time for a claimant to receive their money. \r\nFamilies face a choice of heating or eating. \r\nIn 21st century Britain this is wrong.\r\nAbolish the 5 week waiting period now!",
        "background": "The new Universal Credit replaces JSA, Income Support, ESA, Housing Benefit, Tax Credits and Working Tax Credits.",
