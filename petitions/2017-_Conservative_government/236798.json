By re enstating the act it will clean up some of parliament.  By failing to re enstate the act ,  it will show completely how corrupt this government is.",
        "background": "Tony Blair amended the treason laws so no government officials can face criminal charges for treasonous acts. This has led to a free run for officials to commit treason against England and the citizens. This now needs to be reversed to bring trust back to the people. Untouchable peers is dangerous.",
