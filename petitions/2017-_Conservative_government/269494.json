        "additional_details": "Woodlands currently cover just 13% of the UK. We can double the area of woodland to 26% through a penny-in-the-pound rise on income tax for just 10 years. This would raise roughly \u00a36 billion a year. With the average acre of pasture costing \u00a37500, it would be possible for the government (and the people of the UK) to buy at least 800,000 acres of suitable pasture and upland a year. This land should be forested, protected and gifted to current and future generations as great commons and reserves.",
        "background": "Let's double the size of the UK's woodlands by creating great forest commons and woodland nature reserves. Doing so will help nature restore, tackle the climate crisis, reduce flooding and make wonderful places for people and wildlife.",
