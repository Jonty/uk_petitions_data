        "action": "Restrict social media use by children to help prevent cyberbullying",
        "additional_details": "Social media / video-sharing websites are often used as a way to bully other children, and in some cases teachers too, something from which the victim has no opportunity to escape, even at home.\r\n\r\nChildren should not be posting content online, until they have reached an age at which they have been fully educated about its use/misuse, can understand the emotional damage bullying online may cause, and the legal ramifications of broadcasting inappropriate content or making libelous remarks online.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to consider new laws, banning the posting of content to social media / video-sharing sites by under-18s. \r\n\r\nChildren should be focussed on developing real life social skills, and deserve a childhood free from the pressures and bullying which go hand in hand with social media use.",
