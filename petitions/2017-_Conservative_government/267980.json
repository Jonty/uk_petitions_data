They are just charities not a registry and cannot help everyone especially with those that have more the one disability - dogs, trainers and resources are in extremely short supply. Businesses such as airplane companies and shops refuse entry to any dog that isn\u2019t ADUK trained, thus discriminating everyone else.",

It should also be made clear to all businesses including airplanes etc that there is no registry for assistance dogs.",
