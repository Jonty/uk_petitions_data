        "additional_details": "With supermarkets being one of the largest contributors in consuming large sums of plastic, (especially in food packaging). Over time, with so much of this left over waste still remaining as a large proportion of plastic products are not 100% recyclable, are then left to decay over a period of months and then years, only left for marine life to consume. With micro-plastics being one of the biggest threats to sea life, every year upon thousands of life die each year, continuing will only make things worst.",
        "background": "With 300 million tons of plastic being produced globally, as a result a huge scale of these plastic products used are being dumped into our oceans, drastically damaging the life and sustainability of marine life.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government and Parliament to make a new law requiring retailers and supermarkets to reduce the amount of plastic they use by a certain amount, if that's what you want to happen. \r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition instead:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200189\r\n\r\n\r\n"
