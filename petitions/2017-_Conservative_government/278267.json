Some councils however, are driven more by profit than people and will issue licences to questionable individuals without the be necessary checks or oversight.",
        "background": "Passenger safety is paramount. Currently, a taxi operator can be rejected for a licence in one area but approved in another due to different licensing standards set by individual local authorities. Once a licence is obtained, the driver can operate anywhere, including the area they were rejected.",
