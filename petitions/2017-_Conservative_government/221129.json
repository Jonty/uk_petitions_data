        "action": "Exempt overseas doctors coming to work in the NHS from Tier 2 visa caps",
        "additional_details": "Today in hospitals all across the country, doctors on the front lines of the NHS are staffing critically undermanned medical rotas.\r\nThe strain of this is being acutely felt by all of us everyday, as we struggle to deliver safe care to our patients. The Doctors' Association UK are astonished that several hundred doctors are being refused their tier 2 visas to work in an NHS that desperately needs them. DAUK demands that doctors coming to work in the NHS are exempt from Tier 2 visa caps.",
        "background": "On 3rd of May The Doctors' Association UK launched their campaign, Scrap the Cap. Since December over 400 doctors have been denied Tier 2 visas to take up jobs in the NHS. Yet there are reportedly 100000 vacancies across frontline services. We call on Theresa May to exempt doctors from visa caps.",
