        "action": "Pay student nurses for placement hours.",
        "additional_details": "Bursaries for nurses have been scrapped. Many of us are working part time, some even full time hours, as well as the 37.5 hours of placement, just to get some money coming in. A lot has been said about mental Heath recently, the number of suicides in universities is rising. These statistic resonate with me because the amount of work I do to get by is a big strain on my mental health, the stress, the financial worry, the lack of rest. So I\u2019m calling for a minimum living wage for student nurses.",
        "background": "being a student nurse is a real struggle, and being a student nurse, having to work 37.5 hours a week and paid nothing, is even harder. As a student we need to make up 2,300 clinical hours of hospital hours, as stated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, so that we can join the register.",
