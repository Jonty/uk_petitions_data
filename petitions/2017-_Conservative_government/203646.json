        "action": "Keep the Rapid Response Vehicle on Canvey Island, Essex",
        "additional_details": "A family member recently suffered a heart attack at home on Canvey and the RRV arrived within 2 minutes. Emergency medical care was carried out and she was then taken to Basildon Hospital by ambulance. If this RRV had not arrived so promptly then sadly my sister would not be here today. By removing the RRV from Canvey it will leave the whole community of over 40,000 in a vulnerable position when waiting for the emergency services to arrive as they will be travelling from much further away.",
        "background": "The rapid response vehicle that is tethered to Canvey Island is being axed and will no longer be based on the Island. This will cause longer waiting times for medical care at accidents and emergencies and could take 20 minutes for an ambulance to arrive for someone having a heart attack.",
