        "additional_details": "It should be compulsory for football broadcasters to offer an option, perhaps by way of \u2018the Red button\u2019, where it\u2019s just ambient crowd noise i.e. no commentary. \r\n\r\nThis would allow people who get frustrated with football commentary to enjoy the atmosphere of the games and not feel the need to mute the entire audio signal.",
        "background": "More often that not, UK football commentators supplement the ambient crowd noise with a combination of statistics gleaned from Wikipedia and the identification of the player in possession of the ball - something the viewer can often manage simply by looking at the TV set.",
