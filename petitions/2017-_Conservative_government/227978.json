        "additional_details": "Today, yet again commuters using the M25 are stranded due to a HGV freight collision closing the QEII bridge.\r\nWhilst this may seem unrelated, our small vessels pass underneath, with nearly no other vessels in site for miles.\r\nA free, reliable transport mode able to move thousands of tonnes a day and relieve the neighbouring roads of HGV movements.\r\nWhy is more not being done to retain the use of the waterways?  Shipyards are in decline.  Skills are in decline.  We must act, before it is too late",
        "background": "Having operated vessels on the Thames, I am saddened by the surrounding decline of practical opportunities for utilising our glorious river sustainably for freight.\r\n\r\nWe must ask government to assess whether enough resource is available for industry to thrive and prefer water transport over road.",
