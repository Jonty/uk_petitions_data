        "additional_details": "I'm asking for this to be debated in parliament and for UEFA to be questioned to why this is acceptable and for reasoning. The fans aren't allowed to support their team in the biggest matches in their history. Why should a larger percentage of the neutral get to enjoy someone else's day. A fair allocation policy needs to be implemented and considered when choosing cities to host these events. Example; Baku airport can only support 15000 tourists. But they hosted 85000 for the grand prix in 2018.",
        "background": "As a football fan, I'm sick of seeing a poor allocation towards real fans for competition finals in Europe and across the globe. For example, 12000 of a 68000 stadium in Baku for the Europa league final and 16613 of 67800 allocation for the Champions league final.",
