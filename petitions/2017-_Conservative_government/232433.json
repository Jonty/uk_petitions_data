        "action": "Amend the law and reclassify the meaning of 'intentionally homeless'.",
        "additional_details": "Conventional wisdom would say that if a tenant is served notice by a landlord, then they must leave. However, local councils are increasingly encouraging tenants to remain until a landlord is able to obtain a County Court Judgement in which bailiffs forcibly remove a tenant as this is the only way a tenant can qualify for long-term rehousing under the current law. This is cost prohibitive to both tenants and landlords and must be changed- being served 'notice' is not an act of intentional homelessness",
        "background": "At present, under the law, tenants who are served 'notice' are encouraged by their local council to remain in their home; for, if they leave, they are bizarrely classified as 'intentionally homeless' and are unlikely to be housed as a priority.",
