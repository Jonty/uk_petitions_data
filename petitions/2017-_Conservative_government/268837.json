        "additional_details": "Currently the concensus on how much damage e-cigarettes do is still out as they have not been around long enough.

        "background": "Currently every bus stop, tube carriage and magazine is plastered with advertisements for companies such as Juul and others advertising e-cigarettes as a fashionable accessory. In reality it is just another tool for the tobacco industry to hook a new generation onto an ultimately addictive habit.",
