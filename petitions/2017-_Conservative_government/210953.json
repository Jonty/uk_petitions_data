        "action": "Vote for whether there should be another EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "This means that the government must hold another referendum as the people of the nation voted for it, and must not neglect democracy. Lies were made in the campaign for Brexit, and politicians have not been held accounted for that. I personally believe that false hope does not represent democracy and there was no transparency. Furthermore, the people did not know what they voted for and they have the right to vote again, now they understand consequences. You must ask the people to vote again.",
        "background": "HM Government says that if there is another referendum, then Democracy is broken. Therefore, I am calling for a vote on whether another referendum should take place, which means Democracy is not broken as the people have chosen to have another referendum if it is voted for.",
