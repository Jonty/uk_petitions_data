        "additional_details": "On the bus there is a yellow safety rail which comes down to help keep wheelchair in place however the majority in my experience have been bolted and unable to be used. This means that when bus is driving fast the wheelchair slides all over the place even with the breaks on and at times crashing into other passengers/ Prams or seats which can cause damage to the chair.\r\nMore awareness is needed to solve these issues.",
        "background": "When using public transport such as a bus there needs to be a huge improvement in helping make them disabled friendly.\r\nIn my experience a lot of bus drivers complain and on occasion make a scene when having to take down the ramp to allow wheelchair users access to the bus.",
