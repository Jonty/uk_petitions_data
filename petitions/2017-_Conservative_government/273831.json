        "additional_details": "Some students can not work during their time of study due to class schedules and work load. This causes an impact on the parent and their finance. Not only does this affect parents but also causes stress to the child as well as student funding loan does not always cover everything. Further more, this petition will bring family\u2019s together as relieve financial stress off parents. In the EU child maintenance is compulsory until the child is financially independent therefore should be the same.",
