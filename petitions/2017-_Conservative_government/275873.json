        "additional_details": "The change in financial arrangements is fundamentally unfair and should be revised because:\r\n\r\n1. It has a disproportionate long term financial impact upon students from lower and middle income families and in comparison with students from previous years and other parts of the UK\r\n2.It results in an additional element of inequality for English students in being able to access higher education compared to the financial support available to students from the rest of the UK",
        "background": "It was announced in July 2015 that from August 2016 the student maintenance grant was to be replaced by a maintenance loan subject to repayment. This was insufficient notice of a significant change and results in an unfair additional long term financial burden on English student cohorts from 2016.",
