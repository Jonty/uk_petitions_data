It should be illegal for these adverts to be hosted by online marketplaces.",
        "background": "While it's illegal to buy and sell seahorses (dead, alive, whole or in part) within Europe, online platforms flout this law by hosting adverts for their sale. Seahorses could therefore be functionally extinct in 25 - 30 years* (based on 150 million + seahorses per year taken from the sea).\r\n",
