        "additional_details": "The action which could be taken would be for the government to look into Eco-friendly options to replace the coffee cup. \r\n\r\nThe government also need to raise awareness to all consumers of disposable hot drinks, that, although they are supposed to be disposable, in reality very few are, because they cannot be recycled.",
        "background": "In the UK we use 7 million coffee cups every day. Even though coffee cups are classified as recyclable, only 1 per 400 cups is able to go through the recycling process the rest go into landfill due to the way they are manufactured. To protect our environment the government need to take action.",
