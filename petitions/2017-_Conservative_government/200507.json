        "action": "Install security checkpoints at every underground transport station in the U.K.",
        "additional_details": "Global cities more densely populated than London require passengers to place large items on scanners before proceeding to trains and metros. Metal detectors are also used to detect weapons and explosives. It is currently too easy to bring dangerous articles into confined stations in the U.K. wherein likelihood of injury and fatality from terror incidents increases. Requiring random searches of passengers and staff entering these stations could also mitigate the possibility of unfair profiling.",
        "background": "Given the increasing prevalence of terror attacks in major U.K. cities, discuss reforms of national transport security policy. Initially install baggage scanners and metal detectors at underground stations and conduct random searches (not based on profile) of passengers crossing station checkpoints.",
