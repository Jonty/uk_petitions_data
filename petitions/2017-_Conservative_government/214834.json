Without this licence from the Home Office to use medicinal cannabis Alfie's seizures will return to over 150 a month each requiring hospitalisation. He will not have the quality of life he deserves. The only treatment he responds to in the UK causes psychosis, organ damage and early death. The family should not have to accept this. The licence should be granted, Alfie is a patient not a criminal. He needs access to his medicine.",

He was treated with it in Holland and his seizures reduced from 150 to 1 seizure a month. Alfie should not have to break the law to access his medicine. He needs this medicine to live.",
