You can find out more about this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public\r\n\r\nThe owner can get an unlimited fine or be sent to prison for up to 6 months (or both) if their dog is dangerously out of control. They may not be allowed to own a dog in the future and their dog may be destroyed.\r\n\r\nYou can find out how to report a dog here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/report-a-dog\r\n\r\nWe're therefore not sure what additional action you'd like the Government or Parliament to take."
