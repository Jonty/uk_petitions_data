        "action": "UK Government to impose trade sanctions on Venezuela, over human rights abuses.",
        "additional_details": "Why should the UK Government fund a tyrannical state? A state that ignores International Human Rights Agreements, that they even co-signed. A state where the detention of the opposition is natural. In 2015, Venezuela exported $286 million worth of goods to the UK - most of which was mineral products (99.2%). The UK exports to Venezuela in 2015 amounted a total of $318 million. Although Venezuela may be an attractive source of investment for UK firms, I urge them to stop. Simply because the trade revenue enables Pres Maduro's suppression of basic human rights. The UK should impose embargo on the nation until democracy has been restored.",
        "background": "Democracy has been betrayed in Venezuela. With top opposition politicians like: Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma, being unlawfully arrested. The severity of the political crisis has triggered mass protests for months. Protests resulting in: nearly 5000 arrests; 163 deaths; 15,000 injured.",
