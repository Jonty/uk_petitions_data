        "action": "Stop the state pension reducing tax allowances for working pensioners",
        "additional_details": "What the government should do is change the law so the state pension doesn't count towards someone's personal tax allowance if they are working. Having completed one working career paying for that pension, the government should allow people to continue to work without having their tax code reduced. This double tax on pensions puts people off continuing to contribute to society. The well being of remaining part time in work reduces a burden on the state. State pension is a PAYBACK and not an additional income!",
        "background": "Many people remain in work beyond retirement age training the next generation. Some work because they need to top up their income rather than turn to the state for benefits. Decreasing tax codes re-taxes PAYBACK of money already paid in tax. This was not an investment but saving.",
