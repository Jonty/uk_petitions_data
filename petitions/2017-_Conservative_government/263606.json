        "additional_details": "When we buy a wheelchair we should be as protected as we are when we buy a baby or child seat for a car. \r\nWe feel that wheelchairs which have been crash tested MUST be marked VERY CLEARLY by means of a simple, protected and easily understood badge or symbol to show that this is the case and that they are safe to travel in when properly constrained (usually using straps and clamps) in a vehicle designed or modified for the purpose of carrying disabled people when travelling in their wheelchairs.",
        "background": "We have found that even the larger retailers of wheelchairs don't know if a wheelchair has passed a crash test. Retailers often fail to check and subsequently sell people wheelchairs that aren't crash tested.\r\nWheelchair users assume that they will be sold the correct, safe type by the retailer.",
