        "action": "stop the introduction of mandatory black box data loggers on new cars from 2022",
        "additional_details": "There has been no option made in the proposal to give drivers the choice if they want the data logger fitted, which  could eventually lead to insurance companies accessing details, the police for potentially retrospectively issuing fines. There has been no consideration shown to the privacy of drivers throughout this proposal and would effect the new car market along with the second hand market as new cars are resold with the technology already fitted.",
        "background": "The new proposed ruling if voted through in the EU later this year would result in an invasion of privacy for drivers purchasing new cars or commercial vehicles as the data logger would record details of action taken while driving and more importantly the location of the vehicle.",
