Their threat to disrupt the composition of the upper house is therefore an unnecessary power-grab and is likely to result, yet again, in legal challenge.\r\n\r\nThey must avoid this course of action and the embarrassment to the Crown that it would cause, by involving Her Majesty in party politics.",
        "background": "The Government is threatening to pack the House of Lords with its supporters in order to assure the passage of its controversial Brexit Bill.\r\nThis would undermine the UK's delicate unwritten Constitution and give yet more power to the Executive at the expense of Parliament.\r\nIt must be stopped.",
