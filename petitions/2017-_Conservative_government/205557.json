        "action": "Reverse the planned ban on letting agent fees to tenants",
        "additional_details": "A ban on fees to tenants will simply push these costs onto landlords who are a long way from all being able to afford them. This will drive up rents and drive down standards and, crucially, reduce supply as landlords are squeezed on top of recent tax changes. Asking prospective tenants to make a reasonable contribution to the vetting process is in no way unreasonable and a cap is a perfectly workable compromise. The Government\u2019s broken housing policy needs private landlords right now.",
        "background": "The UK Government is currently putting a bill through Parliament to ban letting agents or landlords from charging any fees to tenants for renting a home. This ban will likely put costs to tenants up so we would like to see it reversed before primary legislation is passed as a cap is more appropriate",
