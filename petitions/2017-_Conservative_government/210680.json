        "additional_details": "The new design does not:- \nDisplay the Yorkshire Rose\nInclude any nod to football\nGive any reference to the famous 'Smiley'\nShow the famous LUFC\nPay homage to our past (ie 1919)\n\nThe new design does:-\nFeature a headless man\nResemble American/MLS badges more than their English contemparies\nHave undertones of thug culture rather than the progressive image our club battles to portray.\n\nThese are my views which I believe are shared by many",
        "background": "Today (24/1/18) Leeds United AFC unveiled their new badge after 'consulting' 10,000 fans. We hope to receive more support against the horrendous new design.",
