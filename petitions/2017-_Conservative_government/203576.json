Details of all instances are present in the Official Report of Parliamentary debates (\"Hansard\").\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has prevented several bills, many of which deserved a fair hearing, from being reasonably discussed in Parliament, and places the position of one MP above that of all others.",
        "background": "On several occasions in the past five years, several MPs have spoken for an excessive time during Parliamentary debates. This behaviour prevents reasonable discussion, placing themselves above all other MPs.\r\n\r\nThis tactic is disgraceful, anti-democratic and has no place in a modern Parliament.",
