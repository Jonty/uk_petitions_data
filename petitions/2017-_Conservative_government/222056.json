        "additional_details": "Check the TFL ULEZ to confirm the above & I can guarantee 99% your vehicle will not be ULEZ permissible, therefore you will have to pay the daily charge. This will affect social living, household chores, children\u2019s social activities as you will not be able to drive your car anytime. So the mayor of London is saying change your car to newer ones costing thousands or pay up. Help sign this petition so the government will review this decision. Ask yourself the question, how does the mayor travel?",
        "background": "The mayor of London is implementing the ULEZ to central London i.e in the congestion zone area from April 2019. He is now expanding this to inner London so this is the majority of London postcodes who will be affected and will have to pay \u00a312.50 PER DAY. We need to put a stop to it.",
