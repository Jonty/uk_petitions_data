        "action": "Extend Paternity Leave for Fathers with fairer statutory pay rights.",
        "additional_details": "2 weeks is a dire amount of time for fathers to have with their newborn. If labour is complicated, this time could potentially all be spent at the hospital bedside of the mother with no time to bond with their child in the home. Studies show fathers staying at home leads to decreased post natal depression, and increased child development. Women currently get 39 weeks off at Statutory, with the first 6 at 90% whilst men get two weeks at Statutory only. This should be 12 weeks leave with 3 at 90%.",
        "background": "In a world where we have made great progress on gender pay gaps and equality for women, we now need to address the shortcomings placed upon fathers when they introduce a new life into the world by giving dads longer paternity, with pay at 90% for X amount of weeks so they can better support mothers.",
