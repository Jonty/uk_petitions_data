        "background": "The M4 reduces from three lanes to two at junction 38 (Port Talbot) and remains that way until the motorway ends at junction 49 (Pont Abraham).\r\n\r\nThis needs to be increased to three, to help cope with more traffic pressures from thousands of new homes being built in the area.",
