        "additional_details": "Before the 2008 crisis, from 1998 to 2007, savers earned \u00a3233 billion in interest. Following it, from 2008 to 2017, they earned just \u00a3129 billion because banks fail to pass on rate rises announced by the BoE.\r\nInterest rates cost savers at least \u00a3100 billion in interest payments https://dailym.ai/2ot5PJ3 \r\nMillions of savers are being hit by rip-off rates https://dailym.ai/2PzyEin\r\n \r\nWe request that our MP's debate this in Parliament and create a new law that will enforce timely equitable treatment for interest rates on savings and retrospectively make good the deficit.\r\n",
        "background": "This last decade's rock-bottom interest rates cost savers at least \u00a3100 billion in interest, because banks are quick to raise rates on loans & mortgages after BoE hikes, but are reluctant to offer the same, timely hikes for savings. Savers see this as immoral an highway robbery on our High Streets.",
