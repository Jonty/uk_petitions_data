Award continued to be paid to tenant. Minimal repayment plan refused by tenant, tenant now has DRO in place, landlord unable to pursue tenant further. A Deposit of \u00a3500 is held with DPS but tenant refused to agree repayment to landlord. One bad tenant can have a detrimental affect on decent ones",
