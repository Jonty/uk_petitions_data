We demand that parliament is dissolved and the people have an election and decide who they want to fight for them. A second referendum will not work as it won't change the people who currently bicker and continue to destroy this country. Any potential deal will weaken the UK for both sides we need new MPs to decide.",
        "background": "In 2016 we had a referendum on the EU, the most democratic exercise in our history. Since then parliament have done nothing but block or delay the process in total disregard to the people. It serves no purpose to either voters who voted for leave or remain.",
