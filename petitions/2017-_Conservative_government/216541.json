        "action": "Allow homosexuals to give blood freely",
        "additional_details": "At the moment there is a restriction applied to Homosexual men wish to donate blood. This restriction entails that Men can not donate within a three month period after having sexual intercourse with another male. This also applies to females who have had relations with someone who is bisexual and is listed with the above criteria.  This regulation is outdated, and a blatant form of discrimination as the grounds for these regulations do not reflect the homosexual populous.",
        "background": "All donated blood is screened and tested for STD's including HIV/AIDS. Therefore, why segregate an entire community from even attempting to donate. Most of which have 'clean' blood. We move to waive this restriction to increase the amount of blood that can be donated.",
