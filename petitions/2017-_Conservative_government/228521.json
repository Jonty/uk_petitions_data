        "additional_details": "It doesn\u2019t always include physical violence. Someone using offensive language towards you or harassing you because of who you are, or who they think you are, is also a crime. The same goes for someone posting abusive or offensive messages about you online.\r\n\r\nwe understand that this is a extremely personal matter for many citizens in the UK therefore we believe that lengthening the sentence is key to help deter people from committing these crimes.",
        "background": "What is hate crime?\r\nA racist hate crime is when someone commits a crime against you because of your ,  race,  religion, or any other perceived difference.Our aims are to lengthen the sentence as there is a minimal sentence and a fine in most cases which is unacceptable for the nature of the crime.",
