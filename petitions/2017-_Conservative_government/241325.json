This is one of the primary reasons our political system has stagnated to this broken mess. \r\n\r\nWe need to shock the system. We need to make sure MP's get paid enough to live, but not so much it blinds them to the realities of society.",

They also are allowed to claim a large amount of expenses each year. This puts MP's so far out of touch with those they are supposed to represent.",
