        "additional_details": "You can have children and get married at the age of 16 but you can not leave education to get a job or to follow the career path that you want. The education system holds the youth back from getting what they truly want in life, education is not for everyone and therefore you should not be forced to carry on with it if you believe you are ready to leave. By the age of 16 you have enough knowledge to understand and know what you want for the future and for you.",
        "background": "Many young people are carers or need to support their family and they shouldn't be forced into staying in education as this restricts them from getting the income that they need. Britain's youth should not be held back because of the education system.",
