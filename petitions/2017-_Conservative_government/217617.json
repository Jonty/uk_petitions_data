        "additional_details": "There do not appear to be any statutory restrictions on the the use of gas guns but the NFU has guidelines on their use:- https://www.nfuonline.com/assets/4662\r\n\r\nThe guidelines are largely ignored, the gas guns are inevitably plonked in a field and forgotten about.\r\nTheir proliferation has made the countryside sound like a battlefield.\r\n\r\nGiven how ineffective they are and the number of them that are thoughtlessly deployed (too many for local authority control). They should be outlawed.",
        "background": "Gas gun type bird scarers are used by farmers to scare birds from their crops.\r\nThey periodically make a series of loud bangs to scare the birds.\r\nThe loud bang also scares passers by, horse and dogs.\r\nThe birds return after a few minutes making them ineffective and a nuisance.",
