        "additional_details": "It seems the charges for a Vets prescription can vary from \u00a34.50 to \u00a320 and indeed could even be more. \r\n\r\nAs people can now buy medication for their Pets online at a much cheaper cost than from a Vet, it appears the cost of a prescription has gone up. Indeed if you buy your medications from your Vet there is no charge for a prescription just a huge mark up in price of the medication. \r\n\r\nEither way you look at it the public are being over charged without justification.",
        "background": "Before you can purchase some medications for animals online a perscription is required from a Vet. The amount Vets can charge for prescriptions is not regulated, which means some Vets are charging rediculous amounts.",
