        "additional_details": "The porn ban will inevitably push children towards using websites and systems to avoid age verification that will expose them to illegal and extreme material they would not have seen otherwise.\r\nThe porn ban allows for people to be matched with their online behaviour. Address, driving license and passport details will all be in the hands of MindGeek, which owns a vast amount of adult sites.This is a massive privacy issue. The consequences of a database leek would be debilitating for individuals.",
        "background": "The porn ban will inevitably start a culture of censorship in the UK. \r\nGiven the number of porn sites on the internet and VPNs, it is unreasonable to believe that under 18's will be unable to access porn.\r\nThe government needs to review its sex education policy, not restrict internet behaviour.",
