        "action": "I think school should be held Monday to Wednesday, giving us a longer weekend",
        "additional_details": "My evidence is that I am a pupil that doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy school and the amount of work to complete each week. If school time is reduced by a couple days per week then I would learn more. However, if this petition was approved holiday times would also need to be reduced, but not enough that we\u2019re still at school the same amount of time.",
        "background": "I believe that having school five days a week makes kids feel more negatively towards having to drag themselves there everyday. I think that if we reduce this to three days per week then kids will have a more positive attitude towards school and take more information in. Thank you.",
