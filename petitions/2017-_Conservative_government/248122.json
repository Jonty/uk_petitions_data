        "additional_details": "All they seem to do is regurgitate the same old excuses.\r\nThe 'lies on the bus' - a suggestion, not a promise.\r\nRussia got involved - an accusation with zero merit.\r\nIt's only advisory - Gina Miller's challenge & subsequent High Court rulings made it legally binding.\r\n\r\nWe had a vote and 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU, and everything that comes with it. \r\n\r\nWe knew what we were voting for, and no amount of brow beating from Remainers will make us change our minds.",
        "background": "Following the EU Referendum, we that voted to leave have constantly had our democratic rights overruled by those that think they are better informed, and think they know what is better for our future going forward. They think that 3 million asking to revoke A.50 circumvents the will of the people.",
