        "additional_details": "Dog ownership licences could be revoked upon a dog being mistreated or dangerous.\r\nResponsible dog owners would likely not hesitate to attend mandetory courses and a dog licence would discourage irresponsible or criminal dog ownership. \r\nA licencing scheme of this type would give the RSPCA and authorities more powers to enforce animal cruelty or dangerous dog legislation. \r\nAny fee charged for a licence could be used towards organising education and enforcing animal rescue operation and care.",
        "background": "The enforcement of a dog licence requirement would give new dog owners the opportunity to attend government led courses on the proper care and legal obligation of dog ownership.\r\nA scheme of this type would allow responsible dog owners to learn the best way to care for their family pet.",
