Do the government/banks get to keep it?\r\n\r\nWe believe any unclaimed money should be given back to the public through public services, help fund the NHS, improve education, and fight homelessness.",
        "background": "On the 29th August 2019, the deadline for claiming PPI refunds comes in to effect. \r\n\r\nWe are petitioning the Government to legislate that any unclaimed money after the deadline passes, should be given to: help fund the NHS and education, towards fighting homelessness, and official charities.",
