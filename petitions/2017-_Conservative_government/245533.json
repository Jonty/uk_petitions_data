        "additional_details": "The people of the UK voted in 2017 for candidates based on Party Manifesto pledges - Many of those elected on that platform have reneged on those pledges but claimed that the public voted for the individual not the party and that they are therefore free to disregard those manifesto commitments.  This is an affront to democracy and an insult to the will of their constituents.  By including a De Facto statement of their stance on customs union, ecj and single market, the ambiguity is removed.",
        "background": "In the event of not leaving the EU on 29th March 2019, a General Election becomes one possible option.  That being the case, the people of the UK should be allowed to choose their representative, and KNOW where that individual stands in respect of Brexit.  The Ballot paper should show this.",
