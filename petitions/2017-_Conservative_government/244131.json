        "additional_details": "Every year in the UK, over 3,000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under.\r\n\r\nMany companies will expect you to book off time as annual leave or take it unpaid and only a small amount allow time for such appointments without hinderance. This is an added pressure on top of the already scary process. \r\n \r\nFor such treatment I think employees should be free to not worry about their employer expecting them to book the time off.",
        "background": "Women shouldn\u2019t have to worry about taking time off of work for cervical screening. Loosing pay or not having enough holiday entitlement are horrific reasons women do not get screened. Companies should promote cervical screening by offering paid time off for it. This should be government backed.",
