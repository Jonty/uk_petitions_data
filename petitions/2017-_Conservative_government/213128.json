        "action": "Ban British citizens from serving in the Israeli military",
        "additional_details": "The Israeli military routinely commits acts which many experts believe, under international law, constitute war crimes - including occupying Palestinian territory; torturing suspects; bombing Palestinian schools, hospitals, and water plants; and conducting collective punishments of civilians - all of which are unlawful in international law. No UK citizens should be allowed to possibly contribute to further war crimes by serving in the Israeli military, police or security apparatus.",
        "background": "There are currently many British citizens serving in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The UK government should ban UK citizens \u2013 even if they hold other passports \u2013 from joining and serving in the Israeli military, police or other security forces.",
