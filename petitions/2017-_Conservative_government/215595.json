        "action": "Reform sentencing for online groomers",
        "additional_details": "As it stands, a sentence is generally a short custodial sentence which is then suspended. The name will be of the sex offenders register, and a SHPO in place. This is NOT enough and rates of re-offenders shows this. Much tougher sentencing is needed. Other measures are required as not one punishment fits all. There needs to be a massive reform. Each police force have stats, but its estimated 1 in 10 adult users have admitted to having a sexual conversation with a minor- knowingly.",
        "background": "Thanks to a change in the law in 2017, online grooming of a child is now a criminal offence. Many organisations and groups have been set up to gather intelligence for the police, and hand a suspect over. Online grooming is just as damaging as physical abuse on a minor.",
