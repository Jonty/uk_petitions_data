        "additional_details": "Meat and dairy provide just 18% of calories and 37% of protein, it uses the vast majority of farmland and produces 60% of agriculture\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture.If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.",
        "background": "Agriculture is one of the biggest contributors to global warming thus introducing a tax on agricultural products like meat and dairy will encourage people to consider how their funding of agriculture damages the environment in a vast amount of ways.",
