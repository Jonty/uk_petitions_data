        "additional_details": "We need funding for research into how to save babies born over 20 weeks and to introduce guidelines to ensure doctors help very premature babies.  The earliest baby to survive outside the womb was born at 21 weeks and 5 days. This was back in 1985. I believe that with the knowledge we have now about babies and the medical equipment we have I think we can keep, our children alive from this age and maybe lower. Give our babies a chance of life.",
        "background": "I went into labour at 22 weeks 2 days. When my child was born she was trying to breathe, but she wasn\u2019t helped. The doctors classed her as a \u201clate foetal loss\u201d and \u201cnon-viable\u201d. She wasn\u2019t legally classed as a baby and I never got a death certificate. I want this to change.",
