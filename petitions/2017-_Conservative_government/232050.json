        "additional_details": "I have a few friends who like me are Veterans but they suffer from PTSD. During the fireworks they are all effected by them and one of them hides in his garden shed so that his family doesn't see the state he gets into and he feels like he's back in Afghanistan.\r\nThen there are animals to think of. My dog is left shaking and cowering in a corner and it goes on for WEEKS. Why should I drug my dog to get her through it when QUIET fireworks can be used.",
        "background": "Fireworks should be about the visual effect not how big a bang it makes. So I want loud fireworks banned and only low noise or quiet fireworks are allowed to be sold",
