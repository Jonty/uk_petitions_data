        "additional_details": "For these and many other reasons, we demand that London be expelled from the UK and a new democratic capital be established to administer to the needs of the whole nation and not just a select few.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate demand is brought about by our capital's continued attempts to betray Brexit, the peoples of the UK, and democracy. We voted to leave the EU; no negotiation, no compromise, no extended withdrawal. If London stays in the EU, it stays in alone.",
        "background": "Over the past years, it has become clear that London, and more particularly the corrupt parliament held there, has nothing in common with the rest of the UK. It has also shown it total contempt for our democracy, our way of life and our future.",
