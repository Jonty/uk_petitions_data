        "action": "Dissolve Parliament until after Brexit given how MP's have betrayed the people.",
        "additional_details": "We are being told constant scare stories by most MP's about leaving without a deal, even though the EU exports three times as much to us. UK is the biggest market for the EU yet the CBI, Universities, (funded directly by the EU) IMF, Bank of England, the Treasury all tell us scare stories about leaving too. They all told us lies unless we joined the Euro, the ERM & that just voting leave will cause meltdown.\r\nUK has paid over \u00a3200 Billion net since 1973 with no end in sight. MP's must resign now.",
        "background": "MP's were elected in 2017 to carry out the will of the 64% of constituencies that voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 Referendum. They also voted and put into law the EU Withdrawal Act. Now we are being delayed from leaving on March 29th. Most MP's don't live in the real world & tell lies.",
