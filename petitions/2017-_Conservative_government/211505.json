        "additional_details": "Greyhound racing is a popular industry here in the U.K. Beautiful dogs race at ground-scaring speeds; the thrill making quick quid off a brutal bet - this all entices many dog-racing enthusiasts, betters and gamblers alike. However, the reality is greyhound-racing is cruel and disgusting. Over 10,000 greyhounds a year are tossed aside due to being \"useless\". Around 8,000 of these are retired. These poor dogs are then left to starve, abandoned, murdered, sold for dissection purposes and worse.",
        "background": "Greyhound racing must be banned in the U.K. This \"sport\" remains legal in 8 countries and one of them is the U.K. The sport is inhumane and over 10,000 greyhounds vanish/die every year. This is why we believe it has to stop . #YouBetTheyDie #NoGreyhoundRacing",
