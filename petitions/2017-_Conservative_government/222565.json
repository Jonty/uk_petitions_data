        "action": "Introduce a Licencing system for cyclists and tighten up cycle law.",
        "additional_details": "I once received verbal abuse from a cyclist feeling I was in the wrong. I had dash cam footage reviewed by the police who were horrified how many highway code points the cyclist broke. The cyclist could not be traced so no action was taken but it's typical of the lack of knowledge of cyclists.\r\n\r\nI am a horse rider, cyclist, motorcyclist, and car driver. The group I see least consideration for road users and frequent law breaking is cyclists.",
        "background": "Recently a facebook post caused horror and cyclists regularly show little regard for other road users and the law.\r\n\r\nPlease debate introducing a licence, at least with theory tests similar to other vehicles, which all cyclists must pass and must carry at all times and have 3rd party insurance.",
