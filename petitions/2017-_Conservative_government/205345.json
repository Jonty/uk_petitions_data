        "additional_details": "Electronic Arts recently received huge backlash on the lootbox system within their  game Battlefront II (www.reddit.com/u/EACommunityTeam - see comments). They are a form of gambling, designed to get people to spend  more money than necessary. This impacts children. You either get an in-game item (desired), or credits, which must be saved up to unlock a character. By definition, gambling is to 'take risky action in the hope of a desired result.' This petition is aimed at the Gambling Commission.",
        "background": "A lootbox is an item purchased within a  game, using real money, which when opened can either provide you with an in-game item, or game credits. This is clearly a form of gambling which isn't reflected within the games rating (should be 18+), nor is it declared anywhere when purchasing the game.",
