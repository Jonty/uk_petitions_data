About 45,000 applications for contact are made to Courts each year involving about 85,000 children. Cases take years to resolve causing unnecessary emotional harm. The worst affected are psychologically manipulated to sever all ties with a parent and other family members. It impacts a child\u2019s mental health, prospects and future relationships. Mothers and fathers are at risk of being alienated. It happens to good parents.",

Changes to legislation and Court practices are required to stop coercive and controlling behaviours that lead to unnecessary severance of family relationships and the emotional harm suffered by children/families as a result.",
