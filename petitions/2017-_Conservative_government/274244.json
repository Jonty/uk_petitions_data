        "action": "Increase the penalty point allowance for new drivers",
        "additional_details": "As a new driver, it can be quite daunting being a qualified road user. Something even more daunting is the pressure and worriment caused by the strict and exceedingly low penalty point allowance for new drivers. It is my belief that newly qualified drivers are less likely to commit traffic offences than those who passed their test many years ago. This rule is illogical and discriminative, hence I petition the government to increase the allowance of penalty points for new drivers.",
        "background": "Currently under the Road Traffic Act, drivers who have just passed their test will have their licence revoked if they receive six or more penalty points within the first two years of driving. This allows for only two mistakes which could simply be doing 31 mph in a 30 mph zone.",
