        "action": "Make employers give new fathers and new mothers the same parental leave",
        "additional_details": "If employers were forced to offer equal time off to new fathers and new mothers, it would help employers view women and men equally when hiring. Women and men would present an equal \u201cpregnancy risk\u201d. Providing men with the same time off work would help fathers bond with their children and enable them to take a more equal role in parenting. By not requiring equal provision, our legislation is indirectly upholding discrimination.",
        "background": "Maternity leave gives a woman valuable time with a new baby but entrenches her role as primary carer. Child raising is work that can, and should, be shared by fathers. Where employers offer maternity leave policies, these should be extended to apply equally to men and women.",
