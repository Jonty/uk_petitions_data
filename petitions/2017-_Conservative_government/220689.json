It has been proven that lowering the speed limit saves lives. \r\nIt was a dog this time - how long before it is a child?",

At Albion Gate, pedestrians,including many children,dog walkers,tourists,cyclists and riders, have no option but to cross in order to enter the park.\r\nThere is currently a 30 mph speed limit,which is often ignored.",
