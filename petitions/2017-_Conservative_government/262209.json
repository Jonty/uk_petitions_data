What about the people who can\u2019t afford private therapy, and what about the fathers mental wellbeing? Not once has my partners name been addressed for any follow up after care, don't fathers grieve the death of their child? I want this changing. I want both bereaved mothers and fathers to be offered instant one to one therapy VIA NHS when their child dies.",
