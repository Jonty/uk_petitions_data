        "additional_details": "The bereaved spouses of teachers receive different levels of pension benefits, depending on gender and sexual orientation. Men married to women are disadvantaged compared to those in all other legal relationships. Survivors receive 50% of their partner's pension accrued since 1972. However, only contributions since 1988 count towards survivor benefits for the husbands of female teachers. \r\nSee: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/occupational-pension-schemes-review-of-survivor-benefits",
        "background": "Men and women have always paid equal contributions into the teachers' pension scheme. However, widowers of women teachers continue to receive lower amounts than widows of men teachers. The DfE recently announced that spouses / civil partners of same-sex couples will receive equal benefits to widows.",
