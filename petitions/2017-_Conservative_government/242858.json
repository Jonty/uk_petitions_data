        "action": "To implement and legalise stringent plastic recycling plans in UK hospitals",
        "additional_details": "We want it to be a legal requirement that every UK hospital has a streamlined non-contaminated plastics waste recycling scheme. We call on the government to introduce new and sustainable methods of recycling this plastic, and to implore manufacturers supplying single-use plastic disposable items to develop more resource-efficient methods of sterilising and packaging products for use in the healthcare industry. www.wrap.org.uk www.who.int www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org www.recycle-health.org",
        "background": "Around 5 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated annually in the UK. There are no sustainable, formal recycling plans currently in place for healthcare-generated plastic waste. Whilst a proportion of this must be incinerated due to contamination, a huge amount is conventionally recyclable.",
