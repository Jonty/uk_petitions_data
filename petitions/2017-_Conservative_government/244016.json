        "additional_details": "Since the 2016 referendum vote the Government have prevaricated over leaving the EU. There is no agreeable offer from the EU in sight and those in favour of remain including, PM Theresa MAY and opposition leader Jeremy CORBYN want to maintain the status quo, which was not the defining outcome of the 2016, once in a generation, decision to LEAVE.\r\nPlease sign this petition directing our leaders to uphold the democratic vote our country made in the 2016 referendum. No if\u2019s no but\u2019s just LEAVE.",
        "background": "In 2016 the people of Britain were given responsibility by a vote in Parliament to decide on the fate of Britain within the EU.\r\nThe choices were clear, stay or leave. A majority of almost 17.4 million people voted to LEAVE. Everyone knew what they voted for as the then PM wrote to every household.",
