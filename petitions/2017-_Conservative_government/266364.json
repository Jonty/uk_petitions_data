        "additional_details": "The government supports Electric Vehicle adoption by providing a \u00a33500 subsidy on EV purchases and the OLEV grant to have a home charger installed.\r\n\r\nThere are mounting studies and scientific papers linking many health issues to poor air quality caused by burning fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nThis TV advertising ban would send the right message while costing the UK tax payer nothing.",
