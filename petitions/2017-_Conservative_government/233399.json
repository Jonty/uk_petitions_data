        "additional_details": "There are so many unsolved murders in the UK alone. I know these cases will get solved if the legal system realises how much psychics really can help and their abilities real. Think about the families wondering why their child was taken away from them with no real answers or explanations as to what happened. Psychics can help with all that and everybody knows it too. The police collect evidence then its left as a cold case. Alot of vital evidence gets hidden.. As it was reported in the news. We need psychics in the UK to work with the police and the police to act on what they are told. Too many families are being failed by the justice system and never get the justice they deserve",
