        "additional_details": "Psychiatric patients who aren\u2019t in a critical or unstable physical situation would benefit from alternative waiting room set ups and resus style departments.  Basic safety precautions should be put in place for furniture & bathroom designs.  Provision of RMNs on duty to interact with patients whilst they wait.  Side rooms available for highly distressed individuals & for those having to wait several hours to be seen.  Access to sensory & distraction items to ease anxiety/agitation.",
        "background": "Mental health among British citizens is a rising concern.  Standard Accident and Emergency departments are not suitable for patients experiencing a psychiatric crisis.  Busy, loud waiting rooms are discouraging to attending psychiatric patients and the facilities pose risks as well as unsettlement.",
