        "additional_details": "After 2 years of negotiations, multiple attempts by the media and Remain MPs, it looks like the result of the EU referendum won\u2019t be honoured by Parliament. \r\n\r\nI believe a petition and debate is required to show how strongly those who took part in the biggest democratic vote in our history feel about this.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to show Parliament that you won\u2019t vote again in future elections if the Brexit vote isn\u2019t honoured.",
        "background": "In 2016 the British public were asked to vote on whether to leave or remain in the EU. \r\n\r\nPoliticians from all parties made it clear what was at stake and the British public were fully aware we either stayed in the EU as members or left the EU including the Single Market and Customs Union.",
