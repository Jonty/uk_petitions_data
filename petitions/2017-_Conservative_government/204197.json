        "additional_details": "This petition is to raise awareness of the issues faced by HGV drivers across the uk with the lack of adequate rest areas available to them at a reasonable/no cost. With the DVSA imposing more regulations on drivers from 4/11/17 preventing HGV drivers stopping for their 45 hour legal weekly rest break in lay-bys, we demand that the government/department of transport start providing adequate,safe,hygienic and reasonably priced rest areas with a good standard of food and facilities.",
