        "additional_details": "During the current important Brexit negotiations, it is clear that some MPs and parties\u2019 standards of behaviour have fallen alarmingly short of what the electorate expects. It is simply not acceptable and totally irresponsible for MPs to knowingly mislead and lie to the public for their own self-interest and worse, not to face any repercussions for their actions. MPs should always behave honourably and the National interest should always be paramount in their minds.",
        "background": "We call upon all MPs to behave responsibly, as their electorate expects. This means always putting the National interest first, ahead of any personal or party gain. It also entails being honest and truthful in all communications and strict penalties to be imposed where serious violations occur.",
