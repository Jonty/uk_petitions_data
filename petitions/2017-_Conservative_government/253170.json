        "additional_details": "The UK should seek a meaningful, 12 month delay to Brexit. \r\n\r\nThe Government will renegotiate a deal with the EU which Parliament will then vote on by 31/12/19.\r\n\r\nShould this deal pass Parliament, on 05/03/20 the UK will hold a further referendum in which the choice will be to leave the EU with the agreed deal, or remain in the EU. \r\n\r\nShould this deal not pass Parliament, on 05/03/20 the UK will hold a further referendum in which the choice will be to leave the EU with no deal, or remain in the EU.",
        "background": "The constant squabbling, in-fighting and gamesmanship over Brexit is an embarrassment to the country. \r\n\r\nPublic trust in politics and politicians is low.\r\n\r\nAs more facts become known about the process of the UK leaving the EU, it is important to seek public opinion on the options available.",
