        "action": "Mandatory Electoral Commission scrutiny for governing party leadership elections",
        "additional_details": "An election for the leadership of a political party is deemed an internal matter and is regulated internally, as it involves only a small or tiny minority of the UK electorate (0.35% for the Conservatives). But when that party is in government, the result will determine the new Prime Minister. If an election of such importance is not subject to public scrutiny it makes a mockery of the UK\u2019s claim to be a leading open liberal democracy, and leaves the legitimacy of the result open to question.",
        "background": "Any election resulting in a new Prime Minister is crucial to the future of the whole country: it must be above reproach; free from irregularity. Thus it must be subject to public scrutiny, the mechanism for this being the Electoral Commission. This is not the case in any UK party leadership election",
