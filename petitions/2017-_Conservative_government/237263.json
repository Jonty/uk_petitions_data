        "action": "Return Koh-I-Noor diamond to India",
        "additional_details": "The UK snatched the diamond from Maharaja Duleep Singh, son of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh and took it to Britain. Maharaja Duleep Singh was only nine years old at that time! It is most unjust and unfair that the British took permission (by the Treaty) from a nine year old! The British at the time knew what they were doing was wrong. We would consider it wrong today. Hence I urge that we put things right and return Koh-I-Noor to India.",
        "background": "Koh-I-Noor is a large, colourless diamond that was found in Southern India in early 14th century. The 108-carat gem came into British hands during the colonial era. It has been a subject of a historic ownership dispute. It is high time it is returned to India.",
