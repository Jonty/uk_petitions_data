        "action": "Give the UK voters a Brexit confirmation vote, based on final separation terms.",
        "additional_details": "The current vote was on the basis of lots of unknowns, speculation and political spin.  The result was very close and the UK government have proceeded on the basis of the outcome as you would expect.\r\nAs the facts are emerging through the negotiations we should introduce a further checkpoint in the process to ensure the British voters can make a much more informed decision once the details of the separation agreement are finalised.",
        "background": "The UK voters were given lots of conflicting information regarding leaving Europe during the initial vote (political spin). It would be very prudent to allow the UK voters a second vote to confirm their wish to proceed, once the details of the separation agreement are known.",
