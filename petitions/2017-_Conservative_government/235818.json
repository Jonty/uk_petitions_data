        "additional_details": "If a second vote supports LEAVE, the Government should seek an extension, negotiate trade deals under WTO rules, close the UK\u2019s boarders, create the necessary infrastructure to facilitate trade, and in every way exploit the opportunities of a world leading nation.\r\nIf a second vote supports REMAIN, the Government should withdraw the UK\u2019s application to the leave, and resume membership on our original terms whilst continuing to exploit the opportunities of being an EU member.",
        "background": "Before the EU Referendum we were misled by MP\u2019s and Interest Groups as to the pros and cons of leaving the EU by promoting unsubstantiated facts. The Government should have negotiated a draft deal with the EU and presented facts prior to the vote; we are not incapable of making decisions on facts.",
