As an example of how bad things can get, letting agent Haslams in Reading recently sent the following estimate to a couple looking to rent a flat in the area. On top of their deposit and one month's rent up front, they were expected to pay a further \u00a3650 in tenant agency fees, plus a check in charge of \u00a3130.  This is insane! It also costs an additional \u00a3157.50 to process a guarantor application",

Letting agencies typically charge tenants around \u00a3337 in fees to rent a home \u2013 and many tenants in London are forced to pay over \u00a3400.",
