        "additional_details": "Quote from the RSPCA website about Rabbits, \u201cIn 2017, we investigated 2,428 complaints of neglect about rabbits and more than 2,000 bunnies were rescued by us last year.\u201d \r\nIf people were sent home for three days after choosing any pet, for example a rabbit, with all the relevant information on care and costs over its life time then the purchase would hopefully be better planned for. This would then hopefully lead to less animals being abandoned. Pets should not be an impulse buy.",
        "background": "At the moment you can walk into a pet shop and buy any pet. Some stores will offer advice for how to look after them but this does not stop impulse buying of animals. Making people wait 3 days would give them chance to think properly about whether they are making the right decision in buying a pet.",
