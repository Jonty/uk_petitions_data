This would then hopefully lead to less animals being abandoned. Pets should not be an impulse buy.",
        "background": "At the moment you can walk into a pet shop and buy any pet. Some stores will offer advice for how to look after them but this does not stop impulse buying of animals. Making people wait 3 days would give them chance to think properly about whether they are making the right decision in buying a pet.",
