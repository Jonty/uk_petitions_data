        "additional_details": "Riders can be seen throughout the UK weaving  and zigzagging through traffic, overtaking and squeezing through almost impossible spaces, in a kamikaze like attempt to deliver and get back to base and be on the road again. This gets worse when other delivery riders are near.  Intense rivalry between companies and even colleagues makes for dangerous situations.",
        "background": "Fast food delivery riders are under pressure to deliver as soon as possible, in some cases they have a set time, or lose money.  They can get on a moped with no training or experience.  All that is required is a provisional licence and a set of \u2018l plates\u2019.",
