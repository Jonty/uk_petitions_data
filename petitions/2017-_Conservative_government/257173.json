        "additional_details": "The Home Office began issuing new passports with all references to the European Union removed from 29 March 2019, the date on which the U.K. originally planned to leave the E.U.\r\nThey have stated that applicants will not be offered a choice, even though some old E.U.stock remains. As it is by no means certain that the U.K. will leave, and as many applicants hold dear the principle of holding an \u2018E.U.\u2019 passport, we should at least be offered a choice until such time as we actually leave the E.U.",

Applicants are not given a choice, even though old stock remains. I wish for all new U.K. passports to be issued with E.U. titles until the U.K. actually leaves the E.U.",
