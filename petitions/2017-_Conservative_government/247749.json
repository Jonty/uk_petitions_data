        "additional_details": "The referendum vote was won on the back of making this nation great and more prosperous. Until this can be delivered we need to reject anything else. \r\n\r\nIf the board of a business put forward a business plan to wing a botched idea without a plan which could severely damage the business, it would be rejected without thought. Why then are we the British public countenancing something which affects a multi-trillion pound economy and the livelihoods and good state of our country\u2019s future.",
        "background": "Revoke Article 50 until we\u2019re ready. We need a credible Leave plan which will deliver a successful outcome for our country or remain a full EU member.  If a Leave deal is presented which is good for our country, we should then trigger article 50 providing the two years we need to be prepared.",
