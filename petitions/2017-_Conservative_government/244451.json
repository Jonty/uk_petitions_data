        "additional_details": "The railway will destroy 7000 acres of land, 900 houses, 1000 businesses and 60 woodlands. \r\nHistoric Houses in the Chilterns, Buckinghamshire and Warwickshire will also be demolished.\r\n\r\nHS2 is mainly targeted at wealthier business men and women that will need to be at one of the cities quicker.\r\nMany commuters could pay less but just for a longer journey.\r\nThere will be no guarantee that HS2 will be a success and prices may be expensive.\r\n\r\nIf we stop HS2 now we can save billions of pounds and acres of environment so please sign this petition.",
        "background": "HS2 was originally had a budget of \u00a332.7 billion then \u00a356 billion but some are expecting for it to cost up to \u00a390 billion.\r\nThe government could use this money to advance existing lines, stop Austerity and Knife Crime.\r\n\r\nAswell as the government, taxpayers could pay \u00a380 Billion.",
