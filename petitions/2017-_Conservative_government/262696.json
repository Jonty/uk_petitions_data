        "additional_details": "In order to meet carbon reduction targets it may be necessary to curb the demand for flying (see the latest report from the Committee on Climate Change).\r\n \r\nRestricting or rationing the supply of flights, will also be needed but will be challenging, as decisions will need to be made as to which flights should be allowed. In a complementary way we need to shift our lifestyle towards one with different demands with a lower CO2 footprint, and not always strive to maximise the growth of everything.",
        "background": "We cannot ban flying; nor should we. It has brought many benefits, and just sometimes is the best way to get from A to B. But why we do we promote it, when it is the fastest growing contributor to climate change? Where the net impact of something is negative, it does not make sense to promote it.",
