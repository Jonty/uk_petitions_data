        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom failed to meet their diplomatic, military and moral obligations with respect to the Polish nation during the prelude to and aftermath of WWII. At Yalta, Churchill agreed that Stalin should keep the Soviet gains in Poland and that tens of thousands of veteran Polish troops under British command should lose their Kresy homes to the Soviet Union. In reaction, thirty officers and men from the II Corps committed suicide. Only 25 MPs at that time voted against Churchill plan!",
        "background": "The apology should recognise British's abandonment of the Polish nation and 200,000 troops of the Polish Armed Forces serving under the high command of the British Army during the conference in Yalta. The UK left Poland and Poles to the grip of Soviet tyranny.",
