        "action": "Hold a referendum in 2025 on whether to rejoin the EU following Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "There are so many arguments, debates and opinions on Brexit. Probably there is more now than before and during the referendum. Brexit should be accepted without delay - the delay is costing the nation and business money, that should be used for more important things. We will only know the impact AFTER the event - everything else is speculation based on opinions. This new referendum will allow the people to review their decision. If it is working, great, if not, then change. Everything changes.",
        "background": "Brexit is a democratic choice that has been made by the people. The many questions of how well informed the people were to make this choice is irrelevant. A new referendum is a test of the REAL impact of Brexit following the departure. A test of fact rather than a test based on speculation or fear.",
