        "additional_details": "1 in 5 people will be faced with someone who needs immediate cpr throughout their lives, yet only 39% say they are able to perform cpr. Every minute that passes increases mortality. By offering these courses It allows those who may not have the confidence, knowledge or funding to be able to intervene in situations where lives are at risk, and hopefully, make a difference.",
        "background": "Currently, first aid courses can prove quite expensive. When faced with someone in need, many don't have the confidence or knowledge to give first aid. Free courses can provide everyone with the skills and mentality, and allow them to be able to assist with first aid when needed.",
