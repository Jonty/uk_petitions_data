        "additional_details": "There have been cases in the headlines of children wrongfully removing from their families. There are Facebook groups of parents desperately trying to get their children home, usually without success. There are news articles and court hearings that have exposed mis-information, unfortunately children may have already been traumatised after being removed from their home, resulting in mental health issues, attachments issues and a ruined childhood.",
        "background": "Service users have made allegations with no way of proving if a worker is treating them unfairly. It should be a legal requirement for social workers to wear body cameras to establish if this is the case.",
