Not to mention the added 20% mark for speaking! Whereas at GCSE 9-1 level, exams are worth 100% of your grade and it's fully closed book - you must remember lots of quotes. \r\n\r\nSurely everyone has the right to take equal tests for equal qualifications?\r\n\r\nhttp://everythingenglisheducation.co.uk/everything-english-education-gcse-reforms-igcse-versus-gcse-guess-who-wins/\u201d",

But if you are more privileged and go to a private school, you can take IGCSEs. \r\nIGCSEs can be easier than the new GCSEs 9-1 but are considered as equal levels of education. Should the rich be able to pay for easier qualifications?",
