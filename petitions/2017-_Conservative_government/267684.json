Why can't the government pay for TV licence fees for the elderly. Removing it is just another small but backwards step in this countries obligation to care for the elderly and importantly support their carers. My fathers story isn't unique. He is just a normal person has he has been all his life so far. Sadly there are many like him.",
        "background": "Many of our elderly live alone with the TV as their friend and for some the only contact with the outside world is through their TV. My father for one. He suffers from Alzheimers and has the TV on from when he gets up in the morning to when he goes to bed at night.",
