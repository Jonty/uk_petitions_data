        "action": "Remove all MP`s from their positions who are trying to stop or frustrate Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "If all the MP`s in question put as much effort, as much intelligence, as much time, and as much thought into carrying out their instructions from the majority of the British electorate and carried out their will, our strength in the negotiations on exiting would be exceptionally strong thereby making our outcome and future much brighter. By simply all pulling in the same direction the EU dictatorship would be far weaker.\nOur MP`s need to recognise that we can`t be a little bit in and be out.",
        "background": "Whatever your take on Brexit there is a danger that a mockery is being made of UK democracy by MP`s trying to stop the will of the people in the ultimate vote. MP`s who are not willing to recognise this damage should be replaced with those with more integrity and understanding of what democracy is.",
