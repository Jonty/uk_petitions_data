        "additional_details": "I myself was at my lowest during Secondary school, mainly from the age of 14. Many schools offer out leaflets or other forms of propaganda to children with information to get help from but the truth is they/we can't always access the help. There's only ever really two options; Call a number or email somebody but what if that child has no access to a phone or internet? What if they're too scared or worried what will happen to them. What if they're too young to understand all of this?",
        "background": "Mental health is one of the worlds biggest silent killer. As study's show a wide range of mental health issues stem from childhood and teenage experience, I think we need to address how affected children are today. This is a big issue right now and it certainly needs addressing.",
