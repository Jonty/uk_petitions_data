For example, you could start a new petition asking for cyclists and bicycles used on the road to be tested, taxed, insured and registered. \r\n\r\nIf you want the Government and Parliament to introduce a licencing system for cyclists and tighten up cycle law, you may wish to sign this petition instead: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/222565"
