        "additional_details": "Police and Politicians appear unwilling to do anything to return OUR country to the peaceful, pleasant land it was, even as recently as 20 years ago. Terrorism, gang violence, restriction on real free speech rather than \u2018elite\u2019 approved speech, fear of speaking freely in case we are arrested, dragged through the courts and lose our livelihoods; filthy streets, etc. We pledge to make our country a safe and pleasant place to live by our own efforts from now on.",
        "background": "Peaceful and pleasant living in Britain is almost impossible now and all we see is things getting worse, not better.    We hereby take back control of our own lives and communities as we can no longer rely on or trust the Police to 'protect and serve' us, nor trust the Politicians to work for us.",
