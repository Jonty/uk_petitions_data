        "additional_details": "It\u2019s time to help all the poor animals, who get so scared some end up disfigured, or worse killed. Also Elderly people are often frightened and some people have even had them put through their letter boxes. Then there are the soldiers that have fought for our country and suffer with PTSD. Now it\u2019s time to help all the people and animals.  Only allow fireworks at organised events so these explosives are only handled by professionals. The only way is to stop selling to the public. Let\u2019s be honest every year there are more and more horror stories, it is time to stop this NOW",
        "background": "I am starting this petition to stop fireworks being sold to the public and only to be allowed at organised events. People have to listen to them for 2 weeks before bonfire night and 4 weeks after, then again at Christmas and new year, bonfire night is one night a year",
