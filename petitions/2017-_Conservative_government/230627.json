We rely on it from cradle to grave to ensure we can have healthy lives and guarantee us treatment regardless of our means. \r\nThe NHS is undoubtedly our greatest social creation which rose like a phoenix from the ashes of WW2.  Anuerin Bevan gave our country the first glimpse of a better nation, where collective caring and empathy could be realised. This should be celebrated on the new \u00a350 note.",
