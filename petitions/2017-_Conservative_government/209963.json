        "action": "No to a bridge over the channel, spend the money on tunnel trains and ferries",
        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson proposed this bridge to help us integrate more with the EU, didn't he lead the leave campaign? We voted to LEAVE the EU, and we don't need nor do we want any further links. What happens when the contractor decides to go bankrupt? Half a bridge? No doubt it would also be a target for terrorism? This is not wanted, not needed, and we the signatories of this petition do not wish for the bridge to go no further than the mouth of Boris Johnson.",
        "background": "There seems little point in even considering a bridge over the English Channel. The government could use the money to fund additional ferries and additional trains for the tunnel. The security at the French channel ports  is being subsidised by the UK taxpayer, a bridge would require more security.",
