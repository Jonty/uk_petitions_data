        "action": "Ban (Prospective) Employers asking about salary history from job applicants",
        "additional_details": "Some states in the U.S (e.g. New York city) has already passed the law (in 2017) prohibiting employers to ask about salary history in interviews or on applications.\r\nBy banning the question during the hiring process, employers will be required to offer jobs and compensation to prospective employees based on their own skills, merit and demands of the job, not gender, race or ethnicity.\r\nBanning salary history question is the next step to take in the fight to end the pay gap.",
        "background": "Law makers say asking about salary history continues the cycle of pay inequality and makes it harder for people to change careers/jobs. The salary question is a hidden,yet,pervasive form of discrimination. It enables employers to use potential employee's past salary to determine the salary to offer.",
