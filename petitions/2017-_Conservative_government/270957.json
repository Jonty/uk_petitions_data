        "action": "Stop allowing landlords to include a no pet clause for tenants",
        "additional_details": "It is ridiculous that at the rates of rent nowadays , landlords can still direct you not to keep any pet- even goldfish or budgies?? After all, all of us tenants pay huge sums in deposit  which can always be withheld for any real or alleged damage. Moreover, if a flat is rented unfurnished, what damage can a pet do? It is really frustrating that having the comfort of a pet such as a cat or a small dog is still considered to be a luxury only to be reserved for home owners.",
        "background": "It is known that having a pet, especially in the context of this demanding day and age, has a positive effect on our well-being and is not a luxury but a way of dealing with daily stress and exercising your basic human rights as an animal lover.",
