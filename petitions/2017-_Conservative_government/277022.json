        "action": "Stop 5G until more scientific data is in place about its effects on our health",
        "additional_details": "Most research on radiation so far has been focused on 2G, 3G and 4G electromagnetic waves and its effects. The new 5G technology is being put into place without certainty of its safety. According to the BBC there is a group of scientists and doctors who have written to the EU calling for the rollout of 5G to be halted. When the UK leaves the EU, the government should be weary of this issue and not follow the US in disregarding the concerns about this intensified radiation.",
        "background": "Concerns about the 5G radiation by scientists and medical professionals are being ignored by major networks in the UK. We demand more testing of this new kind of radiation and a suspension of the service until it has been proven safe for us and our environment on the scale it's intended to be used.",
