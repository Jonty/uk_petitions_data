This is an outrageous fee for utility giants to charge and it is customers who have to bear the brunt.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no cap on how much these companies can charge for paper bills. A ban would prevent utility companies from charging this fee.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1 - https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-6748633/The-paper-bill-rip-Telecoms-giants-charging-36-year-posted-statements.html",
        "background": "Around 4.5 million UK adults did not use the internet in 2018.\r\n\r\nMost utility companies are now charging an additional fee, currently uncapped, for customers who wish to receive paper bills. This is simply not fair on those who do not have access to the internet.",
