This is an outrageous fee for utility giants to charge and it is customers who have to bear the brunt.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no cap on how much these companies can charge for paper bills. A ban would prevent utility companies from charging this fee.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1 - https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-6748633/The-paper-bill-rip-Telecoms-giants-charging-36-year-posted-statements.html",
