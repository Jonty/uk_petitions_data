        "additional_details": "After 20 decades of looting, corruption and tyranny, the people of India are owed an apology for just one of the many atrocities committed during this period. In true British fashion, the empire claimed that there were 379 casualties following the massacre, however the true figure is stated to be over 1000, although this figure could never be officially determined. Despite the number of deaths, the loss of lives were never apologised for and it\u2019s time to atone.",
        "background": "British leaders have carefully avoided a direct apology for this disgraceful massacre and it is time for acknowledgement and atonement. While it is no fault of any living PM, an apology would at least touch the surface of the hearts of the families and the generations whose lives were affected.",
