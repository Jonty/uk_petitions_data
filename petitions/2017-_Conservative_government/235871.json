In most cases, it\u2019s the impact that a health condition has on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for support or protection under the law.\r\n\u202f \r\nYou can find out more about showing that you're disabled under the Equality Act here:\u202f\u202f \r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/showing-you-re-disabled-under-the-equality-act/\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign this petition to raise awareness of endometriosis among young women and medical professionals instead:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231911\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could start a similar petition calling for the Government to raise awareness among PIP assessors and job centre staff."
