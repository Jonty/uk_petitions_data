The remaining 16 million registered could've hugely impacted the end result if they'd only bothered to vote.",
        "background": "The turnouts for general elections are extremely low. On average only 60% of registered voters actually take part. The remaining 40% remain passive despite the fact that they're UK citizens and the outcome greatly affects not only them, but their family and friends.",
