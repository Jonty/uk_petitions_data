In 2018, CAFCASS published a new Child Impact Assessment Framework to support practitioners in their assessment of complex factors that may have an impact on children. The framework consists of four guides, one of which is specifically on child refusal or resistance to spend time with one of their parents, including parental alienation. CAFCASS says that all private law practitioners will receive mandatory training in applying the framework, with training expected to have been completed by March 2019. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the framework here:\r\nhttps://www.cafcass.gov.uk/2018/10/11/cafcass-publishes-new-assessment-framework-for-private-law-cases/\r\nhttps://www.cafcass.gov.uk/grown-ups/professionals/ciaf/\r\n"
