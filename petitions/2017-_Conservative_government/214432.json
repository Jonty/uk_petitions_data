NYE  won\u2019t be a time to be grateful or rejoice with loved ones. \r\nIt will be the most harrowing time of the year. \r\nI'm guessing you know someone like Sonya?\r\nLets change. Lets Help.\r\nThere is no losing party in this plan, no-one can come off worse because the display is slightly less elaborate than last year's.\r\nThink about it. Please.",
        "background": "To contextualise since 2013 the display has cost over \u00a32m. \r\nCut the amount. Half it. Spend \u00a31 million instead of 2.\r\nTell the global media we have decided to support the most vulnerable in our society. \r\nThat should make better headlines than any firework display ever could.",
