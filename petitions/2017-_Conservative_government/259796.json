Larger companies are likely to have a much larger impact and so would pay accordingly. And large companies making changes and limiting their impact would be rewarded by paying smaller fees. \r\n\r\nThere are several different Carbon Offsetting / Neutral schemes available. The government should authorise a range so a choice is allowed.",
