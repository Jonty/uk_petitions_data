        "additional_details": "There can be a life after laboratories for suitable animals!!  Mandatory legislation will guarantee adherance to the law and will ensure that release & re-homings will be conducted officially and transparently for those animals who achieve the criteria in ASPA 1986. This will ensure that animals can enjoy normal lives in domestic enviroments once they have been socialised and domesticated properly, and re-homed to new owners who have been extensively checked as suitable.",
        "background": "An Advice Note was issued by the Animal Scientific Regulation Unit at the Home Office in 2015 encouraging research/ breeding facilities to re-home these animals but an Advice Note is not Mandatory.  There is evidence that animals are released under the radar or the advice is ignored.",
