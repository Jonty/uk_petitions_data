        "additional_details": "There is a widespread belief that the house buying process in England is unnecessarily long, stressful and tedious. The current process of instructing solicitors, applying for searches, resolving enquiries before then exchanging contracts and then agreeing dates of completion is convoluted and unnecessarily complex. This then puts a strain on families and discourages people from moving which then stunts the real-estate industry and national economy.",
        "background": "1. Sellers must provide information upfront. \r\n2. When a bid has been successful, the buyer's solicitor should confirm their mortgage with the lender, agree an entry date and deal with legal enquiries about the property. This is legally binding with deposit paid.",
