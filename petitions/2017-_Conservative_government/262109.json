Allowing 16 and 17 year olds to vote would ensure that our voices are heard which is important at the moment during such a political divide in society. It\u2019s unfair that the older generations, the majority of whom voted for Brexit, are currently deciding our future and not even asking us what we want. This must change now.",
        "background": "Brexit has dominated politics for the past 3 years yet the people who it\u2019s affecting most, the younger generations, aren\u2019t getting any say in what happens to our future. Instead politicians who have no idea how we\u2019re feeling about it try to sort it out. Well it\u2019s time now we had a say.",
