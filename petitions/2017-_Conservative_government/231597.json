        "action": "Revoke article 50",
        "additional_details": "If, by the  deadline  of January 21st, when the UK government presents it's withdrawal deal to allow a meaningful vote and its rejected by Parliament and there is insufficient time to organise a peoples vote by the cliff edge date of March 29th, then I petition the government to, in the short term, revoke article 50. After we have left the EU our choices are limited. This backstop buys time to secure cross party support for what we want from Brexit and to solve the Irish border conundrum .",
        "background": "The deadlines for securing a good Brexit deal are becoming dangerously close and the electorate is having doubts that the government can deliver what it promised. The ideological Brexiters are deaf to the economic truths of leaving the EU. Mr D Tusk has said on record that we can withdraw article 50",
