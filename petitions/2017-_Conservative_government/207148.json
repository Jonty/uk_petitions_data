Rules change. Signs change. Road layouts change. Change the licence requirements. DVSA could call the renewing licence holder for a \"check\" free of charge. If the licence holder passes their check DVLA will issue a renewed licence. If the holder fails the check their licence would be suspended until they pay for each check and pass.",
        "background": "Currently, driving licences last until the holder reaches 70 years, but the photograph on their licence must be updated every 10 years. \r\nAs an Approved Driving Instructor (ADI) I have to be re-tested every so-often to prove that I am \"up to standard\". Why not apply the same rule to all drivers?",
