        "additional_details": "Driving licence photos must be renewed every 10 years. MANY drivers say \"I couldn't pass my test again\". We (ADI's) are required to teach \"safe driving for life\". Rules change. Signs change. Road layouts change. Change the licence requirements. DVSA could call the renewing licence holder for a \"check\" free of charge. If the licence holder passes their check DVLA will issue a renewed licence. If the holder fails the check their licence would be suspended until they pay for each check and pass.",
        "background": "Currently, driving licences last until the holder reaches 70 years, but the photograph on their licence must be updated every 10 years. \r\nAs an Approved Driving Instructor (ADI) I have to be re-tested every so-often to prove that I am \"up to standard\". Why not apply the same rule to all drivers?",
