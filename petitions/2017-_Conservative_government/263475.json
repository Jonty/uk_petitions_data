        "additional_details": "The 2016 referendum , even if fairly run and not interfered in or biased by breach of electoral and campaigning law or other irregularities, expressed a purported wish of a very small majority of UK citizens to leave the EU. Several years have passed, more facts are known, the consequences of leaving the EU better understood, and we submit that Brexit, aka Leaving the EU, is not now a plausible \"Will of the People\". The Union is divided, politics is in a catastrophic state. We want to Remain.",
        "background": "The UK is set to leave the European Union because of a purported \"Will of the People\" as supposedly expressed by the 2016 referendum. We contend that this \"will\" is not conclusive, and most definitely not binding. Furthermore, recent opinion polls show a majority of UK citizens now wish to Remain.",
