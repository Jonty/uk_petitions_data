        "action": "Strengthen laws & policies on terror suspects and those linked to terror groups",
        "additional_details": "The deaths at the Manchester Arena bombing and most recently the decapitation of two tourists in Morocco by a group which was known to have close ties to ISIS. We need new laws that allow authorities to hold suspects for unlimited time until thorough investigations have been taken, there should also be strengthened laws on allowing imprisonment and deportation ( in cases of foreign criminals) to be authorised. The rights to live a life without fear and the duty to protect the public interest heavily outweighs the rights of the individual.",
        "background": "The UK and the European Union as a whole need to strengthen policies and laws on those individuals linked to terrorism. It is clear that close surveillance on those individuals is failing the public as a whole.",
