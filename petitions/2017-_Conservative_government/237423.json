However, many Members of all faiths appreciate the opportunity for quiet reflection before making important decisions during debates and the course of the parliamentary day. \r\n\r\nOver recent years Parliament has made many inclusive reforms. One of these is the creation of a multi-faith prayer room in January 2018. The room is non-denominational and accessible to people of all faiths and of no faith. It provides a space for individual contemplation and/or prayer.\r\n\r\nLeader of the House of Commons",
