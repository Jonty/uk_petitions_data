        "additional_details": "It is my opinion that young children are more difficult to look after than older children.   After the age of 3 some assistance is provided with childcare and when they reach 5 the child goes to school and it becomes much easier for the parent to work.   If things become difficult, a teenager can do a paper round to raise money.   There is very little assistance when they are less than 3 years old.   I believe child benefit should be scaled by a child's age.",
        "background": "Change child benefit so that it is scaled.   For example, you could scale it so that they receive \u00a340 per week for the first 5 years, \u00a317 for the next 8 years and \u00a39 per week for the remaining 4.   This would only apply to children born after a certain date.",
