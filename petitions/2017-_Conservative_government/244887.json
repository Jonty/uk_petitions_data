        "additional_details": "Because of the current disclosure rules it is not possible to find out how many MPs, current or historic, have or have had criminal convictions. Parliament is unable an unwilling to give this information as it does not have complete or accurate information.\r\n\r\nSome other professions bar those with a criminal record from holding a job within their profession. Many of these are arguably less sensitive than the role of an MP.",
        "background": "MPs currently only have to declare a criminal conviction if it resulted in a custodial sentence of more than 1 year. Hence there are an unknown number of MPs, past and present, who have or have had a criminal conviction.Can anyone with a criminal record be considered suitable to govern our laws ?",
