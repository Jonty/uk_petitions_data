        "additional_details": "Seeing as the whole point of the CO2 based system was for environmental reasons why are older cars not treated the same as new ones? The CO2 coming out of the exhaust is the same! This situation is actually costing the government money as owners of these cars SORN them hence ZERO tax revenue!!",
        "background": "The current VED system is grossly unfair. Cars registered now can emit 249g of CO2 yet only pay \u00a3140 PA VED. A car registered in 2007 emitting the same CO2 pays \u00a3540 PA VED! It gets even worse though, the EXACT SAME CAR registered up to March 2006 pays \u00a3315 PA VED!",
