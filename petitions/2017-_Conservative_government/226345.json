        "additional_details": "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the Srebrenica massacre was a genocide and was not just limited to men, but also to women and children, with the youngest victim being a newborn baby.\r\nWith human life being so precious, denial of their demise gives justification to the perpetrators of this heinous crime.",
        "background": "In July 1995, more than 8,373 Bosniaks, mainly men and boys were murdered in cold blood, in Srebrenica during the Bosnian War.\r\nAs this was a clear act of genocide, it should be illegal to deny this event ever happened.",
