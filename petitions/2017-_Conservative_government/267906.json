        "additional_details": "Many dogs in the UK are well trained and taken care of by responsible owners who are forced to leave their dogs behind when they go out shopping, for a meal, on holiday or just on transport. I often see dogs chained up to the polls of supermarkets or restaurants, or left in cars with only a small window open, which is unfair to the animals. The UK is known to be a nation of dog lovers, but this isn\u2019t portrayed in our society when we compare ourself to Western countries such as USA and Europe.",
        "background": "I had just travelled to Italy and noticed how dogs were allowed in all areas including public transport, restaurants, supermarkets, and airports. I believe that the UK should allow responsible dog owners to do the same thing as many well trained dogs are harmless.",
