In particular, we're not sure whether you'd like Wales to have an entirely separate currency, like the US dollar, or whether you'd like Welsh banknotes, similar to the Scottish banknotes issued by banks in Scotland. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government to work with the Welsh Government to encourage the development of Welsh banknotes, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
