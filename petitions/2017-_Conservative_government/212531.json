        "additional_details": "In July 2017, Italy pleaded for the help of other European nations to deal with the record influx of refugees it was experiencing. In 2016, Italy took in a total of 181,436 people (TIME magazine). In 2016 the UK received 38,500 asylum applications, only 45% of these were granted (British Red Cross). The number of applications were considerably less than that of Germany (587,346) and Sweden (83,103).",
        "background": "The crisis in the Mediterranean has seen a shocking display of reluctance to take action in order to help those fleeing war and disaster. Countries such as Italy have been left alone to disproportionately host refugees and asylum seekers. It's government's moral duty to host our fair share.",
