        "additional_details": "But to most peoples horror they are not entitled to it this year even though they received it last year. After making further enquires many members of Utilita were told it was due to the government changing the criteria or that they had to contact DWP for further paperwork. Checking with my last supplier I still would be entitled to the warm home discount scheme if I was with them, others I have spoken to have done the same checks \r\nPlease help me spread this far and wide to get this looked into.",
        "background": "Many people are shouting from the rooftops in anger and I myself am included, most single parents know its that time of year where money does not stretch and the warm home discount scheme is heavily relied upon. Do you feed the family or heat the house ???",
