        "additional_details": "There is a widespread clamouring for another referendum, but the one sought asks the wrong question & will not address the real issues.\r\nA straightforward vote of no confidence will address the problem head on.\r\nParliament would need to unite to try and win the vote, & when they lose they must dissolve and a general election held in which both parties are prohibited from participating.",
        "background": "Both government & opposition are the worst in recorded history.\r\nParliament is paralysed by party politics, ideology & voter disenfranchisement.\r\nThese are inevitable consequences of a political system that has broken down.\r\nThe electorate need to express their dissent & our politics must reform.",
