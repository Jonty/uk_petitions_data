Not that they should of course, as the government advertise it as FREE childcare after all!\r\n\r\nNo other business has what it can charge their customers dictated to them.  The government control what we receive and what we can charge and the result is a deficit for most providers.\r\n\r\nPlease help is get an increase in funding, in line with the increase of business costs.",

Employer pension contributions are increasing to 2% at the same time.\r\nGuess how much our funding has gone up by?\r\n0%\r\n\r\nEarly years providers are closing, please sign and save FREE Early Years Education!",
