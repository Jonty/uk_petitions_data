        "additional_details": "Key criteria in the decision to replace our political system, are:\r\n- Is the economic success of the UK due to politicians?\r\n- Do Members of Parliament represent the \u201cWill of the People\u201d?\r\n- Are the current political parties capable of positioning the UK to thrive in the 21st Century \u2013 to lead a crusade with like-minded peoples in the world, to avert the rapidly approaching day of reckoning for all the creatures on Planet Earth?\r\nReplying no to these questions - means changing the UK governance.",
        "background": "The UK political system has lost the faith of the People - demonstrating a fundamental lack of ability to reach consensus to fulfil the will of the People. This system of opposites, forever destined to fight, is outdated. We need governance by capable and talented people elected from our midst.",
