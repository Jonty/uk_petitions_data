Let\u2019s teach children that it is ok to be different and why people are different.Instead of leaving children and adults feeling like prisoners in they\u2019re own home.",
        "background": "More children and young adults should be educated on special needs and disabilities in order to reduce discrimination! Many people I work with feel isolated and fear of going out in public due to public discrimination and public lack of education.",
