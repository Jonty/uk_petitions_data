        "additional_details": "A big contributing factor is the amount of excess fat, saturated fat, salt and sugar consumed by the average UK citizen on a daily basis. There is a clear system available called the \"traffic lights\", whereby food and drink items can be rated using red (high), amber (medium) and green (low) images to simply and clearly indicate how much fat, saturated fat, salt and sugar are contained in 100 grams or 100 millilitres of an item. As I understand it use of the traffic lights is currently voluntary.",
