        "additional_details": "If the UK government agrees an extension of the planned date of leaving the EU beyond 22nd May, it is highly likely that the EU will insist that the UK must elect MEPs. This will probably become the biggest and maybe last opportunity for UK voters to express their view on whether the UK should push ahead with a plan to leave the EU (whatever the UK Parliament can agree to) or to say, \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of Brexit stealing time and money that should be better spent on many other priorities.\u201d",
        "background": "This petition demands that the UK government agrees to any requirement to participate in the EU elections and further, insists that the UK government agrees with the EU any extension to the Article 50 notice period which includes the requirement to hold MEP elections.",
