        "additional_details": "Some say there is no harm!   But, there is evidence it's harmful; including, self-admission from those committing hideous crimes these were linked to video game ideas.  We have to make a stand and stop the gaming industry normalising our childrens' minds towards violence, aggression and killing.  Stop the desensitisation of our childrens' morality!   With parents reporting changes in behaviour, moods, motivation and school work, we have a duty and responsibility to protect our future generation.",
        "background": "Normalising violence, aggression and killing is wrong.  Access to games-animated or otherwise-normalises this conduct, and desensitises everyone to its impact.  Morality is disappearing for many. Many violent, and aggressive crimes, terrorist or otherwise have been seen to be linked to online games.",
