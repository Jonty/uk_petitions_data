        "additional_details": "Since the vote, many issues regarding the consequences of Brexit have emerged that were hardly discussed during the referendum campaign. The date of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum was announced two years in advance, as this was deemed to be a major constitutional matter which would require this length of time for voters to make their decision. We believe that the date of the EU referendum should have been announced at least a year in advance.",
        "background": "The decision on staying in or leaving the EU is a major constitutional issue and could have far-reaching consequences. We believe that four months (February to June 2016) was not long enough for voters to consider carefully all the issues involved before making a properly informed decision.",
