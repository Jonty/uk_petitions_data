        "action": "Make it a requirement for supermarket delivery vehicles to be fully electric.",
        "additional_details": "As supermarket delivery vehicles only deliver/operate in city they are based in and surrounding towns & villages they rarely have to travel long distances which means that they would never be too far away from a charging point and when the vehicles are not being used (overnight ect) they can be charged at the supermarket ready for their next job. The electrification of delivery vehicles would help lower pollution levels and help save the earth.",
        "background": "Make it a legal requirement for the big six supermarket retailers in the UK (Tesco's, Sainsbury's, Adsa, Morrisons, Waitrose and Iceland.) to have a fleet of fully electric delivery vehicles by April 2019.",
