        "action": "Make substance testing facilities mandatory at music festivals",
        "additional_details": "If people have access to drug testing facilities they can be given information about the pills which could change their minds about whether to take the substance. \r\n \r\nIt is clear that despite taking measures to prevent them accessing illegal substances, young people are still determined to indulge in them. Must we continue to watch people die before we do something to prevent this? \r\n \r\nWith help from services like The Loop who already operate in the UK with support from law enforcement, events can prevent drug related deaths occurring.",
        "background": "To help avoid drug related deaths at music festivals, it is essential that changes are made to how events approach substance use.\r\n \r\nI propose that it becomes mandatory to offer a safe risk free drug testing facility at music festivals.",
