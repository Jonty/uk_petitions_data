        "action": "Allow Computer Science GCSE NEA to continue.",
        "additional_details": "The NEA (Non-Exam Assessment) holds 20% of the total grade awarded to students at the end of the course. By taking this out, many students are at risk of getting below their desired grade, due to it being a relevant factor of why they took the GCSE. Another reason to keep the NEA in the specification is because many careers also prioritise the programming aspects of the course, as it demonstrates personal understanding.",
        "background": "Students taking the 2018 Computer Science GCSE have the possibility of being severely affected by the recent consideration to remove the NEA from the course, as solutions were leaked. We are appealing to allow the NEA to continue because it is unjust to jeopardise students who were not involved.",
