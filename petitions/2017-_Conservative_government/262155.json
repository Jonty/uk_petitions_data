        "additional_details": "Terminally ill individuals should be allowed the right to active euthanasia, to end their life on their terms with dignity and without pain. \r\n\r\nThe elderly, and sufferers of conditions deemed unlikely to improve, should have the right to active euthanasia, provided every feasible treatment appropriate for their circumstances has been attempted.\r\n\r\nThose wishing to die may otherwise turn to suicide which may be painful, slow, gruesome, unsuccessful and traumatic, and endanger others in some cases.",
        "background": "Active euthanasia is the act of bringing about the end of a life. \r\n\r\nPractised effectively, it can bring about a death with little physical, and less emotional, pain- than could otherwise be expected. \r\n\r\nAllow individuals living without hope of improvement to take control of the end of their life.",
