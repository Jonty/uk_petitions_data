        "additional_details": "Too often Councils will rely on the fact that many of us do not have the financial means to risk losing a further appeal and having to pay twice the amount. Once you pay the fine, you lose the right to appeal. People are being unduly silenced and denied further attempts to appeal fines because of their income. \r\n\r\nThis needs to change: the full amount of any fine should be reserved for people who fail to pay in time and don't appeal. Councils cannot be allowed to put a price on our voice.",
        "background": "It must be as easy to appeal a fine issued by the Council as it is to pay it. Any means of paying a fine (e.g. online, in person, in writing) must also be offered as a way to appeal. At any stage of appeal, people should be entitled to pay the fine's discounted rate if the appeal is rejected.",
