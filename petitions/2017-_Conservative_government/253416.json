        "additional_details": "Sky and BT will be paying the Premier League 4.46bn over the next 2 seasons. Where the EFL will get 595 million over the next 5 years. TV money in the EFL is far less than in the Premier League. Championship clubs chosen to host matches are awarded 100,000 per game- unless its played on Sunday(120,000) or Thursday(140,000) - while away teams collect a fixed fee of 10,000.\r\nIn contrast, the club which finished bottom of the Premier League last season, West Brom, banked an astonishing 12.3million",
        "background": "There is a massive gap between the Premier League clubs\r\nand what the EFL clubs get paid. \r\n\"Pre year\" Championship teams get 4% of what Premier League teams get. \r\nIf the EFL got more money from TV rights this would help with FFP for most clubs.",
