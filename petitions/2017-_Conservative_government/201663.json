        "additional_details": "4 years ago my son was born at 20 weeks gestation, he was born alive and fought for his life for 2 hours before taking his last breath, he was given absolutley no medical help, and was just left in a cot to die because of this rule. I'm sure there are many more cases like mine, and there shouldnt be any more! The bottom line of a hospitals job is to keep people alive when they enter it that way, and premature babies are no different, if they are born alive they should be helped to stay alive!",
        "background": "Currently doctors and hospital staff are under no legal obligation to help babies born before 24 weeks gestation, even though the youmgest baby to be born and survive was born at just 21 weeks.  Sign to give more babies a chance to survive and live full lives.",
