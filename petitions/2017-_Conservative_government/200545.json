        "additional_details": "At public open spaces where public toilets have been removed this has discriminated against those who are now unable to benefit from the health and well being these open spaces provide because of their need to use the a toilet. Discriminating against any section of society is unlawful in both UK and EU law but this has not deterred councils for closing public toilets. If legislation were created then they would no longer be able to use the excuse, \"We have no legal requirement to provide them\"",

It is a natural requirement for us all to use the toilets and facilities should be made available where needed.",
