        "action": "Reverse central government funding cuts to councils",
        "additional_details": "Due to the austerity cuts councils have had to make savings, and that has led to a spiraling funding problem, causing the most vulnerable to suffer, social services at crisis point, our roads in dire need of need repair and our children services and early years cut and cut again causing generational damage. It is time to realise that the decision of 2010 by Conservative/Lib Dem government is causing untold damage to the UK, and it needs to be reversed. Put the funding back into our councils.",
        "background": "Since 2010 central government has cut the funding to councils. It is planned that by 2020 funding by central government to councils will be reduced by 77%. Causing councils to have to make MORE devastating cuts to much needed services including social care, childrens services, education, and more.",
