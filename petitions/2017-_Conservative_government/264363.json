        "additional_details": "On 6th June 2019 This government rightly, and proudly, led the entire country in a global acknowledgement of gratitude and thanks to a generation that literally saved the world in 1944. Less than a week later, on 10th June 2019, the government, along with the BBC, removed the benefit of a free television licence for people over the age of 75. This hypocrisy cannot and must not go unchallenged. This outright falsehood of the manifesto pledge cannot and must not go unchallenged.\r\n\r\nWe ask that this question is raised in Parliament with a view to having this decision reversed and the Tory Manifesto promise to voters is kept.",
        "background": "Theresa May, promised voters in the Tory Manifesto in 2017 that she would maintain funding for pensioner benefits, including free bus passes, prescriptions and TV licenses, until the end of the current Parliament in 2022.",
