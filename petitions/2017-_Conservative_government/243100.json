        "additional_details": "Pateley Bridge North Yorkshire are being left without a bank following the announcement that Barclays Bank will be closing. \r\nOther bank closures announced in Yorkshire include Knaresborough, Boroughbridge, Grassington, Hawes, all in May 19. \r\nIt is recognised that High Streets lose approx 20% of their trade when people are no longer able to use their bank. The High Street decline nationally can partly be attributed to banks abandoning their customers in a community. \r\nOnline banking is not the answer",
        "background": "Communities throughout the Country are being left without any of the major banks. This needs to be debated in Parliament with a view to processes being in place to offer alternatives which offer the equivalent services that a major bank does. Post Offices do not offer the same level of service.",
