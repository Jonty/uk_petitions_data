        "additional_details": "This will leave us free to start our own trade deals on our own terms. It will allow Britain to take back control. Yes even the prime minister agrees it will be unknown in the short term however. She has admitted on numerous occasions that Britain will be great in the long term and will prosper as it always has when faced with a difficult situation. We have large countries such as the USA that want to start trade deals with the uk however they cannot until we leave the Eu.",

It is time the people decide the outcome. We petition the government to cut all ties with the EU on April 12th and leave the EU with NO DEAL",
