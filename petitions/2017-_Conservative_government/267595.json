        "additional_details": "This is a major redevelopment of the local car parks including those in conservation areas to build new apartments. While new homes are much needed, development must be sensitive to the local areas, and consider the surroundings and infrastructure. \r\n\r\nThe proposed development is for a total of multiple dwellings, with only a small number of parking spaces. The plans call for high rise 6 - 27 storey\u2019s which are out of character and will tower over the local area.",
        "background": "Transport for London plans to convert valuable car parks on many popular London Underground stations (Finchley, High Barnet, Stanmore, Rayners Lane & Cannon's Park). This will create high density housing on tiny plots of land with limited infrastructure and undue pressure on public services.",
