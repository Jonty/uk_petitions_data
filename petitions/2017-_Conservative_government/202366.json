        "action": "Give mothers and fathers 50/50 custody of children in separation or divorce.",
        "additional_details": "Currently men generally only receive every other weekend in the courts and many use their children as a weapon to hurt fathers, when in fact children are being hurt. Men are considered second class citizens with mothers stating fathers must \"win their children over\" when mums have to make no effort. Children are used to inflict pain on another part and its not fair on the child to be in this position and having to take sides. I propose to give equal access and go to court for more as in the USA.",
        "background": "Fathers are just as important to the health development of children. Often limiting a father's access affects a child more than is realised creating societal and mental health issues for the child later in life. Don't make children decide between parents but have a balanced upbringing.",
