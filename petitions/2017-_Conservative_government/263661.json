        "additional_details": "A recent episode of BBC watchdog highlighted just how widespread food waste was at Costa, Nero, Starbucks and Boots who all claim to have ethical practices. I personally experienced this in Leon where I asked for leftover food to hand to the homeless and was told it was company policy to throw it away. France currently has food waste laws in place to prevent waste. Our government needs to step in and do the same to force all food retailers to act ethically and donate surplus food.",
        "background": "Hundreds of tonnes of food goes to waste in the UK that could be donated to the homeless and various charities. This waste also contributes to climate damage & can be easily stopped if retailers donate excess food to the numerous charities who would be happy to pick up & distribute food",
