        "additional_details": "Currently, the DfE\u2019s statutory guidance, which dictates what schools must cover, is clear that schools must teach that marriage can be between members of the opposite or same sex, and some families look different.  But, in a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d document, and in statements by ministers, it is evident that although primary schools are \u201cenabled and encouraged\u201d to cover LGBT content if they \u201cconsider it age-appropriate\u201d, there is no requirement to do so. This 'opt-out' for schools must end.",
        "background": "The 'No Outsiders' programme, which teaches primary school children that some families have two mummies or daddies has been controversial. The protests aim to suppress such teaching, damaging children in LGBT+ families who need clear and visible support from schools to prevent homophobic bullying.",
