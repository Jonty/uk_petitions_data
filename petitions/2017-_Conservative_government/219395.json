        "background": "RSPCA recommend that a Syrian Hamster should have a cage with 80 x 50cm unbroken floor space. However this is not defined in law so pet shops can sell 50 x 60cm cages as LARGE hamster cages. Your small pets live stressed and unhappy lives, while you think you\u2019ve bought a sufficient cage.
