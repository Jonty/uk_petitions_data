        "additional_details": "Please support me in getting this petition heard and focus our attentions on looking after the residents of Rugby.  Lying in a corridor for hours whilst waiting to be seen/waiting for a bed is just not right.  Its not fair on the patient, nor is it fair on the staff at University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire who do an amazing job whilst being stretched far beyond their capabilities.  St Cross Rugby is there, open it and relieve the pressure all round.",
        "background": "As a long term resident of Rugby town, I have seen the town grow massively with new houses being built, new business and improvements and growth.  However, with all this going on, we are still without our own A&E department, residents are taken to UHCW which is already stretched way too far.",
