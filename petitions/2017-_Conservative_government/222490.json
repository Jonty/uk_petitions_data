The very nature of PTSD and many other mental health issues is a natural reaction to abnormal situations. Whether its contact with the enemy or reimmersion into civilian society this reaction is an occupational illness.",

And answer that with compulsory funding for access to local independent mental health support for every veteran in need. We have had 16 veteran suicides in 2 months, what is currently in place is failing.",
