        "additional_details": "We call on the UK government to exclude the NHS categorically from any Brexit trade deal with the USA or any other nation. If the government fails to rule this out, it must call a new referendum on EU membership with the full facts made clear of the risk Brexit poses to the NHS being sold off and our precious service being depleted and/or destroyed.",
        "background": "President Donald Trump has declared he wants the NHS to be on the table in any US-UK trade deal. There is practically no support here in the UK on opening the NHS up to be sold off to American corporations; something that would almost certainly lead to the death of the health service as we know it",
