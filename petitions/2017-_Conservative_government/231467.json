        "additional_details": "Mental health in the UK is in crisis, the Government has committed a further \u00a32bn \u2013 but the NHS can\u2019t solve this alone. A large resource pool exists to deliver help but it\u2019s hard to access, sub-optimised and costly. Youngkind is developing a buddy platform, which will compliment existing services to unlock these private sector resources with intuitive 21st Century technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Lowering cost all the way to free. We could change 50,000 lives for only \u00a330m.",
        "background": "The government announced an increase in funding of \u00a32 billion to support the mental health crisis. Consider this then. Serving 50,000 people would cost Youngkind just \u00a330 million p/a. Is that a realistic use of some of that huge investment? Please sign to support a Government fund initiative.",
