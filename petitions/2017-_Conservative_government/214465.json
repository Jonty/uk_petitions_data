        "background": "My plan can be paid for by eliminating mental illness using the Kadir-Buxton Method. Existing power stations can be converted to clean energy by digging a 10 kilometre deep lined and capped water well next to them, energy depends on how wide the well is bored, using Starlite as a wall paint etc.",
