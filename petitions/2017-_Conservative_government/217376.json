        "action": "Abolition of the coarse fishing closed season on rivers (16th March-16th June)",
        "additional_details": "We have also seen the loss of Tackle & bait shops for years during the closed season as takings reduce massively, fishing seems to be a dying hobby which is a crying shame as kids and adults alike could do with more outside pastimes not less. More fishing time and longer evenings (in closed season) can give the sport and local businesses a real boost and give more opportunities for people to take up Angling.",
        "background": "This outdated law has left us Angler\u2019s twiddling our thumbs for years, there is no evidence to prove all year round fishing harms fish\u2019s breeding habits, no effects have been seen on commercial fisheries and canals which have had no closed season for years.",
