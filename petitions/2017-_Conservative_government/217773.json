        "additional_details": "We currently put 0.7% of our GDP into Foreign Aid, which is ok when we can afford it but the needs of our Country must come first.\r\nIt is the duty of the Government to put the security of the nation first that means increasing the funding for our Armed Forces.\r\nIt is also the duty of our Government to ensure the safety of its people that means increasing the funding for our Police.\r\nUntil our Road networks are repaired, our Hospitals upgraded, our schools rebuilt and our Police and Armed Forces are fully equipped to defend our Nation the reduce Foreign Aid Budget should remain.\r\nOnce we have rebuilt these vital services we can once again increase our Foreign Aid budget on the understanding that it is fully audited and overseen by our Armed Forces, that way we can see how our money is spent",
        "background": "I propose we reduce the Foreign Aid budget to 0.5% of GDP then put those savings into NHS, Policing, Armed Forces, Schools & Infra-structure in equal proportions.",
