        "additional_details": "Why the new style of benefits is unfair for students\r\n- It is making getting an education harder, or even impossible for parent students and low income families\r\n- Students are effectively having to repay this loan twice, once through their Universal Credit benefits and then again through loan repayments to Student Finance\r\n- Students relying on benefits normally have children and families to support, or are disabled, therefore hit hardest and made even more vulnerable\r\n- Make education accessible!",
        "background": "Even though much of student finance is a loan, it is classed as extra income by Universal Credit and deducted pound for pound from any benefit entitlement, despite it having to be paid back. We request treating student loans as per the legacy benefits system where they were completely disregarded.",
