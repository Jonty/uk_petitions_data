        "additional_details": "Public funding should be used to investigate a therapeutic cocktail of the following compounds in clinical trials to reduce the economic burden of Alzheimer's and dementia and improve quality of life in the ageing population:\r\n\r\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC)\r\nNiacin (nicotinic acid form)\r\nZinc\r\nMolybdenum\r\nAlpha lipoic acid\r\nSelenium\r\nSulforaphane\r\n\r\nCollectively, these compounds are integral in aldehyde detoxification and would present a powerful weapon against neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's.",
        "background": "There is increasing evidence to suggest Alzheimer's is caused by aldehyde toxicity. It stands to reason that medical protocol based on this hypothesis could be invaluable in the prevention and treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative condition afflicting the ageing population.",
