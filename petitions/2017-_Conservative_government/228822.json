Laws and policies, including the Equality Act, don't list specific conditions and define them as disabilities. In most cases, it\u2019s the impact that a health condition has on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for support or protection under the law.  \r\n   \r\nYou can find out more about showing that you're disabled under the Equality Act here:  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/showing-you-re-disabled-under-the-equality-act/ \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do to support people who are suffering from diverticulitis."
