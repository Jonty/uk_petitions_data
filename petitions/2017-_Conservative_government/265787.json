        "additional_details": "Currently terminal forms of cancer can lead to a medical route away from regular reassessment.\r\nIt is acknowledged a similar petition about benefit reassessment to this for under 16 years old exists but does not cover the same affected individuals (adults).\r\nThe responsibility for notification could be changed to the person if their circumstances did improve - the same responsibility that is already in use for other benefits where a person's income increases. \r\nApplicable conditions include R.P.",
        "background": "Currently adults on DLA/PIP and ESA are periodically reassessed regardless of the nature of their health condition. This frequently causes them and their families immense distress. Where a health condition (eg RP/sight) is highly unlikely to improve the person should not be reassessed as standard.",
