        "additional_details": "The UK is embroiled in a housing crisis, and you're unlikely to find an expert who disagrees. Over the past 40 years, the UK's housing surplus has become a shortfall. We need serious and rigorous strategy to combat the housing crisis and fast! \r\nThe number of home-owning households has fallen by 900,000 for the under-45s since 2010. Nearly a million more young adults are living with their parents than was the case two decades ago, a study has found. We call on the Government to declare emergency.",
        "background": "Much like the recent fight to get the government to declare a climate change emergency, we need get the government to recognise the serious housing crisis. The Government must set up an independent review into how to combat the housing crisis and commit to implementing any recommendations.",
