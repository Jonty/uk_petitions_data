        "additional_details": "The tests are really a test of memory, not of knowledge which is not what colleges, univerities or jobs will go off. Life sets you off wanting you to be smart so why not make that visible in the tests instead of testing memory. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s disappointing that last years demand of open book exams was denied because that year had to go into their exams repeating the quotes over and over and over, punishing themselves for their memory. Anyone from parliament could help put a stop to teenage mental health issues and help 2018 (&future) leavers. \r\n\r\nPlease.",
        "background": "Teens are really feeling the pressure because of the open book exams. From last years results it\u2019s clear just how hard they really are, even when you don\u2019t need to learn the books \u2018off by heart\u2019.",
