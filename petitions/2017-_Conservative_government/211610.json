That equates to \u00a3650m in total. Whilst many students are appreciative of the need and right to strike, we as the 'consumer' should be awarded a refund of our already extensive tuition fees for this period.",
        "background": "From the 22nd February all university lecturers at 85 universities will be going on strike, with regards to their pensions. This is anticipated to last approximately 3-4 weeks. As we will not be taught, we argue that for this period we should be refunded our tuition fees during that period of time.",
