To  make society more equal and democratic we need to level the playing field.  If elections and referendums are held on Sundays this will make society more equal and democratic. Far more people will be able to vote and thus parliament and referendums will represent us more closely.",
        "background": "In the 2015 general election, the gap between old voters and young voters was massive.\r\nJust 43% of 18-24-year-olds went to the polls, compared with 78% of people aged 65 or over, according to Ipsos Mori. \r\nAn obvious reason for this discrepancy is lack of time due to work and study.",
