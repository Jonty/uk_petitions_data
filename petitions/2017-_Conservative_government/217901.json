        "action": "Amend the Wildlife Act so companies have to protect wildlife",
        "additional_details": "The Wildlife Act needs to be updated in order to protect all wildlife. Companies have to take responsibility for their actions towards wildlife, for example, putting ramps down holes, covering up all holes, paying the bills of the animals they have injured and so on. By putting this in place, it will help reduce the number of injured or killed wild animals.",
        "background": "There's nothing in the Wildlife Act which states that companies must put measures in place to prevent wildlife from being injured/killed whilst they are undertaking outdoor work. We want the Wildlife Act amended in order to reduce the number of animals going to rescues due to the work of businesses.",
