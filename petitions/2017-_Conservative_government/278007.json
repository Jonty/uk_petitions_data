Due to cuts, even those who have  experience of domestic abuse or have learning difficulties still don\u2019t meet criteria for Legal Aid. Access to Justice must be achieved. Legal Aid needs to be reinstated on means basis to ensure people get the legal support they need and are entitled to.",
        "background": "Family Courts no longer allow legal aid on means basis in Private proceedings, save certain strict criteria such as domestic abuse. However this still means many individuals are left unrepresented in serious legal matters that will impact on children.",
