        "additional_details": "I am proposing the government stop Highways England from installing road works for more than one junction at a time. Where the next junction is longer than 5 miles away then the limit be 5 miles. The lanes are too narrow and the lack of a hard shoulder in the inevitable outcome of an incident impedes emergency services and creates hours of tail backs. All to help protect workers which is all well and good if they were actually working on that stretch.",
        "background": "With the current influx of \u201csmart\u201d motorways being installed around the country, we have seen neverending roadworks for miles and miles. The current spate of roadworks on the M6 between Jncs 19 and 16 are causing mayhem and misery daily. Accidents occur daily and yet work won\u2019t be done till 2019",
