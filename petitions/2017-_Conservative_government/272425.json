        "additional_details": "It has gone from severe delays on Fridays to severe delays everyday.\r\nI want the authorities to honor their part of the deal and if that fails at least allow local residents who have to suffer daily free crossings for life, it is the least we deserve. \r\nIt is having a huge impact on everyday life and not to mention the fumes affecting all around the town. All roads in and out of Dartford are affected and is used as a rat run for motorists wanting to cross the bridge making it unfair for residents.",
        "background": "It is becoming a difficult place to live what with the serious traffic congestion surrounding the dartford crossing.\r\n\r\nWe were lied to in reference to once the bridge is paid for it would be free for all to use. It has been paid for time after time and yet we still get charged and traffic is worse.",
