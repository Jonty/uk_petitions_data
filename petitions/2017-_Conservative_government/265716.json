        "additional_details": "The main reasons of why it should be changed is because:\r\n\r\n1) Secondary school especially during GCSE years takes a mental and physical toll on students \r\n2)Teachers are also affected mentally and physically due to secondary school\r\n3) Essential life skills aren't covered in the national curriculum so many students that leave school won't know how to buy a house and other essential life skills\r\n\r\nThe national curriculum as it is right now contains major flaws which act as catalysts for the problems that are put upon teachers and students alike.",
        "background": "The Current Secondary education system is laying the foundations for our generations failure. The education system is deeply flawed.\r\nThe National Curriculum that UK schools follow was decided by politicians and civil servants. Why should they decide we study?\r\nIs it our futures or is it theirs?",
