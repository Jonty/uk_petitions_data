        "action": "Ban gambling advertising in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The adverts that we see on the television take advantage of people's weaknesses, use of apps in spare time, inability to be alone or bored and position gambling as a 'light-hearted', 'sociable' way of passing the time. The actual potential that gambling had to ruin people's lives and the lives of their families and friends is catastrophic. There needs to be more onus placed on centralised government's responsibility to stopping this happening.",
        "background": "I am 26 years old and I already know over ten people who have been near crippled by gambling addiction. The fact that gambling is advertised is disgusting and should be held in the same regard as other addictive substances which get abused by people with poor mental health.",
