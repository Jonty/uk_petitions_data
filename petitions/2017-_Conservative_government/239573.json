        "additional_details": "This is a petition to the UK Government to provide an option at point of sale for diverting 1p and 2p coins into a government fund that helps in vocational training before discharge as well as housing of ex-service people who never go on strike but are often left to fend for themselves after they have served the country unselfishly. Its a shame that 10% of the UK homeless population is made up of ex-soldiers!  \r\n\r\nHM Treasury: Cash and digital payments in the new economy\r\nhttps://owwsoldiers.co.uk/",
        "background": "The 1p and 2p coins are made at significant financial cost & environmental cost (energy & mining). 6 in 10 of 1p and 2p coins are only used once before being saved in a jar or discarded. In one in 12 of these cases, the coins are thrown in the bin. Its time to pool our pennies for ex-service people!",
