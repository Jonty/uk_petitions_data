        "additional_details": "Micro-plastic glitter passes through waterways into the ocean, marine life and birds mistake it for food; glitters are produced with toxic additives; which is then consumed by us. It has been reported that plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish. With approx. 51 million fragments in the ocean.\r\n\r\nThese micro-plastic glitter can break down to release chemicals that disrupt hormones in the bodies of both animals and humans\r\nWe hold a responsibility to future generations to stop this pollution.",
        "background": "Micro-plastic glitters are used in everyday items; posing an ecological hazard to our oceans and aquatic life.\r\nThere is a ban on micro-beads and we call for this ban to be extended to micro-plastic glitter.",
