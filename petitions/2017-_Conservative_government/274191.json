        "action": "Stop separating children from their parents because of inhumane visa laws",
        "additional_details": "It is disgusting that young children are forced to live without one of their parents under these insane laws. The forced removal of a parent can put more financial pressure on a family and make it more likely that they will need financial support as a parent left alone will need to either give up work or pay for childcare where they could be relying on a spouse to care for the child. The Government is neglecting to safeguard the well-being of these children, tearing families apart for no reason.",
        "background": "Minimum income requirement should be relaxed when it comes to parents of British or settled children. Parents who qualify shouldn't have to pass an English test to remain, instead a condition on them remaining should be to attend English classes until they are able to pass the test.",
