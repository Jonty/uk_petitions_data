        "additional_details": "In the state of Colorado in the USA, Cannabis has been legalised for recreational usage since 2012, and for Medicinal usage since 2000. \r\nIn 2017, with a population of 5.607 million people, the state of Colorado received $247 million (\u00a3186 million) in taxes, license and fee revenue from sales of Cannabis. In 2017, the UK population was roughly 10 times this amount at 66.182 million. This equates to potentially over \u00a31.86 billion in revenue the UK could receive from the same sales model.",
