        "additional_details": "We the people have the right to expect our MPs to be truthful when standing for election. Confidence in our politicians is at an all time low, we vote them in to rule for us, not reign over us. Many politicians have stopped working for us and now work for their own self interests. We the people have been powerless for too long, when we speak, MPs should listen. We the people intend to take back our democracy with or without our government.",
        "background": "MPs stand for election on a party's manifesto, if they then change to a rival party part way through the parliament it is reasonable to assume they mislead the electorate. Before they can move across the house, they should first resign and face a bi-election. Lets bring morals back into parliament.",
