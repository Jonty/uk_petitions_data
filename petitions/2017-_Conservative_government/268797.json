        "additional_details": "If we leave an animal to suffer or mistreat them we are charged with animal cruelty and a list of other offences, but yet a vet can refuse to treat a bleeding animal till you pay their ridiculous fees, and still be within the law this is an absolute disgrace and should be changed. I propose all animals should get essential treatment to stabilise the condition, then work out payment plan fees etc, to refuse to treat a animal is disgusting if this was a human you would be jailed",
        "background": "My dog recently had an accident and the vet refused to even look at him till I paid a ridiculous sum of money for the treatment given, all animals should receive a basic level of care if the animal is bleeding badly or in danger of losing life or limb",
