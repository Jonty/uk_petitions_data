        "action": "No foreign aid to Pakistan for supporting terrorism.",
        "additional_details": "On one hand, they show that they have taken action to tackle terrorism; on the other hand, they support terrorism for their own gain. Granting foreign aid to Pakistan seems as if we are financially supporting the terrorists. Many terrorist-related events in Afghanistan, India and other countries are initiated in Pakistan. Recent bomb blasts in Afghanistan killed hundreds of innocent people.",
        "background": "Pakistan soil has become a training camp for terrorists. The government of Pakistan have been supporting terrorists; UK foreign aid therefore goes to terrorists. Government must immediately stop all foreign aid to Pakistan.",
