        "additional_details": "BIDs are being allowed to creep in via undemocratic ballots. Central Government gives financial backing only to those wanting to establish a BID. This ignores and/or undermines any attempt at a NO campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Communities, House and Local Government BID regulations are woefully inadequate and have allowed a culture of lack of BID accountability and transparency to run rife throughout the UK with no independent regulator.",
        "background": "Stop unfair Stealth Tax \r\nA Business Improvement District (BID) is a defined area within which Businesses are forced to pay an additional TAX /LEVY. Traders have little or no control how this money collected by Councils on top of Business Tax is spent. This unfair legislation needs to be abolished.",
