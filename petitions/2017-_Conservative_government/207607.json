        "background": "Whenever there is a problem with the M25 (Dartford Crossing) and the A2, the roads in and around Dartford become gridlocked. \r\nDrivers try to get off these main roads & cut through Dartford & the surrounding roads, which clog them up. Drivers clog up the roads trying to get onto M25/A2. It's a mess.",
