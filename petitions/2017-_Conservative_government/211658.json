        "additional_details": "I have to risk my like on a motorbike to my apprenticeship (My education, my place of work, my place to earn money to afford keep things running) EVERY DAY (30 miles a day) In the cold, rain, ice. All because I can't afford a safer way to my place of work, and i'm sure I am not the only one, this is disgusting how our country is allowed to rip off youngsters, not all of us youngsters are a risk on the road, motorbike riders are more aware and so I am less of a risk but still get ripped off more.",
        "background": "Insurance prices are still sky high price, and the previous petitions obviously didn't do anything about it. America flips if the prices get bad (like 1 US Dollar for fuel per liter) so why should we let our companies get away with this rip off scam. Gender discrimination is also still happening.",
