        "action": "Ban Homework in All Comprehensive Schools",
        "additional_details": "Many children struggle with keeping up with due dates and work without the support of their teachers. This leads to them missing homework due dates and being punished for it. \r\n\r\nFinland, for example, has almost zero homework, plus subtracting an hour from our national school time average (six hours) and still manages to maintain the privilege of having some of the best comprehensive schools in the whole of Europe. Maybe it's time to take notes from their books, instead of stealing childhoods.",
        "background": "Homework is a solid violation of child rights. It has and is causing numerous mental issues within our youth, and stealing valuable childhoods. Kids want to be kids, not sitting around in their house, forced to comply with teachers demands even from outside the designated time periods of school.",
