        "additional_details": "Vulnerable people suffering from mental health issues should be supervised when prescribed pills like Amitriptyline in a controlled environment with a healthcare professional. Sometimes people who are suffering from mental health problems don't think rationally like other people. They are vulnerable and need protection from harm. So why would you put them in harm\u2019s way with lethal drugs? We lost my mother the worst way possible and it could have been prevented.",
        "background": "My mother, who suffered from mental health issues, was given a weekly prescription of Amitriptyline without any supervision. My mother was saving them up over some time and committed suicide with these pills. Yes, they may be good for specific conditions, but not for vulnerable people.",
