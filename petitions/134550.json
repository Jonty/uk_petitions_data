        "action": "Hold a general election to elect a government to negotiate the EU withdrawal.",
        "additional_details": "The Conservative led government has only a small working majority of 12. The PM David Cameron has resigned in the wake of the referendum loss and the Conservative Party need a new leader. This is weak position to engage with EU separation negotiations. The winner of the leadership contest will become PM without the electorate having a say and the result of the referendum suggests deep unhappiness with the way the UK is governed. These concerns can only be addressed through a general election.",
        "background": "On the 23rd June the UK voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU. The vote was close and there are many competing ideas about the nature of the UK's future relationship with the EU in terms of trade, law and travel.",
