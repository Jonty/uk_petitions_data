        "additional_details": "BSL was recognised by the UK Government as a language in its own right in March 2003. In September 2015, the Scottish Parliament enshrined the promotion and protection of BSL in law in the BSL (Scotland) Act.\r\n\r\nWith two months to go to the election, no materials in BSL have been released by the Government or the Leave/Remain campaigns. We were told by gov.uk that this was because of \"extremely low demand\", but we have seen no evidence that any consultation with the Deaf community took place. ",
        "background": "On 23 June, UK voters will decide whether to leave or remain in the EU. Neither the UK Government nor the Leave/Remain campaigns have produced any information in British Sign Language about the referendum and its implications. Deaf voters who use BSL must not be excluded from this historic debate!",
