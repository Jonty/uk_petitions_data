After the vote people are increasingly horrified by the outcome. ",
        "background": "After a dirty EU referendum, the public feels deceived. MPs must reflect the changed public mood and stop Article 50 being signed. They have no mandate to decide terms of a catastrophic exit agreement. The national interests must be urgently protected. MPs must represent constituents interests.",
