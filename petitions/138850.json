        "additional_details": "Only hours after the results are in, a claim made by a campaign admit it is untrue and a 'mistake'. Why was it allowed in the 1st place? Posters are created which are inflammatory and distressing, propaganda, yet are allowed. The electorate use this information to arrive at a decision. If a financial advisor provides advice which is deemed poor, the advisor is held accountable. There is seemingly no accountability at all towards any political parties when campaigning. Why is it allowed?",
        "background": "We've just come off the back of the most poisonous political campaign I can remember. A democratic decision has been made which profoundly affect all of our futures yet politicians can seemingly make any claim they wish in the run up to an election, seemingly unregulated. This cannot be right.",
