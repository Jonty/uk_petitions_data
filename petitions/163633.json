        "additional_details": "Its our community and we can make what we want of it! Walthamstow deserves more than banana skins and men shouting \"2 for a pound\". My parents tell stories of finding their best outfits in the market when they was young and I want to revive that feeling for the younger generation and the future. If you feel the same as I do, feel free to sign this petition and spread the word! It would put Walthamstow back on the map as a more than just the last affordable postcode!",
        "background": "Walthsmtow is the largest market in Europe. It seems such a waste to restrict this market to simply fruit, vegetables and toiletries. I'm calling for the community to come together and create a monthly vintage market thus creating Europes largest vintage market, boosting trade throughout Walthamstow",
