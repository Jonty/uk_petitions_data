        "additional_details": "The United Nations is already investigating Iain Duncan Smith's disgraceful welfare reforms for a violation of human rights, yet he still continues to press on with destroying the lives of many people who cannot work by forcing them to do so, whilst David Cameron promotes yet more to the House of Lords who are by far the biggest benefit cheats in the UK.\r\n\r\nI am therefore calling for the immediate dismissal and arrest of Iain Duncan Smith on Manslaughter charges. ",
        "background": "Iain Duncan Smith and the DWP are responsible for the deaths of thousands of people who cannot work. Duncan Smith has waged war on innocent people who he deems fit enough to work, yet the latest figures prove that many have fallen seriously ill or died after the DWP forced them back to work. ",

You may find that there is already a petition about this which you would like to sign. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could start a petition specifically asking for action on your concerns about the \"fit for work\" policy and its implementation."
