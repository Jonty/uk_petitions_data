        "action": "Increase standard paternity leave to a minimum of 3 months",
        "additional_details": "After having my second child and it being a very tough ordeal. It pointed out that 2 weeks paternity is not even close to enough leave. My partner had to take 3 months off sick to help me through post natal depression. This was due to me being a stay at home mum so having no maternity leave to share with him. This, of course, put great stress on his employment status.\r\n\r\nI can only imagine that every other family with mum at home, would be in the same boat that we were. ",
        "background": "Currently men get 2 weeks paid paternity leave. Increasing this to a standard of 3 months at the same pay level as maternity leave, would firstly make men and women more equal when it comes to getting jobs. Secondly, allow fathers of non working mothers crucial time off to support their partner",
