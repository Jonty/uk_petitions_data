        "action": "Change the law on Historic Sexual abuse and assault cases and penalties",
        "additional_details": "The current cases means that someone who abused someone in 1970's or 1980's only allows a person to be prosecuted under the laws of that time undermining the sentencing of someone who may have committed abhorent crimes against people, this would allow a better and more efficient way to proscute historical sexual crimes.",
        "background": "If a historic sexual abuse/assault case is brought before a court, if the case occurred earlier than 2003 a person prosecuted of the crime has a penalty or prison sentence which refers to the law under that point in time. All historic cases should use the current sentencing for historic cases also",
