        "additional_details": "1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental health problem each year. Just because you cannot see a disability, which it is, doesn't mean it does not exist and should not be under the Equality Act 2010. They say it \"can\" be covered if there is proof it effects day to day life, but that is unacceptable as it can be hard to prove that. People all over the country suffer. Jobs, benefits, health all put strain on people where they cannot cope, mental health should be a protected characteristic.",
        "background": "The Equality Act covers the same groups that were protected by existing equality legislation \u2013 age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership and pregnancy and maternity. These are now called \u2018protected characteristics\u2019.",
