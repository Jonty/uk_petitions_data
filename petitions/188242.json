Each parent has a responsibility to their children, not just one parent. If mothers and fathers knew they both had to equally provide for the children and see them regularly, we would probably see a decline in the number of children that are unwanted and neglected.",
        "background": "I know too many single mothers who are fantastic with their kids, but their children's fathers have left all the responsibility to them. Self employed parents not paying a penny towards their children, but are able to drink every night while the other parent struggles on their own.",
