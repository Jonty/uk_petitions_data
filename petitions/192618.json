        "additional_details": "The European Commission has mobilised \u20ac250,000 for emergency relief in Peru. While this is an important move, it is nowhere near sufficient for dealing with the catastrophic crisis that is already affecting hundreds of thousands of people and will affect many more. These floods will have even more devastating impacts unless the international community provides an adequate and timely response to reinforce the national effort. Safe drinking water, food and medical assistance is urgently required. ",
        "background": "Provide comprehensive and timely assistance to help those affected by catastrophic flooding across Peru. At least 78 people have already been confirmed dead and approximately 640,000 have been displaced. Urgent support is needed to prevent further casualties and the outbreak of preventable diseases.",
