        "action": "Make all motorway matrix signs read Keep Left Unless Overtaking when not in use",
        "additional_details": "As stated in the Highway Code (goo.gl/zagJKH) road users should keep left on the motorway and move back to the left as soon as they have overtaken, however for many drivers it has been years since they learned this rule. The result of this is poor road use resulting in heavy congestion and frustration for others. The overhead announcement boards could easily be used, when not displaying live notices, to say \"Keep Left Unless Overtaking\" to remind road users of how to use the motorways properly.",
        "background": "Middle-lane-sitting is a common problem for many motorway users, and often results on excessive overtaking speed, undertaking, road rage and congestion. I think this problem is largely caused by ignorance of proper road use and could be eased by instructing drivers to keep left using overhead signs.",
