        "additional_details": "Most people i have encountered have suffered from an increase to at least one Insurance policy in their lifetime through no fault of their own. Insurance is a \"just in case\" policy, that goes mostly untouched throughout your life. There are too many insurance companies adding extras to raise the premium of your policy, and in the event you need to make a claim, there are so many variables in the small print you are unable to claim. I want a clearer and fair system that isnt so expensive for all.",
        "background": "This petition is for the government to act on constant rises to Insurances across the board. There are insurances for everything these days and Insurance companies are charging huge premiums to the population to have them. Some Insurances are legal requirements and should not be so expensive.",

You obviously feel strongly about the cost of insurance, but it is not clear to us what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nThe Government does not directly control the cost of insurance. If you would like Parliament to agree to regulation of the insurance industry to achieve a particular outcome, you could start a petition calling for that."
