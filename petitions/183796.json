        "action": "Allow President Donald J. Trump to address Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "The speaker of the house should not allow personal opinion to cloud his judgement and he should make his decision with the best interests of the British people. Allowing President Trump to address Parliament and address any concerns that some of the British people have is what is best for Britain. Britain and the USA need to rebuild the 'special relationship',especially with the UK's exit of the EU. Furthermore, Mr. Bercow expressed no opposition to the President of China and the Emir of Kuwait.",
        "background": "Donald J. Trump has been democratically elected as the President of the United States, thus making him the most powerful person in the world. The speaker of the house John Bercow's position is supposed to be one of neutrality, the President should be allowed to address Parliament.",
