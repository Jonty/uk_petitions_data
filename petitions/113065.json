        "additional_details": "The OECD & Nuffield Trust has found that Britain currently needs 47700 more nurses and 26500 more doctors at a cost of \u00a35 billion to meet the standards of other developed countries.\r\n\r\nThe projected cost for the NHS by 2020 is \u00a330 billion. \u00a38 billion of that has been promised by the current government. It has been proposed that the remaining \u00a322 billion shortfall be met by efficiency savings.\r\n\r\nPromising increased 7 day services without increasing staff, funding & resources is unsafe for patients.",
        "background": "All NHS staff want an improved NHS 7 days a week. However, expectations of current NHS staff to provide a 7 day NHS without increased staff, funding or resources is unrealistic and will be unsafe for patients.",
