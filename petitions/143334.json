        "additional_details": "The power of the UK parliament and courts to make and enforce legislation has been gradually eroded over 40 years of EU membership.  Now that we are at last getting these powers back we need legislation affirming that sovereignty, that is to say the power to make and enforce our own laws, belongs to the people and to ensure that in future no government can transfer any aspect of sovereignty away from the UK parliament and courts without the consent of the people through a referendum.",
        "background": "When we leave the EU the power to make and enforce laws will be returned to the UK parliament and courts.  We need legislation to ensure that in future no government can transfer any aspect of sovereignty away from the UK parliament and courts without a referendum.\r\n\r\n",
