There are also links to Natural England Advice that demonstrates the area of Blackwater is already failing Water Framework Directive targets and that the river and seabed sediment is suffering from high concentrations of heavy metals and nitrates.

        "background": "The EA has rightly informed Magnox that an extension to the expired permit MUST be handled by a full application for the permit to be varied. But the EA then agrees to simply not 'enforce' the expired status while Magnox complete the application process and is allowing discharges to continue.",
