Michael Meacher & Dennis Skinner have been active since 1970 - nearly 37 years making decisions for our country. The term 'Father of the House' is unsettling. We should be a progressive country, not a frozen one. Change is healthy. Fresh ideas and fresh actions are needed now more than ever.\r\n\r\n",

The world has changed vastly since 1996, yet nearly 1/5 of MPs have been serving since then. Excessive continuous service prevents real political change for the UK. ",
