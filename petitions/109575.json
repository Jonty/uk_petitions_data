        "action": "Make prescriptions free for all university students.",
        "additional_details": "Indeed, free prescriptions to students will be a costly initiative. However, the cost of treating those with worsened conditions is greater than the initial cost of treatment at the onset. \r\n\r\nTake the moral perspective. With the recent uncapping of tuition fees, average debt of \u00a350,000, and a lack of affordable housing, how much more of a financial burden can be placed on a generation? \r\n\r\nTo put it simply, how can a generation pay such debts if they are too ill to work due to untreated conditions?",
        "background": "Currently university students born and studying in the UK have to pay \u00a38.20 per prescription. This petition urges MPs to consider the financial situation of all students. While a student can apply for low-income exemption, the process is lengthy and unnecessary. ",
