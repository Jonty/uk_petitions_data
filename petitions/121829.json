        "additional_details": "Alcohol-related admissions put A&E departments under severe pressure. Action needs to be taken to reduce both the physical and financial strain on the NHS.\r\n\r\n'Up to 35% of A&E visits are down to alcohol' (Balance Alcohol Office, 2015)\r\n\r\n'Often they don\u2019t need A&E help \u2013 they just need to sleep it off. But then they\u2019re drunk and don't know what they need so they just call [for a paramedic].' (Royal Liverpool Hospital, 2015)\r\n\r\n'The NHS incurs \u00a36.5bn a year in costs related to alcohol.' (NHS, 2014)",
        "background": "Introduce a fixed penalty notice and fine (~\u00a350) for admittances to A&E due to excessive alcohol consumption. Plus an additional charge for unnecessary ambulance call-outs.\r\nThis should, in theory, encourage people to consume within their limits and deter from binge drinking and drinking to excess.",
