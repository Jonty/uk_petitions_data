        "action": "The UK government must enact article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty immediately.",
        "additional_details": " The UK government should enact Article 50 immediately and commit to ensuring the UK's exit from the EU in line with the expressed will of the majority of the voters in the Referendum. Parliament must also assert that in the event of a vote on the terms of exit the result will not seek to overturn the decision to leave the EU merely to accept or reject the negotiated terms. In addition the government must accept that freedom of movement was expressly rejected by the electorate and cannot have a place in any agreed terms of exit.",
        "background": "Since the Referendum vote of the 23rd June there have been a number of attempts to delay implementation of Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty and justify a second referendum either on the decision or on the terms of the exit agreement.",
