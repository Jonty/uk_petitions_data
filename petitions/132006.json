        "additional_details": "For a student who began in 2012 and only took a loan for fees the monthly interest amount  being added to the loan while she was still studying ranged from \u00a311.85 in a month to \u00a3100.22 in a month - for 10 months of the 3 year period the monthly interest added that month was over \u00a390. Even where such a student is not earning enough for the repayments to kick in on graduation - over \u00a316 a month is being added to the debt every month. For students with maintenance loans this is doubled.",
        "background": "Currently the student loan company charges an interest rate of RPI + 3% from the first payment a university student receives for fees until the April after their course ends. Then an interest rate between RPI and RPI + 3% depending on what the former student is earning until it is paid.",
