        "additional_details": "The Year 11s who have been offered places from September, and the Year 12s who are being forced to change their plans halfway through their studies, are devastated by the proposal. However, the closure wouldn\u2019t just be a blow to current students. It would make it even harder for the children of Knowsley to access the opportunities promised by the Every Child Matters initiative. The Governing Body of Halewood Academy seems willing to write off a whole generation.\r\nhttp://www.halewoodacademy.co.uk/",
        "background": "On the 2nd March, the Governing Body of Halewood Academy proposed closing the school\u2019s sixth form. This is the only sixth form in Knowsley, one of the most deprived local authorities in the UK. Its closure would make it even harder for current and future students to get the education they deserve.",
