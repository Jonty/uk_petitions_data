        "additional_details": "In my experience cancer does come back  and quite often in a different area. This is why I feel it is important for all past and present cancer patients to receive a full body screening every year. I had a ovarian tumour removed in 2012 now in 2016 I have bowel cancer, I did receive yearly bloods targeted in pelvic area and the bowel cancer wasn't found. I feel by having full body screening yearly could save more lives, and less invasive treatment.",
        "background": "I would like the NHS change the way the NHS screen for cancer. I have lost Family members to cancer including my Dad. I myself am living with cancer and it scares me to death for myself and my 7 year old daughter who needs me here to be her mum. I want full screening every year for cancer patients.",
