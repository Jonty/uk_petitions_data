        "additional_details": "I believe that the father should be entitled to take and or share the maternity leave with his partner. These are extreme circumstances and should be looked at as such. When it comes to dealing with the death of a child, your gender does not come in to it. I am writing from personal experience as my son Zachary was stillborn at 11 days overdue on April 2nd 2013.\r\nI was treated extremely badly and inappropriately by my employer after having sick leave due to the death if my son.",
        "background": "Currently if a fathers child dies due to stillbirth or neonatal death they are only entitled to what their employer feels is required in terms of compassionate leave.  While a mother is fully entitled and rightly so to the full maternity leave.",
