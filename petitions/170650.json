        "additional_details": "It is important to clarify that this petition is not asking for ALL transactions to be rounded to the nearest 5p. This petition only applies to cash. It calls for removal of 1p and 2p coins, therefore any cash transaction would result in change given rounded to the nearest 5p.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n- If I were to use cash to buy a bottle of milk costing 99p, I would receive no change, since 1p rounds down to zero.\r\n\r\n- If I were to buy a cake costing 96p, I would receive 5p change, because 4p rounds up to 5p.",
        "background": "We the undersigned want to see the 1p and 2p pieces removed from circulation, since they are no longer of a useful value.\r\n\r\nOver time, due to inflation, the value of a coin decreases. The one and two penny pieces are now worth so little that we cannot buy anything useful with them.",
