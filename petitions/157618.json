        "additional_details": "Many people who voted for Brexit have now realised that: 1.  The money paid to the EU will not be going to the NHS and that Immigration probably won't be controlled.  They feel that they have been duped into voting Brexit, so now the MPs need to vote on this major long-term decision.",
        "background": "The Brexit vote isn't legally binding and therefore Parliament should vote on whether or not to invoke Article 50. This is a life changing, long-term change that the youngsters (73% majority) are dissatisfied with. They are the ones who will have to live with this action for decades.",
