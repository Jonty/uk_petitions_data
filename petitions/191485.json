        "background": "After hearing the Radio 2 discussion about the slaughter of Songbirds on MoD land in Cyprus I went to sign a petition asking the MoD to stop it - there is no such petition.\r\n\r\nRSPB estimate 1.7 million killed in 2016, approx 800,000 on MoD land.\r\nChris Packham advises there are simple solutions.",
