        "action": "Trident never dismantled, Forever Nuclear deterrence only for the UK's defence.",
        "additional_details": "Recently far left groups and leaders of parties have expressed their personal desire to remove the UKs nuclear arsenal and deterrence. Whilst they dream of this notion of 'if we dismantle, others will follow', This has never been the case and it is a matter of national security and defence that we maintain and enshrine that our nuclear deterrence is never taken away by any group or individual. One must wonder had Ukraine never dismantled would they be in the state they are today with Russia? ",
        "background": "We the signed would request the government to enshrine into law, that its the nations right and safety that Britain can never have their nuclear deterrence taken away by anyone or any group and forever maintained as a means of deterrence and national safety across the United Kingdom/Territories.",
