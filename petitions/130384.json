        "action": "Link time of raising earning threshold for Carers Allowance with the Living wage",
        "additional_details": "Unpaid carers save the UK \u00a3132 billion a year. For 2015/16, the overall NHS budget was around \u00a3116.4 billion. This comparison alone illustrates the net-worth of Carers and their contribution to the economy. It is therefore not unreasonable to suppose the Government values their worth and shows it in a meaningful way.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to link the time of raising the earnings threshold for Carer's Allowance with that of the Living Wage rise.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently earnings after allowable deductions must be no more that \u00a3110 pw but because the National Living Wage for over 25s is \u00a37.20hr. This means someone working 16 hrs a week will earn \u00a3115.20 per week. \u00a35.20 more than the amount allowed to earn and are at risk of losing their Carer's Allowance\r\n",
