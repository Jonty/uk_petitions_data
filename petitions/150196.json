A set of voting eligibility rules should have been laid out for EU citizens who have been here a certain amount of time, made the UK their home and contributed.\r\n",
        "background": "No votes for European residents but votes for Commonwealth residents. None for long standing Brits living elsewhere in the EU. The result is too marginal to call decisive. The 2 million EU citizens working and living  in the UK directly affected by this should be given a vote at a new referendum.",
