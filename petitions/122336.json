        "additional_details": "I have asked for military discount in various stores and been embarrassed when told they dont offer the discount. I never argued and just paid the full amount, checked again when I got home only to find their company do offer the discount.\r\n\r\nIf the VAT were scrapped this would allow all serving personnel past & present to know their country appreciates their service by giving a little back. A veteran ID card would have to be issued upon their leaving the military.",
        "background": "Having been in the military for 24+ years recently there has been a surge in people giving certain discounts to the military. Whilst helpful it is different in every store and vary from 1-20%. If this was available no company would lose out, the service person would also know where they stand. ",
