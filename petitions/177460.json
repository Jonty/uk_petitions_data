        "additional_details": "We have lost two babies at 23 weeks, both were classes as late miscarriages. For Rory we have an official record as he was born at 23 weeks but alive (birth and death certificates issued), for Henry, he didn't officially exist as he was born at 23+1 but was born still.\r\n\r\nI laboured both of my babies and I gave birth to them but only one officially exists.\r\n\r\nWe need to change how baby loss from 16 weeks is recored and recognised. Please sign.\r\n\r\nWe want recognition for all babies lost after 16 weeks.",
        "background": "At present if a baby is born sleeping before 24 weeks you get nothing to prove they existed, if after 24 weeks you get a record of stillbirth which helps with statistics of stillbirths. Neither are birth certificates.\r\n\r\nWe want recognition for all babies lost after 16 weeks.",
