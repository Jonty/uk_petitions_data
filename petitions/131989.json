        "action": "More funding in the NHS for prosthetic legs",
        "additional_details": "With the lack of funding the availability of resources are minimal, i get sores and ulcers and my leg gives way alot. Many others struggle with them as well and its a shame that we cant live our lives to the full, we cannot possibly afford private legs with better equipment and the large variety of things we can get to make the leg fit and feel better.  Please sign this petition as it will help me and many others to be independent.",
        "background": "I have been an amputee since i was 3. All the while i have been having problems with my prosthetic leg not because of the ability of staff but the lack of funding. Why should there be a price on someone's mobility? I struggle with my leg and many others do too, more funding means better legs.",
