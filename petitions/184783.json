        "action": "Stop the budget cuts for secondary schools in the London Borough of Sutton",
        "additional_details": "Sixth Form funding has been reduced by 12% and there have been huge cuts per pupil in sixth form funding. In 2012 the government introduced a cap on public sector pay rises at 1% and a 0.5% Apprenticeship Levy which applies most secondary schools each year but unfunded meaning that schools are paying more for the same staff and have to cut other areas of school life to pay for this. The government has increased employer contributions to NI and pension schemes significantly which will continue. ",
        "background": "Sutton Local Authority is suggesting that it will cut 0.5% from the budget it delegates to all secondary and primary schools.The government has removed the ESG which was \u00a377 per pupil to provide essential services.These extra costs as well as some others come to over half a million pounds each year.",
