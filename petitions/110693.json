Are paramedics not essential to society?",
        "background": "There is a huge national shortage of paramedics and I believe one of the main issues behind this is that many young people are put off attending a university course because of the \u00a39000 course fees. I believe paramedics are just as essential as all the other funded professions and should be funded.",
