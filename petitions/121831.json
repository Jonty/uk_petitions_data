        "action": "Move Parliament to a central UK location during building repairs at Westminster.",
        "additional_details": "Renovating the Houses of Parliament with Commons and Lords in occupation will be costly beyond belief.\r\nHistorically Parliament often moved.\r\nGermany has coped well with moving the Bundestag first to Bonn, and then back to Berlin.\r\nToday's (16 February 2016) news of the closing of Bede's World museum in Jarrow is just the latest indication of the dominance of London and the South East and the reinforcement of the North-South divide.",
        "background": "London-centric investment and thinking dominates at the expense of the rest of the UK. The political establishment, and the nation, would benefit immensely from having a more geographically central view point, if only temporarily for the duration of Houses of Parliament building works.",
