        "additional_details": "Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disease meaning every time I visit my granddad he loses his memory even more. My family and I decided to stay in the UK so we could spend the most amount of time as a family with my granddad. However, my mum has a visit visa and that doesn't allow her to stay with me. That means we have have to leave my dying granddad to stay with my mum or my mum has to leave us for a minimum of a year. That is very stressful because I love both my granddad and mum.",
        "background": "In August my family visited the UK to meet my sick grandfather. We realised he was dying from Parkinsons and decided to stay and look after him, however, my mum had a visit visa and the government wouldn't change it. The government is forcing my mum to leave me, my sister and my dad. Please help us.",
