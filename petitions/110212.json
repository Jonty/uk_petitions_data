        "additional_details": "In the pilot the results were that a quarter of landlords did not want to rent out to tenants that had a foreign name. The rental market is heated and logic dictates that if a landlord is presented with a British person or a foreign person with complicated visa status then landlords are clearly encouraged to discriminate and choose risk free option of the British tenant.\r\n\r\nChecking visa status is complicated, landlords are not Border Control officers and this leads to casual discrimination.\r\n",
        "background": "Landlords are now required to act as Border Control officers and check the immigration status of the tenants. Landlords will be subject to criminalisation.\r\nShadow home secretary, Andy Burnham: In practice, it could end up making Britain a more hostile place for anyone with a foreign-sounding name.",
