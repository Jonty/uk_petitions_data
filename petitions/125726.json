        "additional_details": "Great Britain has a massively disproportionate influence on the sport, with around half the teams based here, and all using British made parts, engineers and drivers - who are the second best performing nationality after the Germans.\r\n\r\nTaking F1 off free-to-air TV will inevitably lose future generations of engineers, drivers, and support staff; as children don't grow up being able to watch it and be inspired. It may also result in there being no British race and the PR that brings the country.",
        "background": "Sky Sports have just signed an exclusive deal for the TV rights. Now free-to-air TV can show only the British GP live, and only highlights of all other races. In Germany where this happened a few years ago, German Grand Prix attendance figures dropped so much the race there was cancelled.",
