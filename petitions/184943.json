This means students can\u2019t take copies of their anthologies into the exam...\" (AQA Exam Board, 2017, http://www.aqa.org.uk/resources/english/teach/printed-anthologies)",
        "background": "The new GSCE would have students memorise all the poems for the literature exam. It's unfair and students are stressed enough studying for other subjects which have also increased in difficultly.\r\nA copy of the anthology should be given to students taking the exam as has been done in the past.",
