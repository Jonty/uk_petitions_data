        "additional_details": "After having worked for many years in the health care sector, I have seen many vulnerable adults with no family network endure a time in hospital with no comforts, family or friends, for someone elderly or with dementia this can be unfamiliar and scary, due to funding, TVs cannot be provided for beds in many hospitals around the UK, yet many prison cells have TVs, on top of a social life, a small allowance and more. These TV's could be used to make the day brighter for those with nothing else.",
        "background": "Many elderly people who have fallen or become unwell, have no relations, comfort or entertainment in hospital, yet prisons continue to have TVs for prisoners, who have other entertainment, and social lives, this funding should be prioritised to help older or vulnerable people, with nothing else.
