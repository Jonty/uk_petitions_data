        "action": "Debate: the EU Referendum result was damaged by lies and misleading information.",
        "additional_details": "The Leave campaign and the media backing them promoted to the public as truths, that the NHS will receive \u00a3350m a week if we leave the EU, that Turkey was about to join the EU, and that the UK can control immigration whilst still keeping single market access, and more. They knew all these claims to be lies.  The Leave campaign therefore critically damaged the fairness of the voting process and the result cannot and should not be relied upon by UK Government.",
        "background": "In the run-up to the EU Referendum vote, lies and deliberately misleading information were presented as truths by the Leave Campaign and the media that backed them in order to win votes. As a result of these actions the vote was damaged and cannot be relied upon as the true will of the people.",
