        "action": "Promise to match EU spending within the UK in the event of Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "The EU contributed \u00a35.2bn a year to the UK, by various mechanisms. Given that in the event of Britain leaving the EU we will not be paying membership fees, we would ask that the government promise to maintain the payments that would have been made by the EU. This will, for example, protect vulnerable areas of the UK by matching the funding they would have received from the European development fund.",
        "background": "A large part of the campaign to leave the EU was based on the fact that the UK is a net contributor to the EU funds. We contribute \u00a312.9bn a year (gross) or \u00a37.1bn a year (net). In the event of Brexit, we would ask the government to maintain the level of investment in the UK that the EU contributed.",
