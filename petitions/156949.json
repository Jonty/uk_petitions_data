        "additional_details": "We respect that there are people who think the Remain campaign lied. Before the referendum, 250 academics signed a letter in the Telegraph criticising misinformation on both sides of the campaign. \r\n\r\nWe note that the Remain campaign leaflet began by saying that \u201cover 3 million UK jobs are linked to our exports to the EU\u201d, when not all these jobs would necessarily go.\r\n\r\nBut since the referendum, Leave campaigners have also changed their tune on key promises about immigration and the single market. ",
        "background": "All of the British public, no matter which side we supported, have been betrayed by abuses of the democratic process in the campaign for the EU Referendum. Leave's winning campaign lied to the electorate, above all with their \u00a3350 million for the NHS pledge. We are afraid for our democracy.",
