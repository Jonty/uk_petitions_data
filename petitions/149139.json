        "action": "Call on Parliament to use its sovereignty to overrule decision to leave the EU",
        "additional_details": "Parliament's duty is to represent the British public and a decision such as leaving the EU must be based on a much higher majority vote to truly reflect the will of the people. Those who voted to leave have concerns that need to be recognised and addressed but the public outcry against the result cannot be ignored either. The result of the referendum should be taken as a show of public disaffection with the current arrangement and not a legal obligation to leave the EU. ",
        "background": "The referendum was an advisory vote and is not a binding decision. Britiain should not be forced to leave the EU when 48% of the British public voted to remain. Britain should instead remain in the EU and look to reform the relationship and negotiate our membership.",
