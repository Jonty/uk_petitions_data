This is for staff who work u social hours. No emergency services or public sector workers who work unsocial hours get this payment so he BBC staff should fund their own meals",
        "background": "The staff at the BBC currently claim their meal allowance when they work a late shift. This is funded by the UK licence payer. Public and emergency services cannot do this and work unsocial hours so why should the BBC be any different. They should provide their own meals",
