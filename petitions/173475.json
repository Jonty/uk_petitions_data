        "additional_details": "Nigel Farage and Donald Trump appear to have a close professional relationship. Mr Farage has appeared at his rallies prior to the US election,flew to the US on Remembrance Day to congratulate Mr Trump on his victory,and Mr Trump has stated that \"Many people would like to see\" him as ambassador.This raises concerns that Mr Farage is providing advise or other information contradictory to that provided by Sir Kim Darroch,the ambassador chosen by the UK's democratically elected government",
