        "additional_details": "This petition was started by Leanne Burgess, founder of disability awareness campaign 'Changing Impressions'.\r\n\r\nThis petition started as a result of significant interest on the campaign Facebook page. Resources such as portable and static beach ramps and 'beach buggies', which allowed wheelchair users to join their family and friends on the beach, were warmly received and something that many people were keen to find and use.\r\n\r\nWe would now like to see more of these opportunities in England.\r\n",
        "background": "This petition aims to secure wheelchair access down the beach and to the sea at a mimimum of one beach per coastal county in England. Examples of appropriate strategies include discrete beach ramps or specialist equipment that could be available during seasonal breaks.",
