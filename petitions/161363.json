        "additional_details": "The only way to effectively treat this condition is surgery. It doesn't just effect women, lipoedema can effect men as well.\r\n\r\nPatients with Lipoedema have painful, enlarged, lumpy, misshaped and often badly bruised arms and legs. Currently patients are left to suffer as the disfiguration of the limbs becomes more pronounced, the pain increases and their mobility and enjoyment of everyday activities decreases.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and get the Lipoedema patients the treatment they deserve. \r\n",
        "background": "Lipoedema is a genetic adipose tissue disorder which causes patients legs & arms to grow largely out of proportion. This can be an incredibly painful, embarrassing & debilitating condition. It's estimated to affect 11% of women worldwide! \r\n",
