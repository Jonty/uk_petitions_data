        "additional_details": "A by-election should be planned so an MP is elected who represents the views of not just the constituents of Tottenham but also those of the UK. David Lammy has shown that he does not hold our values such as democracy and is therefore undeserving of the post in the House of Commons to help legislate for the British people who he obviously does not represent. I understand that many people did not get what they wanted, but this is a democracy and therefore the majority decision must be respected.",
        "background": "David Lammy, MP for Tottenham has shown on the 25th of June 2016 that he is incapable of fulfilling his duty as a democratically elected MP. He is intentionally ignoring the will of the British people in wishing to overturn the EU referendum achieved by a democratic vote. ",
