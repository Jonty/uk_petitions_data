I said to radio cumbria and itv back in 2005 what we should be doing which is all documented and corroborated by a professor from London university but the EA would not listen and were adamant that even after spending the \u00a345m they still could not stop the flooding this was also the quote from Glynn Vaughan the then flood defence manager this is also documented to the news and star. My reasons for contacting you now is that I have said it before and will say it  we should be reducing the flow of water from the source. This is the same idea for all areas that were flooded and could have been prevented if the EA would listen.        ",
        "background": "I propose preventative flooding by containing the water in the lakes if there is no lake we build one and contain the water before it floods homes and businesses not building higher or more flood defences that clearly do not work. ",
