        "additional_details": "These advertisements not only make television viewing and internet browsing highly unpleasant, but encourage those who do not ordinarily gamble to do so and also encourages those who are trying to stop gambling to continue. In an economy where we need growth through people saving money then spending in the right way and the avoidance of huge personal debt, it would be a step in the right direction all advertisements encouraging people to gamble to be banned.",
        "background": "Gambling is the worst addiction. It ruins people's lives and has a massive effect causing depression, stress, violence. Children in the future will think it's normal as it's being advertised everywhere. One bet can change your life forever.",
