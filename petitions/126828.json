        "additional_details": "some people dream of fancy cars, big houses, lavish life styles. what i dream about is to be able to have my own baby. feel my baby grow inside of me, give birth to it and love it unconditionally. but unfortunately due to the unfairness of the postcode lottery my dreams seem impossible.  the nice recommendations suggest 3 IVF cycles for there to be a successful outcome, why are we given a choice of non to three cycles because of our postcode. we need more funding per councils.",
        "background": "me and my husband have been trying for a baby for 5 years. i was diagnosed with hereditary anovulatory PCOS and my husband has a low sperm count.  we were offered 1 NHS funded IVF cycle. 10 days after implantation that failed. now our dreams have been shattered and we are now back to square one.",
