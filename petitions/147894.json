        "background": "Although the EU referendum has produced a decision to leave, the legal mechanism in order to do so is to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the Lisbon. There should therefore be a full debate and vote in Parliament before Article 50 is invoked, and Parliament should have oversight of this process.",
