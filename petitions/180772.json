We don't hate immigrants but those countries have too much terror risks and we can't allow them in. Also Saudi Arabia is even worse. The financial benefits from visiting wealthy Saudis are only benefiting the super rich.",

Not taking refugees and closing our borders doesn't mean we are \u201cheartless\u201d or \u201cracists\u201d. I lock my doors every night. I don't lock them because I \"hate\" the people outside. I lock them because I LOVE the people INSIDE! ",
