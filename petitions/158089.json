        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom should apply to join the union of the United States as the States of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Geographically, London is almost equally as far from New York as Honolulu is from Los Angeles. Let's join the USA and become a part of a global project that actually worked!",

It's the world's largest economy, best military and 2nd largest single-market after the EU. Everyone speaks English, and there is an unparalleled cultural and historical link.",
