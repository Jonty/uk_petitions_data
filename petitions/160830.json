        "action": "Non paying parents living partners income should be taken in to consideration",
        "additional_details": "The CSA used to take the partners income in to consideration but was later changed. Now it is easier for the non paying parent to not pay for their child which means the child is going without! I believe as many others do that if the non paying parent claims to have no income (nill rate) or little to none income and is living with their partner who is supposedly supporting them then their partners income should be considered to help pay towards the non paying parents child.",
        "background": "Child Maintenance should take in to consideration a non paying parents partners income whom they live with. So many parents do not pay for their children and many of these parents are actually working with either being paid cash in hand or their income being paid in to there partners bank account.",
