        "additional_details": "This is important to me as i am experiencing this myself. I am wanting to change this  and stop making people waiting for professional help and get the qualified people in. By raising awareness we can make those vulnerable people and their friends and families feel they are not alone and make more peoples lives better. This can be done with more advertisement, more qualified professionals to set up more social action projects and one to one appointments.",

This has caused people to be in a worse situation than they would of if the had the support in the first place. ",
