        "additional_details": "Regardless of whether the SNP agree or not, Scotland is an important constituent state within the United Kingdom. The British taxpayer also pays for these types of referendums. The majority of Rest of the UK (rUK) citizens do not want to see their country broken apart, and the only way to prevent this, in the case of another independence referendum being announced, is to force the government to agree to allowing all UK citizens to vote on the issue.",
        "background": "On Monday 13th March 2017, Scottish FM Nicola Sturgeon declared her intention to hold another independence referendum. IF Scotland chose to vote for independence, it would break-up the UK, a historic country that most British people do not want to see torn apart by the monotone rhetoric of the SNP.",
