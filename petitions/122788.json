        "action": "Strictly ban the construction of houses near rivers in London and elsewhere",
        "additional_details": "Flooding is the greatest risk for riverfront property owners. Even with elaborate flood control systems in place, varying water levels throughout the year can cause trouble for homes that are too low and too close to the banks. The risk of flooding increases significantly with rivers that have little or no flood control. The fallout from flooding could lead to extensive property damage and expensive, time-consuming repairs. So based on current predictions of climate change, it's a must-to-do.",
        "background": "Should the government promise better and faster flood responses, it must stop people from building houses near rivers and ensure well funded and organised flood defences installed in critical areas.",
