        "additional_details": "On 2nd September 2016, Go-Ahead announced full-year profits (y/e 2nd July 2016) of \u00a399.8m, an increase of 26.8% over the previous financial year.\r\n\r\nParliament should debate whether the payment of \u00a320m can be justified in light of the demonstrated profitability of Go-Ahead, or whether a private enterprise should fund the improvements to its service from cash on deposit and profits.\r\n\r\nIf GTR cannot or will not fund the improvements to services, it should consider resigning its franchises.",
        "background": "Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) has been granted a \u00a320m fund to \"get to grips\" with problems on the Southern rail network.\r\n\r\nGTR is jointly owned by Go-Ahead (2/3) and Keolis (1/3), who between them also hold the Southeastern and London Midland franchises.",
