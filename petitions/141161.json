        "additional_details": "The referendum vote was *not*:\r\n\r\n1) a vote for further renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership;\r\n2) a provisional vote subject to the possibility of a second referendum;\r\n3) a vote to leave the EU at the whim or pleasure of Parliament or any other institution in the UK;\r\n4) a vote for any delay in leaving beyond the minimum time necessary to make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nRather, it was a vote to *leave* the EU pure and simple. Parliament must do its constitutional duty *immediately*.",
        "background": "On 23 June 2016 the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. This is a direct, explicit expression of the popular will, which must be implemented in full and as soon as possible. Unnecessary delay will cause avoidable damage to this country & frustrate the will of the people.",
