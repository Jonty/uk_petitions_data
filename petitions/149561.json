You need to seriously consider if you want to buy foreign goods and services over and above our own.\r\n\r\nThis country consistently imports more goods than it sells. We purchase goods from all around the world while other countries dump their products at below cost prices - Steel from China for example.\r\n\r\nThe Elephant in the room is Globalisation. We MUST challenge it.\r\n\r\n If we can do one thing to support our own economy it is to buy British!",

In this world we need to strengthen and maximise the revenue from the products we manufacture and the services we sell not just to the world but also within our own UK market.\r\n\r\nIf you voted for Leave or Stay - vote for this. \r\n",
