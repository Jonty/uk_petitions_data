        "action": "Grant an amnesty to all illegal immigrants living in the UK prior to 23.06.2016.",
        "additional_details": "Illegal immigrants are already victimised in many ways, for example by being indebted to people traffickers, enslaved as sweatshop workers, and exploited as sex workers. This situation can only worsen if Britain's exit from the EU is understood as a victory for a xenophobes and racists. Granting amnesty to illegal immigrants would provide them with a way out of their current servitude and save them from the aggression of right-wing thugs. ",
        "background": "Following Britain's decision to leave the EU, many people fear a significant shift to the right and violence against foreign nationals living in Britain. To prevent the victimisation of illegal immigrants by right-wing radicals, they need to have the full protection of the law as British citizens.",
