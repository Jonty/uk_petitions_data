        "action": "Give the electorate a referendum on the decision to replace the Human Rights Act",
        "additional_details": "The HRA protects us from each other, corporations and our own government. As such the decision to remove or change that protection should ultimately should lie with the people of the UK not politicians. In the past we've been rightly proud of our tough stance around the world on human rights. A decision on something as important as this has to have the backing of the majority of the electorate, not just the 36% that voted Conservative. ",
        "background": "The Human Rights Act is an important act designed to protect each and every individual. We are asking you to do the democratic thing and bring this decision before the electorate in a referendum and let them decide if they want a British Bill of Right' or keep the existing Human Rights legislation.",
