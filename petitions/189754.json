        "action": "End the Safe Return Review policy and grant automatic settlement to refugees",
        "additional_details": "Because refugees, employers and colleges can no longer assume a refugee will qualify for settlement, it will be harder for refugees to find work, commit to educational courses or simply settle down and rebuild their lives. It means some refugees will be at risk of detention, deportation or navigating hostile environment policies. It means more work for Home Office, more potential for bad decisions made by caseworkers, and more legal burden on people fleeing persecution.\r\n\r\nSee: https://www.freemovement.org.uk/home-office-ends-policy-automatic-settlement-refugees-five-years/",
        "background": "This new policy means that refugees are deprived of long-term security, certainty and peace of mind by denying them automatic permanent residence.\r\n\r\nWe demand the right of automatic settlement for refugees. \r\n\r\n#RefugeesWelcome\r\n",
