        "additional_details": "As well as leaving the EU the breakup of the United Kingdom is also of constitutional significance.  People were unaware when voting on the EU referendum that Scotland leaving the UK  might be a likely consequence.  It is wholly undemocratic simply to rely on a referendum of the complexity of the EU vote only later to find out it has further unforseen constitutional consequences.  It is for this reason Parliament is supreme and for this reason Parliament should block further moves pending this.",
        "background": "The issue of Scotland leaving the United Kingdom was never placed before the British electorate in the context of leaving the EU.  Fairness requires that the electorate vote on leaving the EU in full knowledge of this implication. ",
