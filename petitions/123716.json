        "additional_details": "While this was an unpopular decision, consideration must be taken into account that nurses have not received a pay rise in well over 5 years. The NMC should be made so that we can pay our retention fees on a monthly direct debit basis to ease the burden as many of us are struggling. There is no reason this can not be done. ",
        "background": "As we are all aware the NMC have increased their retention fees, the first hike was in 2012 from \u00a375 to \u00a3100. The second hike in 2014 from \u00a3100 to \u00a3125. Both increases were well above the rate of inflation and left many of us struggling to pay. ",
