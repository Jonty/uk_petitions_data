        "action": "Call a referendum on the UK remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA).",
        "additional_details": "The EEA is the single market - it is Europe without Federalist aspirations. It allows the UK to trade freely with the EU. The UK is a signatory of this agreement and the \"presumption of continuity\" allows the UK to remain within the EEA if we so choose; there is no mechanism to eject us. The result of the EU referendum has been distorted and misinterpreted. The only thing we can conclude is that voters did not want to be part of the EU; EEA membership was not voted on.",
        "background": "The UK referendum rejected membership of the EU but voters were unable to express a preference for remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA - the Single Market). The most logical and democratic way to resolve this question is to have a new referendum with a new question.",
