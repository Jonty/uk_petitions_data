        "additional_details": "This petition is in response to the misrepresentations, mistruths and lies that the electorate were fed by politicians in the EU referendum. \r\n\r\nImmediate admissions have been made that information in the campaigns was misleading (such as Farage stating that the \u00a3350m NHS claim was a \u2018mistake\u2019 / and Liam Fox confirming that the correct number is \u2018a net \u00a310bln\u2019 or \u2018more like \u00a3160m\u2019, etc.) \r\n\r\nThe UK electorate has a right to expect politicians to be clear, fair and not misleading in all statements.",
        "background": "The \u2018clear, fair and not misleading\u2019 requirement is used in financial services, where companies are accountable for the statements they make about their products to customers. Statements made by politicians may influence the entire country - and should at least meet this same threshold.",
