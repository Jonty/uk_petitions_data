        "additional_details": "Eastern Aleppo's children's hospital has been bombed. Sick children and babies have no place to receive basic care. Other basic resources, such as food, are running out.\r\n\r\nThe UK understands the importance of removing women and children from cities being bombed, as this was practised during WWII. The situation is even more dire in Syria. We cannot stand by and do nothing. The UK must lead. We mus act now to save these children.",
        "background": "The situation in Syria, particularly in Eastern Aleppo and other areas under siege, continues to deteriorate beyond what is livable. Attempts at peace have failed. We believe that the United Kingdom must lead the way in providing the safe removal of children and pregnant women from these areas.",
