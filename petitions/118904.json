        "additional_details": "The editor of the British Medical Journal has written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to protest at the misrepresentation of statistics as have 2000 doctors but he, the prime minister and other government members keep misleading the public. There is now evidence that they are putting lives at risk by deterring people from seeking treatment at weekends when there is, and always has been, 7 day emergency cover in the NHS.",
        "background": "The government have been using a study about weekend deaths in the NHS to give the false impression that excess deaths are due to inadequate staffing. The study itself says it would be 'rash and misleading' to draw any such conclusion.",
