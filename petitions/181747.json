        "action": "Add 1p tax on all cartons/bottles/packet sold - money used to clean our streets",
        "additional_details": "I recently walked two miles of a country lane and collected 28 black bags of plastic and cans! We are sinking in rubbish. A 1p levy on each item (multi packs - 12 pack would pay 12p more) would raise a huge amount of money and could be granted to local councils 'ring fenced' to pay for new employees to clean up the problem.",
        "background": "Our cities are getting filthier because of the litter, even our countryside is now suffering badly. Councils find it ever harder to deal with this issue with budgetary restraints, particularly in rural areas. Adding 1p to an item will not add much to its cost but could have a very positive effect.",
