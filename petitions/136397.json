        "additional_details": "Young members of voting demographic feel disenfranchised and as though they have unfairly lost out on something they believed in. 48% of the public who voted wish to remain in the EU and do not want a far right, nationalist government. In order for this proportion of the population to feel represented and valued as voters and citizens, those wishing to remain need to be represented equally by senior remain politicians in the new government framework after Cameron's formal resignation. ",
        "background": "48% of the voting public wanted to remain in the EU, it is unrepresentative and undemocratic that the leaders of our government should stand for a UK polar opposite to what we stand for. Significant Remain Tory representatives should have key roles in the upcoming changes within cabinet.",
