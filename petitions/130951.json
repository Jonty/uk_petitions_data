        "action": "Allow commuters to claim income tax relief on the cost of travelling to work.",
        "additional_details": "If all workers had the opportunity to claim tax relief on their annual commute this would ease the housing market, create job mobility and employment in more regions. \r\nAn annual railcard from Worcester to Paddington costs \u00a310,000. If a 40% tax payer could claim income tax back against this, it would have an effective cost of about \u00a36500. It is unfair, unreasonable & damaging to the mindset of all employees that they are taxed to go to work.It is an unfair burden on hard working people.",
        "background": "Commuters spend their own money to travel to work. Fuel & public transport costs rise and it costs more per year to get to work. House prices force people out of areas & make more expensive commutes. Where workers live & where companies are located could be positively influenced by such a move.",
