From September 2014, maintained primary schools must teach a modern or ancient foreign language to pupils at key stage 2.\r\n\r\nThe government accepts that British Sign Language (BSL) can be a beneficial subject that schools might choose to teach in addition to foreign languages. However, the national curriculum programmes of study for languages contain a number of requirements that could not be met through BSL; for example at key stage 2 the requirement to describe people, places, things and actions in writing. A maintained school would therefore be unable to meet the curriculum requirement solely by teaching BSL.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",
