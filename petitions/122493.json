        "action": "Abolish plans for extended Sunday trading hours in England",
        "additional_details": "500 characters is not enough to lay the foundations of an objection to the extending of retail opening hours. I would however be happy to stand before parliament and offer my thoughts on any proposed increase to Sunday trading hours. Should any owner of a retail outlet in the UK, be opposed to my petition, then I will happily face them and debate my point until the proverbial cows come home! Please be aware, I would encourage substantial evidence to prove a benefit in increased trading hours.   ",
        "background": "Sunday trading hours are already extensive enough without increasing them and further, removing any quality family time that may be enjoyed by those that work in the retail sector. Productivity and profit will not increase, only time and costs involved will be added to. Say no to extra time!",
