        "additional_details": "There is a huge financial strain on Student Nurses and Midwives. The government support with this matter would relieve some of this financial pressure. Although whilst working placement hours students are not contracted to the NHS or paid for their efforts, the contact time mirrors that of a full time job. Consequently, 30 hours funded childcare would be greatly benificial and help relieve some of the financial burden medical students selflessly undergo to serve the health service & UK citizens.",
        "background": "30 hours free childcare is going to be made ONLY available to working families, where both parents do paid work. I would simply like to request that this support is extended to Student Nurses, Midwives and other medical professionals with children in recognition of full time working placement hours.",
