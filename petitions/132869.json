        "action": "Pass a law prohibiting or limiting referendums",
        "additional_details": "We live in a representative democracy. It is important that people have a say in their own government but it is equally important that we avoid a tyranny of the majority and that on particular issues voting proceeds on the basis of knowledge and understanding. Representative democracy, for all its flaws, achieves that goal better than any referendum can.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the referendum process distracts from other issues, falsely turns complex questions into binary choices and fosters division.\r\n",
        "background": "Parliament should pass a law either prohibiting referendums or requiring that the result that would change the status quo would need to achieve more than two-thirds of the votes cast to pass.\r\n\r\nThe current EU referendum demonstrates that too often they are - disruptive, divisive and distracting.",
