        "additional_details": "Our daughter lost her life due to a drunk driver 3 times over the limit. The sentence was 8 years but given the opportunity to plead guilty this was reduced to 5 years. He was subsequently released having served only 30 months. To any family experiencing such events this type of sentence is severely distressing and flawed. Such sentencing must be assessed and addressed. These individuals are released and free to continue there lifestyles whilst the families are left with the life sentence. ",
        "background": "People who commit driving offences relating to excess alcohol are given sentences that are reduced after admitting guilt. Individuals do not deserve this opportunity and should serve full term to deter others,highlight the severity of such crime and show judicial support to victims and the families.",
