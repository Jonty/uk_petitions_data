        "action": "Back into society and work schemes for survivors of sexual and domestic abuse",
        "additional_details": "In the last few years the U.K has seen massive cuts to helplines and therapy centres that provide great help to victims of abuse. A scheme was introduced that helps offenders of such abuse get back into society and start working again after their sentence or provides skills and training in prisons. Unfortunately no such scheme is in place to help victims get back into socialising, learning new skills, being able to work and sometimes even keep their homes. This needs to change.",
        "background": "lots of centres do not receive enough funding for survivors of sexual/domestic abuse, leaving the victim vulnerable and alone. Often secluded and struggling to live. There are schemes in place to help offenders of such crimes to get back into society and working but no such scheme for victims.",
