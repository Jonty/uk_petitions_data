        "additional_details": "PIP has replaced disability living allowance. This helps with that food & household bill which you all know isn't always a nice total.\r\nMy brother is severely disabled and needs around the clock care. With very limited job opportunities he has to rely on PIP which is going to be reduced. \r\nThe government shouldn't be supporting those who earn a comfortable amount by giving them a train that gets them to work 30 minutes quicker and ignoring the vulnerable who need the funding to enjoy their life.",
        "background": "PIP helps those over the age of 16, who are living with a long term illness or a disability effecting their daily living, with added costs for living. Currently individuals can receive between \u00a321.80 - \u00a3139.75 a week & Mr Osbourne wants to cut this by a total of \u00a31.2billion & affect 640,00 people.",
