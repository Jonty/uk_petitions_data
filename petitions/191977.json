        "additional_details": "By building more social housing with affordable rents, prioritised for local people, areas can retain there unique cultures. This will also reduce rents for private tenants as demand is reduced, due to people having social housing available. In the longer term, house prices will then reduce as demand from landlords for properties they can rent out is reduced as they get less return on their investment. Private builders cant solve the crisis but councils can with social housing.",
        "background": "Many people in their 20's, 30's and 40's are forced to live in private rental accommodation that is costing them a fortune and that in some cases is not fit for purpose. They are also being forced out of the areas they grew up in due to the high cost of housing.",
