A huge majority of these people will be working and paying taxes etc. Google, Amazon and Starbucks meanwhile make huge profits and don't pay taxes. If they were made to pay then there would be no need for the Government to seek revenue elsewhere. ",

These are  the people the safety net was made for because for whatever reason they cannot afford their own property. Please help make the Government see how unfair this will be.",
