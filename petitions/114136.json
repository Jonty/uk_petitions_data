        "action": "Force free votes in government bills where the election mandate is less than 50%",
        "additional_details": "The current election system allows governments to take power with low mandates from the electorate. However at the same time the current government with a mandate of less than 30% are pushing through dangerous NHS changes and making strikes legal only if they have a mandate of 50% of eligible voters. This is inconsistent and focuses power on those who already have it, while disenfranchising workers. The whip system gives to much power to governments with a minority vote and should be restricted.",
        "background": "The government are pushing NHS changes citing their manifesto pledge and an election mandate to deliver it, when less than 30% of the electorate voted for the Conservative party. Unions will soon require 50% of the eligible voters to mandate a legal strike. This inconsistency should be resolved.",
