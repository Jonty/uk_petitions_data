        "additional_details": "By making votes transparent on a Gov website, everyone can see their name and everyone can independently verify the facts... not only will this be a fairer society but it means as a people we can start to build some trust back to our government, just looked what happened with the Scottish independence vote, very close to call... but plenty cried foul play .. with a transparent system we all would know... and truth is a very rare commodity these days. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YKpvTBmdCI",
        "background": "Its not who voted that counts, Its who counted the votes !!\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely crazy to me that in democratic societies, the voting process is a secret process. WHY? this opens the door to fraud and voter rigging, a government or party could fudge the numbers and everybody would be non the wiser.\r\n",
