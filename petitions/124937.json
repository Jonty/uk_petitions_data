        "additional_details": "We are in the age of cuts, cuts & more cuts and the citizens of the UK simply do not have \u00a3145 available. The BBC have already scrapped BBC THREE and now we are getting even less for our money. So help us help you by signing this petition to decriminalise nonpayment of the BBC's TV licence. ABOLISH THE TV LICENCE TAX!",
        "background": "The BBC are backed by the UK Government to criminalise non payers of the TV licence. It currently costs \u00a3145 a year for a colour licence. The people of the UK shouldn't be forced into paying a company that sort of money. Let's call on the government to decriminalise non payment of the TV licence!",
