        "additional_details": "Under the Parliamentary Oaths Act 1866, members of both Houses of Parliament are required to take an Oath of Allegiance [ to the Monarchy & any successors ] upon taking their seat in Parliament, after a general election, or by-election, and after the death of the monarch. Until the oath or affirmation is taken, an MP may not receive a salary, take their seat, speak in debates or vote. \r\n\r\nShould elected representatives of the people not be swearing allegiance to those they represent - the People? ",
        "background": "Take Magna Carta to the next level, prove also that we know longer live under 'The Divine Right Of Kings' - protect the people from the Monarchy. It is ludicrous that serving politicians elected by the people have to swear allegiance to the Crown before taking up office. Is this 2015 or 1615? ",
