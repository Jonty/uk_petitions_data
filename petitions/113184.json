        "additional_details": "Only an adult should be allowed to vote .\r\nMost children under 18 years old , have no interest in politics and have very little life experience especially in the  history of the UK and Europe as a whole so would likely  vote in the same way as their parent/s . This would therefore be a disproportionate vote and would not give a true reflection of the wishes of the UK's electorate. ",
        "background": "Peers have backed calls to give 16- and 17-year-olds the right to take part in the UK's EU referendum.  Peers are a body of people who have not been voted into position by the UK electorate and should have no say what so ever in who should be able to vote in the upcoming referendum .",
