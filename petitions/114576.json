        "additional_details": "Recent polls on the subject of military action in Syria have shown a substantial gap between how MPs vote and how the people they are supposed to represent want them to vote.\r\nOn a topic as important and with as deadly consequences as military action this is unacceptable and makes a mockery of British democracy. \r\nThe UK government should have to make its case to the British people and allow them to decide just as it does with the parliament.\r\nOther countries manage snap referenda on lesser issues.",
        "background": "We believe that all current and future military actions, beyond the immediate defence of our borders, should have to be validated by a referendum to check that such action represents the general will of the people of the UK.",
