        "action": "Stop medical appointments affecting school attendance",
        "additional_details": "My daughter has a rare chromosome condition and has to have lots of different hospital appointments. She has always caught up at school but is marked down for attendance. Schools offer rewards and incentives to children that achieve 100% attendance records, they are penalising children with health needs and disabilities through no fault of their own. I am asking that schools be required by law to take into consideration of medical appointments when working out attendance.",
        "background": "I don't feel its fair that children with disabilities and illnesses are penalised for having essential and critical appointments that they need. Surely this is some sort of discrimination??",
