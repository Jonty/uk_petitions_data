        "action": "Ensure 100% broadband coverage for everyone in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Approx. a million businesses & homes \u2014 mainly rural areas \u2014 will not be receiving superfast broadband by close of 2016, and for those who have poor broadband service, its \u2018Universal Service Obligation\u2019 will require homes and businesses in the 5 per cent of areas that don\u2019t yet have fast broadband to request the service & pay for it themselves. It could take until 2020 for the connection to arrive. This petition is to fix this unjust & ensure the Government reverts to their promise 100% service.",
        "background": "Access to broadband is now a key utility, & in business relied upon as much as water, light and heat. 95% of the UK is covered by some form of broadband connection is fine; denying the remaining 5% - businesses and consumers - (mainly rural areas) is a disgrace; & is creating a two speed country.
