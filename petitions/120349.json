        "additional_details": "\"Book bans\", \"super prisons\", \"secure colleges\", \"dual contracts\" etc etc MoJ has recently set about publicly funded law - Crime, Family etc - not with a scalpel but with an ideological machete. The results are now plain to see. Andy Slaughter MP asked \"How much public money & civil service time has been spent on the aborted tendering processes, the court cases & the consultations in the past three years?\" Shailesh Vara MP replied it would be a waste of time! The taxpaying public deserve answers!",
        "background": "The MoJ, in the coalition Govt & this Parliament, has introduced numerous, ill-thought-out, rushed, & ultimately abandoned policies, especially radically \"reforming\" inter alia Criminal Legal Aid. After numerous consultations & judicial reviews the MoJ reforms are in tatters. At doubtless huge cost.",
