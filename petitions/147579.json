        "additional_details": "The consequences of the UK leaving the EU are serious and potentially not reversable.\r\nThe value of sterling has fallen, our Prime Minister has resigned, half of the shadow cabinet has resigned, $2trillion has been wiped off world markets, the Bank of England has put aside \u00a3250bn to stabilise the UK economy and this is before we've even exited the largest single market. We have democratically elected MPs who should be making informed decisions on our behalf - we must utilise them! Let's remain.",
        "background": "We petition for the government to not trigger Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union based upon the result of the non-binding referendum but instead put the vote to parliamentry debate for MPs to decide, who have now seen the severe negative consequences of the UK opting to leave the EU.",
