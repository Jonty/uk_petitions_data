        "action": "Raise taxes to fund the NHS",
        "additional_details": "The NHS provides one of the cheapest comprehensive healthcare systems in the world; significantly cheaper to individual patients than an insurance-based privatised system.\r\n\r\nAn ageing population and our ability to treat previously untreatable diseases have significantly increased NHS spending. We must find a way to fund the service before it succumbs to further insidious privatisation. A privatised healthcare system would increase patient costs significantly and limit access to the less wealthy.",
        "background": "Our NHS needs more financial investment, as has been made clear in Parliamentary debates, the media, and first hand accounts from front line staff. If the Treasury truly cannot afford to fund the much publicised deficit, we ask that taxes be raised to meet this urgent need.\r\n\r\nThe NHS must not fail.",
