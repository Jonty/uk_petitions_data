        "action": "Increase pressure on Indian government to allow Kashmiris a fair referendum",
        "additional_details": "\"At the time of India and Pakistan\u2019s independence from Britain, Kashmir was free to accede to either country. In 1948, the UN Security Council decided that Kashmir\u2019s future should be determined by a plebiscite. But India has continuously refused to discuss any real autonomy for Kashmiris. The most likely outcome is that Kashmir will become independent if autonomy is granted. In a recent poll, almost 75% of Kashmiris, including Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists, favoured independence. \" - Dr Rita Pal",
        "background": "\"The people of Kashmir have made it obvious that they want freedom.  There have been daily protests resulting in the loss of many lives. In order to stop the bloodshed, a robust political solution is required. Kashmiris should have the right to vote on their own independence and freedom.\"",
