        "additional_details": "All parties should be involved in the re-negotiations with the EU. This will enable them to present their own domestic, foreign, immigration and trade strategies to the electorate. A single independent body should review all financial and policy projections and report to the electorate, not the parties. This will enable the electorate to make an informed choice based on their own personal priorities. We will then be able to step into Article 50 with eyes wide open and, hopefully, as one nation. ",
        "background": "There is currently no mandate for the significant policy changes required to support EU exit. Parties must provide both clear policy detail and accurate independent financial projections and obtain a mandate from the electorate to form the government that will sign, or not, Article 50.",
