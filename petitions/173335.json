        "additional_details": "The cost to develop a Harrier III from the Harrier II, I am absolutely certain, would have been a fraction of the disastrous, bug ridden JSF program. The Unit cost too, I am certain, would have been been fractional. It's a matter of national pride too. What do we have left that we can be proud of? Concorde? Harrier? The world wanted these things. But no. Scrap it and buy American or EU... 'REDUCE F-35 ORDER AND REINVEST THE REMAINING *Billions* INTO A SYMBOL OF NATIONAL PRIDE: The Harrier III'.",
        "background": "The Harrier was the ONLY V/STOL jet IN THE WORLD. Instead of capitalising on a technological monopoly, the British Government sold the country out and our industry out to the Americans. Now we buy their exorbitant \u00a3100+ Million a piece F-35 STOVL jet with a program cost of $1.5 Trillion. Shameful.",
