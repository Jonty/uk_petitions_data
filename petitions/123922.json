        "action": "Introduce controls to curb the sky rocketing cost of renting within London.",
        "additional_details": "It is difficult to find a 2 bed flat in zones 1-3 for less than \u00a31450pm. This leads to young adults, families & students who aren't looking to buy or are trying to save a deposit living in overcrowded, shared accommodation. \r\nFor most, there is little option but to turn to rental websites like 'Spareroom' and move into the ex-living room of a 3 bed shared house for \u00a3600 pm. If you are lucky, there will be 1 bathroom per 4 people. Sadly, most spend more than half their income on ever rising rent.\r\n",
        "background": "The cost of renting is rising exponentially each year, leading to people living in sub-standard accommodation. Not everyone in London wishes to buy and while the government focuses on increasing the supply of affordable housing, it is hard to see how this will help curb extortionate rental prices.  ",
