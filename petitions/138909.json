        "additional_details": "Life expectancy rates are 80 years old, so people aged 75 voted for something that statistically they will only be affected by for a few years, whereas, 16 and 17 year olds, who will be affected for the rest of their lives, were not allowed to vote, this is not right.\r\n\r\nWe should also debate a maximum voting age for special referendums only, not for general elections which occur every few years where everyone over 15 should be allowed to vote.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be done, the time is now, do it.",
        "background": "Change law to allow 16 & 17 year olds a right to vote in the UK and debate a maximum voting age. The referendum highlighted the reality of these issues.\r\n\r\nPeople that will be affected by an election or referendum must be allowed a vote and have a voice, those that will not be affected should not.",
