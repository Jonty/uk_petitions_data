His request has been denied. This is not in the spirit of fairness & indeed indicates a Government deliberately hiding information from the electorate because they feel it detrimental to their preferred position.\r\nThis is a matter of huge public interest!",
        "background": "It is revealed that UK ministers (HMRC) are refusing to release data about active National Insurance numbers issued to EU migrants in the UK as they deem it would be \"Unhelpful to the EU renegotiation process\". This is unacceptable & the data must be released well before the EU In/Out referendum.",
