        "additional_details": "The new tougher stance on the law is generally a good thing and should be even tougher for those that text or hold their device to call whilst driving. \r\n\r\nHowever it has been extended to include areas, as already mentioned, that border on the absurd.\r\n\r\nImagine a cold frosty morning, you scrape the windows and start the car. Whilst waiting for the windows to clear inside you use your phone, still parked on your drive or the outside your house. I now believe this to be illegal. \r\n\r\nA step too far?\r\n",
