        "action": "Provide funding for a specialist music teacher in every primary school.",
        "additional_details": "Primary schools often don't have a specialist; budgets are squeezed. Music stimulates cognitive development, enhancing everything from language to mathematics and empathy; it helps children to succeed at school and far into adulthood. The younger we learn the better. The experience of music allows children to build human understanding across differences of \u200bculture, creed, and race. Music-making builds a happy society: you make friends in choirs and orchestras; concerts are uplifting.",
        "background": "The racism and xenophobia surrounding the EU Referendum has demonstrated the need for better music education in our schools in order to teach our children about other cultures, create safe spaces where children feel a sense of well-being, joy, togetherness and purpose.\r\n",
