        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom has the highest rates of food waste in supermarkets within the whole EU with 18 million tonnes going to a landfill yet theres 8 million people who cannot afford to put food on their table. The number of people in poverty is due to rise by 2020. France has banned supermarket waste going to a landfill and 100% goes to food charities. The United Kingdom needs to follow suit. We are one of the richest countries in the world food poverty should not exist. BAN SUPERMARKET WASTE NOW!",
        "background": "With 8 million people in the UK struggling to put food on their table over 500,000 people in the UK are reliant on food parcels. 200,000 tonnes of food is wasted between all UK supermarkets per year, food poverty should not be happening with that amount of food being wasted. BAN SUPERMARKET WASTE.",
