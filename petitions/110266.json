        "additional_details": "\"Milk\" is not an acceptable label, considering all other types of milk including soy, almond, rice, oat, coconut, hazelnut and goat's milk have followed food labelling laws and described their products exactly. \r\n\r\nWe demand that the UK Dairy Farmers immediately label their product \"Cow's Milk\" on the front of all packaging.",
        "background": "\r\nPlant based milks and even goat's milk are correctly labelled for what they are, yet cow's milk is labelled only as \"milk\" on the front label.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it is COW'S milk should be stated clearly on the front of the product. A graphic representation of a cow is not enough. \r\n\r\n",
