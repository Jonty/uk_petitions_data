        "action": "Halt bringing child refugees to the UK until adequate vetting processes in place",
        "additional_details": "It is clear that many of the 'child refugees' are in fact adults and unfortunately for many of the ones that are children, either the relatives in the UK failed to materialise or the relatives were living in inadequate housing resulting in the child going into the care system.\r\n\r\nThe UK should do what it can to help child refugees that are at risk and have a valid claim to asylum in the UK, but I believe that this process should be halted until we have a functioning vetting process in place.",
        "background": "The recent intake of 'child' refugees have proven to be largely unvetted. The Home Office has even recently confirmed that two thirds of disputed Calais 'child refugees' are adults. Also, for many of the ones that are children, it turns out they have nowhere to go and they end up in the care system",
