        "additional_details": "There are other developments in the area that have taken years to sell and some are still empty and left in disrepair. We have spoken to all departments and if not ignored completely have been told that there is nothing happening. Even when site surveyors have been out on numerous occasions doing ground work! After speaking to workers in the school they have confirmed that the ground is to be developed. This appears that the whole situation is being kept quiet as to stop any opposition.",
        "background": "Most of the green space has been lined up for development in the local area. With more and more housing being built there is little green space left for people to enjoy. Dog walkers, children playing, football teams of all ages training and general open air use is being taken away.",
