        "additional_details": "The parent and child bays are vital for safety when setting up buggys and keeping children from harm. Too many times you see people abusing these spaces, causing parents to park elsewhere where it's more challenging and dangerous. \r\nI'm sure many parents wouldn't even mind the parking spaces being further away from the shop, but more control is needed. It's not fair that we have to risk our children's safety for the sake of someone being lazy or not wanting their car to be hit by another car. ",
