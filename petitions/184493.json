        "additional_details": "James Duddridge, the Conservative MP who represents Rochford and Southend East, has tabled a parliamentary early day motion[EDM] of no confidence in Mr Bercow. The vote is expected within days. If this happens the right-wing of the Conservative Party will put a more malleable Speaker in place. Bercow is a rare thing these days: a Conservative MP with a moral compass.",
        "background": "Mr Bercow faces a Tory vote of No Confidence in Westminster because he said he would not invite President Trump to address the MPs in Westminster. Bercow is disgusted by Trump's open racism and his behaviour towards women. We support Bercow's efforts to promote democracy which acts for everyone.",
