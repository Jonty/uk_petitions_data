The only people who benefit from this are drug dealers, making a profit which goes untaxed. The sale of Marijuana would generate millions upon millions of pounds which could be channeled directly into our desperately underfunded NHS and would starve organised crime of a massive revenue stream. Instead of police forces wasting time and money, the taxed sale of Marijuana would deal a huge blow to organised crime",
