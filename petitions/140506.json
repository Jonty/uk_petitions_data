        "additional_details": "One of the arguments for leaving the EU was that it was undemocratic, and yet a new PM is about to come to power without the support of the public.\r\nAccording to the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act an early general election can be called if a motion that there shall be an early parliamentary general election is passed by the House of Commons with at least two thirds in favour of the motion; or if a motion of no confidence is passed by the House of Commons. \r\nThe House should vote for another election.",
        "background": "The country voted to leave the EU largely due to the argument that it was undemocratic. However, after the resignation David Cameron, the Tories are going to elect a new PM without any say from the public. As a result, another general election should be held to allow the U.K. to elect a new PM.",
