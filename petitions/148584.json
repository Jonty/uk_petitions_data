        "additional_details": "There are a wide range of views concerning what the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU should be after any exit. The first referendum has shown a clear wish to substantially change the relationship with the EU, but no specific plans have been put before the electorate. Parliament has a duty to clearly show what that future relationship with Europe will be, prior to receiving a mandate to trigger Article 50.\r\n",
        "background": "Before triggering Article 50 (Lisbon Treaty) a cross party team of pro EU leavers (\u2018Brexiteers\u2019) should be assembled to negotiate the best heads of terms for the U.K.\u2019s exit that they can. Those terms, or none, if they are unsuccessful, should be put to the electorate in a second in out referendum.",
