        "action": "Admit that PIP is neither fit for purpose, well administered, nor practical.",
        "additional_details": "1. The PIP form defines everyday words (eg reliably) in specific & misleading ways. The guide defining the terms used is neither included nor referenced in the application pack.\r\n2. Many of the criteria used are ignorant/impractical, eg being able to stand and move 201m with two walking sticks counts as not having a mobility problem.\r\n3. The decisions makers are allowed to ignore evidence from medical professionals despite being essential for an accurate picture of a patient's capabilities.",
        "background": "PIP is ostensibly money to help those who cannot perform the basic life tasls around food, hygiene, communication and walking. As the benefit stands, the application process does not adequately measure the claimant's ability to do these things for various reasons and leads to much suffering.",
