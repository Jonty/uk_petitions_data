        "additional_details": "This would also help the environment as 4stroke engines would be available. These are much cleaner with less pollutants entering the atmosphere.\r\nIf publicised right it could mean less cars on the already busy roads.",
        "background": "Please change the law for learner motorcycle riders.\r\nPlease change from 125cc to 250cc for learner riders. \r\nMany accidents happen due to mopeds having small wheels.\r\nIt's pretty easy for the front wheel to slip away on a corner. Bikes with larger wheel don't usually have this problem.",
