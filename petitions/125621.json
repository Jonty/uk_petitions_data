However since his death DWP removed all my husbands benefits (I have worked for over 40 years) how could this be... They will only pay contribution JSA for 6 months (which was stopped shortly after my husband passed away. \r\nTherefore I was informed that I can apply for Bereavement Benefit of \u00a3112 per week. \r\nOut of the \u00a3112 I was expected to pay full rent \u00a397.79 per week and C.Tax.\r\nI finally received a letter confirming that I would be exempt from the Underoccupancy due to the sudden death of my husband. It will only apply for 12 months where after I am expected to pay for the Underoccupancy,  this is DISCRIMINATION towards age.",
