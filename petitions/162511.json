        "action": "Raise university tuition fees using current CPI, not forecasted RPIX",
        "additional_details": "Due to the HE Bill universities are already publishing new tuition fees of \u00a39250 per year, an increase of just under 2.8%. Currently, no rate of inflation published by ONS is close to 2.8% and RPIX, the rate the government is making calculations on, is only 1.5%. 2.8% is a 10 year forecast for RPIX. To put tutition fees in line with inflation a new tuition fee should be calculated each year using CPI figures at the time.",
        "background": "This petition urges the government to use CPI (currently at 0.5%) to increase tuition fees instead of the 2.8% forecasted rate from the Office of Budget Responsibility. This rate will benefit students more, whilst also covering the cost of inflation for universities. ",
