            "details": "We can't accept this petition because it asks for something that neither the House of Commons nor the Government can do. The expression \"vote of no confidence\" is used when talking about a vote in the House of Commons which tests whether or not the Government of the day has the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. The concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to select committees. While we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence (as this is something Parliament as a whole could do), the Committee itself is unable to schedule a motion of no confidence. \r\n\r\nThe Petitions Committee isn't the only way that petitions can be debated. It is still open to MPs to seek a debate on a petition even if the Petitions Committee decides not to schedule a debate on it.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the Petitions Committee to have the power to schedule these debates, you might like to sign this petition:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/113256"
