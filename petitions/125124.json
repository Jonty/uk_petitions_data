        "additional_details": "The British public has had enough of Tory austerity and complete incompetence to run a government. George Osborne. in his budget, was going to take essential financial support from the disabled, despite receiving professional advice from disabled charities and advice groups. He then proposed to use that money, from disabled people, and offset it against tax relief to the most wealthy. David Cameron fails to directly answer any question Jeremy Corbyn puts to him.",
        "background": "Due to the recent resignation of Iain Duncan Smith, and complete incompetence of George Osborne, with regards to the Budget 2016. I call upon the Houses of Commons to disband the current government and hold an election to allow the British public the opportunity to vote in a new government.",
