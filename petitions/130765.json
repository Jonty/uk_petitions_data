More houses are being built in Bampton, Brize Norton and Carterton.  All the jobs are in Oxford.  The A40 is the major route to Oxford.  The A40 is already at a standstill, add to that all the people from the new housing and it will not move at all.  They can put the 54m they have budgeted for this work to better use.  We need a dual carriageway all the way from Witney to Oxford.",
        "background": "The A40 from Witney to Oxford is already congested, Oxford County Councils plans to fix this are inadequate. They want to make it dual carriageway from Witney to Eynsham then a bus lane to Oxford. This will not ease the problem. It must be dual carriageway all the way. It's costing 54m so must work.",
