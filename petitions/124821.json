        "action": "Free feminine sanitary products for all women.",
        "additional_details": "Women do not choose to have periods. They occur as part of nature of being a woman. A period is something to be celebrated as an affirmation of the continuity of life and hope for the future.\r\nWith this in mind and to confirm the importance of women to society as the bearers of the human race amongst other things, I propose that feminine sanitary products are made available free of charge to all women through their doctors surgery.",
        "background": "Reports that women are using old socks as sanitary towels because they cannot afford to buy products. This could lead to serious infections and is not a situation to be tolerated in a civilised country.",
