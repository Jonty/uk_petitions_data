        "action": "Abolish the use of whole life sentences in England and Wales",
        "additional_details": "Nobody can predict when a prisoner will die, and in many cases they will reach an age where they will be no threat to society. And it has been proven in the past that even some of the worst criminals can rehabilitate and therefore qualify for parole. And what incentive do they have to behave in prison if they have no realistic hope of parole? Several such prisoners have behaved very violently in prison,  injuring other inmates, and one even committed further killings in prison.",
        "background": "Whole life sentences mean that a prisoner is effectively condemned to stay in prison until they die. There are about 8,000 prisoners serving life sentences in England and Wales, and at least 60 of those are serving whole life sentences. ",
