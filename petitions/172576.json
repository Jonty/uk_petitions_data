        "additional_details": "The MHRA is the government body which licenses medicines in the UK. It's been criticised for its links with big pharmaceutical companies, whose financial interest is to promote their expensive products and limit cheaper and effective alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe MHRA doesn't allow the public to be involved in the implementation as a transparent process of drug licensing with public access to pharma companies' data is lacking. \r\n\r\nWe want the secrecy to end and see financial dependency on pharma removed! ",
        "background": "The MHRA is funded by the Department of Health for the regulation of  medical devices, whilst the costs of medicines regulation is met through fees from the pharmaceutical industry.\r\n\r\nThe MHRA must become independent and entirely funded through public money as well as showing more transparency.",
