        "action": "Parliament to debate whether it is possible to make a success of leaving the EU.",
        "additional_details": "Potential consequences include the UK leaving the Single Market and the break-up of the UK (both contrary to pledges made in the Conservative Manifesto); a plunge in the value of sterling (which hit a 168-year low following the referendum); few trading partners (diplomats for India, Canada, the US & Australia have stated they prioritise the EU over the UK); the loss of sovereignty over Gilbratar (a red line for Spain in negotiations); no deal with the EU (the 18-month timeframe is unrealistic).",
        "background": "The Government has repeatedly stated it is determined to \"make a success\" of Brexit. While 52% of eligible voters may have voted to leave the EU, mere determination to make a success out of Brexit is insufficient. The notion Brexit can be successful is not supported by evidence and must be debated.",
