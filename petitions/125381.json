Vaguely written or subjectively interpretable laws, whose consequences actually act in opposition to their purpose (encouraging rather than dissuading investment in conservation) should be challenged.

We assert that the \"character\" should refer to the state of the property when it was first built and not refer to later alterations. An owner should be able to change such alterations without fear of sanction.",
