        "action": "No sale or privatisation of the Land Registry.",
        "additional_details": "The Government is, once again, against professional advice, taking the first steps which will lead to a sell-off or part privatisation of the Land Registry to apparently pay down debt as if it is running a household.\r\n\r\nThe Land Registry is a highly respected and trusted institution. It is profitable. Yet the Government believes it would be better value for money if it were privatised.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to reconsider these ill-founded plans and preserve the Land Registry in its current form.",
        "background": "Since 1862 the Land Registry has recorded the ownership of land and property in England and Wales and produces data on house prices and transactions that are used by the government to make policy decisions.\r\n\r\n",
