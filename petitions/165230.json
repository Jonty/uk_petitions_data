It needs to be stated categorically that islam is NOT a race, it is made of many races, just as Christianity is.\r\nPeople entering should undergo a test, and have to prove they will no longer follow the laws they left. Implementing the policy overhaul would require a temporary halt in immigration from \"the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism",
