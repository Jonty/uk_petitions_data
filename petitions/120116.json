        "additional_details": "Suicide is the largest cause of death for men under 45.  The t-shirts, some aimed at children, have images of people hanging, the most common form of suicide.\r\nSlogans include \"Death is Gods way of saying you're fired. Suicide is humans way of saying I quit\".\r\n\"Yesterday my brother committed suicide. Should I kill myself?\".\r\n\"I \u2764\ufe0f Suicide\". We would never tolerate a slogan \"I \u2764\ufe0f Cancer\".  \r\nWhile the stigma remains for mental health we need to protect vulnerable people from seeing images like these.",
        "background": "Amazon are offering t-shirts \"making fun\" of suicide with a variety of distressing slogans and images.  About 6,000 people end their lives by suicide every year.  The images are extremely distressing for people touched by suicide and they could provide a trigger for more suicides.",
