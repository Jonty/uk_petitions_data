        "additional_details": "During the campaign people have been lied to and miss-led to satisfy big business, financiers, banking institutions, the president of America and vested interests. People have been threatened with World War 3, financial calamity, their jobs,  increased prices. Where is World War 3? Companies are saying business as usual. Have we been made redundant. Has your mortgage shot up? Is there mass terrorism? Have German car companies stopped selling to us. What bullshit. Block this second referendum",
        "background": "The British public have voted to leave the EU.  Some people who voted to remain want a second referendum because they did not win. If you voted to leave the EU sign this petition to block a second EU referendum and stop people trying to trample on your opinion and overturn your vote. ",
