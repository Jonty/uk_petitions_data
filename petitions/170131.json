        "additional_details": "A gay man in a long term monogamous relationship can be denied as a donor, where a heterosexual man sleeping with multiple partners is allowed. This outdated view on men who have sex with men is fuelling the discrimination faced by them on a daily basis. This needs to be reviewed and changed and then perhaps there wouldn't be as many shortages. MSMs can be on the organ donor register and can sign up to the Anthony Nolan Trust so why shouldn't they be able to donate blood ",
        "background": "Currently huge groups of people, such as men who have sex with men, are unable to donate blood, due to creteria based on out of date views and stereotypes. These need to be reviewed and the discrimination needs to stop! There are always adverts crying out for donors but they stop those willing!",
