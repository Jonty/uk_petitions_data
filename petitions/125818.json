        "additional_details": "Joint sponsorship, as applied in other countries (such as the USA), allows a second individual to accept legal responsibility for supporting the visa applicant throughout the duration of their visa. \r\n\r\nSuch a system would provide couples those who are unable to meet the strict financial requirements of sponsorship a way to live together in the UK, without the the additional risk to the taxpayer that reducing the financial requirement may have.",
        "background": "Non-EU citizens wishing to live with their fianc\u00e9 or spouse in the UK must have their application sponsored by their partner alone. If their partner does not meet the financial requirement, the couple cannot live together in the UK. Joint sponsorship would allow this responsibility to be shared.",
