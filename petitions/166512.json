        "action": "Review decision-making process behind closure of nightclubs in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Fabric holds global significance for dance music, launching the careers of many artists and drawing crowds from all over world. In the last three months several other venues including The Arches, Passing Clouds and Dance Tunnel have also been forced to close. Dance music is an important part of music culture; the closure of places that grow the community, foster innovation and provide a venue to enjoy this music, will lead to the loss of the UK\u2019s status of a breeding ground for musical talent.",
        "background": "Following Islington Council's decision last night (6th September) not to renew the license for Fabric, an iconic dance music venue in London, we request that parliament reviews why decisions like this one and others are consistently being made to the detriment of dance and youth music culture.
