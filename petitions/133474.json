        "additional_details": "Richard's recent discovery and interment has shown he was not like Shakespeare's fiction. There is proof that he sought to protect women from rape and other sexual violation. Richard was only 32 when he died, not middle-aged. Shakespeare has him fight battles as a toddler! A recent production presents the discovery of his 'hunched' spine as fact, and then shows him committing rape. Audiences should be informed before each performance that the play is fiction, and does not resemble the real man.",
        "background": "The real Richard had scoliosis, not a hunched back, and his curved spine did not inhibit him nor was visible when he was dressed. And he went to lengths to protect women from violation. The production of the Bard's play at the Almeida shows him with a grossly deformed spine, and raping a woman.\r\n",
