        "additional_details": "Symbols, and orders have a strong impact in reality and in the way humans interact and relate to each other. A feasible way to start unifying this country is by simply making the members of parliament sit among members of the \"opposition\".  \r\nThat is how we, the people, that have given you this job, live and interact in society, and reflecting this in the house, would bring us a step closer to negotiate, to have compassion, to stop thinking of rivals and start thinking of building together.",
        "background": "Placing those who represent us opposite each-other, in confrontation, creates a division that separates them and that they use as a fence, many times feeling comfortable attacking and shouting to each-other which would dramatically change if you allocate sitting in the house by alphabetical order.",
