        "additional_details": "You only need to go to Goodison Park and hear the fans, see the look of disbelief on their faces. Or listen to the radio after the game and hear the pundits and fans alike shocked that we keep on repeating the same mistakes. Football is something that both unites and divides and Roberto Martinez seems to be doing his best to divide the club from a young generation of Everton fans who will soon see the best squad Everton have had in 20 years leave the club in search of success.",
        "background": "When Martinez joined Everton in June of 2013 there were many who doubted his credentials but after achieving 5th in his first season we were made to eat our words. Since then its been 2 years of mediocrity, 2 years of poor excuses, 2 years of a failure to adapt and 2 years too long at Everton.",
