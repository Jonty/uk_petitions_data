        "additional_details": "Obviously 48% of the population are unhappy with the result of the referendum.  Now that leading leave campaigners have either denied saying about the 350 million a week saved going to the NHS and on immigration it is right the British people should vote again before article 50 is evoked.It is right that before Article 50 is activated the British public has the right to take back control and approve the BREXIT deal,This will give politicians a second chance to tell the truth.",
        "background": "The leave campaign never went in to details of what trade deal would be achieved after the referendum preferring to just say \u201cTake Back Control\u201dwe will get good trade deals we are the 5th largest economy in the world\u201d. Let the British approve the BREXIT deal.",
