        "additional_details": "Veterans are a huge untapped resource. Highly trained, skilled upstanding members of the community. Public functions would benefit from extra eyes on the ground, trained radio users, decision makers, trained in first aid, emergency situations and able to deal with the general public. Public confidence would soar as there would be a feeling of \"we are doing something tangible\".  Veterans are not all old, we all pledged allegiance and that binds us together forever. Let us continue to serve. ",
        "background": "Many forces veterans remain fit, active and very loyal. Threats to Great Britain are ever present and there is a resource of ex professional military personnel, highly trained, able and willing to aid and assist with security at public events. These VIP, Veterans in Public, would be a huge support!",
