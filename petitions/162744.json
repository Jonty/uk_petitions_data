        "additional_details": "The inaccesbility of London Tube stations is a clear violation of the Equalities Act 2010 which states - \"(29) Provision of services, etc. (1)A person (a \u201cservice-provider\u201d) concerned with the provision of a service to the public or a section of the public (for payment or not) must not discriminate against a person requiring the service by not providing the person with the service\". \r\n\r\nThus, we the undersigned ask the Government to act imediately and make all Tube stations wheelchair accesible.",
        "background": "Only 24% of London Underground Stations are currently wheelchair accesible. Signage to lifts or accesbile routes is often poor, misdirected or defaced and thus makes journies accross London stressful and adds uneccesarily extral time to their journey. In additon to inaccessbile tube platforms.",
