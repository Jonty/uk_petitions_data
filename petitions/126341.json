        "background": "Brighton and hove Buses have announced an increase in bus fare, for the people of Seaford/Newhaven/Peacehaven this is a \u00a32 increase on a ticket to Brighton. \r\nBrighton buses reasoning is they want people to turn digital, they have also changed the zone we fall under hence the huge increase.",
