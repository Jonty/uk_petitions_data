        "additional_details": "Those earning minimum wage tend to be doing unskilled work, with very little difference in productivity between those aged 17 and those aged 70. People under the age of 25 still pay taxes, bills, and so forth. In some cases, younger workers may have or be working to a higher level of education than older workers. Therefore, their wages should be enough for them too to live, rather than just survive. ",
        "background": "The living wage of \u00a37.20 per hour is currently only paid to those over the age of 25, falling incrementally to \u00a34.00 per hour for workers under 18, with no discernible reason as to why. Surely, workers with the same skills doing the same job should be paid the same wages? ",
