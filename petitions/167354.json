        "additional_details": "With increase of people using phones behind the wheel while driving and less police and soft penalties....teres been a slight good news that new drivers will have to retake a test and older drivers have a 6 point ban with a fine of a measley \u00a3200 fine.this is simply not enough to deter people . We cant give people a soft escape. \r\n\r\nI am making the petition for even stricter rules before the new ones go ahead.\r\n\r\nI propose...\r\nA retake test for older drivers and not just the new drivers.\r\nAn automatic ban of 6-12 months if caught once.....remember it only takes one incident to kill your friend or family member not paying attention so why are we giving them a second chance?\r\n\r\nPlease please please sign this.",
