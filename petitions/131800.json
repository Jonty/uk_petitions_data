        "additional_details": "I strongly DO NOT support cutting pensioners money retrospectively.\r\n\r\nIf the Government changes the rules, there is nothing to stop ALL businesses doing the same should they find their pensions fund has a deficit.\r\n\r\nWhat happens 3 or 5 or maybe 10 years down the line when the TATA Steel Works is in trouble again. Will the Government change the rules again to take EVEN more money off pensioners?\r\n\r\nIts hard enough for Pensioners to live now .....\r\nSTOP THIS NOW BEFORE ITS YOUR TURN NEXT !!!",
        "background": "All Pensioners not just TATA Steel pensioners are one of the lowest income areas in our society and to contemplate retrospective law changes after pensioners have signed a legally binding document is wrong and will undoubtably open the floodgates for ALL other businesses to follow.\r\n\r\nSTOP THIS NOW!",
