        "action": "The UK Government must cut diplomatic ties with Israel until it obeys the law.",
        "additional_details": "Israel must cease its expansion and occupation of all foreign territories. International laws are there for a reason, and the governments that allow Israel to continue its brutal occupation and subjugation of Palestinians are complicit in this brutality. Israel must not be allowed to continue to break International law with impunity. We ask our government to explain why it allows the occupation to continue while maintaining its friendship with a state which acts in this way.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to cut diplomatic ties with Israel until such time as it complies with International law.\r\n\r\nIsrael must end its settlement activity and unlawful occupation of Palestinian land. It is illegal under International law.",
