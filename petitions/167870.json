        "additional_details": "Some students at the colleges who carry out this practice have been affected and none of the students were aware of the practice before signing up for Land-based courses. A parent of a student who suffered the same trauma of raising animals destined for the slaughterhouse quoted: \u201cWe don\u2019t agree that this is how animals should be treated - especially at a learning facility.\" There are also many viable alternatives for the animals raised such as being released to a sanctuary. ",
        "background": "It has come to our attention that some educational institutes in the UK such as colleges that teach Land-based courses are raising farm animals to be slaughtered for meat. Enough animals in the UK are being farmed for meat and the practice is simply unnecessary. What do the students gain from this?",
