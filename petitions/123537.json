        "additional_details": "One may have the required GBP62,500+ in a pension fund, but unless the funds are in a current account for 6 months they do not count. This is unfair and prejudicial as to access those funds one has to resign and be jobless whilst waiting for the 6 month period. To force the British spouse to return alone to the UK to satisfy other requirements, for a period of up to 1 year is surely against the Human Right to a Family Life especially if ones child or children are already living there.",
        "background": "Prior to 2012 pension funds etc were taken into account to prove financial viability for non-eu spouses to travel to the UK with their returning British Citizen spouses. Also re-instate the ability of High Commissions to approve applications on individual merit, also removed in 2012.",
