        "action": "Change the law so that cowboy trades people are prosecuted in a criminal court",
        "additional_details": "Rogue trades people are often taken to county court by home owners when a trades person does not complete the work he/she has been contracted to complete. If the home owner wins the case the trades person will have a county court judgement which the home owner will then have to enforce if the trades person does not pay. This still does not guarantee that the home owner will receive any money. County court judgements are no deterrent to a trades person that has no assets that can be seized.",
        "background": "People save hard to have construction work done at there property, only to hire a trades person who stops work half way through a job leaving the home owner with an unfinished property and thousands of pounds out of pocket. This should be considered a criminal offence as county court is no deterrent",
