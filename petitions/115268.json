        "action": "Stop all military action over Syria and withdraw from the Middle East",
        "additional_details": "Syria is an already war torn country with refugees trying to flee to countries who will not accept them. The UK is now part of the cause that leads them to flee from their home looking for anywhere that will take them. Not only does military action destroy the lives of thousands of innocent civilians, it increases the likelihood of a terrorist attack within the UK so by taking military action against ISIS, ultimately, its the public who will suffer the consequences of a retaliatory attack.",
        "background": "The airstrikes in Syria are meant to only be targeting ISIS members, however civilians will be caught up in this no matter how accurate the government claims the weapons to be. The airstrikes also increase our risk of attack from ISIS so action lowers security in the UK instead of making us safer.",
