        "action": "Stop moving the retirement age. If aged 50 plus you can't adapt your finances.",
        "additional_details": "During my working life my retirement age has already increaed  at least twice. Other workers in a similar difficult position are finding it so hard to plan for their retirement when the date keeps moving. Those aged 50 plus are especially hard hit by these changes both emotionally and financially. A person needs to know for certain their retirement age from the day they reach 18 and that date should not be altered, especially not by five or ten years.",
        "background": "The government should only change the retirement age for those entering the system. People need to know their retirement date will not change for their working life. It is very difficult to plan for retirement when the date constantly increases. Those aged 50 are particularly disadvantaged.",
