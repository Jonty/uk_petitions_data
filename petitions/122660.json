        "additional_details": "More and more transgender people are finding the courage to come out to families and friends in the last year or so, meaning that there is now more transgender people in the workplace. \r\n\r\nBeing transgender is something many people have no knowledge on at all.\r\n\r\nFor every 100 employees or so, there should be at least 1 member of management or personell staff that have basic training on transgender people.\r\n",
        "background": "I feel that it should be a legal requirement for one member of management or personell staff to have basic training on how to deal and support (if needed) a transgender employee in their workplace. There is a major lack of understanding and education about what it's like to be transgender.",
