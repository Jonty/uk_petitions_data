        "additional_details": "I fear that there are many people who do not vote as they have No Confidence in any of the options during an election, and that they see not voting as a protest. This is not the case, they are just not noticed.\r\nIf there was a vote of No Confidence option, then there would be a valid count visible of NO Confidence, that the powers that be would not be able to ignore.",
        "background": "As a UK voter I have looked at my choices and found I have no confidence in the options,so would like a chance to voice this.Surely there is no better way to show the countries feelings than to give an option to show your support for a particular party or that you have no confidence in any of them.",
