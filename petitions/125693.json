        "additional_details": "Not only are pavements bumpy, they have excessive cambers, even worse when crossing driveway accesses, and then there are the dropped kerbs at crossings. \r\nThese have excessive slopes and cambers, tipping people toward the road and heavy traffic.\r\nI was totally ignored by drivers several times, sworn and hooted at by others, particularly at blind corners.\r\nBlue routes should be level, crossings safe perhaps controlled, warnings to drivers etc\r\nWe have cycle and red routes, lets have Blue Routes !!",
        "background": "I have been a Mobility Scooter and driver for a number of years, however I now suffer from balance problems and have had my license withdrawn, so am even more reliant on my scooter.\r\n\r\nI have found that using it is painful, tiring, dangerous, stressful and restricts my independence.\r\n",
