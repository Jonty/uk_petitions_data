        "additional_details": "The EU students can now be classed as international students making them pay for their education and with the surge of money, which supposedly isn't being spent on the EU membership fees, we english students should receive a free higher education.\r\n",
        "background": "For too long we English students have been forced into paying ridiculous tuition fees for university. The Scottish, Welsh and EU students have their education free while we study almost drowning in debt. \r\n\r\nWe have now voted to LEAVE the EU and hence can control how we pay for our education.",
