        "additional_details": "By refusing to invoke this article, despite having over 17 million votes from the British public to leave the EU, he is creating fear and uncertainty in all aspects of peoples lives and causing damage to businesses as well as the nation as a whole. Invoke article 50 now as promised, or step aside with the guarantee that the next PM will do it straight away, we've had enough lies and further delays are not acceptable. ",
        "background": "David Cameron promised to invoke article 50 immediately after a leave vote in the referendum. He has now gone back on his word and is not only staying in power for 3 more months but refusing to invoke it himself. We will then be at the power of the next PM who may well delay or refuse it. ",
