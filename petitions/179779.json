        "additional_details": "The offer on our house was withdrawn the day before exchange of contracts was due to take place. We had made an offer on another property, had searches done and were ready to exchange at the same time (back to back sale/purchase). When our sale fell through this house went back on the market and sold to another buyer leaving us with almost \u00a32000 solicitor fees still to pay. ",
        "background": "Many people have had an offer on their house withdrawn just prior to the exchange of contracts. This has resulted in them losing the house which they wish to purchase but still incurring solicitors/search fees. The law should be changed to protect the seller in the same way that it is in Scotland",
