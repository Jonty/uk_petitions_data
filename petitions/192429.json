        "action": "Make basic Psychology including Mental Health education a mandatory subject",
        "additional_details": "At school as part of PSHE, I learnt about drugs awareness,bullying ,sex education and more but as important as those topics are, not of it was helpful. Growing up and dealing with problems of my own, and seeing those of others, people are frightfully unequiped to deal with mental health problems. I think a massive problem that affects people is that they do not understand what is happening to them when they experience problems, thus inciting fear which is only more detrimental. ",
        "background": "The mental health problem in the UK is a big topic concerning parliament, and mental health is a huge part of every persons life yet the only chance most would get to learn about it is during Psychology GCSE. That is why Psychology should be a core subject up until GCSE so that kids become familiar.",
