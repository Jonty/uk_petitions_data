        "additional_details": "Carers Allowance should be tax-free, like PIP, and shouldn\u2019t affect any other benefits that carers may receive. I am 67 years old, in receipt of a State Pension, which I paid for through 40 years of work. Yet I cannot claim Carers Allowance because the Government does not allow you to claim both. This means men and women who can claim their State Pensions are excluded. These same people are more often than not by their loved ones sides 24/7 yet receive no recompense for it either.",
        "background": "People who receive Carers Allowance should not have to pay extra tax or have their other benefits cut. People receiving a state pension must also be able to claim Carers Allowance while looking after a loved one. Mandy Bayliffe tried to change things in her short life so now we must.",
