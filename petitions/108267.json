        "additional_details": "The argument for state support is jobs. But the state distorts the jobs market for engineers by promoting arms exports over other engineering, and indeed all other sectors.\r\n\r\nCompare the extra support for the defence sector:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-trade-and-investment-defence-and-security-organisation\r\n\r\nvs. the resources available for other engineering, finance, retail, media, etc.\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-trade-investment\r\n\r\neverybritishfamily.org\r\n",
        "background": "Every British tax-payer subsidises the promotion of UK arms exporters. Government departments, the MOD & UKTI are the lead sponsors of the world's largest arms fair, here in the UK. In fact, the arms sector is promoted over and above other sectors' exports by a dedicated defence exports department.",
