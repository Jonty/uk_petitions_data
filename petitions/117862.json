        "additional_details": "With the CSA winding down and cases being handed over to government run child maintenance scheme to be run by child maintenance service.  This service offers pretty much the same as the CSA but charges the applicant \u00a320 to apply and if absent parent does not pay will then have to pay 4% of each payment that is collected for child support.\r\n\r\nI think the absent parent should have to pay the \u00a320 once claim is awarded and if they do not pay they should be charged an additional  4%, not take it from child it is intended to support!   You can see charges and additional information at www.cmoptions.org",
