        "additional_details": "In New Zealand, restaurants do not open on Christmas day. People spend time with their families and friends at home, including serving staff.\r\nIn an ideal world everybody would have the day off...but there are people that are needed every single day, for example life saving medical staff, police etc.\r\nSome privately owned pubs prefer to open to share drinks with friends. But no staff member should HAVE to spend up to 16 hours cooking for and serving others and miss their own Christmas.",
        "background": "Recently a petition has started to stop shops opening on boxing day. We want to stop restaurants serving food on Christmas  Day. Why should millions of people spend their Christmas day cooking for and serving others? Offices shut, shops shut, banks and all other non-essential businesses shut.",
