        "additional_details": "Although the first is non-binding, it is unlikely that a second referendum will be held. Those parts of the UK that voted to leave the EU should be allowed to do so. It is undemocratic for England to remove Scotland/NI from the EU against their will. There will be a prolonged period of negotiation/instability in no-one's interest. It is simpler for the UK to remain in the EU having already met the criteria and England's negotiation to leave the UK would thereafter be a purely national matter.",
        "background": "The UK as a whole voted in a referendum to leave the EU. To avoid uncertainty and concomitant negative impact on the economy, allow our Scottish/NI allies to remain in the EU as wished and to win time for orderly negotiations, England and Wales should begin proceedings to exit the UK.",
