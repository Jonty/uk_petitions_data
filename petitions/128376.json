        "additional_details": "The reason behind Kit\u2019s resignation is aimed at the government\u2019s increasing pressures on narrowing the curriculum to the detriment of all other subjects. Kit\u2019s vision is to make sure that all pupils at Manor Field have the right to receive a wholly rounded education which will prepare them for a successful future. We need to make the government aware that they need to listen to the people, like Kit and her team who are doing the job and hear the challenges and frustrations associated with it.",
        "background": "As parents of Manor Field in Burgess Hill we are all reeling from the news that our devoted Head teacher, Kit Messenger, has resigning not just from her post but from her profession which she has worked in for over 23 years. Kit came to Manor Field School 16 years ago and has never looked back. ",
