        "action": "Respect the result of the EU referendum.",
        "additional_details": "A democratic decision was reached that the UK should leave the EU, with a majority of more than a million. The referendum was free and fair and was conducted according to electoral rules.\r\nThe voter turnout of 72.2% exceeded the turnout at any UK election since 1997 and exceeded the 64.5% turnout at the 1975 referendum which took the UK into the EEC.\r\nTo invalidate or undermine the 2016 referendum based upon thresholds that were not specified prior to it would be repugnant to democracy.",
        "background": "A petition has been launched calling for a 2nd EU referendum, arguing that the turnout and majority in the last referendum were too low.\r\nWe the undersigned call upon the government and parliament to respect the result of the referendum of 23rd June and to decline the call for a second referendum.",
