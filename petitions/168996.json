        "additional_details": "The topics covered in maths such as surds or trigonometry are irrelevant to the majority of students future lives, these absolutely should not be mandatory and instead, should focus on everyday life challenges such as; Raising a child, getting a mortgage, taxes, spotting mental disorders and knowing how to support and help the person affected and much more. So instead of making super intelligent children make good parents and advice tackling poverty and drugs.",
        "background": "Focusing on Maths and Science over mental health and everyday life advice is absurd. subjects like PSHE should be mandatory and every school should have an in depth detailed sex education system covering the LGBT community aswell.",
