        "additional_details": "Privatisation started with the introduction of markets in the NHS under Margaret Thatcher which & continued with introduction of PFI initiatives under New Labour which costs billions. GP services (including OHH), hospital services are also being outsourced. Last year nearly 40% of NHS contracts went to private firms. It comes as no surprise that the tops tiers of the Department of Health and the NHS management have been infiltrated by people who gain from this sell off. Don't let this happen. ",
        "background": "The NHS is slowly being privatised. Introduction of the the Health and Social Care Act has removed the governments responsibility for the NHS. It is setting it up to fail by cutting its budget, demoralising it's work force, cutting junior doctors pay and trying to force through 7 day working. ",
