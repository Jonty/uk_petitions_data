        "additional_details": "2015 UK General Election: men made up 71% of MPs; 74% of Members of House of Lords; 68% of elected councillors; 87% of local authority council leaders.  Women make up 43% of Labour MPs, 21% of Conservative MPs, 36% of SNP MPs, 13% of elected mayors. While the majority of medical students are female and 80% of NHS staff are women, women make up just 28% of trust chairs. We need binding quotas, the appropriate framework & effective sanctions for noncompliance. Lets implement binding quotas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Currently the male and female population are not equally presented in UK public & government offices. The UK is ranked 49th in the world with regards to the number of women in national parliaments.  Norway implements a binding quota: each gender is represented by a minimum of 40% of members.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
