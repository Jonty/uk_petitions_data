        "additional_details": "I'm very proud of Scotland & it's heritage, but we are all a part of the UK.  We had our chance to leave & become independent but the people of Scotland voted to stay in the UK & like it or not that comes with the good & the bad.\r\nWhichever way you voted in the EU referendum we (as a part of the UK) must abide by its outcome.  We have a democracy like so many countries wish they did, where the people choose, by allowing Scotland to null that choice we are basically removing democracy & our vote.",
        "background": "Coming from Scotland this is something I feel very strongly about.  We voted in a National Referendum regarding Great Britain as a Nation & we are having our democratic rights stripped away.  Scotland lost the vote to become independent therefore cannot be allowed to change the out come of the vote.",
