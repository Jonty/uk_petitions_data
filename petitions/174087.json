        "action": "Give staff the authority to turn away ill children to safeguard classmates",
        "additional_details": "It is unfair on healthy children to be required to stay off school/nursery due to individuals who have attended with a contagious illness. Just one individual can potentially infect a class resulting in more children being required to miss vital school. Should any of the class be vulnerable, school can be missed for weeks due to their poor immunity.\r\n\r\nI propose that children displaying signs of a contagious infection must be clear of symptoms for 24hrs before being allowed to return.",
        "background": "Staff need to be given the authority to turn away children who are clearly unwell to safeguard their classmates from contagious infections. This is especially important when the class includes vulnerable children who have deficiant immunity and a simple 'cold' can result in a hospital admission.",
