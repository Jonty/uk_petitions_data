        "action": "Make youth services a statutory provision for local authorities.",
        "additional_details": "A government report into the 2011 London Riots linked the closure of youth provision in North London to the violence seen in London. It costs  \u00a3200,000 of taxpayers money for every young person who passes through the criminal justice system by the age of 16 (Audit Commission). For every young person who accesses youth services, it costs \u00a3350 per young person.That's a huge amount of money saved. By protecting young services we not only save money,we help to build confident and skilled individuals",
        "background": "At present, local authorities do not need to provide youth services, legally. As a result of this, the majority of LA's have axed their youth services.This petition would seek to protect youth services in law, so that young people have a strong support network and develop skills people need for life",
