        "action": "Constitutional change proposed via referenda to require a two-thirds majority.",
        "additional_details": "In the wake of the recent EU referendum, polls have suggested that public opinion shifted in the wake of that vote and as more information became available to inform voters. A referendum on a single day merely reflects the shifting opinion at that point in time, which is why other constitutions require a two-thirds, rather than a simple majority. Major change cannot be left to a simple majority, because of the repercussions for future generations and the consequences for the nation.",
        "background": "In many other countries, such as the USA and France, major constitutional proposals requires a two-thirds majority to effect lasting change. Referenda on EU membership or Scottish independence have required a simple majority only, which binds future generations to the current whim of the electorate.",
