        "additional_details": "During the Independence referendum promises were made to the people of Scotland by PM Cameron that were reneged on.  Many  trusted the politicians to keep their word and voted 'No'. Despite this and the Brexit result that is dragging us out of the EU against our will,\r\nTheresa May (un elected PM) has  now said 'No' to Indy 2. \r\nOur First Minister WAS elected by the people and on a Manifesto stating if there was a material change in circumstances (i.e Brexit) a second referendum could be called. ",
        "background": "In 2014 Scotland many voted 'No'  to Independence after being told that an independent Scotland will not be allowed to be part of EU.  Ironically, Brexit  now means we will be out of EU anyway (we voted 62% to remain). Scotland must be allowed Indy 2 as Brexit has changed the political perameters",
