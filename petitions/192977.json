        "additional_details": "Electorate:  67,447 (December 2010).  Thus if 7000 of Clacton's voters support this petition, Douglas Carswell, as somebody who has repeatedly claimed that MPs should honourably stand down and seek re-election if they leave their party but now appears to be hiding behind the fact that he is not 'crossing the floor', should respect their wishes, stand down and allow a by-election to take place.",
        "background": "Under MP Recall proposals (2014) it was agreed that MPs should be recalled if 10% of their electorate voted that their MP should stand down.  Many of Clacton's electorate voted for the party, not the man and so should be given the opportunity to select a new MP following his resignation from UKIP.",
