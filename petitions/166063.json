        "additional_details": "Here's is the most recent example of many: \r\n\r\n\"Eight car pile-up after elderly driver goes wrong way down motorway\"\r\n\r\nhttp://metro.co.uk/2016/08/31/eight-car-pile-up-after-elderly-driver-goes-wrong-way-down-motorway-6101485/#ixzz4IzPn56B6\r\n\r\nStudies suggest that older drivers are no more dangerous than young drivers, but it is scientifically certain that old age results in degradation of the senses. As such, it stands to reason that there is a point when driving is no longer a safe endeavour. ",
        "background": "It has been shown numerous times that old age causes lowered reflexes and reaction times. This has been reflected in the high level of accidents and poor driving from pensioners.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the standards of driving on UK roads, I propose mandatory re-testing above a certain age (perhaps ~70).",
