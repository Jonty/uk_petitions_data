        "additional_details": "It has been published by numerous news media that it took just 5 days in January for the pollution levels in Brixton Road, Lambeth. \r\n\r\nThe EU has also issued a final warning to the UK for exceeding legal air pollution limits in 16 areas in the UK which includes Greater London as well as Glasgow, Birmingham and Leeds. \r\n\r\nThe Mayor of London has also raised the concern regarding London's pollution levels.\r\n\r\nWhilst there is a need for homes and jobs, spread it out and stop over development",
        "background": "London exceeded it's 2017 pollution limit by 5th January therefore we need to reduce drawing more people and businesses inside the M25 - more people results in more traffic and therefore more pollution especially reducing high rise blocks of flats. All taxis & buses also need to be hybrid.",
