        "additional_details": "A single person, paid \u00a32000 for a cruise.  She discovered during the cruise that a couple with a premium balcony outer cabin  paid the same costs.   The single person was consigned to an inner cabin deep within the ship.   A single person wished to travel with her family to Europe.  A well known holiday company operated a restrictive punitive policy insisting that the single traveller paid the cost comparable to a couple ie double the costs prejudicing fairness and equality.     ",
        "background": "In the UK companies in the travel and holiday industries levy unreasonable extra costs in the single independant traveller.  The practice is to place unreasonable supplements while the provision often leads to substandard accommodation/facilities. This disallows fairness and equality.",
