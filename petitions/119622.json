        "action": "Instigate effective state services to swiftly help UK homeless off the streets.",
        "additional_details": "On Christmas Day we stopped at a petrol station on our way back from visiting family. Two very cold young adults were huddling under a threadbare blanket. The man had been homeless for 8 months, the woman for 7 years. She was ghost-like: pale, ill and defeated. I returned to give them money, gloves, hats and scarfs. We call ourselves a civilised society and yet we leave it to charities to help single adult homeless people. Our government needs to take responsibility and do something directly.",
        "background": "It's unacceptable for our government to do so little to help the single adult homeless. I'd like the state to run a year-round service similar to Crisis at Christmas: a safe bed, food, washing facilities, help for alcohol/drug problems, counselling, and advice to find a more long-term home and work.",
