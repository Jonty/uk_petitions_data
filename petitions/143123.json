        "action": "In the case of a 2nd EU referendum, 16 &17 year olds should be allowed to vote",
        "additional_details": "16yr olds are able to join a trade union, work, be paid minimum wage and apply for a passport without consent (Youthoria).\r\n\r\nThese are just some rights that they have but the right to vote is not one. If young people can work, they should have a say in government matters, too.\r\n\r\nIf age is the issue then at least 17yr olds should be allowed to vote. Some Yr 13s cannot vote because their birthdays fall beyond the date of voting so only a select few are able to vote on behalf of their generation.",
        "background": "The recent EU referendum results have left young people across the UK outraged. Many consider the idea of a different generation to their own deciding on their futures unfair and worry that they will not be able to have the same rights as their predecessors. ",
