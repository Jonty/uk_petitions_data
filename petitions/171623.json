The banks shut, so why shouldn't pilots have a \"pilot day\"? \r\n\r\nI call on government to help pilots and their families spend their day together. \r\n\r\nIf pilots are being forced to fly on Christmas day, their families should be rewarded with free flights and accommodation to enable the families to be together. \r\n\r\nPlease call on government to make this a possibility!",
