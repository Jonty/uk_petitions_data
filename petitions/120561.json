        "additional_details": "Recent stats show 1 in 7 ladies experience depression after birth. Yet there is little support for 2nd/3rd time mums. The challenges and q's you have 2nd time are different. By putting in place such a support session, it would provide many ladies with the ability to work through many of the challenges themselves/ together, without having to rely on GPs and Health Visitors, and help decrease the burden on the already stretched health service. It would help them feel that they weren\u2019t alone.",
        "background": "Having given birth 3 years ago, I\u2019d forgotten lots by the time I had my 2nd child. My network of mums were back at work and there was no antenatal support. I faced debilitating anxiety after birth and it was hugely isolating.An antenatal class would have provided support a GP appointment can\u2019t give.",
