        "additional_details": "A recent example of him saying 'Most of you have never done a proper days work in your life' is evidence that he shows no respect to others and will earn none in return.   This video footage from Brussels has been shown worldwide across the media and makes the UK look ridiculous. He must not be allowed to continue to speak on behalf of the UK and represent our country.   We demand that an immediate replacement is found.",
        "background": "Nigel Farage is an embarrassing representative for the UK and we have no confidence that he is capable of positive negotiations with our partners in Europe.  He is damaging our reputation and any possiblity for useful discussions with our European neighbours.",
