        "additional_details": "I have seen so many posts on social media about people being unhappy with the result, many of them having been to young to vote. It is unfair that just because we are young, we don't get to have a say in something that is going to affect us much more than the older generation who do get to vote. Please sign!!",
        "background": "After yesterday's referendum, there is a petition going round for a second referendum to take place and if this happens, I think it only fair that the younger population, like myself, get a chance to have a say about our future. Please sign to lower the voting age to 16!",
