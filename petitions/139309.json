        "additional_details": "Remain campaigners want a second chance, the Government gave people an extra 48 hours to register their ability to vote, they had options for postal or proxy votes, everybody knew the date of the referendum, there is no reason for a second referendum other than they want a second bite of the cherry. Those on both sides had ample opportunity to vote my some means. It was \"first passed the post\" even if by ONE vote, if a 100 metre sprint was won by a very narrow margin would the race be re-run? No",
        "background": "Remain campaigners are calling for a second referendum, this should not be allowed as the first was carried out within the timeline and as per requirements and as far as we are aware legally. A second referendum would serve no purpose. ",
