It has become such a contensious issue that it now threatens our own democracy! That is THE most worrying news. We need to respect the decision of the majority who used their democratic right to vote and to exit the EU. I say we fight here for democracy, we must stand as one, both sides together. For Our Nation, For Our Future, For Our Children the result MUST stand united.",
