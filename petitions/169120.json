        "additional_details": "Sky & Virgin Media provide a much better service than the BBC with their vast variety of programs & movies at a monthly fee which is agreed with their customers. \r\n\r\nCustomers have a choice to pay or not pay for services they provide.\r\n\r\nUnlike the BBC TV Licence which is mandatory & forceful than followed with threats of a fine if you don't have a TV Licence. \r\n\r\nGive the people of Britain a choice, if they want to watch the BBC enable them to buy a subscription, if not, do not force the TV Licence.",
        "background": "I believe paying for a TV Licence is unnecessary in todays digital era.  \r\n\r\nBBC TV Licence should be converted into a subscription based service for anyone who wishes to watch or listen to the BBC.\r\n\r\nMost or nearly all households now pay for Virgin or Sky services.",
