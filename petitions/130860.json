        "additional_details": "Officials have said Yulin does not exist, or that it is 'on the decline,' but the horrific pictures and press reports from 2014 and 2015 say otherwise (#stopyulin). We ask the UK government to reach out the Chinese government to intervene and stop this barbaric event now. \r\n\r\nPlease add your signature to this petition asking the UK Parliament to take urgent action to ask the Chinese government to stop the Yulin Dog Meat festival going ahead.",
        "background": "Thousands of dogs are tortured to death during the Yulin Dog Meat festival. They are skinned alive, beaten to death, burned with blowtorches and dismembered while they are still alive. Many dogs are stolen family pets - they still have their collars on. Yulin began in 2009, it is not 'tradition.'",
