        "action": "The UK should buy a 12% stake in Airbus Group and push its listing on the LSE.",
        "additional_details": " The government should also pursue this course of action because Airbus Group is a major defense contractor for the MOD. If Airbus group is to continue to be a main supplier to the MOD it should have equal loyalty to the UK as to Germany, France, and Spain. Finally, the UK government has low borrowing costs right now so the interest on the debt necessary to buy the stock may be easily covered by the dividends from the stock. Additionally the pound is currently strong relative to the Euro. ",
        "background": "In October 2006 BAE sold its stake in Airbus to EADS. This marked the end of British ownership and a reduction of British influence in the civil airplane manufacturing industry. The UK was a founding nation in Airbus and should regain its place in civil aerospace next to France, Germany, & Spain. ",
