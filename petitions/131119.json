        "additional_details": "How it would work: On beginning a degree such as medicine, physics, or one in teaching, you alert the government that upon the course's conclusion, you are happy to accept a predetermined government/public-services role (e.g. surgeon/MI5 agent/psychiatrist/physicist) with employment-terms as defined by the GVT. If you leave the course or job-role before a certain amount of time, then the fees will be charged like any other degree (as you won't have used it for the GVT's intended purpose). ",
        "background": "Healthcare? Funded. Scientists? We cover them. Why is more not being done with the training for these roles? If a student agrees to terms where they're guaranteed a GVT job after completing their course, then fees for this student should either be scrapped entirely, or considerably discounted.",
