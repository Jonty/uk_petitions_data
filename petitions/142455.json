        "additional_details": "Previously, a petition not to allow the eu referendum  to take place failed.\r\nIn the light of this failure, a second eu referendum should not even be considered.\r\nThe British public have decided and the elected government should get on with the Job & fulfil the people's wishes.\r\nArtical 50 should be implemented forthwith.",
        "background": "An official eu referendum has taken place and the vote result by the majority of the British people was clearly for LEAVE, so a second eu referendum would be pointless and a total waste of tax payers money.",
