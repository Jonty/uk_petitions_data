We feel let down due to: 1) lack of housing, 2) lack of jobs, 3) cuts to medical care, 4) education spending cuts, 5) cuts to policing, 6) cuts to military, 7) increase in tax cost for the working class 8) lack of humane care for the elderly. We feel this wouldn't be the case if the government had put US first and not immigrants!",
