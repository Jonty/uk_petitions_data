        "additional_details": "Leavers: this is what many of you sold your vote on. This was the headline claim printed on the side of a bus: A PROMISE made to you that opting out would mean investment in the NHS. UNITE WITH US AND DEMAND IT.\r\n\r\nRemainers: Many people we know, many people we love, were promised voting Leave would make things better. UNITE WITH THEM AND DEMAND IT.\r\n\r\nWe can fight amongst ourselves, or we can come together to steer this ship away from violence and hatred and actually get what we were promised.",
        "background": "This petition is for 2 items to be debated by parliament:\r\n1 - That \u00a3350M per week is invested in improving the NHS, as promised by the Leave Campaign in the run-up to the EU referendum\r\n2 - That the Conservative government be held accountable for failing to deliver this promise, should that happen",
