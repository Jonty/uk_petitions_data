        "action": "Hold 2nd EU Referendum allowing 16 and 17 year olds to vote",
        "additional_details": "The consequences of the Brexit vote have left many reeling; the value of the sterling and FTSE 100 plummeting; billions wiped from the UK economy, the possible break up of the UK and David Cameron resigning as Prime Minister. If voters had known the consequences would they still have voted for a Brexit? Leave won by a narrow 3.8% margin. A second vote held with 16 and 17 year olds included would not only be fairer but allow people to decide on the UK's future with all the facts. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds could not participate in the UK's EU Referendum, despite being the ones who will live the longest with the consequences of a Brexit. This is democratically and morally unacceptable and makes the result unrepresentative of the British people.",
