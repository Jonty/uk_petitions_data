        "additional_details": "A decision of this momentous nature should be a true consensus of the will of the people. Parliament has a duty to legislate and govern on behalf of ALL the people in the UK, not just for the 17,410,742 who voted to leave. The 16,141,241 who voted to remain and even the 12,949, 258 who did not vote (a total of 29,090,499 people) have to be fairly represented by Parliament and their democratic rights properly addressed. ",
        "background": "Parliament is sovereign, referenda are advisory. The number of people voting to leave the EU only represents 37.44% of the persons eligible to vote. Parliament should not give effect to the 23.06.16 Referendum until the views of a true and meaningful majority of the electorate have been sought.",
