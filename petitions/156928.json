These are the:\r\n\r\nPit Bull Terrier\r\nJapanese Tosa\r\nDogo Argentino\r\nFila Braziliero\r\n\r\nIf your dog matches many of the characteristics of a Pit Bull Terrier, it may be a banned type.\r\nA police or council dog expert will judge what type of dog you have and it will be kept in kennels while the police (or council) apply to a court\r\nYou\u2019re not allowed to visit your dog while you wait for the court decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The banned dog breed list is inhumane against the dogs on it. The police can seize a dog if they think it is a Pitbull. So any cross Staffie could be classed as a pitbull in the police's eyes. No dog is aggressive unless the owner makes them. The owners are to blame not the dog.",
