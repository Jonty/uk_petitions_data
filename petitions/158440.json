        "action": "Ensure UK citizens born before the UK's exit from the EU keep their EU rights.",
        "additional_details": "This position is preceded by the rights of citizens of the British Commonwealth nations maintaining rights and privileges as British Citizens when former colonised nations gained independence. \r\n\r\nThe rights of Irish citizens to obtain UK citizenship subsequent to the Irish Republic's declaration of Independence can also be seen as a clear precedent of the maintenance of prior citizens' rights and privileges following the amendment of a nation's sovereign, legal and political authority.",
        "background": "All UK citizens born before the UK's formal secession from the EU ought to have their rights as EU citizens protected; as these rights were obtained by both elected UK government agreements and a previous UK electorate referendum.\r\n\r\nThese rights should also cascade to children and grand children.",
