        "action": "Build a gas-powered station at Hinckley Point instead of a nuclear station.",
        "additional_details": "We need low carbon base-load power. Nuclear would, in theory, provide this. However, tidal power could provide a better, safer solution. The sister nuclear stations at Olkiluoto 3 in Finland and Flamanville in France are billions of Euros over budget and years behind schedule. There is no reason to think Hinckley will be completed on time and to budget. EDF know this, both governments know it and the Chinese require an indemnity from us because they know it. We can build an LNG dock for the gas.",
        "background": "The South West needs a new power station to avoid blackouts in the next decade. It is increasingly clear that a nuclear station cannot be completed in less than 20 years. The enormous amount of money saved can be spent developing tidal power in the Severn Estuary. It is time to think again.",
