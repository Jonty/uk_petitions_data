If a deal with EU cannot fulfil Brexit promises then Article 50 should not be issued at all.",
        "background": "Once the government issues Article 50 to leave the EU it would formally and permanently set the wheels in motion for the UK to leave the EU. This is irreversible and the UK will never again be able to re-join. Until that moment the UK is still a member and the referendum is not legally binding.",
