For example, if you would like Parliament to change the law and devolve all law-making powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly, you could start a new petition asking for that. Alternatively, if you would like Parliament to legislate for an independence referendum in Northern Ireland, similar to the one held in Scotland in 2014, you could start a petition asking for that. "
