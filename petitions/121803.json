        "additional_details": "Jeremy Hunt has repeatedly linked doctor numbers working at the weekend directly to increased mortality whilst a document produced by his own officials indicates otherwise.\r\n\r\nSeven-day NHS may not cut death rates, say Hunt's own officials\r\nhttp://gu.com/p/4gmpf?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard\r\n\r\nHe has, therefore, not only misled the public but knowingly misled Parliament and he should be made to account for this in the House with appropriate sanctions",
        "background": "A leaked paper from the NHS indicates no causal link between the number of doctors working at the weekend and the increased mortality seen at weekends. It concludes that rather than spreading existing numbers thinner many more doctors and other staff will be required costing around \u00a3900m per annum",
