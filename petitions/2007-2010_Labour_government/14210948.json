            "background": "Over 4 million cheque payments are made each day and many people not only prefer to pay for goods and services in this way it is the only way, other than cash, that some services can be paid for. Some of Britain's most vulnerable people, including many elderly, disabled and housebound people, rely on cheque payments as a means of goods and service payment and will be greatly marginalised. Many small businesses, charities and local community organisations do not have electronic facilities for payment receipt and will be at risk.",
