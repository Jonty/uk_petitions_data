            "background": "The beauty of many of our ordinary terraces has been scared with the fitting of architecturally inappropriate doors and windows. Fitted badly (most often 'flush' with the facade, losing the shadow, depth and protection given by a 'reveal'), disrupting flat arches and in many cases altering the original dimensions. In addition, this practise is creating a landfill timebomb. Ignoring any pollution caused by the manufacture of these atrocitious objects, given that they have an average lifespan of 30 years, an average house may have 6 windows and there are 20 million dwellings in the uk mean that within 100 years we will have to find landfill space for 3,960,000,000 non-biodegradable units.",
