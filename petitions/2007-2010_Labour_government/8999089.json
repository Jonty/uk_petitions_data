            "background": "The rising cost of fuel, petrol, diesel, gas and electricity is driving up the price of food, heating, getting to work - in fact almost everything. Petrol goes up by another 1p per litre every week with further duty increases ahead and the main beneficiary is our government, which not only gets the duty, but also 17.5% VAT on the full price. Green issues are given as the reason for increases in duty but most people believe that this is just an excuse on the part of the government. Part of the lost revenue could be regained by a windfall tax on excessive profits made by fuel companies",
