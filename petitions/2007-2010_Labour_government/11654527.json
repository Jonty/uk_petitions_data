            "background": "As you will be aware a couple of major banks have been bailed out by the government giving them money, and then making us pay by increasing taxes. We are not benefitting from this so STOP NOW!!! The money would be better going to the NHS or even giving us a tax break to get us spending again thus helping to boost the economy. Bailing banks out is not a good way to boost the economy and we have got less money to spend because of it.\nEND THIS MADNESS!!! Sign below!!",
