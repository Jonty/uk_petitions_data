            "background": "When somebody reaches the age of 16, they gain a larger degree of freedom. For example they can join the army, get married, with their parents\u2019 permission, and leave school.\nSo why can\u2019t people who are 16 vote?\nAfter all it is the politicians, county councillors and local councilors who will make the decisions that will ultimately affect their lives.\nThe current age of voting in the UK is 18. We would like to reduce the age that people are able to vote to 16.\nIf you believe that 16 year olds are being treated unfairly and would like to reduce the voting age to 16, then please sign our petition.",
