            "background": "I am extremely concerned at the huge rewards offered to those paid from taxpayers money for what are often mediocre perfomances. Many Chief Executives of local authorities and Primary Care Trusts earn staggering sums of money from the public purse. Do the people think any of the above have more responsibilities or are able to make a stronger potential contributuion to this country than the P.M. (like him or not)? . And do we really think that we would not get the talent we need by offering nearly  \u00a3190,000 p.a. If this became law and was applied retrospectively how many of those at the top of the tree would actually quit and what difference would it make to the smooth operation of the country?. \nThis cap would apply to every employee at any institution receiving more than 90% of its annual revenue from the taxpayer.It would also naturally prohibit these absurd payoffs to leaving staff. Any waiver to the cap would need to be signed off by the PM themselves.",
