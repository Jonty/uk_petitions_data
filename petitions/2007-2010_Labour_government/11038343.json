We are unconvinced that the life of even one person will be saved by the introduction of this identity card system. In fact, we argue that MANY people will in effect become 'AT RISK' with so much personal information accessible by 330,000 civil servants (the same civil servants who seem to be pretty good at losing our personal data). Abolish any plans NOW.",
