            "background": "There have been a number of cases recently where pilots have been banned from flying because they were found to be over the drink/fly limit. But in these cases they were only caught by chance. All pilots should be breathalysed before flying. They are carrying huge responsibility and so safety should be paramount. Also the alcohol limit for pilots prior to flying should be zero.",
