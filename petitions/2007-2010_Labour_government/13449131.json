Claimants who specialise in one area of expertise and who are qualified only in these areas should not be penalised via the \u201cdo any job rules\u201d that are currently in place. For elder statesmen and women especially there is no choice as they may have no qualifications or relevant experience in any other field than their own specialist area and the forcing of them out of one benefit into another and sometimes into a no benefit at all situation can create stress and hardship that is not conducive to speedy and or effective recovery.\nIn example: Work that is physically demanding, but also specialised wherein regaining the strength and flexibility of an injury is essential for that work to be carried out.",
