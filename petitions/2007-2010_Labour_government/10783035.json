            "background": "The Government plans to approve Average Speed Cameras for general usage and to replace existing speed cameras in our residential areas and motorway system.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transports own figures, the number of car drivers who break the 30 mph speed limit has dropped 20% from 1997.\n\nSince it's widely been reported that the number of drivers breaking the limit has fallen, the revenue gained from these blatant tax cameras has fallen, hence the need to find new revenue.\n\nA driver will, if the Average Speed Camera systems rolls out, will spend their time obsessed with the speedometer and won't be looking at the road - this will increase danger to the motorists, other road users and pedestrians. \n\nThe Government must not role out these tax based cameras that will increase danger for everyone using our roads and by signing this petition, you agree they should not be installed!",
