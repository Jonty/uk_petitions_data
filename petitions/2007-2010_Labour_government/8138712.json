        "background": "Prepay meter customers pay on average \u00a3173 more a year for gas and \u00a3113 a year more for electricity.  Prepay meters enable those on low incomes to budget, however they end up paying more than a standard quarterly billed consumer.  This should not be allowed and ask the Prime Minister to stop fuel companies penalising those on lower incomes and stop this overcharging.",
