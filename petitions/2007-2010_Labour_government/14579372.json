            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Blacksole Bridge is a pinch point at the eastern end of Herne Bay where all road traffic and pedestrians are fed through a very narrow railway bridge with poor sightlines which is without a footpath. There has been extensive housing, restaurant, hotel and industrial estate development recently which has generated a huge flow of traffic endangering the lives of pedestrians. The s.106 agreement to provide a footpath, entered into by the housing developer with Canterbury City Council at the time development planning permission was given, has proved ineffective. Kent County Council and Canterbury City Council are urged to come to an agreement between them and resolve their dispute about responsibility and provide a footpath with all expediency.",
