            "background": "Unsolicited mail betrays a patronising and degrading attitude by targeting victims during private time:  like an unwelcome visitor it is an invasion of privacy and clearly incurs an unacceptable disposal cost (including time, effort, environmental degradation).\n\nSimply make it illegal unless it is expressly requested.  An offence could be relatively easy to prove using existing infrastructure and dealt with in an increasingly deterrent fashion.\n\nUnsolicited mailing allows the mailer to distribute all sorts of psychologically tainted propaganda:  This is at least undemocratic if not immoral.\n\nIf unsolicited mailing was banned, they would have to concentrate more on improving their products.\n\nSurely, citizens have painfully earned the right to peace and quiet to pursue what is most important in their precious lives; Earned the right to stop being harassed, distracted and generally preyed upon by unsolicited mailers just for the sake of ruthless opportunistic profit.",
