        "background": "i think it is an attrocity that people cannot get government funding to attend training courses with independant training providers such as PITMAN Training for instance. why is it that the government will only give money to those who want to attend government run courses?! independant training providers are able to give flexible training that can be completed at times to suit the student, which colleges and the like cannot provide! Why is the government denying its people the chance to better themselves?!",
