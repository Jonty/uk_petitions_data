        "background": "The Royal Mail has decided to withdraw 5 of the 7 Highland Post Buses that it operates. It states \"Financial Unviability\" as the reason.\nThe areas that the Post Bus serves is among the remotest and most fragile areas in the UK and a vital service for the people living there. It also assists the mobility of tourists who visit the area each year.\nThe withdrawal of the service effectively means that the Royal Mail is no longer a Public Service and is now placing Profit as its Modus Operandi.\nComing weeks after this governement used Billions of Tax Payers money to save failing banks, we appeal to you to become personally involved in this issue. It wouldn't cost much in the grand scheme of things to save this important public service.\nWe have every confidence that you will do the right thing.",
