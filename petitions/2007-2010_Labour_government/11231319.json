It's scandelus. and there hasnt been any improvments or anything to the services infact i think personly its got worse! buses are always late and sometimes they just dont show up so then im late for college or work and its possible that it could reuslt in me getting kicked of my course or sacked! all because the bus drivers cant be botherd. they get paid rediculous amounts to work a couple of hours and they're never polite or nice its just bad customer service which wouldnt bother me that much if i wasnt waist half an hours pay to actully get to work!",
