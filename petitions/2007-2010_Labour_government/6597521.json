If they were allowed to have a gun, then they would not have been mugged, raped, burgled, killed, etc.\n\nIf the government respects and trusts it's people, then it should trust them to keep and bear arms. It is a symbol of a free state.\n\nPeople in the UK should be allowed to keep and carry firearms, in order, to protect thier freedoms, the freedoms of other, to defent themselfs and the state.\n\nThe UK should make a law simular to the     US Second Amendment \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"",
