            "background": "Many people seem to think that asylum seekers, etc., get better benefits than British people and/or that they jump the queue for Council accommodation; this perception probably fostered by some sections of the tabloid press.  In fact they are not entitled to work and receive only  a fraction of British people's entitlement to Income Support; and I doubt, very strongly, that they are given priority for Council accommodation (except in an extreme emergency).\n\nThese perceptions of favourable treatment, which I believe to be totally false, can only encourage racist groups.  They almost certainly leads to attacks, possibly including physical assaults, on people who are thought to be migrants. We therefore request the Prime Minister to order a series of advertisements, in all sections of the media, refuting these perceptions.",
