It does not appear that other counties are bending over backwards to avoid offending people with Christian values. To lose the nativity play at many schools, ask nurses to face beds to Mecca and attempts to downgrade Christmas are the start of a process that can only increase bad feelings towards other nations and their beliefs.",
