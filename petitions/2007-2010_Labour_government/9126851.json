            "background": "To allow the Torch to cross the Tibetan Territories will undoubtedly escalate tensions. Under the present circumstances the notion that the Beijing 2008 Torch is the symbol and bringer of Peace and Tolerance will most certainly inflame Tibetan  feelings and provoke further protests, and in turn cause more arrest and possible deaths. To avoid these likely and potentialy tragic events by excluding the Tibetan Territories from the Route would be but a small price to pay.",
