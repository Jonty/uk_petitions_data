        "background": "I am one of countless parents that are frustrated and angry at the Governments policy of inclusion when it means that our children are not given proper specialist provision and consequently fail in mainstream schools.The pressure is on to save money by shutting special schools down or reducing their intake and by not issuing statements when requested.Many parents are now being forced to remove their vunerable children from school or to fight their LEA's for a school of their choice.Some children just cannot cope in mainstream schools and it is damaging them.",
