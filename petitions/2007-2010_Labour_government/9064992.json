            "background": "I propose that the primeminister and ascoiates should live on Minimum wage for a period of 2 months, this way they will know what it is like to live on the \"poverty line\". And maybe they will do something about the so called tax/working credits, And maybe raise the minimmum wage to coinside with inflation. \nA quick example, myself gained a 2.5% payrise this year but the rate of inflation has gone up 17%. Now seeing that my outgoings were more than my monthly wage before my payris and inflation, it dosent look that good for the future.",
