        "background": "Please do not take away long term care  from the disabled. How would you feel if breakfast was taken away after 27 yrs of having it. This was paid care not free. You must see disabled people about in there w/chairs, they look no different sat but these people cannot stand more that a few minutes and morning help is a god send to them and the only people they may see that day.. A lot of things they cannot join in but a basic  breakfast made so they can take medication ( pain killers ) is nothing to others. Are we such an easy target to help pay yours debts, what about the super rich, isn't it time to scrape some from them not the old  and disabled.  All we want is basic help like having a slice of toast made in the morning.",
