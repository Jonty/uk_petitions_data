            "background": "At the moment it not illegal to fail to yield to an emergency vehicle at junctions or to pull over when it is behind you. In the US it is a felony to fail to yield, by stopping and giving way at a junction or pulling right over and stopping, and in some states to fail to move over a lane further away from an emergency vehicle parked on the road with its lights on. Too many people in this country selfishly fail to move out of the way of ambulances, police and fire vehicles travelling at high speed to emergencies, this not only costs lives but is dangerous to all. Make it a crime not only to actively obstruct an emergency vehicle but also to fail to yield.",
