            "background": "In one fell swoop the Chancellor and Prime Minister have disincentivised Entrepreneurs by scrapping Taper Relief. Entrepreneurs sacrifice the security of working for others, and at the outset, work for little financial reward, often taking on enormous personal liabilities. We are prepared to expend blood sweat and tears because we are passionate about building successful businesses. This in turn creates employment, tax revenue and is a major driving force behind the economy. This new policy makes entrepreneurs seriously question the balance between risk and reward and is pure MADNESS. We urge the Chancellor and Prime Minister to REVERSE this decision.",
