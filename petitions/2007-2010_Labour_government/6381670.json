            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "On 1 September each year, the SLC reveals the fixed interest rate that it will charge for the next twelve months. The SLC's interest rate is linked to a measure of inflation (rising prices) known as the Retail Prices Index (RPI). The bad news for SLC borrowers is that the RPI hit a sixteen-year high in March 2007, when this year's interest rate was calculated. Thus, the interest rate paid on student loans will double in September, from 2.4% to 4.8%.\n\nAlmost 900,000 SLC loans will be taken out this academic year, so this rate increase is awful news for British students. In total, past and present students owe an enormous amount to the Student Loans Company: almost \u00a319 billion in 2005/06, with this figure growing by around \u00a33 billion a year. So, a rate hike of 2.4% will cost students around \u00a3500 million more in the coming academic year.",
