            "background": "As it stands, The Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 requires anyone privately owning certain types of rare or exotic animal to hold a licence. However, certain animals (such as sloths, tamarins, emus, lemurs, raccoons and squirrel monkeys) do not fall into the Government's current definition of 'dangerous', and therefore do not require their owner to hold a licence. \n\nWe believe that certain pet owners may not be able to cope with such demanding creatures, possibly leading to a poor quality of life for these animals. Animal dealers may also take advantage of the situation, and the illicit trade of endangered animals could potentially take place. \n\nThe conservation of these animals, we argue, is important, and request that the Government amend their 2007 modifications to The Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 to help further this conservation, and to help prevent cruelty towards these animals.",
