            "background": "To protect the health of workers in the bars of the Palace of Westminster, smoking should be banned there even though the Palace is exempt from the current legal ban. Members of Parliament must accept that they should set an example to the public in this regard; to do otherwise would be to undermine public confidence in the sincerity of the Government's claim that the health of bar staff was of primary importance in the framing of the anti-smoking legislation.",
