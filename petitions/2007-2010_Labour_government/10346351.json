So far the Authorities have been unable to identify them and it is feared they may repeat their coup - possibly in the UK.\nIt is essential to take urgent action.\nThere are two possible cures, namely:\n    1. Outlaw short selling and stock lending. (This would be unpopular with the market but in the National interest).\n    2. Announce that the Government Broker has been authorised to buy shares in companies considered to be of National importance. The Hong Kong Authorities took similar action when Britain withdrew.",
