            "background": "1.  Decision:  John Denham, The Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, has announced that, from 2008/09, he will phase out funding for the majority of students in England and Northern Ireland who are studying for a qualification that is equivalent to, or lower than, a qualification that they already hold (e.g. graduates studying undergraduate courses; or those taking second masters degrees).  However, this runs counter to the Leitch agenda on skills and life-long learning and indeed to the Government\u2019s own pronouncements about nurturing the talents of all its people \u2013 including Denham\u2019s own assertion that \u2018every second one of us must make up our skill lack for Britain to succeed\u2019[1].",
