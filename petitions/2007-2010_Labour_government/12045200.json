            "background": "Concerns about alcohol abuse tar all alcohol outlets with the same brush. Cheap alcohol from supermarkets and shops generally contributes more to the problem than responsible drinking on licensed premises. \n\nPubs have to answer to the police and local community through licensing regulations that are now more reflective of local opinion, while supermarkets remain relatively anonymous when the alcohol they sell contributes to a problem. \n\nPubs are also valuable assets to communities, particularly in rural areas. This should be reflected through a reduction in alcohol duty for alcohol sold for consumption on licensed premises.",
