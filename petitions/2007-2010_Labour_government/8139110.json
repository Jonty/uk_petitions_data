            "background": "Now that the GNU/Linux Operating Environment is fully mainstream, the BBC is seen by many to be laxadaisical in its approach to this as a viable option to their giving of advice to home and business computer users in their half hour skit known as \"Click\". They pay lip service to the BSD-based Apple Mac OS, which itself may be easily replaced by the Linux platform, as can PCs supplied with Microsoft's xp or Vista. This single action would solve 99% of common problems eg malware, kernel crashes, suffered on a daily basis by any Microsoft or Apple Mac OS user, as none can deny with a straight face.",
