            "background": "With regard to the current situation with the banks, we would ask that all Managers and Directors of all the Banks which have received assistance with taxpayers money should have their salaries limited to \u00a330,000 pa, No bonuses, no perks, until all the loans are repaid. It is our money they are living on, not theirs. The situation is of their own making, they must play their part in its rectification. This will be the greatest motivation for them to get the banks back to normal. Only you have the courage to do this. You will be very unpopular with the Banks but very popular with the voters. We have every faith in you.",
