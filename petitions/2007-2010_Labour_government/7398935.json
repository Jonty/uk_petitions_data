            "background": "Many companies use mother's maiden name as a security password. Using this has several flaws:\n1. Anyone can obtain anyone's birth certificate and it's there on the certificate.\n2. Siblings share the same mother's maiden name. This also applies to cousins if the mother has sisters and they have children as well\n3. When some women get divorced, they revert back to their maiden name. Most of these women's children get their surname changed to be the same as their mother's. The child has the same surname as their mother's maiden name.",
