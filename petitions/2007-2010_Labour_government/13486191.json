            "background": "HMY Britannia was a national symbol that represented British excellence and engineering around the entire world.\n\nThe existence of a Royal Yacht allowed the Queen to fulfil her role as Head of the Commonwealth by visiting countries around the globe; making her one of the most travelled Head of States in history.\n\nBritannia\u2019s overseas visits have helped to earn the United Kingdom hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, dwarfing the cost of running her, making it a viable asset even in the present economic times.\n\nA modern ship would allow the Queen to travel the world in a far more environmentally friendly way than by chartered airline, and would be an innovative promoter of British trade and business (valued at over \u00a3500 million worth of export deals every year based on HMY Britannia).\n\nWith today\u2019s technology, a Royal Yacht would be far less costly and more efficient to run than in the past and a new Yacht in time for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee would help to promote our country to the world and to restore pride in time for the London Olympics.",
