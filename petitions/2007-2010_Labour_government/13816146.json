        "background": "We, loyal supporters of The Rangers Football Club, express our dismay at the apparent lack of support given by the State-owned Lloyds Banking Group to our Club.  We appeal for a common sense approach to the outstanding debts of our club and national institution.  We appeal for government intervention to ensure that the club is sold to a responsible buyer at a price suited to the current financial climate (many debts are being written off for 40-60 pence in the pound) as soon as possible.  We also appeal for state intervention to ensure that debts are recouped while also safeguarding the long term future of the club, that is, without stripping the club of our key playing and coaching staff.  This short-sighted approach would not only be detrimental to the club on the field but also damage the clubs finances by robbing us of the income that comes from having a successful team on the pitch (Champions League TV revenue being the main example).",
