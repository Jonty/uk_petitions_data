            "background": "Patients, and all staff whether earning a decent salary or not are being forced to pay \u00a335.00 per week to park. This has a detremental effect on patients with sick children, the elderly, relatives of patients who are sick. Staff who work tirelessly are being forced to either rely on public transport.Park in unsafe areas, then have to walk the rest, sometimes in darkness. This will result in staff being late, not wanting to stay behind - fear of parking costs. No consideration to people who have children to drop off at schools or nurseries as they will now have to leave earlier to use public transport. Its a tax on the ill. We do not mind paying but a pound a day is more affordable! Some people are looking for new jobs as they cannot afford to pay these ridiculous charges and have no other means of transport!!!!! the story is endless.",
