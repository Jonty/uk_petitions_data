        "background": "This year the Welsh Assembly Governement have reduced the budget allowance for Greenhill School in Tenby by 7.5%. Consequently this has a significant impact upon the school's ability to maintain their music & drama commitments.\nThe school orchestra is Nationally recognised with a number of talented musicians in their ranks.\nWith students from Greenhill, making up 50% of the County Orchestras in Pembrokeshire, the budget cuts have wide reaching impacts, which will effectively reduce the performance and commpetetive abilities of students. In addition key staff will be lost at County level, due to lack of finacial support, impacting on all schools in the area.",
