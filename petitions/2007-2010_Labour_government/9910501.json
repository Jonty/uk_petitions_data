        "background": "Motability should be scrapped for those who deem themselves incapable of getting out, but are capable of using public transport. Why should we pay for these losers to have a brand new car that we pay for, but yet are capable of using public transport for their needs. A car is not an essential part of the process other than getting these people to and from hospital or doctors, or who don't have carers.",
