            "background": "Isn't it about time the outdated and cruel practice of goldfish at fairs was banned? Most of these fish arent really wanted by the people who \"win\" them and are condemed to a short and miserable existance stuffed into totally inadequate bowls. I work in a reputable aquatics store and Im fed up of people who have ended up with a sick goldfish,comming to us for help, as they havent got a clue how to look after their fish! I will do my utmost to help these people and the fish, but I would much rather not be in this position at all.It's time to ban this cruel practise and consign it to history where it belongs! Thanks for reading this.",
