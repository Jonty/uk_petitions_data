        "action": "force the country's police forces, MOT stations, etc, to adopt a tougher stance on illegal car modifications.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many more vehicles are being illegally modified by their keepers, which is now starting to have dangerous consequences for other road users.  This includes aftermarket headlight conversions which utilise Xenon gas discharge technology (also known as HID) - as elaborated on in The Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989 and an online fact sheet dated December 2006.  Many people are installing them in light fittings that aren\u2019t designed for them, thus dazzling and momentarily blinding oncoming motorists.\n\nOther such illegal modifications include overly loud exhaust systems (a menace at night time), and the removal of catalytic converters from vehicles in the pursuit of \u2018on-the-road speed\u2019.\n\nAs these modifications are illegal, they will not be covered by the keeper\u2019s insurance, which means many such people aren\u2019t declaring that they now drive an illegal car to their insurance company.  This is fraudulent behaviour as well as an issue for road other road users, should they need to make a claim on the illegal third party\u2019s insurance.",
