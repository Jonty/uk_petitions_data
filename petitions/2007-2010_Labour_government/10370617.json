            "background": "The government wants to ban social networking sites. I believe they should be banned, as they are exposing young people to the more unsavoury side of life. Young people are placing provocative pictures of themselves on websites and using inappropriate language. After reading this petition, I urge all parents to check the activities of their sons/daughters on these sites. Equally, there may be families out there who have already been devastated by these sites. Please don't delay in signing. Thank you for your support!",
