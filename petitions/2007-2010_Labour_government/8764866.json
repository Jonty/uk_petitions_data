Only 24 hours notice has been given before entire communities are razed to the ground; no resettlement options have been provided, in direct violation of the laws of the Bangladeshi High Court. The UK government must stand up for the voiceless communities who have no recourse of their own, by directly remonstrating with Bangladeshi officials both in London and in Dhaka. The UK government must demand that, at the very least, resettlement options are provided to the thousands of now homeless families.",
