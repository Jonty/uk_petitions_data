It is dangerous to pets when they are running around they can cut there paws or legs on it. And if a child falls over they could also cut them selfs on it . Also there are alot people on bikes who complaine that they have popped tyres from the glass . My idea was that if all glass bottles and jars were made from plastic then people would not be able to smash them .",
