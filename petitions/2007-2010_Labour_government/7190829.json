            "background": "6 points for 45mph in a 30 limit? Possibly a good idea, but only when the 30 limit is justified. How many 30 limits have been poorly applied, eg. on dual carriageways or out-of-town roads that are little more dangerous at 60 than 30?\n\nAs for 6 points for a little over 90 on a motorway, that is wrong. The Germans manage to achieve comparable road safety even on unrestricted Autobahns where 100+ is normal. Don't forget that the Government's own figures prove that only around 4% of accidents are caused by speeding of any sort, so the focus on high speeds seems more narrowly targeted even than the normal anti-speed hysteria.\n\nSo before you proceed to heap even further pain on otherwise law-abiding drivers, at least have the decency to perform a full assessment of speed limits, and have driving experts set them at sensible levels rather than allow local councillors and non-drivers to set ones that pander to the political  agenda.",
