            "action": "Ban teenagers from public places, enforce neutering and lead control, microchipped for easy identification, and for their parents to be charged with manslaughter when teemagers are found to be out of control in public places - punish the breed not the deed.",

            "background": "Following several high profile violent attacks by vicious teenagers, we feel it is high time steps were taken to force those responsible to control their children.  We are sick and tired of seeing and feeling intimidated by gangs of unruly teenagers who think they, and in some cases are treated as if they actually do, own the streets they stray on.\n\nCurrent legislation appears to be ineffective, so it is time for drastic new measures to be put in place so we can reclaim our streets from these violent and seemingly uncontrollable creatures and properly punish and rehabilitate those responsible for their creation.",
