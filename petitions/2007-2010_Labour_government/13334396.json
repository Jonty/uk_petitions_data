        "background": "HOUNSLOW Council is planning to bulldoze the historic Feltham People's Centre and replace it with a car park for its employees.\n\nThe astonishing decision to knock down the council-owned building in Feltham High Street comes after plans to replace it with a skills centre fell by the wayside due to lack of funding.\n\nIn May councillors expressed regret at potentially losing the 1930s building from the conservation area but argued that the skills centre was so important to the town that special allowances should be made.\n\nNow the decision to bulldoze the former Feltham Hotel \u2013 which was used by the Feltham Community Association (FCA) for 36 years \u2013 and replace it with a car park for council workers has been met with fury in the town.",
