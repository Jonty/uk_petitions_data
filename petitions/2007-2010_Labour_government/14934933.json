These systems often result in repeated silent calls which can cause distress.\nii.)That those organisations that use direct calls be banned from with holding their numbers.\niii.)That  services such as call barring which may be required by individuals who have suffered from unwanted calls be paid for from a levy on these organisations.\niv.)That companys that persist in making unwanted calls or who refuse to abide by rules on good practise be punished effectively, given that they have not responded to the threat financial fines, this punishment should take the form of being barred from ever using a telephone again.",
