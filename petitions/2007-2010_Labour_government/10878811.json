            "background": "Like many others, the current uncertainty leaves me just one option, to remove funds in savings and current accounts and spread them over many un-connected institutions, which is time consuming and generally fraught with complications. The risk is also that a minor 'run' on the banks will occur in parts. To save all the inconvenience to savers and the institutions, and to bolster confidence generally, it is surely NOW time to act and guarantee all private savers without exception, leaving us all to concentrate on earning money and moving forward, not reacting to what 'may or may not happen' ! Do it, and do it NOW !!!",
