            "background": "In Handsworth in the west midlands in secret there has been a bail hostel opened right next to our property. There have already been issues with accumulated rubbish, noise, anti social behaviour (foul language, and discussion of criminal activity overhead in our garden). And, the most worrying incident on Friday night/Saturday Morning 2am where the police arrived in force x3 cars to arrest a resident who had caused major criminal damage to the property. We have managed to speak to the staff member from Clear Springs this week who has given us her contact details, and advised that we will be shortly receiving an official letter. However, I feel this is too little, too late and she was unable to offer a great deal of reassurance as to the manner of people who will be staying in the house. Please sign my petition. Thanks Chris",
