Currently 11,229 Palestinians in Israeli jails include 375 children, 19 mothers whose children are imprisoned with them.\n\n>Palestinians are tried and later being held within Israeli military courts located within military facilities in the OPT. These tribunals rarely fall within the required international standards of fair trials.\n\n>The Israeli human rights groups have documented Palestinian detainees being subjected to torture.\n\n>Since 1967, almost 200 Palestinians have died in Israeli prisons.\n>Palestinian children from the age of 12 onwards may be charged and sentenced in military courts under Israeli law.",
