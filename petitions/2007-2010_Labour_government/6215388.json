        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The government should fund research into \"sweepable gum\" that hardens and can be swept up with litter on the streets. Finding a non-patented solution would not only help the UK but every other country that has to deal with this problem.\n\nSome companies already fund research but there is no economic advantage so progress is slow. Other options such as increases in tax will not work as gum is so cheap and an outright ban is unworkable due to trade rules.\n\nIt is not impossible that in the very long-run the government would save money by employing less gum busters if a solution is found and implemented into manufacturing - if necessary by UK or EU law.\n\nThere is a short government paper on this subject entitled \"Chewing Gum Litter\" (September 2003). It is located on the Parliament that can be found through search engines.",
