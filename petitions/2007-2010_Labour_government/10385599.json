            "background": "Instead of using innocent and helpless animals for research it would be more beneficial to use humans, and convicted individuals would provide the required specimens for this purpose. If someone kills, rapes or carries out a serious crime on someone else, then deserve to be punished more severely than prison. Prison is far too easy, as we know already!\nUsing humans for research will also give more accurate and reliable results which will enable scientists to create drugs to benefit the human race. Why should animals have to be used for this when they have done nothing wrong, and the results from testing on them is not conclusive!?\nInstead of leaving convicted killers and criminals in prison - use them for research and make them pay for their crimes!",
