        "background": "I propose a change in the law on assault to make it that just having contact with another person is no longer assault. We as a society need to protect innocent and well meaning citizens from malicious accusations of assault. It needs to be that some physical injury must be sustained before a person can be charged or prosecuted with assault.\nThis particularly applies to well meaning citizens making citizens arrests or helping the police to detain individuals suspected of criminal or anti social activity.",
