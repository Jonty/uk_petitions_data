            "background": "There are two main types of animal testing; cosmetic and medical.\n\nCosmetic animal testing basically requires finding out what ingredients will burn the fur off a rabbit, or cause a rats skin to burn. As companies such as ASDA, Superdrug and the Body Shop have originally shown, a lack of cosmetic animal testing will not mean an increase in prices for consumers and products are just as safe.\n\nMedical animal testing requires injecting animals with chemicals, which may help us to find a cure to cancer. However a lot of the tests find the chemicals to be fine for animals but potentially fatal to humans. How do we know that this is not vice versa? Something which is fatal to animals, could be lifesaving to humans, but we will never know because as soon as a rat drops dead it becomes too risky to test on humans\n\nAnimal testing is cruel, unnecessary, pointless and is potentially losing the lives of humans by preventing treatments from being properly tested.\n\nStop cruel and pointless animal testing, it's not fair on animals, and it's not fair on human beings.",
