            "background": "Currently the legal age for purchase of sex toys is 18. The legal age for consent to sex is 16.\n\nWhen children reach the age of puberty, they start wondering what sex is like. Many will want to try sex as soon as they possibly can, whether practising safely or not. Lowering the age of sex toys would, I believe, help to reduce childrens curiosity as to what sex is like. Instead of going out and having sex with someone and possibly getting and STI or becoming pregnant, they could use a sex toy. \n\nCurrently this is not possible and I believe that the age limit of 18 only serves to further childrens desires to have sex.",
