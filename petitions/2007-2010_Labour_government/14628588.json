            "background": "We are a group of smallholders that are upset with being forced to ear tag or tattoo our livestock. Ear tags place unnecessary pain and suffering upon animals. Tagging results in open wounds and at times the animal rips the tag out completely, thereby having to go through the distressing process all over again. We beleive that micro-chipping could replace tagging and tattooing as a more reliable,less cruel way to identify livestock.",
