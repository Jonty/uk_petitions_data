            "background": "Applying for work (especially within Government) can be highly frustrating - it appears to be an elite body, and of no help to already deflated job seekers.\n\nSome jobs have the right to close off the final closing date earlier, thus obviously disadvantaging some applicants; it is rare to get any response at all, let alone an interview.\n\nA large number of Agencies are allowed to advertise on Job Centre websites and these jobs can be quite often already filled, or even non-existent.\n\nSome website ads. (including Government) act as a third party - again a source of frustration to the job seeker.  \n\nIt seems there are more barriers than an already unemployed person might need.\n\nWhy is searching and securing work not made easier for the unemployed?",
