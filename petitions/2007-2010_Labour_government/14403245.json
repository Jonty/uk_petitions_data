        "action": "reform the policy of the government on voting arrangements for Service personnel so that they and their families can exercise their democratic rights to vote by secret ballot when stationed overseas and to take immediate steps to have that policy embedded in law in time for the next general election.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Service personnel and their families stationed overseas are advised by the Ministry of Defence to vote by proxy.  Voting by secret ballot in person in the UK is not an option for most overseas personnel.  It is accepted by the Electoral Commission and the Ministry of Defence that postal votes are, because of tight time scales and logistical challenges, unlikely to reach Electoral Officials in time to be counted. Under the current electoral system Service personnel and their families overseas are unable to exercise their right to take part in a secret ballot, as they are entitled to do under the provisions of Article 3 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Other nations are able to provide their military community, serving abroad, with effective secret ballots. We believe it is now time for our Government to provide the same opportunities for the British service communities  overseas.",
