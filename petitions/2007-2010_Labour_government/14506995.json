Paypal have not removed the restriction and Now advised me that i can't remove my money from their account until 180 days. That means they will earn 180 days interest on my money, while i don't get none. I find this totally unfair and if knowning this was a user agreement then i would never have used them for payments.\nI am from what i can see many other people are finding the same problem!\nPaypal your user agreements are not fair for people! Please Help support my petition!",
