            "background": "I am sure you are aware of the planned tax increases of up to \u00a31000 on 4x4 vehicles over the next few years....  This maybe fair for people who own large cars and only use them for the \"school run\"  BUT...For all those who need 4 x 4 vehicles as a necessary part of life.... ie rural areas where the roads are poor and snow is a problem..... For all those who pull caravans, trailers, horse boxes where a saloon would not provide a safe environment for such a load as the towing capacity for these vehicles are very low!!!!  Surely such a tax would encourage people to break the law elsewhere, and thus effect the safety of all other road users!!!",
