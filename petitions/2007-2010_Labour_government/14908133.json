They have the means to perpetuate a lifestyle which is now becoming grotesque. Balance must be restored!\n\nPeople are no longer able to survive in any faithful way, as the banks have little faith in their customers, us the general public. An example might be that someone is \u00a37 overdrawn. They will then incur charges of up to \u00a322. This race to cream off the top of insolvency and personal struggle must be stopped. It only renders people hopeless in a situation inescapable. Might the Prime MInister and those around him bring about such a change?",
