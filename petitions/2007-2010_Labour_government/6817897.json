            "background": "It is unreasonable to expect that patients who need urgent treatment should face the long journey on often very congested roads, to the already overstretched Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.  It seems crazy to close  hospital facilities that are relatively close to Gatwick Airport in these uncertain times.  Lives will be lost that are being saved at the Princess Royal Hospital.  Surely it makes sense to provide treatment close to the homes of patients in the area, saving time, saving the carbon emissions of ambulances and visitors forced to travel the extra miles, and saving lives.  Please listen and STOP THREATENING CLOSURE OF OUR MATERNITY AND ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AT THE PRINCESS ROYAL HOSPITAL in HAYWARDS HEATH.",
