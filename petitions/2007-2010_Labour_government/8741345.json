        "background": "Cornwall must have its own public holiday on the 5th March to commemorate St Piran's day. Cornwall has been ignored in the establishment of regional assemblies and the black and white cross of St Piran's flag, a well established symbol of the Cornish identity, is largely neglected by the rest of the country. St Piran's Day is very popular in Cornwall as a statement of regional identity. We do not accept why our political leaders ignore Cornwall's contribution to the cultural heritage of the British Isles, while giving such prominence to other regions. The granting of a public holiday to commemorate St Piran's Day would demonstrate our leaders' commitment to regional identity.\"",
