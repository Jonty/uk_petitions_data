        "background": "Scenario: you are unable to get a flight, therefore, you will almost certainly loose the flight cost (low cost airlines), the only refundable sum is the government tax applied to your flight.\nTo obtain a refund, you will be charged anything between \u00a3 15 and \u00a3 30, so if you are entitled to a refund, it will be in the order of \u00a3 5 to \u00a3 15.\nIf you don't fly, the airline keep the tax, as they are only obliged the pay the government if you fly! This is unfair, a full refund should be made automatically, perphaps less the actual transaction cost.",
