The holocaust was perhaps the worst case of deliberate human cruelty of the 20th century, and must never be forgotten by any nation on earth, lest we as a species be tempted to allow anything similar to re-occur! Political sensibilities should never intrude into truth.",

                "details": "Teaching of the holocaust has not been withdrawn from the curriculum. We are sorry that you have been misled by some media reporting on this issue. We are able to say categorically that the Holocaust is a compulsory part of the Key Stage 3 National Curriculum for history and is a very well-resourced topic as it has been compulsory for 10 years. Such is the importance of this area of study it will remain compulsory in the new Key Stage 3 curriculum from September 2008. The Department for Education and Skills commissioned research into the teaching of emotive and controversial issues in history. The Holocaust was mentioned in that research, carried out by the Historical Association, as one of a number of these issues. The report, which can be downloaded from www.history.org.uk, made reference to one school where the Holocaust was not chosen as a topic for coursework at GCSE. History is not compulsory at GCSE and it is for teachers to decide what to teach those students who wish to pursue history beyond 14. The Holocaust Educational Trust has also been concerned to allay any fears about the place of the Holocaust in National Curriculum and further information can be obtained from them at www.het.org.uk",
