            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We are taxed so much on fuel and we are told to use our cars less, so that we can reduce CO2 emissions and climate change. BUT, how are we to travel around? Public transport is inefficient and more expensive than using a car! And train fares have just gone up again. I am asking for the carbon taxes to be used in a way that will help people and the environment. Better public transport will improve the quality of life for so many people. It will reduce congestion, improve air quality, give more freedom to certain groups of people (e.g. those who cant afford cars or are unable to drive such as young people and the elderly). Less cars will mean less parking problems, noise and reduced road accidents and drink driving. \nThe public needs to travel around, but it is getting more and more difficult as fuel is taxed but public transport also increases in price but is inefficient, insufficient and expensive.",
