            "background": "Have more Speech Therapists & more funding in schools to educate the teachers and most impotantly of all the Children with Communication problems.\n\nAlot of parents on low income or no travel arrangements find it very hard to get there child to a speech therapist session. If parents can get there child there it is most inconvienient for alot of them due to working and also inconvienient for the children as they have to miss out on there education at school. \n\nSo to solve this situation it would be convienient for parents, children & the educators if a speech therapist was based or even attended the school on a regular basis.\n\nMy son had 3 speech therapy classes at the age of 4 years, but due to me not being able to travel long distance to get to the class my son had to miss out, which has made it harder for him  in education, and im sure this is the same for many Parents with children which of whom also have speech problems.\n\nSo please sign this petition on behalf of the children, Littlecoates Primary School, Grimsby & many other Schools. across the country.",
