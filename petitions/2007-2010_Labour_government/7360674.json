When people quit because they have failed in the responsibilities for which they are contracted and receive remuneration from the public purse, or are sacked because of inefficiency or criminal activity then their terminal and pension rights should be forfeit.  (Any contributions made by the individual, from previous salary, should be refunded but taxpayer funded contributions to the pension pot should be returned to the public purse.",
