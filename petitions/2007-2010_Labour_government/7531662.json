            "background": "The general public are constantly exhorted by the Government to cut down on their carbon footprint. A key way they could contribute to this is via the increased use of public transport. \n\nFurther, the individual is heavily taxed for car use by many means.  This produces income for the Treasury.   \n\nMeanwhile the national public transport system transport system is not suppported adequately by the Government  - train travel in particular  is inadequate, expensive and poorly co-ordinated. Further, we are led to believe that the Government wishes to reduce existing investment in rail services.  \n\nThis is a hypocrisy which diminishes the Government's green credentials. They are putting Treasury gain before environmental and quality of life concerns.\n\nTherefore we petition the Government to review and enhance its support for an effective national public transportation system as a viable and green alternative to private transport.",
