            "background": "OTTs (overseas trained teachers) may teach in English state maintained schools for four years, during which time they must gain qualified teacher status (QTS). It is unlawful for OTTs not gaining QTS within four years to continue teaching. This time limit serves no purpose; if an OTT is less than competent, allowing them to teach for four years is to the detriment of those they teach. Conversely, disallowing good teachers from teaching after four years is a needless loss. If safeguards in place allow government to be confident that OTTs recruited are equipped to teach at all, then the four year rule is at best arbitrary. Over time OTTs become even better equipped to teach in a system to which they have acclimatised. The four year rule serves only to terminate the usefulness of such teachers. Other means are in place to motivate OTTs to gain QTS. The four year rule serves only to cut a valuable workforce and should therefore be scrapped.",
