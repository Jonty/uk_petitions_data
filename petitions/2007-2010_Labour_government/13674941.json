            "background": "Halifax has recently informed customer that they will be charging a flat 'fee' for the use of authorised overdrafts. This equates to \u00a31 per day the customer is using an overdraft below \u00a32500 and \u00a32 over \u00a32500. This is a move by the bank to unfairly charge people who are in financially weaker situations and as such the Government should step in to stop the bank undertaking this change due to come into effect on the 6th December. The interest breaks down as such:\n\n\u00a30.01 Overdraft: 3,650,000%\n\u00a3100 Overdraft: 365%\n\u00a3100 Overdraft: 73%\n\u00a3500 Overdraft: 36.5% \n\nThis is clearly very high rates of interest and most people with overdrafts between \u00a31 and a \u00a31000 will see a minimum of double the previous charges. \n\nHalifax literature claims this is a fairer way for customers to understand charges; it appears to be a move by the bank to make excessive profits from the less fortunate who live within overdrafts or are not able to clear thier overdraft, such as post graduates, the unemployed, the less wealthy. The Government must take action.",
