            "background": "Diageo are planning to close down the birth place of the world famous Johnnie Walker Whisky, at the cost of 700 local jobs.  Johnnie Walker is the only industry left in Kilmarnock and the closure will have a massive impact on an already poor local economy.  Johnnie Walker Whisky has been a part of the community for 189 years and there will be no one in the town who hasn't had friends or family who haven't worked in the company.  This is a crazy step taken by Diageo who earlier praised the site for there hard work and to suddenly drop this bomb shell on the work force will be a huge kick in the teeth.  We cannot let this massively important industry leave the community as it also has its own pride at stake for being linked with the famous whisky.",
