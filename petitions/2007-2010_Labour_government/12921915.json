I was lucky that I managered to get them help privately but the government offers no help and leaves these children suffering in pain, when with treatment they can be helped. The doctors needs to be trained and the social workers help to be forthcoming with help for these children unstead of leaving them to suffer and stating they do not fit our criteria.\n\nRegards",
