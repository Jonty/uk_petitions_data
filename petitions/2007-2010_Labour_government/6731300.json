            "background": "This government has already created more red-tape for landlords and is now likely to introduce tax on mortgage interest payments. Removing tax relief on mortgage interest payments for  landlords and buy to let investors is a stealth tax on tenants.\n\nNo other UK business sector is expected to pay tax on expenses - so why should landlords? Landlords already pay tax on income, stamp duty and capital gains.\n\nThis tax plan is a draconian knee-jerk measure that will lead to increased costs of \u00a31.8 billion to landlords. Landlords will have no choice but to pass this tax cost on to tenants.\n\nThe 'idea' behind this tax is to allow first time buyers better opportunities, however, increasing costs for tenants will mean they will face more difficulties saving for a first property.\n\nThe landlord and buy-to-let sector has transformed inner cities, fuelled economic growth and contributes billions to the economy and the exchequer. Introducing this tax will lead to instability in the housing market, increased re-possessions and homelessness.\n\nThe government already intereferes more in the housing market than any other industry this tax is a step too far.",
