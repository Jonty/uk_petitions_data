We were offered a one day course for a few hours at 2pm in the afternoon on a weekday, not exactly practical when both of us work.\nWith the announcement of \u00a31.8bn surplus does this seem fair or just?\nAs a result to fit in around working - which most of us have to do these days to get by, we have had to pay \u00a3135 to get a course through the National Childbirth Trust, please support getting this unfair and unjust system to work for normal working class people. Help us first time parents feel a little more valued, better informed and less isolated.",
