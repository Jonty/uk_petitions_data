            "background": "In August 1998, the Government decided to test retail milk for an organism called MAP. The test showed that it was present in a few samples of pasteurised milk. When the results came out, action was taken by various government agencies,to stop this from happening. There are worries that this organism might be a cause of crohns disease. I have recently examined NHS hospital episode statistics for crohns. I have found that the number of people admitted to hospital with this debilitating disease have increased rapidly since 1998. This leads me to worry that MAP might still be in our milk, and that milk should be tested again. If milk is clear of MAP, other countries, perhaps commonwealth countries like Canada, might want to adopt the UK strategy to eliminate MAP from milk. It would also increase consumer confidence.",
