        "background": "State schools are forced to teach only European languages and cannot teach non-European languages as part of the National Curriculum despite exam boards offering GCSEs in them. The world has changed dramatically since the mid 80s and many non-European languages have increased in importance for business, diplomatic, and media purposes, but the government makes it difficult for British children to learn them. Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic are probably the best languages to teach, but Turkish is another good choice because it's very easy and the verbs are regular.\n\nThe number of secondary school students taking a foreign language GCSE continues to decline and the only way to reverse it is for schools to offer more exotic non-European languages. There is a bigger world out there than the EU.",
