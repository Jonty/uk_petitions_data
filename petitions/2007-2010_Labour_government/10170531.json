        "background": "Hello,\n\nAgain reading through recent news reports there have been cases of white Britains being assaulted by Muslim gangs (of youths).  Yet none of these crimes have been classified as racist by the police.\n\nThese crimes are clearly motivated by race (EG, a gang assaulting a white teenager and his girlfriend just because they walked down a road - what other motivation could there be?).\n\nThe police should be an objective force which is not bound by policital influences.  Therefore racist attacks, against all peoples, such be classified as such.\n\nTo not recognise an attack is a racist attack is an insult to the victim(s).",
