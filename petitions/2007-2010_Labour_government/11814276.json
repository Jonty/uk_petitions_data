            "background": "The telephone industry has created a regime where the customer does not know the cost of the product (the phone call) until after they agreed to pay for the product (by making the phone call). This can lead to extortionate bills for people who were denied the opportunity to make an informed choice.\n\nWhat is needed is an announcement of the price before the call is connected. For example, \"This call will cost x pence per minute,\" or \"This call will incur a connection charge of x pence and be charged from the start at y pence per minute,\" or \"This call will use your inclusive minutes. If it exceeds x minutes, the remainder will be charged at y pence per minute.\"",
