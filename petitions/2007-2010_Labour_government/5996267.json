            "background": "Magna Carta is one of Britain's greatest contributions to the world. It's the original expression of the peoples' relationship with the state, and the bedrock of democracy in Britain, the United States and many other countries around the world. We propose an annual Magna Carta Day: a national, inclusive secular celebration of citizenship, democracy and responsibility. We suggest a day around June 15th (the signing of the original document) probably renaming an existing Bank Holiday.",
