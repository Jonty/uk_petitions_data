            "background": "The sacking of Professor David Nutt from his position as head of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs by Home Secretary Alan Johnson due to his criticism of the decision to reclassify cannabis and his recent lecture at Kings College, London is unacceptable. Why does Mr Johnson think he is more knowledgeable than the man employed as the expert in this field?\n\nSometimes the experts are going to say things that people don't want to hear but need to be said. They shouldn't feel at risk of losing their job for that.",
