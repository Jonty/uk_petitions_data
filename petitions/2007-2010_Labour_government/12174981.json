This has caused problems in the past when some shops, internet shopping websites and call centres cannot accept payment from these cards 2 days before expiry. These people cannot use their new card as it's valid yet! \n\nOther banks offer cards so customers have 2 cards to use on the same account for a month.\n\nI know the inconvenience of this only happens for 2 days every 2 years, but it's the principle!",
