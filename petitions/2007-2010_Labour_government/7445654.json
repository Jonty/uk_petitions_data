            "background": "The London bound M40 motorway at Junction 1a at the M25 slip road currently has 1 lane serving the M25 and 3 lanes for the M40.  We propose to have this altered to 2 lanes dedicated to the M25 - 1 lane for Clockwise (M1 bound) and the other for Anti-clockwise traffic (Heathrow bound).  This would ease the congestion and make the road safer as at present, drivers cut into the slip lane at the last minute and it has been the cause of many accidents.",
