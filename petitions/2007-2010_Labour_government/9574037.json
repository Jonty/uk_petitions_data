Move policing away from the photo frenzy which is detrimentally affecting the judicial, health and other emergency services.",

            "background": "AOl reports, today, that \"Police forces spent nearly \u00a340 million on PR and marketing last year, a survey showed.\nThe sum would have paid for an extra 1,400 full-time police officers, or funded the \u00a330 million cost of the disputed police pay rise in England and Wales.\" How can this be justified - is this simply another matter of ain't what ya' do but the way that ya' look when ya' do it ?!\n\nPer 100,000 head of population, the Police Service of Northern Ireland was the biggest spender, at \u00a399,501, compared with just \u00a312,566 in Derbyshire. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to justify discrepancies in spending budgets.\n\nGiven that, \"Overall spending on press and PR has increased by more than 13% since 2005\". \n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to re - prioritise budgets -\nsending a clear signal to ambulance -chasing journalists that vulturism on the vulnerable is NOT the best way to run emergency services, reasserting the police's role in crime prevention, detection, investigation - not fuelling this kind of voyeurism that is developing in society on other people's grief and distress.",
