            "background": "The act of Christening or Baptism creates a written record of a person's entry into a church. Generally at an age where they have no say in the matter. If that church is the Church of England, that record cannot by law be amended to indicate to future generations that in later life, having had the chance to actually think about it, that the person involved doesn't want to be associated with such a ludicrous concept as a god. This is wrong. It contravenes the European right to freedom of association. It also allows the CofE to retain people who view it at best as an irrelevance and at worst as an immoral force in society, on \"their books\" thus allowing them an inflated view of their importance. Again, this is wrong, not just for this generation, but for those in the future who will be hoodwinked into thinking that religion played an important role in their ancestors' lives.",
