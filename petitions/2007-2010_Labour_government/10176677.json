            "background": "This year the Mardi Gras in Cardiff has been cancelled! This one day a year event is more than an event to the people who regularly go!\nGay people have been stereotyped for many years and homophobia still exists!\nThis event is for gay people to have their 1 day of pride a year. It is very impotant to a lot of people. Cardiff Mardi Gras is not just for gay people. Gay and straight people have attended the event for many years! This is the one day that gay people can express themselves openly with a large group of gay people. Homophobia will never cease to exist, however, we can try and limit the number of homophobic people. By the cancellation of this years Cardiff Mardi Gras, there has already been talk of a march going on throughout the streets of cardiff! This could make matters worse, however we cannot stop everyone from attending! I announce that we do this quietly and without hassle via use of a petition! Please give us your support and Thank You very much for taking the time to hear our plea! K.D.Parkhouse",
