            "background": "This petition is due to the fact that over the last week as you will have read or seen in the news, the laws of this country have been challenged by the government in relation to israeli ministers and the \"universal juristiction\" arrest warrants that were issued by UK courts. Whoever is accused of war crimes no matter what country they are from, need to respect the law, and governments should not get involved in the judicial system to try and try to change the law just because it doesn't suit the government. The UK government should stick up for the laws of this land and not try and change it just because another country doesn't like our laws, who is actually running this country?",
