            "background": "The behaviour of the Skanda Vale \"community\" has been incredibly childish, unlawful, disrespectful and un-Welsh.\n\nThe government should seek to recover from the charity all the costs involved in policing, and dealing with the obstructions put up by the organisation, in order that the taxpayer is not subsidising their misbehaviour.\n\nFurthermore, the government should ask for an apology from The Hindu Forum of Britain and Skanda Vale for the manner in which they have conducted themselves over this issue.  This apology should be to taxpayers, farmers in Carmarthenshire, and the people of Wales.\nIf no such apology is forthcoming, then the charitable status of the organisation should be reviewed.\n\nIn addition, the judge who ruled that Article Nine of the European Convention on Human Rights on freedom of religion means that anyone who wants to prevent their infected animals being slaughtered can do so by invoking \"religion\" should be investigated.",
