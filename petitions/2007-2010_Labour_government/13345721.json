        "background": "Weedkiller can harm many living organisms as well as the plants on which it is sprayed. These include butterflies,spiders and bees. This herbicide gets into the ground and harms soil organisms. Many councils spray excessively. It is not necessary to spray around trees, along fences and under street signs. The result is the loss of valuable habitats and ugly bare patches of ground. The chemicals in the spray also have the  potential to harm humans.  Valuable resources are wasted. The spray is made from phosphate rock. This is needed for fertilizer and global reserves are diminishing rapidly. Fossil fuel is needed to make and transport the herbicide.",
