        "background": "The UK is one of the 'big four' in the contest as our funding (via the BBC) of the Eurovision Song Contest guarantees our inclusion in the final each year.  This petition suggests that the BBC should reduce its financial contribution significantly and give up its automatic right to entry into the final stage.  \n\nThe money could be better spent on programmes or perhaps even donated to charity, although this would very worthwhile, it would be problematical legally.\n\nWe would also be able to enjoy the competition more without the disappointment of coming last each year.",
