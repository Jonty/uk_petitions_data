            "background": "I would propose to change the tradition of celebrating an individual that, over 400 years ago tried to hinder democracy, to become a celebration of our armed forces both present and past. We should always remember them in the form of the traditional rememberance services, but we can also celebrate their bravery and heroism in the form of fireworks around the same time of year or even better on VE day. This would bring this tradition into a more relevant sphere.",
