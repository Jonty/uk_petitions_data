I petition the PM to allow smokers to opt out of paying tax towards the NHS as long as they pay for private health care.\nIt is a lottery whether they receive treatmentor not. This is not fair as they actually pay more than non smokers.\nLet them opt out or admit that you rely on tax and vat from smokers to support the NHS and guarantee them a full & fair service.",
