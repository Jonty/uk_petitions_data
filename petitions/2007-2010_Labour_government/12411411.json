            "background": "we need a new licence to be made for shops selling reptiles. All reptiles should be adequately cared for and have veterinary check ups before being sold, this should fall under the sale of goods act. \n\nThis is not just happening in one part of the country, it is nationwide. Before a licence to sell reptiles is acquired there must be the correct research, training and policies set by all shops to prevent further harm being caused. Also this would prevent any inexperienced owners being mislead and left uneducated in the care of reptiles after purchasing from a shop.\n\nMy main reason for starting this petition is because I feel that the poor care for reptiles should stop. Many people who have made a hobby by keeping reptiles are being deterred and being caused to give up what they love due to this. Also this would prevent any inexperienced owners being mislead and left uneducated towards the care of reptiles after purchasing from a shop.",
