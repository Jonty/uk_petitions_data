            "background": "The instance of lost items in the post appears to be reaching untenable levels, to make any rational individual question whether it is in fact loss, or actually more sinister - be it theft, or wanton destruction (instead of delivery).  This is not just about Government disks, its about the widespread, day-to-day non-delivery of anything which might appear to have a monetary value.\n\nAt present, Royal Mail investigates any 'losses' internally - the police refuse to get involved, despite the widespread non-delivery of packages across the UK and losses to individuals and businesses.\n\nThe value of 'lost items' by Royal Mail should warrant a full, deep, independent Police investigation, not a whitewash internal investigation.   Otherwise there is the risk that we will entirely lose faith that something posted will ever actually be delivered to its intended recipient.",
