Let them be the ones before the United Nations if anyone is to blame, we offered and that should be enough. The fact that Burmese Officials stated they would not accept foreign aid workers but would accept the raised funds was an insult against those trying to make a difference, if they do not want the help they should get none of our taxpayer's money.",
