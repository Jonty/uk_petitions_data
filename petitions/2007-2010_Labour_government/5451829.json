            "background": "The elimination of 'targets' within the NHS is crippling the treatment of patients. Also the top heavy management is contributing to the chaos now being experienced by so many, this has to be the first priority of running an improved NHS. If the Government are so keen on turning the NHS into a smooth 'business' then too many managers will be costly. With the saving of managers' salaries, this in turn could be used to take on many more junior doctors, nurses and cleaners.",
