            "background": "Currently, if a motorist is hit by a bicycle or suffers damage or injury from a bike colliding with their car or personage, the only way to currently claim for the damage or injury is by personal costly action via the courts. This is unjust as cyclists are road users and should be governed by the same laws.\n\nI therefore petition the prime-minister that cyclists should NOT be allowed on the roads without adequate insurance cover to at least third party standards.\n\nMany cyclists do not give way to other vehicles on narrow country roads and often are the CAUSE of accidents, yet under current law do not have to pay road tax or insurance, which in short, is a farce!\n\nRoss Hemsworth\nManaging Director\nGlastonbury Radio",
