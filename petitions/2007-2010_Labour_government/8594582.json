            "background": "Within soceity today there seems to be angst amongst various social groups and enthnicities. This is a direct result of not having a philosopical grounding within education. If younger children were exposed to political philosophy as well as all other disciplines within philosophy, they would be able to understand why it is not reasonable to act in the manner they do. A direct result of this being implemented would be a more cohesive and tolerant society",
