Even when The VAT Tribunal has ruled in favour of the appellants, HM Revenue and Customs continue to ignore the fact that its strategy is having an adverse effect on the whole telecoms industry and that a huge number of innocent businesses have been brought to their knees financially as a result because they cannot simply fight an organisation as large and powerful as HM Revenue and Customs and the firms are hugely affected to the extent it will be extremely difficult to start rebuilding their shattered and destroyed business once more.",
