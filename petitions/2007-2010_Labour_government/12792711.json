            "background": "This is one of the busiest routes into Manchester Town Centre however for the majority of the route there is just no cycle or bus lane, granted there is a small stretch but where 3 lanes merge into 2 narrow ones there is nothing, There has been many incidents along here,  something needs to be done before there is a serious accident on this road, I know many people alonge the route that would love to cycle to work but due to the lack of cycle lanes they dont, I can't say I blame them, As someone who commutes along there 5 days a week it is rare to go a whole week without incident.",
