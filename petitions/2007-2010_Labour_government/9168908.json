            "background": "At the moment, a house will receive a 25% reduction in their council tax bill if there is one non-student resident and two or more student residents. However, this fails to take into account the band of the property. So in a worse case scenario, 1 non-student living in a band 'H' property with 10 students has to pay 75%  of band H council tax. In a more realistic situation with two non-students and two students in a Band 'F' property, this would lead to either the students having to pay council tax, or the non-students having to pay more council tax (than if they were living 2 other non-students). Both of these scenarios make living with students an expensive and unfair situation.",
