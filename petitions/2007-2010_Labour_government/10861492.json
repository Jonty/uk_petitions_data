        "background": "Every year 19 air ambulance trusts across England and Wales are saving countless lives. Unfortunately the government are failing to give adequate funding to the trusts and they have to operate entirely on charitable donations from the general public. This is a real shame for the government. They should not cut corners or pinch pennies when lives are at stake. In Germany where a state air ambulance service of 16 helicopters has been set up, there has been several improvements. An average response time to the scene of the incident of just 10 minutes, which is really good, also Head injury mortality has been reduced by 15%. Although air ambulance services in England and Wales are doing a brilliant job now, they could stop having to focus their efforts on raising money and spend all of their time on saving lives, what they do best. Please sign this petition which will hopefully persuade the government to take steps towards paying for an air ambulance service.",
