            "background": "Drivers are not allowed to drink drive, or use drugs while driving. Smoking is a drug, affecting the state of mind of a driver. Also, if hot ash drops on a driver and they are looking at i trying to wipe it off they are not looking at the road. As well as the above points, cigarettes are in a packet. The packet had to be opened and the cigarette has to be lit. Thus detracting the drivers attention. Smoking is a drug - it should not be allowed while driving. in my opinion its JUST as dangerous as driving with a phone, if not even more so.",
