In many cases this slows down the granting of, for instance, a licence by many days (by the time an invoice is sent, a cheque raised, the cheque allowed to clear etc etc).  If the law requires a licence be obtained before a particular activity is allowed, then HMG should make it as simple and as rapid as possible for the applicant to make a payment.  Credit/debit cards are accepted by many departments/agencies on Direct.gov and other government websites or by phone - in the early days of the 21st century shouldn't his be extended to all?",
