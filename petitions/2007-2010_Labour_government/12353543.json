            "action": "condemn the undemocratic and unconstitutional seizure of power in Madagascar; to refrain from recognising the new regime as the valid government; to call for democratic elections to be held as a matter of urgency; and to pressure those in power to take swift action against loggers now devastating protected areas.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In March 2009 Andry Rajoelina, former mayor of the capital, unseated the democratically elected president and took power by force. This takeover violated the fundamental principles of democracy and Madagascar's own constitution.\n\nIt is essential that the international community takes a firm stand against such behaviour. Allowing a violent coup d'\u00e9tat to be effective by recognising the new regime increases the chance of others attempting the same in future.\n\nRajoelina plans elections in 18 months. It is imperative that democratic elections take place as soon as possible, ideally much sooner than Rajoelina proposes, to install a credible Malagasy government.\n\nSince the coup, armed criminal gangs have been quick to take advantage of the lawlessness, logging precious hardwoods in national parks & poaching endangered wildlife. Madagascar is a hotspot for biodiversity and this devastation risks causing irreparable damage, driving species to extinction & ruining Madagascar's ecotourism industry.",
