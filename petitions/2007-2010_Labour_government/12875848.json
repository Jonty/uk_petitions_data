            "background": "Too many online adverts show prices to grab people's attention to an offer. However, on perusing the promotion stated prices do not include all the functionality required. E.g. mobile phone promoted at a cost of \u00a330.00 but in order for the phone to function you also have to buy an additional service costing \u00a35.00 more. The latter price is rarely included in the promotion price and usually only found on checkout. Retailers should have to by law clearly state all or the full price initially instead of in the small print.",
