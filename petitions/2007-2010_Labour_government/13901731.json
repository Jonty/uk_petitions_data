            "background": "After the death of Ivan Cameron, Gordon Brown said , \u201c Every child is precious and irreplaceable, and the death of a child is an unbearable sorrow that no parent should have to endure.\u201d\n  \nA Neonatal Taskforce was established last year in response to the National Audit Office's criticism of standards of care for sick babies.  It concluded that they should have one-to-one nursing in intensive care \u2013 the same standard already given to adults \u2013 in line with recommendations medical organisations have been making for the past 15 years.\n \nThe Taskforce recommended investment of \u00a389m a year, with one-off costs of \u00a3102m, to bring care up to standard. But ministers have refused to allocate any extra money. \n\nTiny babies should not be paying the price for the credit crunch. Gordon Brown could prevent other parents from enduring lifelong sorrow by overturning this decision and accepting the Taskforce\u2019s recommendations. We call upon him to do so immediately",
