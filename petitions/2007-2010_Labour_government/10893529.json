            "background": "Accountancy firms have failed in their duty to provide a fair and true representation of company accounts, especially with respect to risk management and strength of balance sheets.\n \nThe Government should create an independent regulator for auditing with powers to impose unlimited fines on accountancy firms that collude with companies to misrepresent their accounts or are simply incompetent.\n\nPersistent offenders should have their licence to practice revoked and their directors or Partners goaled.\n\nA small number of global  accountancy and consulting firms audit the top 500 companies. These firms should be broken up to create more competition. \n\nNo firm should be allowed to audit more than 10 percent of companies in any sector.\n\nA new, more rigorous set of global accounting standards should be established and supervised by a super regulator.\n\nThe Government is requested to take a lead to establish the global regulator.\n\nThe global regulator should be given powers to close firms that break the new standards. It should be funded through a levy on companies and their auditors.",
