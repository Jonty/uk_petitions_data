Why are we always the target market for higher tax etc? Why are we always penalised? We work hard, long hours to try and better our life for us and our 15 month old daughter. I sometimes wonder why we bothered to get our degrees and jobs, when others who didn't, seem to be better off. Leave us alone Gordon Brown. Go and pick on somebody else.",
