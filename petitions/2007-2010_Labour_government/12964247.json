            "background": "The cost of the VED (road tax) section of DVLA is enormous and unnecessary. Building maintenance, furnishing, computers, supplies, staff (incl support, admin and maintenance staff), advertisement, pursuit of tax dodgers incl sophisticated technology and so much more. Scrap VED, put 10p on a litre of fuel. Then no-one can avoid paying, visitors from overseas will contribute, gas guzzlers will pay more than economical car users and people would be motivated to buy more economical vehicles. Reduced queues at post offices, reduced paper waste, no fines for late payment, no SORN and so on. Just 10p per litre would raise way more than \u00a3150 per year per average motorist. And we won't have to get time off work to buy a disc.",
