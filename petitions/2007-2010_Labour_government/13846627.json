        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is in the interest of all UK citizens that policymaking by any public body including government, is based on the best available evidence.\n\nIndependent, expert advice is crucial \u2013 to search for and marshal factual evidence, to critically appraise this evidence, place it in context and interpret the evidence to non-experts who formulate policy.\n\nIn order for this process to occur, experts need to retain the freedom to debate and discuss issues in their field; this is by necessity a public process. Failure to protect this intellectual freedom reduces the independence of the advice, and thus reduces its utility to society. Furthermore, experts are less likely to engage with policymaking if their efforts are not listened to, or if their freedom to disagree with opinions including government opinion, is not supported by the public bodies that enlist their help.\n\nThe recent request by the Home Secretary for Professor Nutt to resign from his post therefore represents a retrograde step for evidence-based public policymaking and for the freedom of academic debate, and we therefore urge the Prime Minister to overturn this resignation request.",
