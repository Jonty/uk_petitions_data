            "background": "The subject of benefits is understandably a sensitive subject but I believe reviewing/cancelling the benefit scheme with exception of disability allowance will be better all round.\n\nIt gives people claiming a number of benefits good reason to live their life and not just rely on others. Its unfair that people such as myself who works 2 jobs to live are worse off than those claiming benefits.\n\nIsnt it supposed to be, \"the harder you work the better life you lead\"...but presently, this doesn't seem to be the case, mainly for the working class.\nFor example,for those single parents,open 'free' nurseries/day centres for children so parents can go out to work thus improving social quality of life and encouraging independence. Another being, having more housing share options rather than proving them partially free or all paid housing.\n\nNot providing benefits will then prevent  'illegal immigrants' coming into the UK, thus leaving jobs open to UK citizens.\n\nThis will make the UK citizens feel like they are the majority not the minority and feel they can have trust and faith in the leadership of the country.",
