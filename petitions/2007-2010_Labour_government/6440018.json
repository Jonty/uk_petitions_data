The police havent adequate resources to bring the culprits to justice & these organised criminals are getting away. I suggest the govt take live photos (& hold in a main database) of everyone entering the UK from places like Cameroon, Nigeria,ghana & places like Holland. They can change their names far too easily but their face is harder to change. These scum are responsible of the ongoing increase of organised crime that is spreading all over the UK & extending to other countries too.",
