This policy was tested in Leeds and the number of abuses of the bays declined rapidly.  With the advent of disability access laws, is the Government not guilty of breaching them if they do not act to enforce blue badge and disabled bay parking abuse as in effect they are condoning the denying of access to disabled people?",
