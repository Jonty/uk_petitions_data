            "background": "Heaton Avenue First and Nursery School has a reputation for \u2018outstanding teaching and learning\u2019 (OFSTED, 2008). Kirklees reorganisation proposals threaten the existence of the school and all it stands for. \nWe reject the council\u2019s proposal to close the school. Closure would reduce parental choice in an increasingly diverse community and would force many local children to travel across town to school.\nWe also reject the council\u2019s proposal for a smaller primary of 210 pupils at West End. Such a plan would severely impact on funding, on staff numbers and on the of delivery excellent teaching and learning. It is a recipe for underachievement.\nInstead we support the governing body\u2019s alternative proposals: a 1.5 form entry, 315-pupil community primary school plus nursery. It will ensure outstanding provision for local children and will provide facilities befitting a 21st century school.\nMost of all, it will best serve the community by putting a school at the heart of that community.",
