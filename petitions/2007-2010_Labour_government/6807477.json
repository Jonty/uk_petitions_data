            "background": "Imagine being asked to perform a series of tasks everyday, such as being organised, reading, writing and contributing ideas and opnions about chosen topics - when everyone around you can do it - but you struggle - no matter how hard you try and concentrate your progress is always slower than anyone elses?? It would be difficult to remain positive - unless you were able to accept and fully understand why? This is a form of support that children with special educational needs should have. Not only to improve their self esteem and encourage them not to give up but also to help them respect and accept the needs that they have in the hope of becoming proud of themselves and the efforts and progress they make, however slow compaired to their peers.",
