People should not be penalised for driving, our country only creates less than one percent of the worlds pollution, therefore hte only reason that there could be is financial. furthermore, if people don't spend money on petrol, they can use it to buy things that they want and need thus increases the recovery of the economy, and putting money back into peoples' pockets",
