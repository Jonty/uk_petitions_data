            "background": "The Post Office fulfils a vital function in local communities in both rural and urban areas of Britain. As well as providing communication, administration, welfare and retail services to local residents, the British Post Office provides an integral hub through which a neighbourhood interacts and coheres. Without a local Post Office, many Britons \u2013 especially the elderly and disabled \u2013 will become socially isolated, fragmenting the sense of community in the UK. Neither mass closure nor privatisation is the answer. We demand more funding and a radical rethink of the government's priorities towards this national institution.",
