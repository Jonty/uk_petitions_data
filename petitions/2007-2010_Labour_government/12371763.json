            "background": "The complete amount that is paid by any individual as part of the mortgage repayment should be made tax free. Thus if you pay \u00a3200 as your mortgage repayment installment (i.e \u00a32400 per year), the total income of that individual should be reduced by \u00a32400 before tax is calculated for that person. This will help give a boost to the mortgage market.\n\nAlso any banking company which charges more than 3% over Bank of England Rate should be charges a special tax of 50% on their total income from mortgages. This is help bank pass on the rate changes to the people.\n\nFollowing are examples of the rates charged by Banks within a single banking group where the Govt is a majority shareholder\n\nBank of Scotland - 4.84% Home Loan Rate\nScottish Widows - 3.99% Standard Variable Rate\nHalifax - 3.5% Standard Variable Rate\nLloyds TSB - 2.5% Standard Variable Rate\nC&G - 2.5% Standard Variable Rate\n\nThus there is a spread of almost 100% between each of them",
