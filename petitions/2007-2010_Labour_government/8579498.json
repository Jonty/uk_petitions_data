            "background": "In 1982 two hundred and fifty British servicemen gave their lives to defend the Falklands and their two-thousand British citizens. Now, twenty-six years later, our armed forces in general and Navy in particular, are a shadow of the past. This is entirely thanks to the short-sightedness and cowardice of successive governments, who were more concerned with civil-service pensions and their own salaries than with investing in the defence of sovereign British territory. Mr. Brown, it is time to act.",
