Everyone else gets there's a bank holiday so why do the English have to suffer?\n\nWe should be entitled to have our day to celebrate our beloved England, get happy, proudly put up our flag and sing God Save The Queen!\n\nI think it should become a HUGE event! All cities and towns should celebrate.\n\nEngland have alot to be proud of, so why don't we show it! Give us our bank holiday so we can truly appreciate St George. \n\n\nWinston Churchill wrote:\n\"There is a forgotten, nay almost forbidden word,\nwhich means more to me than any other.\nThat word is ENGLAND.\"",
