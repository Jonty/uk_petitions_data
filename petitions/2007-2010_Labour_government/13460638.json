How many more need to die before the Government has the courage to ban such guns?\n\nAnd that is ignoring the number of serious injuries every year and the number of crimes carried out using these weapons.\n\nA Firearms licence would cover such circumstances as justify exceptions, for example licensed clubs and farmers but surely it is time to end common usage of air guns. \n\nIt seems the Scottish Administration has the courage - what about England and Wales?",
