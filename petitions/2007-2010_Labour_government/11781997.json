        "background": "Many convicts don't even go to prison for long enough. Really seven years is not long enough. I belive that after their sentence, they should have to participate in compulsary military service. This would be a great way to boost infantry numbers in the British Army. At present the British Army is approximatley 1200 soldiers short. These young convicts would be the ideal candidates for the jobs. Anyway they seem to like playing with weapons, so here they will have great fun.",
