What is needed is for the 11 Million Pensioners to have representation under one roof and in the House of Commons. Already established and recognized by government, are the TGWU Retirement Members Association, who already have an established Political Liaison Officer William Jupp, this in my considered opinion, is the only road forward, to have a Voice and Seat in the House of Commons, as if left up to our MP's, matters will continue to Stagnate Indefinitely.\nShould you wish to contact the Retirement Members' Association, e-mail address for William Jupp  william.jupp@ntlworld.com",
