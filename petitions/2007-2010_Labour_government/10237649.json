        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I Find the Hunting act 2004 unjustified for a million and one reasons,and believe this act was passed with no real evidence to back it up.I have read various articles in numerous magazines about people shooting large amounts of foxes in one night,A whole pack of fox hounds wouldnt take some of these numbers in a year,never mind a night.Dont get me wrong I have nothing against shooting and believe that has a firm place in Society but the hounds also had that important place until the ban.Hunting with hounds is a easy and effective way to weedle out the old/ill/injured foxes, giving the strong healthy population a chance to thrive.",
