By cutting the paperwork that keeps police tied to their desks, we can return them to the streets of the UK.  Any 'token' presence they have now is not enough.  \nBy ensuring that there is a consistent presence, we believe there will be an improved relationship between the public and the police, and the benefits from this will result in lower crime levels, and just possibly help to keep less scrupulous individuals roaming the streets under check.  \nAdditionally, having a police presence really adds a good deal to the community spirit as it provides the public with the chance to communicate with someone in a position of responsibility directly, rather than going through bureacratic channels which can be daunting to some people.\nSo lets bring our bobbies back!",
