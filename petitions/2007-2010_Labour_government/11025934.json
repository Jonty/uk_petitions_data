            "background": "In recent weeks it has emerged that media coverage of a story resulted in many people making complaints about a radio show that the vast majority hadn't even tuned in to.  As a result the programme in question was axed.  As the story unfolded it would seem that with the media manipulation it was taken out of all perspective.  Now, those listeners who tuned in every week were denied their choice of how TV licence money was spent.\nA support group was set up on a social networking site to match the number of complaints, which it did and more.  But,the authorities have chosen not to recognise this public opinion and have dismissed the group as misguided youths. I would like to see more respect for the online community and the numbers of people who set up support groups, these numbers should be taken into consideration for reporting procedures.",
