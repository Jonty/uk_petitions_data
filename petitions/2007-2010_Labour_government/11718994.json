            "background": "It was announced today, Thursday 5th Febaury, that a further \u00a3100million will be spent on the London 2012 Olympics.\nThe country is in a state of recession, Post Offices, Schools, Hospitals, small businesses and even larger corperate companies are all being closed. Jobs have been lost, unemployment is rising. Surely with this state of affairs, money should not be wasted on an unnecessay and extravagant Olympic stadium. We, the undersigned, demand the money should be invested in businesses and used to help struggling families by way of benefits and tax credits.\nThank you",
