            "background": "Reflecting upon the difficulties which we are having in persuading banks to act in a socially responsible manner I do think that it might be time to wipe the dust off the Bullock Committee Report on Industrial Democracy which was published in 1978\n \nThis recommended the appointment of worker directors to the Board of their own companies These directors were to be elected by their fellow workers.It followed the German system of Co-Determination which was imposed by the Allies after the Second World War and which was extended to all companies in 1974\n \nThis system has been very successful in two respects important to us at this time\n \nFirstly,it made directors and workers cooperate in the running of companies for socially responsible aims and not just for maximum profit\n \nSecondly,it helped curb directors'salaries and bonuses.Worker directors were required to be paid at their normal shop floor rate\n\nSurely this idea's time has arrived",
