Anyone should be able to recycle, reuse and enhance government web offerings very easily. And government websites need to facilitate this. Charging the public to reuse something for which they have already paid with their taxes is not very good.\n\nTechnology today allows web based services and data to be reused very simply. Government developers do not necessarily know all possible uses for data. Many private citizens, volunteers and commercial organisations can build and add value if they can get access to the data.",
