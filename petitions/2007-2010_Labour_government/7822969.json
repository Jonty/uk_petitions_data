If my local post office were to close I would be considerably disadvantaged as I am 86 and have motor neurone disease and unable to drive like so many elderly without a car. Taking away the traditional business of these Post offices will make their figures look bad as with any business. Awarding the TV Licence business to a private concern means they are making a handsome profit the P.O. might have had.Please consider  the over all picture and call a halt to these closures which are so wrong.",
