However the vast majority of small business people have no idea how to go about positioning themselves in order to qualify and benefit from such support. There needs to be clear and widely publicized access points along with the guidance necessary to receive such support where it is available. We petition the Prime Minister to act on this as a matter of absolute urgency if small businesses are to survive this dire economic downturn.",
