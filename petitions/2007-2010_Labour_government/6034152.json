        "background": "I understand from my paper that these types of accidents, far from decreasing, are actually becoming more prevalent; and that most employers just get a slap on the wrist in punishment.  I also understand that many accidents take place because there are too few Health and Safety inspectors to order employers to take the action needed to prevent these accidents.  Most people go to work because they HAVE TO, because it's the only way they can acquire money to pay for things like food, rent/mortgage, etc., and a lot find these jobs unpleasant in one way or another.  Surely the LEAST they can expect is that they will be safe there!",
