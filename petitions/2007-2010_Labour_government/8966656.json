            "background": "By fitting solar panels to the top surface of all motorway sign gantries and fitting small wind generators as well it should be possible for each gantry to produce electricity at a rate of 1kWh minimum during daylight hours.  This energy could be used to help power motorway lighting at night and help reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nSuggest that the M1 widening project is used as a pilot project for this scheme as this should minimise the added cost of implementation.",
