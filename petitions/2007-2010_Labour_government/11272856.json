            "background": "At this time in the global economic crisis, the exchange rate of the pound has fallen considerably and a conversion to the Euro at this time will stop the Pound from falling and help save the British Economy.\nAsk the CEB to accept the sterling as valid currency in countries that trade the Euro with a rate of 1:1 and that British Businesses and Banks accept the Euro and \u00a3 Stering as equal with no conversion rates or charges.\nThis would then strengthen the British & European economy.",
