            "background": "the lack of regulation on clampers enables these firms to charge extortionate amounts of money to release a vehicle, the charges aren't fair as the company should only be compensated for loss of business, this industry should be outlawed as is the case in scotland. Banning clamping is the only way to put an end to \"legal extortion\" in any other walk of life extortion carries a heavy penalty through the justice system so why should these firms be allowed to get away with it?",
