This is nonsense!! When a genuine application is made there should be nothing to hide and most of us here in the real world have MORTGAGES and I suspect they are nearly all of them more than the \u00a387.00 approx ESTIMATED weekly outgoings the Government allows for our weekly cost of living. Heavens if it were that cheap then I would like to go and live on that planet too!! The other alternative is to give up our homes because we can no longer manage with the facilities in our current one, and live in an adapted Council House. How much would that cost the Goverment each week I wonder...could it be more than \u00a387.00??????????????????",
