            "background": "For 800 years Magna Carta of 1215  has given commoners the right to gather deadwood, known as \"estwood\" from forests and woods to use for fuel, repairing their houses and making tools. The Forestry Commission have until now issued licences to anyone who wanted to gather such firewood. Recently however, the Commission in Wales have announced that they will no longer be issuing licences to individuals, whilst continuing to do so to commercial organisations. They have claimed health & safety concerns. It is likely that this change will be extended nationally. Such a change represents an erosion of a centuries old right in the name of health & safety, which impacts economically on many low income rural families. It will also have the effect of criminalising anyone who continues to collect firewood. If the FC are allowed to take this step it will certainly be followed by other authorities who manage woodland.",
