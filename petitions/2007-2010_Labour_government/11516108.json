        "background": "as there is currently no minimum wage for apprentices in the UK, many businesses are paying youngsters shockingly low wages (in some cases no more than \u00a31 per hour). I petition the government to introduce a minimum wage for apprentices, regardless of age or trade, not only to stop them being taken advantage of as cheap labour, but also to attract more teenagers leaving school in to getting a full-time job.",
