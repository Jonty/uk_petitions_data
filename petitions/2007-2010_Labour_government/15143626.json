This affects the carer in all aspects of their future career, mental & physical health and is unacceptable in a caring democratic society. All children must be allowed a normal healthy upbringing. It is the crown's responsibility to ensure the parents / relatives are properly cared for. The child must also feel safe to be able to ask for professional help without threat of removal from the family home.",
