            "background": "we the undersigned think it the prime minister should abandon the idea of a tax on broadband users. we are paying far too much tax as it is. this tax will be about as popular as the pole tax was. we are taxed heavily on fuel, vat, earnings, food, tv licence and much more. we are in the middle of deepest reccesion the world has ever seen and this government wants to tax us even more than we have ever been? if the idea is to help get the country out of the reccesion then surely the way to do that is to let us keep our money so that we have enough to buy the things we need, not tax us into oblivian. mr brown expects us to make sacrifices, lets see him make some. put your [our] money where your mouth is mr brown.",
