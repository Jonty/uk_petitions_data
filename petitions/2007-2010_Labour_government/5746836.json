I would like to make the choice and would like to know what is in the food. There are labels for the amount of calcium, Salt etc. why not where my meat has come from and the conditions which it has grown up in. \nI am sure if people could see they could make the choice and maybe stop anything other than cruelly treated birds being used in this way and maybe other animals aswell",
