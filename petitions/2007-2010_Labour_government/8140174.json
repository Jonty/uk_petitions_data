        "background": "We would like to see a price cut on petrol prices and the only way this is going to happen is if the government cuts down on petrol taxes. The government should reduce the taxes from the current 65p per liter to something around 20p per liter. You are running this country on taxes and you already charge taxes on everything, the only thing tax free in this country is OXYGEN. If you could you would even place tax on that aswell.  We kindly request that you reduce the taxes on petrol prices or we will be forced to boycott major pumps such as Esso, BP, Total and Shell, as these are he pumps you earn the most taxes from. If we do decide to boycott major pumps your economy will suffer and UK might even go into inflaion.",
