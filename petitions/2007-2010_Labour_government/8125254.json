        "background": "To quote a recent \"Government Response\":\n\n\"Legalising cannabis (to whatever extent and for whatever purpose) would run counter to the Government's health and education messages. The message to all - and to young people in particular - is that all controlled drugs, including cannabis, are harmful and no one should take them. To legalise the possession of cannabis for personal consumption would send the wrong message to the majority of young people who do not take drugs on a regular basis, if at all, with the potential risk of increased drug use and abuse.\"\n\nWhy don't the Government compare the use of Cannabis amongst Dutch teens to that of UK teens. It is substantially lower.\n\nAs well as this, \"no one should take them\". It has been proven that THC is beneficial for sufferers of MS.\n\nWhat kind of misinformed Government are we being subjected to anyway?\n\nProhibition has been proven not to work time and time again. Why do people assume this is the best way of tackling the problem of drug abuse?",
