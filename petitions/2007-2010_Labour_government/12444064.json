            "background": "There is similarity between the events that happened in Germany, the push for the National ID Cards, and the storing of biometric data of each individual. All of the \"alleged\" bombers traveled using their own ID, therefore the National ID Cards are rendered ineffective just on that count alone. This type of apparent security is not secure, and is yet another invasion into the privacy of the people, who are already under constant surveillance. Could it be guaranteed that there is no link between the National ID Cards, the talk of sustainable development and the Eugenics Agenda of the Georgia Guidestones of limiting the population to 500,000,000? This petition is to scrap the National ID Card.",
