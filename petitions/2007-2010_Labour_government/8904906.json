            "background": "Prices of insurance, car tax and the driving test for young people, is too high! It is becoming pretty much impossible for a student or young person, on a low wage to afford to drive. Most of all car insurance needs to be lowered, or a realistic maximum to be set on insurance premiums. Driving test resists should be cheaper than the first, and finally car tax should be lowered or not be raised anymore, which would help all drivers.",
