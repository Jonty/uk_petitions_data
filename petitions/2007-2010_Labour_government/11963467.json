Sheffield city centre, an unusual heaven of Victorian architecture is being threatened by the Sevenstone project. The project plans on demolishing beautiful Victorian, destroy streets and transform the layout and landscape of a substantial portion of the Sheffield city centre, recreating Britain's sad seventies architecture and the transformation of a \"natural\" city centre into an open air American style mall. Sheffield is a fount of beautiful buildings, town hall, Salvation Army Citadel, Pinstone Street, Burgess Street, Cambridge Street, Division Street, Carver Street amongst other threatened by this project.\nIf you wish Sheffield and British cities to retain their identities, sign below.",
