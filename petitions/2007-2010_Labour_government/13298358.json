            "background": "The Hunting Act 2004 outlawed hare coursing in England and Wales. It appears that hare coursing enthusiasts have been attempting to test the law. (Ms. Clarissa Dickson Wright, from Midlothian, Scotland, and Sir Mark Prescott, Bart., of Heath House, Newmarket, are reported to have admitted attending one hare coursing event on March the 2nd, 2007, near Nunnington, North Yorkshire, and another the following day near Amotherby, also in North Yorkshire). MPs of all parties are known to 'dislike hare coursing intensely' but it is feared that there might be moves in the future to undo the Hunting Act 2004 so far as it affects hare coursing. We the undersigned therefore petition the Prime Minister and/or his successor to do all in their power to resist such moves.",
