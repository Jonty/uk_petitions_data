        "background": "The Royal Mail postal service is lacking quality in many areas of its business. I personally have had many dealings with them that were - needless to say - unpleasant. Ranging from money thefts from childrens birthday cards, to post just never being received, and extortionate prices for anything and everything. We - the people of the United Kingdom- deserve a much improved postal service that actually prides itself in efficient, speedy , well priced services.",
