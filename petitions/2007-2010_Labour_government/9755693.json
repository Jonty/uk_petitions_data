        "background": "In 2003, Somerton was listed as one of 25 UK sites that breached government health limits on smog levels. With a growing population, many of whom are commuters, we urge the Prime Minister to encourage Railtrack and the rail networks to examine the possibility of Somerton station being reopened as a request stop (in the first instance). If successful after a trial period the station could then be developed further to offer a faster alternative to local bus services and to open the area up to national travel.",
