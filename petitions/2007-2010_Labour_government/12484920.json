            "background": "HIPs must be in place before a house can go on the market. In the past a great number of people would 'test the water' by putting their house on the market speculatively. If the response was good, they would then look for a new property. By putting the burden of a \u00a3400 HIP on folk, they no longer take this approach and this has resulted in a dramatic slump of the housing market. \n\nAs the HIP is of minimal use to the purchaser (e.g. local authority searches are only relevant on the day they are carried out, not up to twelve months later) their removal will have no adverse effect.",
