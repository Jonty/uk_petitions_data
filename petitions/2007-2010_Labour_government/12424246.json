            "background": "Successive governments have steadily eroded the rights of citizens to live their lives in peace and in private and protest against injustices of all kinds. Government measures are in progress to introduce UK identity cards, monitor all overseas travel, emails and telephone traffic and retain DNA samples of inoocent people. This will bring Britain on a par with some of the worst and most repressive regimes around the world. Vote to stop this extension of the UK Police State.",
