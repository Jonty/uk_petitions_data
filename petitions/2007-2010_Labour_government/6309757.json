            "background": "Please stop the highways authorities from erecting the new signs around the country that have recently appeared on the A/45 in Warwickshire and I have recently observed on the A/50 around Stoke-on-Trent.\nThese signs are the same as the ones that appear on our Motorways, they have been sighted every 100 Metres apart, then every Kilometre there is a larger numbered sign.\nWhen I enquired from Ruth Kelly the Transport Minister the reason for the waste of money on these signs I received no reply from her office but was fobbed off to the highways authority at Birmingham.\nMy main argument about the erection of more road signs is that no local authority has the money or inclination to send men out with strimmers to walk along the A/45 or any other roads for that matter cutting the grass in order for the signs to be visible, they have already disappeared into the undergrowth on the A/45",
