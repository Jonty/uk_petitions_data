            "background": "Wales and rugby football has truly lost one of its greats. Ray Gravell epitomised the spirit of Wales and the meaning of Welshness. He had represented his country in its favourite sport, he was a proud advocate of its culture, he had only friends. His loss is felt most of all by his family but also by those in Wales and the rest of the world who respected his rugby, broadcasting and acting skills as well as his outgoing generous character. He should and will not be forgotten.\nTrophies for international competition should be named in honour of individuals who mean something to to the citizens of the competing countries. It is far more fitting for a Cup presented to the winner of Wales v South Africa rugby test match to be named after a deserving and respected individual such as Ray Gravell.",
