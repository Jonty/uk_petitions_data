            "background": "In 2005 the Secretary of State, John Reid ordered all NHS hospitals to provide infertile couples between 23-39 with at least one round of FREE IVF treatment.  This was then backed up with a pledge by Tony Blair to end the postcode lottery, to make this fertility treatment readily available in the UK. \nNow nearly three years on, 1 in 6 couples are infertile. Many having exhausted all fertility treatments provided by the NHS,are being denied what could be their last chance to concieve by IVF methods.",
