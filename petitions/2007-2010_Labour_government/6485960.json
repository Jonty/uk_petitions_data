        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present, anyone who is involved in a road traffic accident (whether liable or not) is subject to an update in driving skills course, provided by the local constabulary which (in my personal experience is quite satisfactory). The idea, of course, in the interest of public safety - fair enough - and is most useful in boosting confidence. However, the cost (\u00a3168) whilst arguably serving as a penalty - should be met by insurers, or the guilty party, since it is prohibitive to the attendance. I was involved in an RTA and found myself subject to this expense, as well as being penalised by insurers and the other party - though not my fault and working for the local authorities - what role does the UK judiciary have in supervising this and the exchequer in reimbursing public sector workers ? Does the UK govt care about justice ?",
