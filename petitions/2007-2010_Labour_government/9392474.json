            "background": "Recognition should be given to those personnel deployed in areas adjacent to combat zones who are supporting active operations but who not qualify for a campaign medal. The General Service Medal, discontinued in 1999 (with the exception of still being awarded for service in Northern Ireland) would be ideal for this occasion and would not necessitate the creation of a new medal. Personnel, both regular and reserve, should be recognised for the valuable  contribution they make to operations, and for the fact that they are deployed far from home for long periods of time in some inhospitable, and often unsafe, locations.",
