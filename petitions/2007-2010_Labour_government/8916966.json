        "background": "this is an obscene trade. halfway round the world in china, live turtles are killed to order, their heads chopped off while they are fully conscious. their slow metabolism means that the head can live for an hour after. they are then taken home by the customer to be gutted and boiled alive. this is barbaric butchery to an animal that is defenceless and ripped from its natural environment. please sign this petition to help put a stop to this cruelty.",
