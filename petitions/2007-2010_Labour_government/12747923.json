As a recent victim of bicycle theft, I know how useless the police are when it comes to tracking down your stolen bicycle. Surely they should be a database of bicycle serial numbers that can be updated by shops when some one purchases a bicycle and checked by people who are buying the bicycle to see if it is stolen or not. This would help surely help the police and cut down on insurance claims.",
