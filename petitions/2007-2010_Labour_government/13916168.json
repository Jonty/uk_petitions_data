            "background": "I being a radical thinker and an enemployed bricklayer have like many people been hit hard by the economic downturn. I take a keen interest in politicts and think it is time for the UK to lead the world, by being brave and trusting the peolple of this great nation. It would take great leadership and courage, but it can be done. If MR Brown was to lower tax surley it would leave a hole in revenue in the short term, but look long term and this would, increase the amount of spending and saving power that people would have, which would in turn make more money available for banks to lend to buisness and homebuyers, also with people more confident to spend that would create more jobs. Which would mean the government would not be paying out on unemployment benifits but gaining by earning on tax, n.i and vat , thus the wheels would turn again in the right direction. This could only be done by the government trusting the people an awful lot of trust has been given to the bankers with our money, i think its time to see what we can do with our money.",
