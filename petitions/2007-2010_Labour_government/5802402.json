            "background": "As there is already a petition about the EU Amending Treaty referendum, I would now like to petition the Cabinet to do this: cease to lie about the EU. It's not just the Amending Treaty which is the Euroconstitution in all but name (as Ahern and Zapatero admitted that it's 99% the same as the original Euroconstitution) and which has crossed 2 red lines. (the difference is that it's not CALLED the Euroconstitution... which is the ONLY difference). The EU is NOT the world's largest Common Market, China is (and India is the 2nd biggest). China's population is quickly increasing, Europe's is steadily shrinking. China's GDP is growing faster than the EU's, so the claim that our Nation will be best served by integration with a failing regional organisation is mistaken and everyone knows that, so please stop lying.",
