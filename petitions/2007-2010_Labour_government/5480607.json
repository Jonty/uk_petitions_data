        "action": "change the Family Law in the United Kingdom to allow an adoption order to be reversed in cases that the order were proven unsafe on appeal",

        "background": "Recent media reports about the case about Nicky and Mark Webster have shown that miscarriages of justice do not just affect a person who has been wrongfully ordered to spend time in prison. It also affects parents of a child or children who have been removed from their parents and then forcibly put up for adoption on evidence that was later to be proven unsafe. Whilst legally the parents have been vindicated, the adoption laws do not allow for miscarriages of justice to reverse these decisions and prevent a family from being reunited. Please sign this petition to turn a wrong into a right.",
