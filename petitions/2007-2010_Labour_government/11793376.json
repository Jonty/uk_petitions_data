            "background": "June Alexis(dr),former english teacher at greig acadamy was removed from her post as head teacher at her recent school (jls) because of a trivial matter which stinks of racism towards her. All of the teachers, parents and pupils are 100% behind her, and this was all down to none other than SHARON SHOESMITH who was responsible for the handling of the baby p case, and who has led a personal vendetta against mrs alexis. Anybody who was taught by mrs alexis knows that she was a decent honest teacher who was damn good at her job. This has been kept quiet,but not anymore. Lets get her back where she belongs,making a difference to kids,like she did to me.",
