            "background": "Removing the cap on tuition fees will mean education becoming a market where students become consumers. Students will have to choose a university and course based on what they can afford rather on what they want to study or the grades they achieve. Student debt will be much worse than it is now for those that take out loans.\n\nStudents are already being put off going to university because of the thought of debt and lack of money, the increase in fees will make the situation much worse and will cause an even bigger social divide between \u2018rich\u2019 and \u2018poor\u2019.",
