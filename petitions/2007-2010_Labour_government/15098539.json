            "background": "Why on earth does this country waste money fighting prostitution in illegal brothels and waste thousands if not millions of tax payers money on hunting down drug traffickers when we can emulate what they do in Amsterdam? , I don't know the stats on rape, drug abuse, drug trafficking in Amsterdam but I can pretty much guarantee they are nowhere near as bad as here in the UK.\n\nIf a person wants to take drugs they will which fuels the drug trade, if a few licenced bars sell the real thing and it's regulated like in amsterdam then it will be a lot safer for that person aswell because they know exactly what it is they are purchasing, I know if I wanted to buy Ecstasy for example I would rather buy it from a licenced establishment so I know it's actually Ecstacy and not mixed with say DDT.\n\nAlso if a person wants to have sex without the strugle of finding someone that particular night they know they can without risking loosing there job, also for the girl they know they are protected properly instead of being bullied/battered by a pimp and take the risk of STD's every night.\n\nPlease people don't let me be the only brit with a touch of common sence.",
