            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To be known as the Bunny Chow Long Weekend, it's got three aims: \n\n1. To emphasise the contribution that South Africans have given, and continue to give, for Britain\n\n2. To remind people of friends and family back home in South Africa; \n\n3. To break that long period after New Years when there are currently no long weekends, especially as the UK has fewer public holidays than most European Countries.\n\nIf you agree to the idea, please sign up to the petition - it doesn't take long - and it would be great if you were to forward the link to other people as well. If you are not interested, just hit the delete key. This is not just about another bank holiday, but more importantly about having a designated day to remember friends and eat some Bunny Chow.",
