            "background": "The school run seems to conjour an amount of parents who seem to think it is safe to park their cars along main roads and dual carriageways to drop off their kids.  They will park there for in excess of half an hour to ensure that they get a space on the busy road.  As one example take Eastern Avenue road in Lichfield this is a secondary school on a busy carriageway.  Parents park, even though there is no parking, open the car doors without looking at on-coming traffic and make it dangerous for children who can walk home to cross the road.  It is the same in many places across the UK.",
