However the policy was wide sweeping and does not appear to consider cars that hold more than the short term financial benefit of the Scrappage scheme. Clubs and the Classic Car Media are noting with disbelief cars of Heritage being traded in and then scrapped. \n\nThe government needs to reconsider the policy and remove Scrappage payments for cars that are part of the British Heritage.",
