            "background": "I understand that the board of governors of this Bank wishes to make bonuses to its staff inorder to retain ' the best staff'. I see no reason why staff of a bank which has made such losses should be allowed to receive any bonuses when the bank has made such losses. It has had to borrow huge sums of money from the government and the majority of its shares are now publicly owned. I can see no reason why public money should be used to provide such payments to its staff. In the current economic climate they should be grateful that they still have a job at all. As an owner of shares in this bank I would vote (given the opportunity) for no bonuses at all until the Bank can show that it is once again in a financially stable position. I would assume that, as the majority shareholder, the government would hold a similar view.",
