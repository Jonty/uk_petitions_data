            "background": "We the people are sick and tired of allowing government to steal up to 3% of the value of our money by allowing inflation, which means over 30 years we could lose upto 90% of the value of our money so \u00a31 would be worth as little as 10p in the shops and so an item which we can buy for 10p today would cost us \u00a31.We the people feel it is not for the government to steal money in this way but to lead by example and to show that theft of anykind is wrong.We feel the only way to safe guard against this crime is to have a competing currency with the pound.This currency will be backed by gold and will be legal tender.this currency will be a safe way for people to protect there savings in times of hyper inflation and as the government starts its quantative easing programs.In having this currency we will not be alone in the world as even today in the USA the head of the monetary commitee Dr Ron Paul who is a congressmen and former presidential candidate is asking for a competing currency and to date has introduced a bill in congress.we the people demand that we are given this second currency and should you fail us and continue to steal from us we will ellect new representatives who will give us what we want.",
