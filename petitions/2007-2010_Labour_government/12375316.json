            "background": "To allow for an increased speed limit from 70mph to 85mph as most people drive over 70mph so the law seems very backward. Also we as a nation have less accidents on our roads than most other countries...and as we are c urrently looking at speed limits in our cities this would be a good time to look at our motorways as well. Justifaction is new cars are equipped with ABS Brakes....have better handling and are getting better with c02 emisions and new technology surely the speed limit which was set in the 1960's need s to be looked at again when cars were much slower to brake and were less powerful",
