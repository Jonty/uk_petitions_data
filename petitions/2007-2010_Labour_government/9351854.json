            "background": "It is the usual rule of thumb in business and reality to downsize and save on finances when companies are in trouble and yet the government stays the same size and local governments throng with surplus bodies, yet there is not enough money to go round.  Still they stay in their well paid underworked well pensioned practically part-time jobs where it takes more than one person to complete one simple task such is the science made of bureaucracy whereas really they are safeguarding their jobs by ensuring it takes so long to complete.  Isn't it time to drop politicians, and civil servants draining this country of its resources to a more manageable and appropriate few?  Otherwise they are surplus to our requirements.  We want more of our pay in our pay packets to spend in our own lives not for this overrun parliament/government who waste our money by the score with their incompetent initiatives and attractive salaries and perks sucking us dry and propping up their lives with our money.  What do these people actually do, they can't be very effective as nothing changes for the better.  Get rid of them.",
