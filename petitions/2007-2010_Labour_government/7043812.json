        "background": "Two Hen harriers were unmercifully shot dead on the Queen's Sandringham Estate on Friday 26th October 2007.These Birds of Prey are extremly rare and due to this killing there are now only 18 pairs in England that we know off.These birds are on the brink of becoming exstinct in England.We the members of the International Falconry Forum are disgusted that these rare and beautiful birds are being shot by the Queen's Gamekeepers in order that a few pounds more may be earned in revenue by the crown.We the tax paying public of England and Falconers worldwide demand that action be taken to the full extent of the law against the person or persons responsible for this attrocious action.Her Majesty the Queen being the land owner, is ultimatly responsible for the actions of her staff and the laws applying to the protection of wild birds of prey apply to the crown and the public alike.Let justice be seen to be done, not just in this instance but whenever these beautiful birds that are protected by English law are killed through some people's inane and murderous actions.Life before profit.",
