            "background": "Within the last decade or two, we have heard homeowners being charged for a range of crimes from manslaughter, murder, assault, and GBH. Meanwhile the squatter, trespasser, or burglar has been compensated because they suffered an injury on a premises they have no right to be on the property (Occupiers Liability Act 1984). Surely, the law should protect those who ABIDE by it, and not those that break it; those who break the law should not be covered, and home owners, regardless of their actions, should not be prosecuted or charged.",
