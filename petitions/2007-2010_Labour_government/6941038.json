        "background": "Gordon Brown was quick to label Burma's military government as repressive, illegal, and undemocratic.  He's right, but perhaps he forgot that the continued existence of the regime in Burma is due another repressive, illegal and undemocratic military government; the government of the People's Republic of China, based in Beijing, which ceased power from the legitimate Kuomintang government through a military coup by the communist Red Army.\n\nTime and time again, Beijing's illegal administration has supported the most terrible abuses of human rights both domestically and overseas; using power of veto, propaganda and active campaigning to protect those engaged in such activities.\n\nWe call upon the government to do all that is possible to encourage the worldwide cessation of recognition to Beijing in favour of the legal, democratic and non-repressive government of the Republic of China, based in Taipei; and to institute all possible forms of sanctions and trade embargoes until the military-backed government is disbanded in favour of the government of the Republic of China in Taipei and full democracy.",
