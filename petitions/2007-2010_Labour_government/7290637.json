            "background": "There are approximately 3,500 people killed on the UK roads each year - that's equivalent to 10 people per day, 70 people per week or 300 per month.\n\nIf a jumbo jet carrying 300 people crashed every month, the aircraft would be grounded and a solution instantly sought - but the same number being killed on the roads is given little attention.\n\nWe need to react quicker and make changes on a more urgent timeline. Road deaths are akin to an epidemic without control, and we need more people focused on reducing this statistic.\n\nWe need support, and initially require the leader of our country to initiate immediate focus before somebody close to you is the next victim.",
