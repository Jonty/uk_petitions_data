        "background": "The revelation that images of cars captured on road-side cameras, and \"personal data\" derived from them, including number plates, can be sent overseas shows that once again the government is willing to throw away our civil liberties while hiding behind a flimsy \"anti-terrorism\" excuse. \n\nThe fact that this system has been set up to enable the transfer of data about non-criminal private activities is a disgrace, and the assurance from the home office that \"robust controls have been put in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, the information.\" carries no weight in the context of the home secretary's choice to hide this policy, especially her neglect in not mentioning it her statement to Parliament on July 17, 2007 (detailing the exemptions for police from the 1998 Data Protection Act). Needless to say the governmental tendency to lose sensitive data also undermines their case in this matter. \n\nWe call on the prime minister to immediately end this policy and ensure that such data is transferred to foreign governments only in the case of an investigation where charges have been publicly brought against the individual in question.",
