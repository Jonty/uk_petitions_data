As highlighted in Baby P's case, clothing and 'chocolate' can hide a multitude of sins.  Children old enough to speak for themselves may be too afraid to do so.  \n\nIf this was implemented, abusive carers would soon understand that it won't be so easy to hoodwink social workers or to hide signs of physical abuse.",
