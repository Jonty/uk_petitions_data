            "background": "Mr Brown, can you commit to fixing the following problems:\n- Theover 60s get winter fuel payments not matter how rich they are but a terminally ill 59 year old does not - fuel duty in the UK is amongst the highest in the world yet it is regressive and never ever comes down, even when the price is \u00a31.20 a litre - the banks we bailed out won't lend to the public yet are allowed to bankroll the takeover of British companies by American ones (e.g. Kraft & Cadburys) - - Millions are spent on promoting healthy living (e.g. quit smoking adverts, vouchers for pregnant women, etc) yet there are fast food restaurants in our hospitals\n- MS, Alzheimers, Parkinson's and Dementia sufferers who were unfortunate enough not have life insurance live miserable lives supported by forgotten carers, (or waste away in decrepit care homes)\n- Meanwhile MPs actually thought it was OK to claim money for toilet seats, duck houses, moats etc. Mr Brown, please explain why the above are allowed to take place.",
