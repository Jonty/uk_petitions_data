        "action": "Take action against Halifax plc, to ensure that they do not enforce unfair mortgage conditions",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Halifax plc is the UK\u2019s largest mortgage lender.  Its mortgage conditions include a statement that it reserves the right not to pass on interest rate cuts to its standard variable rate or tracker mortgage customers if the Bank of England base rate falls below 3.00%.  \n\nHalifax also reserves the right to revert to reprice its tracker margins - and therefore increase the rate borrowers pay.  \n\nFor example, if a tracker mortgage borrower pays Bank of England base rate plus 1.00%, and the base rate is 3.00%, then their pay rate will be 4.00%.  If the base rate falls to 2.00% then Halifax does not have to pass on this 1.00% saving, meaning the borrower continues to pay 4.00%.",
