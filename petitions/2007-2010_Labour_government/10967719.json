        "action": "Introduce legislation to reduce road delays by charging utilities and other agencies realistic hourly fees for blocking roads or disrupting traffic.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The roads in UK are very congested but utilities and other authorised agencies are far too complacent about the disruption caused to traffic flow due to road works and other activities. Road blockages cause more accidents to vehicles and pedestrians, wasted work time, increased fuel consumption and greater global warming.\nSome blockage is unavoidable but new technology, better scheduling and greater urgency needs to be encouraged by strong financial incentives. \nWhile it is true that fees would end up being passed on to the public, they would still provide that incentive and would, anyway, return to the national or local exchequer.\nCurrently roads are often closed when no one is working, different utilities make little attempt to coordinate activities and our police take more than twice as long to investigate motorway accidents as their US counterparts. \nUnnecessary road blockages add to congestion and cost the country dearly. We cannot afford such wastage.",
