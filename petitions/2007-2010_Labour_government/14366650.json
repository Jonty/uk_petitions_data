            "background": "dear prime minister,Please will you help more people get back to work. If you was to continue help for parents who return to work receive a low wage, and have a mortgage I think that this would encourage people to work which would put more money being spent in the shops and more money in the economy.The government will pay over a thousand pound a month for someones rent when they return to work and are on benefits and not a home owner, would it not help the government and the public for them to continue to help low earning families who are home owners have a mortgage, work and receive a low wage. continue support for people who earn under 25,000 and pay a mortgage more people would return to work, especially parents.all this money putting into training and education if parents where working then they would be able to help there children more.help needs to be given to the people who have already been educated, and need to work. This help would be very beneficial not just for the families who return to work but for the Labour Party to win the next election.this application will not only help the housing situation but also the employment situation.",
