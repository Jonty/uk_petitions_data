            "background": "Our legal system already recognises that indulging in certain unnatural abuses of the body for \"Pleasure\" is unacceptable on the grounds of indecency - irrespective of the actual degree of physical or psychological harm one might be caused by them. To see a person violating their body in such an unnatural way as nicotine inhalation for \"pleasure\" is just as morally sickening as any form of legally recognised indecency, and also serves to propagate the industry through peer pressure. And some 17,000 children under 5 are hospitalised every year as a result of their own parents smoking at home - a record of child abuse we all contribute to by allowing this ugly substance abuse to legally continue.",
