            "background": "Reassigning the A4 its rightful trunk status will place the road under the control of the Highways Agency, which - crucially - will become responsible for its gritting. Wiltshire County Council has abjectly failed to maintain the condition of the county's road network during the first week of February 2009, rendering it - in stark contrast to clear stretches of the same roads in neighbouring counties - a deathtrap.  The importance of the A4 as a western artery from London means that neither it, nor the safety of its users, should be left at the mercy of a county council whose priorities clearly lie elsewhere.",
