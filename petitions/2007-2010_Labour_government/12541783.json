        "background": "The pre-budget statement this year contained a sinister proposal to privatise a number of Government Agencies including the Land Registry. \n\nThe Land Registry is a vital contributor towards our economy and provides a superb and efficient service to its stakeholders with a strong commitment to public service. The state guarantee of title is a key element in inward investment and public confidence. Hiving off the Registry to an outsourcing \"specialist\" will result in a dumbing down of the high service standards of the Registry and conflicts between it and the property industry over fee levels and liabilities. At the end of the day, the Registry is a quasi-judicial body and must remain accountable to the public.",
