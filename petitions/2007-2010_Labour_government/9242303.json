            "background": "Drought responses rely heavily on food aid, but more long - term effective measures, suggest ID21, the relief organisation, in their latest bulletin, maybe to look at livestock destocking, \n\nAgain, USAID is leading the way, with brilliance - and the petitioner is urging the P.M. to look at structural weaknesses (though the newsletter doesn't say what they are !) in the African marketing industry as a developmental policy. Protecting core cattle, helps families buy food but the main point of the ID21 report states that insufficient attention is paid to livelhood protection and support.",
