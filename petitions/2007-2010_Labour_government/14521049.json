In this process, the TEC was renamed to Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\nThe status quo has changed substantively within the EU for the UK. Whoever wins power in the 2010 UK General Election, will need to know what the British people want regarding the UK's future Membership of the European Union as it stands post-Lisbon Treaty. \n\nThe process starts here, thank you for your participation.",
