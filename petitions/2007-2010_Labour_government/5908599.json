        "background": "A terrible amount of suffering is inflicted on bears which are trapped inhumanely and die in much pain in Canada and whose skins are then used to make the hats worn by the Queen's Guard. This cruelty should not be suffered by any animal, least of all for the sake of a ceremonial hat. There are faux fur alterntives but the MOD is simply not giving this option enough energy - it shouldn't be optional. Through allowing these real fur hats to represent parts of our culture, Britain is - however unwillingly - advocating animal cruelty and the senseless slaughter of these beautiful bears - we ought to be preserving our planet's wildlife not sacrificing it for ceremonial garments. It is an appalling reflection on our country that bears are still killed even though there is a fake fur alternative.",
