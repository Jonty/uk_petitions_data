One supermarket in question is morrisons, i'm surprised their staff are not wrapped in the stuff. Does everything need to be wrapped in plastic? Not using so much unnecessary packaging will reduce recycling costs and stop so much rubbish going into landfills, so surely thats good for the environment!! So please put a stop to so much unnecessary packaging!!",
