        "background": "With the award of \u00a37bn contract for the new rolling stock to a Japanese company, whose economy is this government trying to recover?  Projects of this size should be awarded to Vritish Companies with a 70% buy british clause - Does the Prime Minister really think that British companies and people are going to benefit from this award.  We have a struggling rail industry in the UK and this contract is the nail in the coffin to another Great British Industry.  How much is the taxpayer really going to save after it has essentially paid for Hitachi to set up \"assembly\" plants through grants and the like plus the cost of benefits to the workers in the current rail industry who will lose their jobs.  Think again and make this contract british - REALLY BRITISH!!",
