            "background": "my petition is about the fact you would expect a mother and four children to live on \u00a349.72p. Many people are experiencing this and as a consequence are losing homes, going hungry, and living in poverty in a suppossed economically developed country. As a person who voted for you to take position as prime minister, i am truly sickened by the fact that you let good people who have no work suffer while others (your partners) take what money they wish when it can be used for better use increasing incapacity benefit. Many would say get a job but in this time of economic failure the ones you should be looking out for is the ones who need it most",
