            "background": "We the undersigned would like to see change happen to the governmental system to be able to successfully change with the times; to get in line with peoples desires. What is suggested here is to remove class struggle by promoting equality, introducing an equal wages scheme with a twist. \n\nThis scheme will give people firstly a standard wage (an equal portion of the GDP). Each employee/ employer will then have a quota to fill, indicating how much effort must be put into a job. Once this quota has been filled, a bonus will be granted with varying size relative to how much extra work is done. This may seem like overtime, but the aim is to promote work and reduce those that do nothings (out of laziness solely) income, encouraging industrial and economic growth within the system.\n\nSuch a change is to be coming closer to socialism, or Democratic Socialism",
