            "background": "Two of London's creative agencies genuinely believe that 29th Feb should belong to the people as a non-working day.  The reasons for this are; as a four-yearly quirk in the Gregorian calendar, the 29th Feb doesn't belong to anyone, it doesn\u2019t form part of our holiday entitlement, we are not paid for it and we don\u2019t have enough bank holidays in the UK.\n\nWe are building a website to encourage people to sign this petition for Freeday Friday. We plan to offer individuals & companies within the UK and potentially worldwide, the opportunity to vote and encourage you, the government, to allow us this extra day off work.  We plan to market the site and track its success.",
