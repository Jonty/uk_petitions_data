I am asking for Number 10 to consider the prosecution of those individuals who failed to prevent the murder of the beautiful boy.\n\nAfterall, if the mother, mother's boyfriend and lodger were charged and convicted of \"causing, or allowing the death of a child or vunerable person\", then I believe that these three individuals should be prosecuted on the same basis. All three (in my view) failed to prevent the murder of this child. \n\nIf a CEO in the private sector can be charged with 'Corporate Manslaughter' then these individual, who in my opinion we all criminally negligent, should be prosecuted on the same basis.\n\nThis is more than sufficiently different (in terms of rationale) to warrant a petition, in its own right.\n\nFailure to allow this petition is another insult to a young boy who has already been failed by so many people.",
