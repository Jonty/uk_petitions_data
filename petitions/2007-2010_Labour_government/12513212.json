Even with police recommendations,after a 20 month long thorough and precise investigation, which cited a prosecution against two social workers for Perjury and Perverting the course of Justice.  Because of these people` actions I lost my 10 week old baby for 6 months and my 6 yr old child forever.\nHere in N Ireland we have a Police Ombudsman, which generates great \"Public confidence\".\nA CPS Ombudsman, I`m sure, would also be beneficial, not alone for the public but also for the police in general.     \n\n     \n\nIt is a very simple measure and would generate great Public confidence in the Justice system.",
