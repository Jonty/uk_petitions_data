            "background": "It is long overdue for the Prime Minister and the Government to act against those individuals and organisations who are speculating and making millions from the price of oil. One expert said 40% of the increase in oil price was from specualtion, it is nearer 80%, and every time the oil price goes up energy and food go up. It is the ordinary people of our country who suffer. Their should immediately be an increase in the old age pension of \u00a310 a week, the bills of my fellow pensioners food bills has doubled in the last few months, and immediate increase in the fuel allowance for pensioners of \u00a3200 making it \u00a3400. In addition to these measures you have to be more radical in your thinking regarding the suffering of the British People and your solutions of those problems, for example all employed people earning below \u00a314,000 should be taken out of the tax system.\nThe people you represent petition you to urgently come to ther aid. Stop dithering, give the leadership you can deliver.",
