It is time that bicycle  users have sufficient insurances of at least third party public liability, as do all other road users, to cover any eventuality of a claim against them due to any damages they cause, as another user of our roads. Motor vehicle drivers should not have to be penalised through making a claim on their own insurances for the damages caused by bicycle users, both minor or adult.",
