            "background": "i wish to petition gorden brown to resist the pressure to amend the abortion laws making it easier for an unborn child to be killed.  I am horrified that the uk support abortion in that the unborn child is given no rights and abortion has become an acceptable form of contracecption for many young women.  i personally know of individuals who have used it so and even in situations where married couples have decided that they dont want a 3rd child because they may have to modify their extravagant lifestyle. The whole argument that women must be able to chose has become ridiculous.  this is legalised murder and we are trying to make it easier to commit.",
