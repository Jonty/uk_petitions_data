        "background": "We are seeing more and more children missing, snatched, murdered, savaged by animals, the list is endless and all because the parents were negligent in their duties. No child at primary school should be walking home alone and no child should be left in the home alone. When is the government going to toughen up and prosecute these parents for negligence. The stance usually is \"the parents are suffering enough\" when a child goes missing. I say WHAT ABOUT THE CHILD I should say they are suffering more - frightened, bewildered and wanting to go home. MAKE PARENTS TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOW - IT IS EVERY CHILDS RIGHT TO BE CARED FOR.",
