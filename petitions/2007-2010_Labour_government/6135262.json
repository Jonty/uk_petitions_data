            "background": "I am hereby petitioning for every car insurnace company in the UK to disregard Motorcycle accidents, as they have an unfair bias on the cost of the insurance.\n\nCar insurnace companies do not accept motorcyle No-Claims-Bonuses, and Years of experience on a motorcycle, so why should they accept the accidents? its a catch 22 at the minute - you cant improve your insuance be being a bike rider, but you can make it alot worse. It is un justly biased. \n\nI demand an action be taken about this! Either allow motorcycle NCB's and years experience to count on car insurnace or make car insurance companies disregard the accidents.",
