        "background": "The total ban of smoking in enclosed public spaces is unreasonable for a government that raised 8 billion in indirect tax last year for tobacco (2006/2007). Allowing a ban on patio heaters is adding insult. Either reject the ban or allow smokers access to sheltered public places by licensing some Public Houses to allow smoking.\nAlso if patio heaters are banned then will we get a refund for our garden heaters.",
