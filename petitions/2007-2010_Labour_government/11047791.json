            "background": "Too many young children are being abused and beaten and allowed to die while being seen by so called health care professionals. The care profesionals in question need to be charged with neglect and a failure of duty of care, in other professions people are charged when they fail in their duty and this impacts others, too many times since Victoria Climbie this has been allowed to happen and people have escaped without charge, Lets end this charade now and charge those responsible. If they take the money they must take the responsibility!",
