            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A \u00a3500 million+ dual-carriageway upgrade of the A64 trunk road between York and Scarborough is wanted. But this is a huge amount of money to be spent in Ryedale. It would not reduce the environmental impact of road traffic in Ryedale including the North Yorkshire Moors National Park, neither would it solve Whitby and Pickering's transport problems. Public transport would save money and the local environment.\n\nThe current rail services run once per hour and buses twice per hour. The frequencies of both should be doubled. In addition, their fares and timetables must be integrated, allowing passengers to reap the benefits of both modes in a single ticket (e.g. in a journey from York to Rillington village, use train between York and Malton; and bus from Malton to Rillington).\n\n2 extra train sets and 6 extra buses would cost \u00a310 million. More than enough money would be saved for a Malton to Whitby rail reopening, amongst unrelated projects such as building affordable housing in Ryedale.",
