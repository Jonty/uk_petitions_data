            "background": "Radio Sheffield shows a never ending bias to Sheffield clubs. \n\nThis doesn't tally with the amount of money paid to fund the BBC by the residents of Doncaster, Barnsley, Rotherham and Chesterfield. \n\nRadio Sheffield has offered Barnsley an appalling 3.5 times less money than Sheff Wed and Sheff Utd to cover their games despite them being in the same division. Barnsley will also receive much less coverage - even if they're top of the league. \n\nLet's end the bias. Vote now.",
