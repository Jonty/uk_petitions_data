            "background": "Ask for Turkey not to be allowed to join the E.U. until religious freedom is the same in the rest of the E.U. \nThe Catholic Church 'does not exist' in Turkey, parishes don't exist, with all the consequences that derive from this lack of juridical recognition, It is necessary to give this witness, showing that in the Christian world there are those who have faith, who have religious values, as opposed to the opinion that exists at times that Christianity and the West are the same thing: a corrupt West and a corrupt religion, Christianity,\" the bishop noted. It must be demonstrated that it isn't like this; the arrival of pilgrims from other parts of the world might help Turkish Catholics \"to become aware of their own identity,\" and be strengthened, given the difficulties that we are still experiencing. Christians and Jews combined make up less than 0.2% of Turkey's population of nearly 72 million. Turkey wants to be a member of the European Union, but many Church and secular leaders are asking better protection of the Christian minority before the aspiration is considered.",
