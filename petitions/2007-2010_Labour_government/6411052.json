        "background": "The town of Bracknell in Berkshire is growing at an alarming rate.  In 2001 we had a population of 109617.  We need a hospital or a large medical centre within the town, currently we have no immediate A&E centre near us and for people who have no transport it would be near impossible to reach a hospital if there was an emergency.  If those in charge are so insistant on selling land to build new homes they should be equally interested in giving us proper amenities such as a hospital and a larger police force.",
