            "background": "It should be a day to celebrate our history, values and multicultural diversity. It would not replace the saint days of England, Scotland or Wales but would be in addition to them. On this day our many communities (English, Celtic, Asian, Afro-Caribbean, African, etc) could celebrate what they have brought to this country. Either the Union Flag or the flag of St Alban could be flown on this day. It is near midsummers day so it would be a good day for a new national holiday. Some national events (i.e. Trooping the Colour) could be moved to this day to help us celebrate. St Alban was the first christian martyr in Britain and this makes him an appropriate figure to remember.",
