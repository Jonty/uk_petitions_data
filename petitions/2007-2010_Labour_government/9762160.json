            "background": "compensation to be paid to the owners of cars purchased after 2001 that will now be included in the new road tax increases,as they will be devalued to the extent that they will be virtually worthless,and people will not be able to replace them with a more efficient car due to the fact that nobody will want to buy it and will be forced to continue running it.by all means put it on new cars at least people are aware of it when they purchase the car but changing the goalposts after x amount of years is not on therefore we should be paid compensation to make up for our loses due to goverment polices and enable us a fair chance to purchase a more (green car).",
