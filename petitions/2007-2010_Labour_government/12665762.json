            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Please remove the caravan because:\n\n1: This caravan will prevent other residents from selling their property \n\n2: It is major eye-sore for all residents out of sync with the neighbourhood. The view from most houses is looking at a 30 foot caravan / static home in a predominantly open-plan residential area. Quality of life has been ruined by this decision.\n\n3: The owner already has a 5 bedroon property and disregards the quality of life of other residents for self-gain. \nWe see Trafford Cnouncil's decision as unjustified and completely unfair.\n\n4: No consulation has taken place prior. This defies the good spirit in the area and is a major abuse of this good spirit. Stress levels of local elderly residents has increased.\n\n5: Trafford Councils decision to allow this without any acknowedgement to any residents. This is a breach of trust of tax payers in the vicinity- and an insult to democracy.\n\nWe the undersigned would like immediate action to remove this caravan as it is against the wishes of the residents, creates a major eye sore ruining the quality of life for all residents, its use defies logic and will prevent property owners from sales of their own property.",
