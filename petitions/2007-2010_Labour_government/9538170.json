The Dalai Lama can be invited along with other Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, to discuss environment and peace issue, so that there will be less tension from Hu Jintao's side. The G8 Summit is a great opportunity to introduce the Dalai Lama to Hu Jintao. Tibet issue effects everyone in the world. We request you strongly to act immediately to make this happen.\nThank you very much. Free Tibet Team Japam",
