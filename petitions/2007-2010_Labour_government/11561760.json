        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Without any consultation to the trade a proposed hike in licensing fees for Private Hire & Taxi licensing of 43% has been made by some Authorities at a time when all are seeing incomes fall in a recession. Not only is this seen as an abuse of power it is so far above the RPI that only a lunatic would consider a hike of this magnitude in the current economic circumstances and further enhaces the fact that those resposible for the hike are living on another planet compared to the reality of life in the UK.\nThe licensing fees should reflect how hard conditions are for us all and be REDUCED not increased in order to maintain employment in an overtaxed industry. Government should STOP the increases and consider reductions if it truly wants employment to continue !",
