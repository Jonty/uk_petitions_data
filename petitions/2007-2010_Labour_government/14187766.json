            "background": "Last year CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale used its status as a designated consumer body to issue a super-complaint to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) on the unfair operation of the beer tie by large pub companies.  Exploitation of the beer tie causes consumer detriment through higher prices, reduced amenity and pub closures.\n\nThe OFT has rejected the super-complaint.  In CAMRA\u2019s view their response was partial, misleading, and heavily predicated on industry assertions; their failure to conduct a thorough analysis seriously undermines the validity of their conclusions.\n  \nBob Young, a former member of the Monopolies & Mergers Commission and respected Principal of Europe Economics, has described the OFT\u2019s response as \u201cas inadequate as CAMRA\u2019s super-complaint was compelling\u201d.\n\nGovernment must now use its powers to intervene and refer the matter to the Competition Commission to ensure a fair deal for the consumer and to rebalance the relationship between large pub companies and their tenants.",
