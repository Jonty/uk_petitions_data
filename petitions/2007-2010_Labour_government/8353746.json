        "background": "There are over 35000 horses-ponies and donkeys in the U.K. alone. Sent to slaughter houses to be murdered every year. Why ? so continentals can enjoy them on their dinner plate and so people's wallets in the U.K. can get fatter. Although there is some legislation appalling practices continue, this may involve cruel transportation, handling, and the meat market. I seek to raise your awareness of these barbaric practices and would invite you to sign my petition to make killing horses for human consumption illegal in the U.K. Also to make sure all slaughter houses are properly regulated under strict veterinary supervision to make sure all animals are treated humanely until that day.",
