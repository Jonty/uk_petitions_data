I\u2019m lucky to live in an area where my police force has a cadet unit. But I have talked to quite a few teenagers who would love this insight into the police but they can\u2019t as there police force doesn\u2019t have a cadet scheme. If forces had these it would make relations with teenagers and police stronger.",
