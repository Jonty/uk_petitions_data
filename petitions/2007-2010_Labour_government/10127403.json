As quoted from the Telegraph. One of the governments main priorities is of course national Security and Public Safety, this decision has not been made with our country's safety and the people's wellbeing in mind. \n\nWe are calling for the government to act on their promise of clamping down on terrorists and terrorism and not to allow such incredible misjudgements in regards to public safety.",
