            "background": "Benefit claimants cost the UK taxpayers many millions per year. Some of this capital could be saved by restricting TV services for JSA/Income support claimants, to Freesat and terrestial TV services only. Cable and Satellite services are a luxury which the UK taxpayer should not have to subsidise.\n\nCompulsory checks would be made by the TV service providers, with the local benefit offices when anyone tries to subscribe to these services for the first time.\n\nFor anyone who signs on, the benefit office would contact the satellite or cable providers, to restrict or terminate the services at the end of the month for which they already paid. \n\nAnyone signing off would once again be entitled to the services after a one month period.\n\nRather than removing the equipment from the claimants property, the corresponding subscription card can be reprogrammed or deactivated by the provider.",
