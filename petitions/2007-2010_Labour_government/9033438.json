Though the excuse is that it helps prepare students, I have seen no benefit.\n\nSATS for secondary school are also, for want of a better word, useless.\nThe SATS are basically a way for schools to look good, with good results.\nIt does not help, and those students who do want to do well, end up stressed and feel overworked.",
