            "background": "Estate agent should be capped on how much they can charge for administration fees and credit checks, It is imposible for tenats to move into a house on low income when they have to fork out for admin fees, Garentor search fees, one months rent and a deposit. which can some times exceed \u00a31500, if people had this kind of cash floating around they would buy somewhere. \nThey should also abolish the need for guarentors as not everyone has a relative who earns enought to cover the cost of two rents and this leaves people living in squaller. This encourages people to apply for local council housing, when if it were easier to rent privatly, council houses would be left for those in dire need.",
