Also no redecorating, private chauffeur and security services, nappies, baby bibs, or any other receipts it is unreasonable for the taxpayer to reimburse should be submitted.\n\nIn future all aspects of MPs' remuneration should be overseen by an independent body whose first priority is to protect the taxpayer, not build up MPs' property portfolios or feather-line MPs\u2019 first and second homes with the latest furnishings, appliances and electronic equipment all too regularly.\n\nNo London MP should be able to claim for a second home. The practice of switching designation between first and second homes must stop and the designations must correspond with Inland Revenue and local council records.",
