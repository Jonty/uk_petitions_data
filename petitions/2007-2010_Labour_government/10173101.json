            "background": "I work for a local authority housing department, we spend an excessive sum each year chasing tenants for rent arrears. I would ask the government to amend the housing act to allow local authorities to charge interest on rent arrears. If a private tenant went into arrears they would be charged for the missed payment and interest on the outstanding balance. Where as if an RSL tenant goes in to arrears they basically end up with an interest free loan at around \u00a35.00 per week even if they're taken to court.\n\nWe have around 10,000 tenanted properties and 2 million in rent arrears, This unpaid rent as well as the extra staff required to chase these arrears reduces the services we can provide.",
