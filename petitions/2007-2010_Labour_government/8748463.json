            "background": "Since the abolition of student grants and the introduction of tuition fees in the 1990s student debt has risen sharply (Callender & Wilkinson, 2003). \n\nA survey commissioned by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) found that between 1998\u20131999 and 2002\u20132003 it had more than doubled, with the average debt in 2003 amounting to \u00a39780, with half owing more than \u00a310,395 (Callender & Wilkinson, 2003). \n\nThe DfES survey found that 43% of students now meet government criteria for poverty (Callender & Wilkinson, 2003).\n\nMore recently the annual Barclays graduate survey in 2005\nsuggested that the typical graduate is now leaving university with debts of \u00a313,501, a rise of 12% on 2004 (Barclays Bank, 2005). \n\nWhen the survey began in 1994 students owed an average of \u00a32212 each on graduating. Debts have thus increased\nby almost 500%.\n\nEve Gerrard and Ron Roberts - Journal of Further and Higher Education\nVol. 30, No. 4, November 2006, pp. 393\u2013403",
