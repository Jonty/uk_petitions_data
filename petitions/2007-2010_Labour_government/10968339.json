        "background": "The Metropolitan line runs to Amersham.   The line between Amersham and Aylesbury is currently served by Chiltern railways trains. The two run over the same route for much of the way to central London, so it makes sense that they be combined, providing Aylesbury with a  much more frequent service to London. It would also mean Aylesbury passengers could get direct trains to The City, rather than being dumped on the edge at Marylebone.\n\nI therefore call on the government to provide all necessary support and funding to TFL for extending the Metropolitan line to Aylesbury!",
