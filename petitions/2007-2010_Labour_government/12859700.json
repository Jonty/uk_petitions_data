When I contacted English Uk and other orgonisations who oversee language schools, they said it was down to the school. I have taken in young students and have never needed a Police check. Single men can take in a child and I cant imagine anything worse than not speaking English and being threatened.\nThe peodiophile network must have spotted this loophole by now. Foreign children need the same protection as British children.",
