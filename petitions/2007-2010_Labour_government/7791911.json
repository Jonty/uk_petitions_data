            "background": "We ask for a legal detail to be changed, which currently hinders the use of minibuses by voluntary organisations. Details follow.\n\nThe section 19 Small Bus Permit scheme allows drivers without minibus category (D1) on their licences to drive minibuses for voluntary groups, up to a maximum authorised mass (MAM) of 3500kg.\n\nAt one time, most minibuses were within this limit, but most modern 17-seaters have a MAM typically around 4000kg.\n\nAlso, as since 1997 D1 entitlement is no longer given to those passing the car test, the proportion of drivers affected is steadily increasing.\n\nSo voluntary groups are increasingly unable to use 17-seater minibuses, unless they pay for drivers to take a minibus test.\n\nThis inconveniences voluntary groups, for sake of a difference in allowed weight which is not much more than a technicality.\n\nSo we ask for the weight limit covered by the Small Bus Permits to be increased to say 4200kg, so as to cover the many minibuses slightly over the current limit.",
