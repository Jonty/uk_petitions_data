At the moment because of the economic crisis most teenagers leaving school, go to college/university or become unemployed.So we are starting this petition to try and help teens leaving school. This means that the college's are becoming fuller, then they have to charge more for new applicants and raise the grade expectations for new  applicants.\nPlease help our cause and read our petition.\n\nthank you",
