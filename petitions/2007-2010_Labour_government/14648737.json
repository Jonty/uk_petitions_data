        "background": "Modern day car tax for 17-25 year olds is extortionately priced. Most people in this age range are reasonable, competant drivers and they still have to pay huge amounts because of the mistakes that a few irresponsible youths did several years ago. Young people in this age range are likely to be studying at college, sixth form and university. And because they are in full time education, financially they are limited, and yet they are being \"milked\" of every last penny paying for cars and other forms of transport.",
