            "background": "Dear Mr Prime Minister\n\nThe analysts around the globe know that the state of the energy industry of UK is in a real chaos and none can deny the fact too!!\n\nThe root cause to all the problem is multiple suppliers dealing (or pretaining to be dealing) with different parts of a property when it comes to retail energy market.\n\nIf one property may have only one supplier of each type of fuel the current chaotic situation can be reduced effectively and efficiently.\n\nBy implementing \"One Property - One Energy Supplier\" the cases such as - one property e.g. no 21 - with different idenitifications i.e. 21A and 21B - will have to have one energy supplier.\n\nThe benefits:\n- Easy to identify the energy supplier\n- Easy to resolve 'crossed meter' issues\n- Introduction of 'loyalty' to the competative market of Gas and Electric\n- More accurate data\n- Land Register data will be improved\n\nPlease feel free to discuss the case.",
