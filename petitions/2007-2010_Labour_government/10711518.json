This is clearly a violation of our human rights.LHC experimenters are tinkering with the unknown and putting mankind \u2014 and our whole planet \u2014 at risk. These scientists are playing God, warning that no one can guarantee that the black holes will not survive, rapidly growing in size & suck the Earth out of existence in an instant. The general public have NOT been informed or consulted about this potentially cataclysmic event, until it was uncovered today in the press.",
