            "background": "The government is currently being controlled by an unelected Prime Minister, who, has appointed seven unelected senior cabinet ministers to help him run this country allegedly in the name of the people. None of these senior government figures have a genuine mandate or even a single vote from the people of the UK.\nWe say that this situation is a disgrace, it is a breach of our constitution and of our democracy. Only an immediate general election can remedy this injustice and or give these unelected figures the mandate that they do require from the people.",
