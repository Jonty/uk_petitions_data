            "background": "Is it fair on the 99% of 18-20 year olds who are responsible? As usual, a small minority of people give them a bad name, when the majority do nothing wrong. This has been put into place by people over 21. How would they feel if they were told that today they can go out and buy a drink, tomorrow they can't. They assume all alcohol related problems are caused by young people. They aren\u2019t. I have seen many examples of those over 21 not being responsible drinkers. They are looking for someone to blame. In Europe, beers and wines can be bought from 16 and there is less trouble, due to better education and as it is slowly introduced from an early age. This gives young people a far better understanding of how to drink sensibly without banning it. The nanny state is out of control. What about smart cards that prevent persons of any age buying alcohol if they have had any type of alcohol offence? This would make people of all generations responsible. They could focus more on underage sales. A lot of alcohol related crime is caused by under 18's as they have nothing to do. This causes trouble. Raising the age would enhance the problem, as all under 21's would have less to do, increasing problems.",
