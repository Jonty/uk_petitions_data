        "background": "It is a tragedy that 20,000 people needlessly die from the cold each year, and many more become ill. It is a cruel society when hard-pressed families have to make the choice between feeding their children and keeping their home warm. And yet that is what we face in Britain today, with fuel prices more than doubled over five years and so many homes poorly insulated so that energy is wasted. Support the Rt Hon David Heath MP's Private Members' Bill on Fuel Poverty to end this.",
