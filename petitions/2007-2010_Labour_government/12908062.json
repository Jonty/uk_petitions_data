I think this is wrong and may bring other problems other than the learning problem its self.\nI would like to see children get extra support straight away while waiting for staements aat the same time sppeeding the whole process up. It can take up to two month to see one expert the you have to go see some one else and you are just back and forth. this is wrong!!.\nplease support this petition.",
