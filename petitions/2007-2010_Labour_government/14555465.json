        "background": "Poppyfields Dementia Home is part of Ebdon Court, a Council run facility with 2 day centres, 2 lunch clubs as well as the much loved and admired Poppyfields EMI. We have been fighting to keep this service since 2005 when North Somerset Council (NSC) tried to close it before. The Council Executive says they are closing it to save money. Alzheimer\u2019s Research Trust states the UK has over 821,000 sufferers, rising to over 1,000,000 by 2015. The option of \u201cstay at home\u201d care is not always the right choice and could be more of a burden on costs. NSC promised a \u201cflagship\" dementia centre, this fell through with the 1st choice partner. Why not tender again with the other interested parties! Cost-cutting has never been asked for but could also be made! NSC does not seem to want the burden of Dementia care on their shoulders. Poppyfields caters for 15 permanent & 3 respite places. Poppyfields is exemplary in every aspect of the service they provide. To take this away to save money is a disgrace.",
