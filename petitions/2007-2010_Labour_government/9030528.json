            "background": "introducing the Governments latest suggestion of removing cigarettes from display to prevent children from taking up the habit. This is taking their responsibility one step to far, they have advised people of the \u201cperceived dangers\u201d, have stopped advertising and sponsorship, taxed the product continuously and banned it in all public places. This will not reduce young people smoking and will probably only serve to make it more desirable as it disappears under the counter. \n\nWhat will be next chocolate, crisps and fizzy drinks in closed cupboards and buying alcohol through a hole in the wall? Cigarettes are a legal product and if you are a smoker and believe it is your right and your risk to purchase them freely from a display cabinet then please sign, otherwise the next step for them will be to make them illegal.",
