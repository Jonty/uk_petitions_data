        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The schools havent re-opened after the christmas break due to the adverse weather.  Thousands of children's education is being affected because of this.  Thousands of parents have had to take time off of work to cover the school closures, which means that the holiday entitlement they get will not cover the rest of the school holidays.  Summer holidays are far too long as it is. The education of the children will suffer especially for those taking their exams this year and the children that will be moving to secondary schools.  So, we are calling for the summer holidays to be reduced!!",
