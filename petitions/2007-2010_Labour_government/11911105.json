Had warning triangles been manditory he may well have seen the broken down lorry he crashed into and his untimely death may have been avoided, or at the very least his injuries less severe. We would hope that the simple use of warning triangles at the scene of a breakdown could in the future save some lives. They offer both a visual reminder of something ahead and a physical prompt of a potential danger ahead. Hazard warning lights on their own did not save Gary, a safety triangle placed in the road may well have.",
