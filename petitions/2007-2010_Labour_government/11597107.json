For the past twenty years he can be found in the shopping centre wearing brightly coloured clothes or looking rather dapper in top hat and tails.  He is patriotic, never offensive and always has a happy comment to brighten up the day of passers by. It would be great if he could receive a plaque or statue in recognition in Kingston Town Centre.",
