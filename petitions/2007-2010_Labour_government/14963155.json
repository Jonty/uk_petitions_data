This will make\nhigher education possible for every student in the UK, making\nit equal and fair for everyone. Of course, universities need to\nbe supported by some income or other but this will work out by\nhelping people get the education they need to get a worthy job\nto pay the taxes which will keep the universities up. It will\nalso benefit our society by contributing to more people working\ntowards business, commerce and technology to improve our\nindustries, businesses and country to develop faster and most\nimportantly, improve our lives.",
