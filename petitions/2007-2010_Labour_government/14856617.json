Parties must end party-benefiting lying and media frenzying in order for the people of Britain to choose who can benefit them most.\n\nBritain is in a dire state, therefor this election must be right by the people. Parties who lie OR make allegations, such as the PM bullying, should face democratic monetary sanctions in terms of donations to their groups unless they stick by fact, evidence and POLICY, which will benefit the people of Britain.\n\nWe can't go on trusting what media bias says - we need transparent and democratic action, not media savvy.",
