Why should we have to pay to have a scenic view? Our income and our investments are already heavily taxed. What right do you claim to now tax the improvements we make to our homes so we may enjoy our lives by taxing such things as patio's or balconies? \n\nAs the levels of public service plummet we are asked to give more of our hard earned income to bolster failing public and private institutions.  As the government staggers blind-drunk from one panic stricken move to another, this is a stagger too far!",
