            "background": "I was employed on a 6 month contract, I was told verbally that it was being renewed and then the firm changed their minds, I had passed up another job because I thought I had it covered, little did I know, short term contract employees apparently have no rights! The company did then have to recruit more staff to fill my post. There is little support from any agency, I was met with \u2018if the contract was less than a year\u2026.\u2019. I have asked around and it would appear to be becoming more common that employees are taken on on these contracts because there appear to be no laws to protect the employees. As I found there is also a high turnover so the employers are not liable to pay certain benefits nor redundancy. In my case I instigated grievance procedures as another member of staff was kept on and the company investigated themselves and found they had done nothing wrong, I then appealed and they again found that they had done nothing wrong. There needs to be a change in the law so that there is protection for all those on fixed / short term contacts that are for less than one year.",
