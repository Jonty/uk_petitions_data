            "background": "The cost of railway signalling appears grossly excessive. A recent case of 3 million pounds for signalling one minor junction has been reported. Technical problems with adding signals for new junctions also appear to be an obstacle to connecting up new industrial sidings and heritage railways. As it is government policy to shift traffic from road to rail, these problems need to be tackled.",
