            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Everyday children and teenagers go to school in danger from drugs and cigarretes. A adult can't supervise pupils all the time, so for that time we have CCTV cameras, but unfortunetly schools in Britain don't have enough funding to have CCTV cameras in all essential areas. \n\nIf more funding was avaliable bullying would dramatically decrease, CCTV cameras are essential for student safety.\n\nWith more money for CCTV cameras could be placed in more places, for example in many schools, they don't have enough money to place cameras in all classrooms. With more funding cameras could be placed in all classrooms.\n\nAntony Edkins a headteacher of a school in England installed CCTV cameras in classroom. He found the percentage of pupils achieving five GCSEs with grades of A*-C grew from 18% to 52%. The cameras have made a \"very significant\" contribution to the rise.\n\nWith you help we can get funding for school. Join us in the fight . We will win, but we need your help, for the childrens sake. Please spare a few minutes to help.\n\nThank you so much for your support",
