        "background": "The Additional Member System is a fundamentally poor way of electing representatives:\n\n* It is intensely confusing for the voter presented with multiple ballot papers who do not understand if the \"second vote\" is a second preference or not\n* It gives unequal voting power to those able to use their votes to elect difference constituency and list members\n* It creates two different types of constituency representatives in a single chamber\n* It is vulnerable to manipulation by large parties utilising the tactic of decoy lists\n* It allows parties with very small levels of support to get elected despite being overwhelmingly rejected by the vast majority of voters\n\nThe continued use of this system is detrimental to politics in this country and it should be replaced as soon as possible.",
