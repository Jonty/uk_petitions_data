            "action": "To stop the transfer of private sewers and lateral drains to statutory water and sewerage companies",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The government are to transfer private sewers and lateral drains to statutory water and sewerage companies in Apr 2011 despite the damage this will have on the private drainage contractor and suppliers alike who will be shut down overnight. The transfer will also impact the public increasing the average \u00a3160 sewerage bill even if they do not have a drain problem. Defra and the Gov have been planning the transfer since 2007 however many contractors and citizens are today still unaware of the transfer,implications and burden on the public purse. There has been no consultation to date with the 2000+ private drainage contractors who employ over 100000 skilled engineers or its suppliers,the whole process has been miss managed by Defra and all other associated bodies.This is yet another example of the current Government's disregard for the views and opinions of the people who matter-the Public.Lets not forget the 2007 floods that caused damage to our properties due to the maintenance of main sewers being neglected. When was the last time you see your statutory water and sewerage company clean the main sewer in your street?. \"Together we stand divided we fall\"",
