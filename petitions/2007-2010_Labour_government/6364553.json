It would also make a much higher minimum wage possible due to savings in salary payments made by a maximum wage; and would simply be much fairer.  \n\nBefore I retired I had a LOT of very low-grade jobs and I noticed that the more low-grade (and therefore menial, monotonous and, frankly, soul-destroying) they were the more badly-paid they were; yet they were all vital to the running of the various companies for which I worked so I feel a decent salary was the least I (and, of course, everyone else in the same situation) should have been entitled to expect.",
