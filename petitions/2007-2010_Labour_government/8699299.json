            "background": "As of 2006, all students in England and Wales are subject to tuition (or top-up) fees. Although controversial in itself, perhaps this system is most unfair to mature students who, had they gone to university immediately after school, would have graduated before tuition fees were introduced. Such potential students may have missed out on uni due to domestic issues such as having to provide care, or because of financial or other issues preventing them from going \nat age 18. Now, they are still excluded from uni because, on top of current financial strains (e.g. mortgage), they have to pay tuition fees as well, fees they would not have had to pay if they were able to attend at 18.\nI therefore call upon the government to cancel one years tuition fees for mature students, for each year they could have studied before 2006.",
