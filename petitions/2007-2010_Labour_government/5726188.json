        "background": "I like many, many others have to go for continual medical assesments for various sections of the benefits service, it seems strange to me that common sense has not been applied to ensure that the different benefit offices use medical information that they already have within a different section.\n\nThis would ease the burden felt by disabled people accross the country who have to continually fight to prove that they have a debilitating condition.\n\nI dont think the government understand how much more poorly they can make people by forcing them to have many medical assessment, even when they already have medical evidence via another benefit section.\n\nSo please Mr Brown, ensure that your Government takes into consideration the effect on a persons health when requiring them for continued medicals.",
