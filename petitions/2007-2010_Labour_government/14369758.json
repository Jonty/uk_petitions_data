        "action": "Oppose the banning of T12 fluorescent lamps",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A ban on T12 fluorescent lights will be enforced by the EU on the first of September 2012. This reason for this ban is because T12 fluorescent lights are slightly less efficient than newer thinner models, but this change in efficiency is very small .\nWhat are T12 fluorescent lights? T12 are a standard tubular fluorescent lights with a diameter of 12/8ths of an inch. They gained popularity in the 1970s for their efficiency, today these lights are considered to be the lest efficient form of fluorescent lighting. \nThinner T8 (8/8ths of an inch diameter) fluorescent lights are often used in older fittings designed for T12s as a more efficient replacement. However many older fittings will not function with T8 fluorescent lights and the ban would force users to upgrade their whole lighting fittings which is very expensive and wasteful. I feel that the ban is unnecessary as the increase in efficiency is very small (typically by a few watts of electrical power per lamp) and that the Prime minister should speak out against this ban!",
