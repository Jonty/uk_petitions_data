If certain persons or information has been subdued then the guilt lies with them and not the honest upstanding gun holders that were penalised.  It is therefore the Publics Right to know what and why the perpetrator was allowed, by the authoritites to remain at large and in possesion of firearms, enabling him to commit the heinous crime.",
