        "background": "Our local council has started the testing of all headstones in our local cemetry. If the test fails the headstones are to be dug up and relaid - costing somewhere in the region of \u00a3150 - \u00a3170 and it is the loved ones/families that have to foot this bill. This is outrageous and hitting the old hard - it has caused much upset. My own dad's headstone has failed the test (11 years old) My mum is outraged and also so very much upset - the thought of the headstone being dug up and relaid is unthinkable.\nPlease stop this cruel procedure now. \nIf the family do not pay the cost of repair then the headstones are to be toppled and left on the grave, flat. What is going on in our world - even the dead don't have respect now.",
