And losing approximately 1/2 the population's private and sensitive date including N.I numbers, date of births and banking details) the undersigned petition the Prime minister to call a General election as so as it is possible. The Great British Public are being subjected to an incompetent government whose leader they never voted into power. We supposedly live in a democratic nation, so we call the prime minister to allow democracy to prevail by allowing us to choose our great nations leader (before we become a not-so-great nation)",
