            "background": "As a Christian country we should ensure that the basis of Christianity and its relationship to the development of our society is taught to all our citizens. It should not be possible to opt-out of this teaching but the teaching should not include any form of 'worship'. Likewise, schools should be allowed to provide similar teaching on any other faiths relevant to their students but as an additional subject - not as an alternative. In a society that has an increasing problem with lawlessness, immorality, anti-social tendencies and intolerance, learning about some of the basic tenents that underpin our 'social values' could make a difference.",
