We have no choice but to choose this supplier and have not had the opportunity to shop around. We are now faced with a huge bill and a company that controls the market and is not regulated. Please sign this petition to stop companies holding the open market to ransom and making customers pay over the odds while they receive a huge profit. My wife and my newborn baby deserve to be kept warm.",
