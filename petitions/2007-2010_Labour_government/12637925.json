        "background": "We want a government for the people, in the respect that it betters theirs lives and constantly strives to build a better future, instead of a government that is designed to help globalists, war wagers and international bankers. A country without a central bank is a stable country. The united states of America was built to escape the bank of england (america has since be lost to its own unconstitutional central bank). Central banking systems are only designed to control the population by means of debt, removing the bank of england would move Britain much closer to a true democracy.",
