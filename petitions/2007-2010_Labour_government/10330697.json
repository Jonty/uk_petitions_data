            "background": "We all know how penguins are constantly stimulating the British economy with the funny little penguin shaped mugs and all the people who go and look at the at the zoo. But penguins never seek praise for their efforts. They give so much to communities up and down the land yet take so little. It is time we honoured this noble race by creating the national penguin week. Which should run from the 22nd October-29th October. And everyone should be given free penguins masks that can be worn all through the week regardless of dress codes etc.",
