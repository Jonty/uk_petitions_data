        "background": "We have recently seen attempts by Kraft, and Hersey buy Cadburys.  Cadburys, is one of the only remaining British Great companies that produce high quality goods for a reasonable cost.  Millions of us have been brought up with this product and need it to remain in British hands.  Like all companies that are bought by non uk companies the quality drops, the work force decimated and the price goes up.  Please stop this from happening, keep Cadburys British.\n\nGordon this is a chance to do something the country will thank you for.",
