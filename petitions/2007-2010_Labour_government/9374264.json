        "background": "A teenager in Iraq was accidentally shot by a British troop and could receive up to \u00a32,000,000 in compensation. This is totally unjustifiable!! The teenager knows their home is a war zone so should expect at least a few casualties. \nTheir injury is superficial, a bullet hole will heal in time yet our troops who have sustained significantly worse injuries (lost legs from mines) are getting their disability benefits removed and their disabled parking badges revoked. How the government sees this to be just I will never know.\nThis country is becoming a shambles with all its priorities lost, sort it out!!!\nThis partition is just a start; there are so many things this government needs to sort out now!!\n\u00a32,000,000 can buy 14,000 suits of body armor to protect BRITISH troops. Don\u2019t spend it on one teenager!!!",
