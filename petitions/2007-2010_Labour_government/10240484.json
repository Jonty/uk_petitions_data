        "background": "While schools work with children with learning problems to achieve their full potential, children who are mentally ahead of their peers are often left unprovided for. This leaves them bored, encourages laziness and complacency, and means that they cannot reach their full potential. Those signing this petition recognise the inherent problems in this, and the need for something to be done before the talents of Britain's brightest children go to waste.",
