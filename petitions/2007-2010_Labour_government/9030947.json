            "background": "I believe the Prime Minister should raise the National Minimum Wage, perhaps to \u00a38 to \u00a310, to allow Working people to live comfortably and pay their bills without having to worry.\n  Also the amount that Working people are taxed should be decreased to help with everyday living and expenditure.\n  Council Tax, Council Tenancy Rent, City Bus Fares,  utility bills, etc are being increased dramatically.  But there is no rise in Working people's minimum wage to partner the outgoing expenditure.",
