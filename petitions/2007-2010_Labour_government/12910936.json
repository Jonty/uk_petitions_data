            "background": "It is absolutely shocking that people are still being treated like criminals for smoking cannabis/growing cannabis for personal use, it is much safer than tobacco and actually has MANY positive properties. Our government seem to ignore all the petitions and just go on to state facts about how it is harmful, addictive and damaging when in fact, it is the complete opposite for most of its responsible, adult users. Please listen to the public and decriminalize cannabis.",
