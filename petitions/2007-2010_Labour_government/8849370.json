            "background": "A 12-pack of AA batteries retails for as little as \u00a32.00 whereas the equivalent in rechargeable batteries is typically at least 10 times this price. Since it takes a long time to recoup the initial expense of the batteries and charger, it is all too tempting to take the easy option. \n\nBy placing a hefty tax on non-rechargeables and using this to subsidise rechargeable batteries and chargers, perhaps more people can be tempted to use re-usable batteries - cutting down on land-fill and reducing the energy and resources used to produce and dispose of disposable batteries.",
