        "background": "On Monday 1 September 2008, the cuban province of Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth was directly hit by Gustav, a Category 5 Hurricane.\n\nUK news has provided very little coverage of the devastation caused in Cuba with news reports being mainly focused towards the United States.\n\nHurricane Gustav damaged almost as many homes in Pinar del Rio as the 14 hurricanes that have hit this province in the last eight years in their totality.\n\nHomes, schools and state buildings have suffered extensive damage. \n\nThousands of homes have been destroyed completely and families have lost whatever few possessions they may have been fortunate enough to own.\n\nFuture storms, which are likely to develop into high category hurricanes have been predicted and these have also been identified as a potential major risk to Cuba.\n\nWe therefore urge the UK Government to reconsider its policy on providing humanitarian aid to Cuba during these desperate times.",
