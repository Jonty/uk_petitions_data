            "background": "When Gordon Brown became Chancelor, one of his first actions was to remove general oversight of banks from the Bank of England to his newly created FSA. In doing so he threw away many decades of experience in this vital oversight role and created a new body with no experience of the task it was to undertake. He also relegated The Bank of England to merely being tasked with controlling the rate of inflation. We consider that Gordon Brown was, at best naive, and could not understand the vital role the The Bank played behind the scenes in keeping a measure of stability in the banking system.",
