        "background": "The current system that allows the 3 line whip forces backbench MPs to back ill thought out, half-baked proposals, often rushed through parliament to the detriment of the people. Lobbying combined with reliance on few large donor companies for party funding & the resultant conflict of interest is sustained by the Whip system. The whip system - a top down approach - is outdated and is contrary to the true spirit of democracy that is in touch with grass-root sentiments",
