        "action": "remove the family law process from the court system altogether unless risk of harm to a child or parent is present",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current family law process in England puts children\u2019s lives at risk and is in direct violation of Article 8, Right to respect for private and family life.\n\nThis can be seen in the misuse of resources, the unreasonable delays in the court system, the highly adversarial nature of court culture that actually promotes conflict, the falling standards of the professional bodies who work in the family justice system and the financial incentives to protract family law cases where legal advice is sought, placing dangerous levels of stress on family units.\n\nChildren are routinely exposed to the detrimental effects of the family court system. Symptoms range from emotional alienation to complete dislocation of the family unit and where severe, the death of children involved in these proceedings.\n\nWe urge the government to rethink its culture on family law issues and ultimately to protect the most vulnerable and valuable members of our society: our children.",
