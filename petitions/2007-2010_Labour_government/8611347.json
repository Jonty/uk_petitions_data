            "background": "As a mother of four, I have, on several occasions, had to step in on my childrens internet searches for homework. These searches have included \"Flamenco\" and \"Pumpkins\". These searches have resulted in very inappropriate images and as a result, I believe that there should be a way of protecting anyone who is innocently searching for information to not be afraid of finding anything which may be offensive. \n\nAll schools have protection, our computer has protection but this did not help. In short our children are not being given the protection they deserve.\n\nAll websites need to be regulated by a central policing source, anything deemed inappropriate should be categorised as we would expect an 18 film to be. If the site slips through, this site should be reported to the \"central internet police point\". \n\nWe can report spam, scammers and phishers, why not do more to protect the innocent ones?",
