There has been a huge agreeance to this petition on the social networking site \"FaceBook\"\n\n\"This last week saw the destruction by Transport For London of a famous mural by the artist 'Banksy', near Old Street tube station (as reported by the BBC on the 20th April 2007). While most graffiti is poorly executed and lacking in conceptual merit, more effort should be made to recognise those whose work makes a positive contribution to our culture and environment. Works such as the 'Pulp Fiction' spoof are thought-provoking and entertaining and have gained international recognition. If the government is serious about encouraging the creative sector and regenerating urban areas then they should encourage councils to preserve public works of art such as these, perhaps by preservation orders or grants to maintain the sites. Bristol City Council have realised the value of murals by Banksy and their more considered approach should be considered by other councils across the UK rather than the authoritarian approach usually favoured by our local government bodies.\"",
