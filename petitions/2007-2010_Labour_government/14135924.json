        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Spain and Portugal will be the European countries worst affected by climate change. Spain already experiences severe droughts which will only get worse as the effects of global warming intensify. It is estimated that in the near future, Spain could lose up to 15% of its beaches due to rising sea levels, which would be devastating for a country whose economy depends heavily on tourism. Spain is a major polluter, but has been trying to help by investing in sustainable energy, including solar and wind power. We urge you to support Spain in these green initiatives, and to work together closely with the Spanish, and other governments to stop the worst effects of climate from affecting all of us. We, the children of Canonbury School will inherit the world you leave behind, and we beg you take whatever action is necessary to make sure that our world is still a nice place to live in the future.\nYours sincerely,\nThe Green Team, Canonbury Community School",
