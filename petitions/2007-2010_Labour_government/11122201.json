            "background": "For over forty years Eric Clapton has been a mainstay in the British music scene and an inspiration to Guitarists throughout the world. In recent years his work in creating The Crossroads Centre in Antigua for addicts of Drugs and alchohol has been tireless. His own battles against addiction have been well documented and his work to help others overcome theirs should not go unnoticed. He will forever be one of the greatest guitarists the world has ever known and for this alone we should honour him.",
