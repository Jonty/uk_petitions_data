            "background": "July 1st should be Princess Diana Day. I don't mean as a Bank Holiday. I mean as a fundraising day where retail outlets get to sell white roses, and the Great British public get to take part in all sorts of fundraising activities, with all money raised going straight to the charities and good causes that the late Princess supported, and also to the charities and good causes that Princes William and Harry currently support.\n\nIf the Prime Minister approves of this, then it should get the approval of Princes William and Harry.\n\nI'm sure that the two young Princes would be delighted at my idea to raise money for the charities and good causes their mother supported.",
