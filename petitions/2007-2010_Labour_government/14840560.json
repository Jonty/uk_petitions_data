            "background": "recurring payments are a means for companies or scams to take money from your account legally even if you object or do not give authorisation. this has meant that thousands upon thousands of people have had no control of money taken from their accounts and most of the banks do not want to know or are not very helpful because you gave the details volentary. this is because you may have given a company the long card number accross the front of your card and until they decide they don't want to take your money you can do nothing to stop this legal theft. even cancelling your card won't stop this from happening. please sign this petition to allow card holders to have complete control of your hard earned cash.",
