        "background": "An audit by HEFCE found that London Metropolitan University had misreported student completion of modules and consequently, the university now faces fines and a budget deficit totaling \u00a356m.  This will result in severe cuts to programs and jobs at the university that will have a hugely detrimental impact upon students. We petition the Prime Minister to waive the repayments demanded by HEFCE and recommend that the individuals responsible be held to account, rather than students and staff who have been powerless bystanders to the gross mismanagement of a valuable public institution.",
