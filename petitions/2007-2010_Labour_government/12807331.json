            "background": "DAB, and its successor, DAB+ delivers fewer stations and lower fidelity than FM \u2013 in any case digital broadcasting, should listeners wish to use it, is better implemented by the web (there is no limit on numbers of stations, and a higher bitrate \u2013 and therefore quality \u2013 is available). Also, digital broadcasting, unlike FM, works only when it has a strong and unambiguous signal \u2013 so coverage in difficult areas currently served adequately by FM may well not be possible and reception in cars nationwide will be problematic. We are about to have an inferior system foisted upon us, presumably to free up bandwidth for another sell off \u2013 which we, the people of Britain will subsidise by losing our treasured FM network. And at a time when green considerations are uppermost, can it be a sensible decision to render several complex electronic devices per household \u2013 millions nationwide \u2013 obsolete?",
