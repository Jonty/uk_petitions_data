            "background": "We believe that in the 21st century it is about time that the BBC no longer takes for granted the fact that every household in the UK should have to have a licence, the monies for which go solely to the BBC.\n\nIn all fairness, and because there are so many other broadcasters around, who do not receive public funding, it is only right and fitting that the BBC should have to fund itself.\n\n20 years ago, the service of the BBC to the British public was bar-none and all other countries in the world were quite envious of the programming quality and the standard of the programmes put out by the BBC; sadly, however, the same cannot be said today.",
