        "background": "Students at schools where Microsoft's Windows is used, find that the computers take too long to load, they have multiple crashes and because of hardware problems they have to be replaced frequently which is very expensive. However, Mac's are easier, load up more quickly and are cheaper in the long run. Also, they don't have viruses and they have a better visual design. Please sign the petition below to enforce schools, colleges & universities to use Apple Mac computers (that have Mac OS X).",
