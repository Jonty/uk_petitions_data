This petition is in opposition to one which asks for it to be compulsory for asylum seekers and immigrants to be added permanently to the organ donor list; as I've pointed out, MANY times, those of us who were born here did nothing to ensure this - it was just \"the luck of the draw\" - so why should people who, through no fault of their own, were NOT born here, be penalised in any way?",
