Social workers and Health Visitors appear unable to recognise or deal with both physical and mental abuse - we need action to stop abuse immediately. We must encourage family friends and neighbours to report incidents of abuse.  We must train our  social workers and health visitors to spot abuse immediately.  We must train everyone not to be afriad of reporting such incidents.  We must make reporting easier and annonymous if this is what is required. We must stop people being afraid to report.  We have to STOP our children being abused.",
