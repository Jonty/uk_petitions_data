            "background": "During my engineering degree, and now in the engineering sector, I often meet people who lack basic skills needed in the science and engineering disciplines.\n\nI believe some effort should be made to make secondary education curricula more difficult to do well in, and attempt to encourage curiousity and critical thinking. \n\nIt is my hope that this will lead to the creation of a stronger technical base for our industries to draw from, fewer worthless degrees (and the people who hold them), a more aware and socially responsible generation of British citizens.\n\nThe government focus on higher pass marks has led to a lowering of standards in schools in order to improve scores, at the expense of quality education.",
