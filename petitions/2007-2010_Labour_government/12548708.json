            "background": "Park College, Eastbourne is an established, successful VI form college. Since 2003, the college has been part of Sussex Downs FE College, while currently maintaining its own identity and ethos.\n \nRecent events undermine the prospects for continuing success. Recently published plans to \u201creconfigure\u201d A-level and other courses across the SDC sites will damage Park\u2019s identity. The removal of a highly respected Head of College (mid-week !) has damaged morale of staff and students. Moving staff away from recognised teachers\u2019 contracts and advertising vacancies on an hourly-paid, variable hours basis mean that, over time, the college will not be able to compete for, or retain the best teaching staff.  \n\nThe dismantling of Park as a VI form college would remove any choice for local students at post-16. It is clear that many parents, students and other citizens of Eastbourne wish to keep Park as a centre of sixth form excellence: we urge the Prime Minister to intervene to ensure this.",
