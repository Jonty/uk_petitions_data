            "background": "We ask that the government and the Mayor stop to look at what is heppening to London and how it is changing beyond recognition - in more ways than one! We ask that you at least protect the historic buildings of London, preserve it`s architecture, it`s living history and protect London`s identity! London is an iconic national treasure because of these things, and it`s beautiful archtecture and listed buildings are still far more beautiful and interesting than many of London`s newer creations. We ask that you stop the agreed destruction of 8 buildings in Jermyn Street and actually try to resolve this issue (with all the technology available to us today, why can you not protect the heart of our Capital?!)and to re-think the demolition of much of Borough market and it`s associated buildings - it is pure vandalism! We implore you to think carefully about how you develop London and preserve it`s amazing heritage and to come up with a new way to put forward the changes you need in Jermyn street, Borough Market, and in the future, without damaging our Capital!",
