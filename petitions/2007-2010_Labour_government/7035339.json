            "background": "The Postal Strike has caused a backlog of parcels which more than two weeks since the strike ended is no where near being cleared. This is having a knock on effect that means small businesses who sell online are facing the loss of their reputation and money - many may go under. This is not a petition getting at the striking postal workers but at making sure businesses don't go under because the backlog isn't being cleared, encouraging patience amongst customers and understanding from marketplaces such as Ebay and Amazon. Meaning that businesses are not penalised for delayed mail, whether they delayed posting because of advice until after the strike or not.\nWe ask that the Prime Minister ensures the backlog is cleared and provides protection for businesses effected, especially their reputation and making sure they do not lose money as a result.",
