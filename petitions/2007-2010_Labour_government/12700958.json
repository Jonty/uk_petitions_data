        "background": "Jonathan Legard is ruining the weekends of millions of BBC sports fans with his style of commentating.\nF1 coverage used to be a pleasure to watch but since the BBC took it over and planted the ever useless and terminally annoying Legard on our TVs listening has become a torture.\nHis broken sentences and false melodrama may well be suited to football and horse racing commentary...on the radio, but add nothing to Formula 1. \nThe real problem of course is that the BBC patronise people who complain to them over the issue of Jonathan Legard's unsuitability.\nSo please Mr. Brown do something useful this week and rid us of the despicable Legard.",
