        "background": "I am astonished that with a reputation as a country of animal lovers the British Government does not fund animal rescue and anti-cruelty charities.\n\nThe PDSA (as an example) is funded purely by the kindness of the general public, and the only money they receive comes from the pockets of those that care.\n\nSome of the money we lose in tax to the Government could be put to good use in this respect and could be funded into rescuing animals from situations of cruelty and providing them with medical care and re-homing them.\n\nI believe the general public would still donate money to these charities, which would be a healthy supplement for anything the Government gives them.\n\nAnimals need to be looked after, and I believe that our Government needs to help.",
