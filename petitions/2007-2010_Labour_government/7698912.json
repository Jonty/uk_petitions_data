        "background": "Section 157 of the companies act 2006, which states \"a person may not be appointed a director of a company unless he has attained the age of 16 years\" will come into force next year. \nIn addition, the act will mean that all current directors who are under 16 when this act comes into force will cease to be a director of their company. This law is unnecessary age discrimination, and could actually harm the development of children; is it not best for young entrepeuners to start early, rather than wait until they are adults. Think of all the ideas that will be wasted by this law.",
