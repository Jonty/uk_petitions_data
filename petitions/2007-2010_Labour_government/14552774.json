            "background": "We condemn the Government's plan to attempt to pay off \"moderate\" Taliban insurgents,using millions of pounds of British Taxpayers hard earned money, in a desperate and futile attempt to reduce the insurgency in Afghanistan. This amounts to a monumental insult to the many hundreds of British and Allied soldiers who have been killed or injured whilst carrying out their duty in that country. Better that the money was used to improve military equipment, or to improve the lives of the brave young men and women who have been terribly injured,mentally as well as physically, over the years of this conflict.",
