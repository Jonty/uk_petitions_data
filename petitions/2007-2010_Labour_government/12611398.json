        "background": "I propose that full details of each MP's expense claims should be published on the internet allowing the public to view at any time what each Member of Parliament has claimed and when, and whether or not the claim has been paid. \n\nThis will work much in the same way that we can look up details of an MP's representations in the House of Commons. It will also enable the public to challenge their MP if they feel an inappropriate claim has been made, much in the same way an employer will challenge their employees expenses if they feel they are extravagant or inappropriate.\n\nThe full details of the expense allowances should also be published on the same website. This will provide us the public with transparency and disclosure, and also protect MP's from attracting bad press for embarrassing expense claim reports in the press.",
