        "background": "The heads of Waltham Forest Council are failing to re-assess a pedestrian crossing on Shernhall St, Walthamstow.  Primary and junior school children use the crossing to get to and from school.  There are two major schools who use it, however, motorists are failing to stop at the red light when the green man is on, or they are travelling at speeds in excess of 50mph which in turn, means they cannot stop; running the red light.  \n\nThere have nearly been six accidents from children having to jump back from an oncoming vehicle whilst the green man is on, or having to run across the road to dodge the vehicle.  \n\nDespite numerous correspondence to the council, they are not willing to install cameras to deter and fine motorists for these contraventions.  Children are not safe in using the pedestrian; sooner or later there will be a serious accident or road death.  Prevention is better than cure.\n\nGovernment intervention is vital.  Make this crossing safe for the numerous children using it.",
