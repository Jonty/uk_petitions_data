        "background": "Some of our teenagers have lost hope in our society and its values, they feel they have no future and therefore take no part in British culture.  Knife crime is just one symptom of this hopeless cause but so is teenage pregnancy and alcohol abuse.  The answer is not more prison places. This action re-inforces resentment against our society and breeds more violence. Clearly the government needs to create opportunities for teenagers to feel that they have something to work towards in their future lives. The way is clear for the high-flyers for whom university beckons - but what of the rest? Must their erratic futures be determined by a directionless start in early life? We petition the Prime Minister to instigate an urgent and radical review of this area of Government social policy.",
