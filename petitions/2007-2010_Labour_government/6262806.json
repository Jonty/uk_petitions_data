Firstly, I am not a rascist but I am absolutely fed up with all the gun crime and drug running in this country mostly the 2 are linked and it seems to me the culprits are of non UK nationality. Foreigners have different standards and levels of respect than we (used to) have in the UK.  No more immigration - get a grip on the young British thugs who are totally out of control also; as for the first time ever in my life I am actually scared of what is going to happen next - it's a powder keg that will end in some sort of civil war - I think I can speak for millions that we are all absolutely and utterly fed up with these people running amok in our once lovely country.  Get a Grip lets see some backbone from this spineless Government or I too will be forced to upsticks and emigrate.",
