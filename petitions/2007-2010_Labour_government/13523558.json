        "background": "I've just seen a petition which asks for the removal of a Bill outlawing possession of extreme pornography; in \"more details\" the petitioner states that the possession and viewing of this \"has no effect on anyone except the person who views or possesses it\".  What about the people who appear in it; very possibly under duress?  What effect on them might be caused by the fact that some people want to possess or view it?  Child pornography is, obviously quite rightly, condemned for the effect it almost certainly has on the children shown; in my very strong opinion it certainly can't be taken for granted that all the adults who appear in pornographic media do so entirely voluntarily.\n\nPornography presents those appearing in it, probably especially women as well as children, as objects to be used for sexual gratification.  The logical extension of this is rape.  How can the creator of the petition to which I am responding possibly assert that the possession and viewing of it affects no one except those who view or possess it?",
