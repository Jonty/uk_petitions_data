            "background": "We the undersigned believe that our democracy is strong enough to allow dissent.  \n\nWe believe it is undemocratic and unjust to suspend George Galloway, while not bringing others to account. There has been great public concern over the Iraq war, but no one has been properly investigated because of either the misrepresentation of the threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction or the alleged poor planning of the war, which many view as having led to the unnecessary deaths of British Soldiers and Iraqi Civilians.\n\nThe signing of this petition endorses democratic process but not necessarily George Galloway or the policies he stands for.",
