Parents are often encouraged to send children to school \"if they feel just a bit unwell\" and this advice could lead to faster transmission of swine flu in the Autumn prior to widespread vaccine availability.  Schools need to be instructed that the targets are inappropriate at the present time and that OFSTED judgements on schools will disregard attendance for a fixed period of time.",
