Again I see no reason for it, we have held shares since the demutilized the Insurance companies, our shares have dropped to less taht 40% but as far as I have ben able to estanblish they have compensted themselves with higher and higher bonuses thsi is not right Mr Brown, (Prime Minister) can you take thsi into considerration plaese",
