        "background": "We are shareholders in Standard Life Assurance and no matter how we enquire we cannot get to know the bonuses that they are paying to the directors, our share prices have like all in the in the insurance field taken a battering, I have tried for well over a year ti find out why they are paying the directors Bonuses or share options which are cashable I want this stopping the same way as it should be in the banking service, I see no reasom why they should have them at OUR expense. Again I see no reason for it, we have held shares since the demutilized the Insurance companies, our shares have dropped to less taht 40% but as far as I have ben able to estanblish they have compensted themselves with higher and higher bonuses thsi is not right Mr Brown, (Prime Minister) can you take thsi into considerration plaese",
