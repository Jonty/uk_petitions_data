            "background": "At the moment it is a trend for companies providing broadband or mobile phones to advertise their contracts to have \"Unlimited\" broadband or texts or something similar but there is almost always a little star with a fair usage policy at the bottom of the page. By definition a fair usage policy makes the contract limited so advertising the contract as unlimited is false. We ask the government to prevent companies from advertising in this way.",
