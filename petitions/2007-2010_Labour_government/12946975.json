            "background": "Creating a framework of clear and unambiguous packaging of drugs across the industry would ensure patient safety and pharmacists' peace of mind.  At present there is a plethora of similar packages containing different prescription drugs.  A misprescribed drug which is dispensed puts the pharmacist at risk of prison and and vulnerable patients may mismedicate from similar packages which are not clearly differentiated.",
