            "background": "Labour has always stressed the importance of Education.\n\n\"EMA\" while a wonderful idea is not particually well thought out. There are many students who earn little above the guidelines the EMA system works to who are trying their hardest to achieve their grades and better themselves for later life and indeed even the country, yet are not aided in even paying for the books they need.\n\nWith University costs putting these children at risk of serious debt and with these students needing aid to pay for their school books and equipment needed, we petition the government to rework the EMA to allow most students access to it, or demolish the system to remove the discrimination it bears.",
