            "background": "Buses are being held up by slow-moving bicycles blocking bus lanes.  They can substantially reduce the speed that buses travel at - this being especially true in rush hour periods.\n\nIf a bus is using a lane and cannot pass a cyclist in front, the bus has no option but to slow to 10 or 15mph until the cyclist exits the bus lane.  This can take a considerable time.  \n\nThis proposal particularly makes sense considering that there are far more people on a fast-moving bus than one slow-moving individual on a bicycle delaying them.",
