        "background": "Denmark  is a big shame \nThe  sea is stained in red and in the meanwhile it\u2019s  not because of the climate effects of  nature. \n\nIt's  because of the cruelty that the human beings  (\"civilised\" human) kill hundreds of the famous  and intelligent Calderon dolphins. AND  it's the manner of this horrific  slaughter.  And - not to eat  either!\n\nIs  it necessary to mention that the Calderon dolphin  , like all the other species of  dolphins, it\u2019s near extinction and they go near  men and women to play and interact. In a  way of PURE friendship.\n \nThey  don\u2019t die instantly; they are cut 1, 2 or 3  times with thick hocks. And at that time the  dolphins produce a scream extremely  compatible with the cry of a new born  child. \n\nBut  they suffer and there\u2019s no compassion till this  sweet being slowly dies in its own  blood.\n\nIts  enough! \nWe  will send this mail until this email arrives in  any association defending the animals, we won\u2019t  only read. That would make us accomplices,  viewers.",
