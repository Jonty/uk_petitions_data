            "background": "The last eleven years have been a time of failure: in foreigh policy, in economic policy - and in opposition.  As things stand, electors only have a choice between two failed parties: Labour and Conservative.  That is no choice.  Every ballot paper must include the option of voting \"none\".  If the \"nones\" are in the majority, there will be no Parliament and no Goverment.  Elections will be held a few months later to see if the public mood has changed.  Meanwhile, all tax payers will get a tax refund, funded by the money saved.",
