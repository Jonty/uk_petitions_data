This was intended to be for a period of twelve months but the Bank failed to refer the matter back to me.  In 2008 the Bank attempted to recover backdated interest amounting to \u00a338,842.97p with an accrual of \u00a314.99 per day without giving notice. I do not believe it is right and proper for a bank to seek to rectify its own errors after a period of in excess of ten years.",
