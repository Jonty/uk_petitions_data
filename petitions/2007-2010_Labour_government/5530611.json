            "background": "This is a call to the government to scrap tuition fees for everyone and provide ADEQUATE maintanance grants for all students, varying according to the living costs of the town/city they are studying in.\nCurrently, the university system puts off many prospective graduates, purely because of the cost. The thought of coming out of university with a debt likely to be well over \u00a310,000 is scary enough to a family on an average salary, never mind a family living on or close to the mimumum wage. This is what the government ministers, most of whom have never known what it is like to live in poverty or with very little money, have failed to understand.\nBy getting rid of top-up fees and re-instating adequate maintanance grants, university can truly become open to everyone.",
