            "background": "We believe that the Hunting Act 2004 is an unworkable and an unenforceable law. We believe that since the act came into force the welfare of our wildlife has decreased and that inhumane alternatives are being used to control pests. We also believe that the act was passed as a part of a so called 'class war' and had nothing to do with the welfare of animals. There was little or no consideration given to the people involved or employed in the Hunting world.",
