            "background": "The law provides that the maximimum sentence for anyone carrying a knife is 4 years.  That has doubled from 2 years.  No one has been given 2 years, never mind 4.  We petition the Prime Minister to encourage debate on this subject with a view to introducing a mandatory minimum sentence for the carrying of knives and sharpened implements, with a tarriff scale that will increase with every subsequent offence.  Far too many people are being killed and seriously injured by idiots carrying knives.  Discretion on sentencing should be taken away from Judges in these matters, as the current system offers NO deterrent to repeat offenders, and consistently offers leniency to offenders who go straight back onto the street and stab someone else.",
