            "background": "All over the country people are being denyed treatment by their local Primary Care Trusts because they do not fund certain things.  This is an unfair practice and should be brought to an end.  The NHS was founded to serve the british people, every single man, woman and child should be offered the exact same treatment as their neighbour in the next county.  It shouldn't be down to where you live if you are going to be given the right medication, or the operation you need. \n\nMany people are fighting for their right for treatment please lets put an end to it.\n\nPlease show your support to everyone who has experienced this awful situation and is battling with their PCT to get what is their basic right.\n\nThank you",
