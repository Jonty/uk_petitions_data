        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Kent International Airport's runway is about 1km to the west of Ramsgate in East Kent, a town of some 40,000 people.\n\nAlthough Thanet District Council has placed development of the airport, a former RAF base, as one of the key planks of its corporate plan, it has consistently failed to enter into any kind of agreement with Infratil regarding noise and other pollution from the airport. Consequently 747 training flights overfly Ramsgate at a height of a few hundred feet every ten minutes or so most weekends.\n\nWe believe that this situation is unacceptable to the people of Ramsgate and detrimental to the regeneration of this seaside town which contains many listed buildings and the country's only royal harbour.",
