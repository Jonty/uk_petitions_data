            "background": "The Government should order the production of H1N1 (\"swine flu\") vaccine for the whole UK population with all possible speed.\nThis is because a much deadlier second wave of the flu is a strong possibility. It is also very likely that the strain will acquire resistance to anti-viral drugs within the next few months. This could leave the UK population in a very dire situation come Winter 2009.\nIt should be noted that the very dangerous Spanish Flu of 1918, which went on to kill up to 100 million people, was preceded with a mild first wave. Unless plans to produce a vaccine are fully activated people are left with a terrible dilemma: to try and avoid infection indefinitely or deliberately seek to infect themselves and their families now, while the strain seems to be relatively mild.",
