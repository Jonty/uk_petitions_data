We must fly the flag with pride, and celebrate the historical, cultural and even the trivial achievements our Britain has made! Small things such as respecting traditions, learning about inspirational figures and even learning things about British music and literature and film, are all progressions that could and should be made! Help others learn to love our country and sign!",
