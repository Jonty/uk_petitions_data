        "background": "We would like the government to take the\nfollowing action and to recogize the work of Private Security Contactors, In the form of a letter or award for those who have proof of service.\n\n \nAnd to express our deepest sympathy for the four Close Protection Officers who were captured in 2007 in Iraq, which as\nthe news emerges are all dead now.\n\n\nWe all know that we are not recognised as former Soldiers for the work we carry out as security officers worldwide and in hostile areas, such as Iraq and Afghanistan today. \n\n\nAlthough the vast majority of all Security Contractors are long serving and with distinguished military carriers. I am sure you will agree it is high time that we should all be recognised for our services. \n\n\nAfter all it is the government who require us to work in these areas for\nthem, yet still it is the same government who do not recognize\nthese services, without us the work would not go on. \n\n \nThe war in Iraq for example would not have been won without the security contractors. \n\n\nGod bless all the the men that have died serving there country and as private security officers, our deepest sympathies go out to their families.",
