If I approached the same company as a new customer, the figure quoted is over \u00a350 per year. Why should customers have to go through the tedious process of cancelling an exisiting policy and then starting another when the companies can give automatic renewal notices based on the figures quoted on the internet? I will be doing this as \u00a350 for me is a lot of money. Insurance companies make millions of profit because of this and this needs to stop",
