            "background": "James Whale was an outspoken, but highly respected TalkSport radio presenter who was sacked by the station for encourging the people of London to vote for Boris Johnston in the recent Mayoral elections in London.  \n\nI do not always agree with Mr. Whales opinions, but respect the fact that he says what he thinks and cares passionately about Britain and the honest people who reside within.\n\nI think therefore that Mr. Brown should press for TalkSport to reinstate him.",
