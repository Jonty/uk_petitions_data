        "background": "Dear PM\n\nAre you aware of how many businesses like mine are getting massive, outrageous VAT surcharges when paying late (even by just a few days)?\n\nI have just received a surcharge of 5% of the VAT due, a massive \u00a3900 odd for just being a few days late, which is basically money that I now do not have to pay suppliers, employees and other stakeholders in my business.\n\nIn times like these, when many companies are struggling, I think a review is well overdue. After all, we are in effect unpaid tax collectors. \n\nIn fact the effort and expense all businesses have to go to to collect and report VAT for the government is unbelievable. Much more flexibility should be allowed, and it should be considered that businesses should even receive a percentage of the total VAT due to cover the extra administration that collecting VAT entails.\n\nSo...please can you take a look at this urgently!\n\nThank you",
