        "background": "Virtually every nation other than the UK among the 27 members of the European Union is either a member of the Schengen Group (which allows for free cross border travel) or plans to join, as are non EU nations like Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. If around 25 European nations can cooperate on issues of security and visas it should be possible for the UK to do so too. The advantages to all travellers into and out of the UK as well as the savings in cost to the taxpayer of fewer and shorter queues at Passport Control are well worth any small disdvantages which might result from this step.",
