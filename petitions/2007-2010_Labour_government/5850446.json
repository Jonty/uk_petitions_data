        "background": "The BBC presently has a remit to only provide BBC TV and radio for the islands of the UK only. They accomplish this on the Sky TV platform by using satellite transmissions which are intended to have a limited reception area centred over the UK. \n\nWe would like legislation to change the BBC's constitution to make UK domestic TV (especially) available to any British citizen wherever they maybe within Europe via the satellite platform. \n\nIn return the license fee for those physically watching outside the UK would be a subscription fee (with the fee pegged at the same value as license fee). \n\nWe would like the for all the other commercial domestic channels as well including ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. \n\nNote: Commercial ventures such as BBC Prime etc are NOT a reasonable alternative for overseas viewers. It's not what we want, it's only what the BBC says we can have.",
