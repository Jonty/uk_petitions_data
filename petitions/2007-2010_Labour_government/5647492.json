            "background": "With the further simplifying of the GCSE Science curriculum in the UK, I would contest that texts by experts ranging from Newton to Einstein to Hawking would give a more well-rounded community of science students for A-Level and University studies than we have with the simplified call-and-response learning of Science at GCSE. Modern works such as Bill Bryson's \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\", if made standard texts, would certainly enhance the breadth of GCSE study. From my own experience of GCSE Science two years ago, such texts, if made available by the government, would have been far more effective for students in the higher ability sets than the generic text books focused not on science but exam technique and selective learning. Are we not wanting well-rounded scholars to fill the vacuum of physicists in Britain, which the government has highlighted for years?",
