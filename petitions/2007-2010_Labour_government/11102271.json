            "background": "Pedigree dogs are endangered by the breeding practices allowed in this country.  Breeders are allowed to breed pedigree dogs with serious health problems, resulting in passing on the diseases they have to hundreds of puppies. There is also a serious problem of inbreeding in pedigree dogs which is one of the reasons that pedigree dogs have so many health issues.  We would like the law to be changed to stop this inbreeding and health tests to be carried out to ensure that the breeding dogs do not carry any life threatning or painful heritary diseases that will be passed on to future generations of puppies.  The Pedigree dog is now at risk and are in serious danger of becoming infertile and therefore ending the lineage of some of the countrys favourite dogs.  If you are concerned about the welfare of pedigree dogs please join me in signing this petition \nThank you",
