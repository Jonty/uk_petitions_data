            "background": "Siemens's CEO of the Energy sector (Wolfgang Dehen) wants to shut down Siemens Industrial Turbomachinary Ltd in Lincoln, and move all of the technology and resources to Finspong in Sweden!\n\nWith a work force of over 2000 in Lincoln, this loss would be too great to compare. As Lincoln's major employer with an engineering history of over 150 years it has a good and well recognised reputation for high quality and well engineered Gas Turbines.\n\nLincoln's site was one of the first to mass produce Gas Turbines for power transmission and compressor operations.\n\nWith the recent plan also to create the UK's first school of engineering at the University of Lincoln in the ballance, we would be jeapardising the future of the country. Trying to get more people into engineering and science would become pointless if we don't have the jobs and experience from the older generations available to us anymore.\n\nSo please, help us keep the jobs of over 2000 people alive, and help keep the future of this country certain.",
