For the amount of work that they do should reflect in the salaries they receive.\nMPs earn over \u00a360,000 per year for running this country which in all honesty, is going down the pan.\nThe average British citizen earns under \u00a315,000 per year, working all the hours god sends. So why should MPs earn this much for sitting around the house of commons and deciding what is best for us.",
