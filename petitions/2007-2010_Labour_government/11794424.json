It should be made obligatory to refer to the applicant\u2019s work experience and industry knowledge as relevant to the applied for role.  Certain key phrases such as \"over qualified\" or \"we believe you would be bored with the role\" should be made illegal, with an annual review of newly created euphemisms.  If someone is turned down for a job because of their age, then the agency or employer should be legally obliged to explain this is the case and the reasons why.",
