            "background": "We believe that many of societies ills are caused by alcohol in the hands of the young.  Surely if the number of outlets where alcohol can be purchased is controlled it then follows that the regulation of alcohol sales would be far easier to maintain.  It it a disgrace that the major supermarkets can use alcohol as a loss leader selling strong drink at pocket money prices.  Finally we believe that the most regulated places in which alcohol is taken i.e. pubs, are increasingly under threat and their loss - particularly the smaller local community pubs - would be detrimental to society and the social interaction of local communities.",
