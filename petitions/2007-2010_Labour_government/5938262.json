            "background": "Within Sheffield and in particular the North West area of the city there is currently widespread dismay and dissappointment at the Councils handling of a proposed merger of Wisewood and Myers Grove school. \n\nPeople within the communities effected are arguing for a wholescale properly planned policy that covers the whole of Sheffield. Indications seem to show that the council hasn't got an acceptable plan for tackling falling rolls in a city wide context.\n\nSheffield City Council need to go back to basics and looked at the city as a whole and put forward a comprehensive plan to deal with this issue city wide.\n\nAs a result of this debacle many people have lost faith in Sheffield City Council as a whole. \n\nFor more detailed information please feel free to read posts on the Sheffield Forum website titled : Should Wisewood.merger still go ahead and Wht Bradfield catchment area should change.",
