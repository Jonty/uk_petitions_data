Therefore I believe this website to be a waste of tax payers time and money. If 1/33  of the population (6% of the driving population) can sign a petition about road pricing and all they get in responce is a letter politely saying we will talk about it later, most people know this new way of scamming money out of people will be forced through whatever the opinions of the masses are.",
