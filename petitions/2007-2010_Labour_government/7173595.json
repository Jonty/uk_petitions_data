            "background": "This country is increasingly racking up large amounts of debt. This is causing massive social problems. Creditors are abusing their powers by employing debt collection agencies that have inflexible working procedures. They are ignoring debt collection guidelines issued by the Office and as it is not a statutory document they are not breaking any rules. Making these guidelines statutory would relieve borrowers of some of the pressure from their creditors and agents.",
