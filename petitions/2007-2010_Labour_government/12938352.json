I have various examples but, if you sign the petition, I'd like to hear some of yours.\n\nSome examples that I have come across personally:\n\nVarious motorcycle thefts - the bike in question is found, and the victim is told to \"fetch it themselves\", potentially placing the theft victim in a very dangerous situation, as they may have to go to the theif's residence and almost steal the bike back! Ridiculous.\n\nAnother example was of a local sex offender (who had been reported for sexually abusing a child over a period of 6 years) could not be arrested because the police were \"too busy\", despite the fact that he lived two doors down from the victim.\n\nSo come on, tell me yours, and let's get this completely and utterly useless police force revamped (maybe some of them could actually be held responsible their actions, yippee..)",
