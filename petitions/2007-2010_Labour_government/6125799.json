        "background": "the aims of the bbc are well intentioned but despite saying they will \" Reflect[ing] the UK's nations, regions and communities: by enabling the UK's many communities to see what they hold in common and how they differ, the BBC seeks to build social cohesion and tolerance through greater understanding.\" There is a lack of presentation for the 2.5M british naturists. Naturists wish to bring their families up to believe the human body is natural, not shameful. The lack of naturist friendly programs prevents this. there should be 1.2 hours dedicated to naturist viewers per day. Instead of this when the bbc does mention naturism it tends to laugh about it or mock. This is insulting to naturists and detrimental to those wanting to be naturists.",
