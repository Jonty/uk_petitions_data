            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Net neutrality is the principle that Internet users should be in control of what content they view and what applications they use on the Internet. The Internet has operated according to this neutrality principle since its conception. It is this neutrality that has allowed many companies to grow and innovate. Net neutrality is about equal access to the Internet for all. Broadband carriers should not be permitted to use their market power to discriminate against competing applications or content. Just as telephone companies are not permitted to tell consumers who they can call or what they can say, broadband carriers should not be allowed to use their market power to control activity online. The neutrality of the Internet is at stake as the broadband carriers such as Virgin Media attempt to control what content gets to you first and fastest. Put simply, this would alter the fundamental openness of the Internet and undermine the principles that have made the Internet the success it is today.\nSave the internet from VirginMedia Now!",
