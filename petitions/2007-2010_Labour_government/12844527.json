        "action": "take action to reduce the unacceptable level of noise from the M5 motorway between junctions 4a and 7 which affects many homes in Droitwich Spa and nearby villages from Wychbold to Whittington.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Highways Agency's route management strategy for the M5 motorway between junctions 4a and 7 lists the objective 'to reduce the impacts of traffic noise where appropriate', and this particular stretch near Droitwich is highlighted. Talks with the Highways Agency over the last 5 years have not resulted in any action.  Meanwhile, the motorway becomes busier and the noise gets worse.  In some places it is not possible to hold a conversation outside a house without shouting. Windows and doors have to remain shut even on hot days, and 'quiet enjoyment' of garden areas is impossible. This is causing considerable distress to residents.",
