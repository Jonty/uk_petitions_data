            "background": "This totalatarian idea is against my human rights and against the way i want to live my life, i cant afford to be paying extra bills just to do something i enjoy... where does it stop?, whats next.  This government is an utter discrace, stealth taxes, poor health care, and the shocking truth of funding shortages for them who fight for this nation, and yes there are lot of them who smoke too.  How dare you make tabacco criminal, or under licence. Whats next the alcohol payment license?\n\nThis governemt is more bothered about taxing us joe public than it is bothered about arming our troops correctly.  I make this petition so that all those smokers out there who use it as either a hobby or as something they enjoy to stand together and vote, WE should not have to pay more, after the amount of tax we pay already.  They say we will have to fill a form out.. ill say this, no i wont, and i WILL never fill out ANY form to do what i want to do for my own enjoyment.",
