            "background": "that Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), an internationally recognised neurological disease, be also formally recognised as a distinct clinical entity in the United Kingdom. It is time to make the case definition/diagnostic criteria explicit in the name.\n\nCurrently, most patients are diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a poorly defined, misunderstood, controversial syndrome which remains underfunded and under researched. The name Chronic Fatigue Syndrome itself has trivialised the illness and further subjected these patients to incredulity and ridicule.\n\nThe CFS rubric has not only neglected and failed to help those with ME, it has harmed them. \n\nME patients will not improve with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or graded exercise (in fact, exercise will make them worse) - yet these are considered treatments for CFS. Simply \"renaming\" CFS will not solve this problem.\n\nME should not be considered a subset of CFS, for the hallmarks of ME will not be present in the population of CFS patients.",
