        "background": "It is far too cold far too soon.   The government should establish an all party summer steering group to ensure that summer is longer, sunnier and warmer thus creating a happier workforce who will work longer, harder and more productively.  This will drive down debt, increase our GDP, put smiles on our faces and generally improve the standard of living.  Really.  Promise.  Life is too short to live in the dark and to be perpetually grumpy.  Let the sun shine in, let the sun shine on.",
