        "background": "The requirement for all students in state schools to participate in a daily act of collective worship of a broadly Christian nature is outdated and impractical. We spend are lives teaching our children how to think for themselves and then force them by law (unless their parents request otherwise) to participate in religious acts for which many have no belief. It also forces staff to either act hypocritically in delivering the assembly or illegally in not. It is a nonsense in the 21st century for non religious schools to have this requirement imposed upon them.",
