        "background": "Alan Turing is still highly regarded in the scientific community and was recognised as such by his peers, being elected as a Fellow of The Royal Society at the remarkably young age of 39.  The FRS citation quoted the work he did at age 24.\n\nCommitted members of society accept the laws of that society and if they perceive any to be unjust, seek to change them by democratic means.\n\nThe behaviour of present day members of society is not bound by repealed laws, or by laws not yet enacted.  Alan Turing was in this situation in 1951,   when he pleaded guilty to offences before a judge. He himself wrote: \"The day of the trial was by no means disagreeable\".  There is no evidence that this conviction drove him to suicide and his employers and colleagues subsequently treated him with sensitivity.\n\nNeither the present day government, nor the population they represent, has any responsibility whatsoever for Alan Turing\u2019s death in 1954 and I urge the Prime Minister not to apologise for it.",
