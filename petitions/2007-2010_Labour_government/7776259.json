        "background": "All students, whether in higher or further education should recieve free bus passes anually from the council. It is unfair to expect those of us who have decided to stay on to further education to be expected to pay over \u00a3140 per term for a bus pass! It's obsurd. We should be given similar passes to those that OAP's recieve because those of us who have part-time jobs (on top of our difficult, time-consuming studies) only earn the minimum wage and therefore can barely afford the bus fare.",
