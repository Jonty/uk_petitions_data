        "background": "Over the last few years a doctors appointment has become more and more harder to get at a time that is good for you the patient, we don't all have jobs where you can leave at any time to see a doctor and a lot of surgerys won't see any one unless an emergency after 5pm or how often have you heard 'sorry we haven't any appointments at that time for the next 2 weeks' this is frankly not good enough. it is about time the doctors surgery was open at other times and not 9am - 5.30pm. please add your details to this petition and get the service you deserve from your local GP surgery. this is not a 9 to 5 society any longer !",
