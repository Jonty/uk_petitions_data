        "background": "RAF Gaydon is a former Royal Air Force station in Warwickshire in the UK.\nDuring World War II an RAF station was built near the village. This was a standard three-runway airfield similar to a number of other airfields nearby and was used mainly for training bomber crews, using Wellington Bombers or their training variants. Immediately after the war bomber training ceased and Gaydon became a training establishment for glider pilots and gliding instructors.\n\nThe station closed in 1974 and the airfield was bought in 1978 by British Leyland, and became a proving ground for its cars. The old control tower is used to monitor and converse with the cars in testing.\nI would like to see the airfield re-opened for civil flying as this would be very popular with Aviation Enthusiasts and it would also boost the local area and economy and increase tourism.",
