            "background": "I call for PayPal's policies on refunds and payments to be investigated, to give buyers and sellers more protection.\n\nI'm fed up of being ripped off by PayPal's policies on buyer and seller protection.  They have short deadlines for you to claim against a seller if they don't send you what you have bought, and if it goes over this deadline, you effectively lose your money.  The seller walks away richer, PayPal makes some profit, and the honest buyer loses out.\n\nPayPal cannot be allowed to get away with what it is doing.  They say they offer protection, but there really isn't any.  If they do offer to refund you, it may work out to be a lot less than you originally spent.\n\nI believe this effects the common man, as the working classes are more likely to use eBay and PayPal.  PayPal is owned by eBay, and together, they seem to be able to do what they want.",
