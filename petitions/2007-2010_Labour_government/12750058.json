            "background": "I believe the Government needs to take stock of the current financial situation with regards to funding a unnecessary \"science project\" namely the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\n\nI recently found out that the UK injects \u00a3104 Million of our TAX PAYERS hard earned cash to fund such a project.\n\nCosting broken down are the annual subscription of \u00a370 Million plus the ongoing \u00a334 Million per year in other running costs. (Source http://www.lhc.ac.uk/about-the-lhc/faqs.html) \n\nI believe this to be a totally unworthy cause at the current time when so many people are out of work and so many shops in the high street are closed or indeed due to close down. People are losing their jobs, houses are being taken away and families being ripped apart, but we can still fund the LHC project, We need to take control of our spending and work to the budget for the UK, spare cash should not be squandered into such unnecessary projects especially at this immense cost to us.",
