            "background": "The Telegraph on 14/05/2009 reported that the MOD is sending the Household Cavalry to perform in Abu Dhabi for Sheikh Mansoor Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nFirstly, I object to the MOD sending servicemen to perform for other countries like some circus troop. As a taxpayer this is unacceptable and undignifying to my country.\n\nSecondly, I object to the UK sending them to perform for a tyrannical dictatorship. Recently a relative of Sheikh Mansoor has been involved in a torture scandal. We are sacrificing soldier's lives and billions fighting the so called 'war on terror' whilst alienating the oppressed of the Middle East by sucking up to these tyrants.\n\nThirdly, the government is planning to carbon tax us all yet is happy to fly out the cavalry and their horses for whimsical reasons. The carbon foot print must be huge. It shows the government's carbon initiative as disengenuous.\n\nFourthly, there is the stress and discomfort to the horses of flying for many hours. It is an act of cruelty.",
