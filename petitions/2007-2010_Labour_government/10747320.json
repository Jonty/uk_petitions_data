        "background": "President Bharrat Jagdeo of Guyana has offered stewardship of his country's entire rainforest to the UK, in exchange for development aid and assistance. The rainforest is the size of England and he has, as yet, had no reply from our prime minister. See further details from the Panorama website of programme aired on 20.30 on Monday 8th September. The Kyoto agreement offers incentives for replanting after deforestation, but there is no incentive to prevent destruction of virgin rainforest. Burning rainforests contributes as much CO2 to the atmosphere as all the transport in the world. This solution not only has carbon offset advantages, but also preserves species diversity and supports a small nation in resisting potentially destructive effects of overseas capital investment.",
