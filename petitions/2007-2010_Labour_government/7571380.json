            "background": "Children are being encouraged to learn keyboard skills at ages as low as\nthree.\n\nThe QWERTY keyboard layout we now use was designed purely on the basis\nof technical limitations when the very first manual typewriters were\nintroduced in the mid-1800s. QWERTY does not consider human physiology\nAT ALL.\n\nThe Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Layout (\"SKL\") was scientifically\ndesigned with the needs of the user in mind. It is believed by its many\nusers to be superior, and yet the few comparison studies that have been\nconducted have been shrouded in debate for decades.\n\nA 1945 study by the US Navy suggested that the costs of learning the\nDvorak SKL are both trivial AND a worthwhile investment.\n\nSignificant benefits to productivity and health might be realised if the\npurported advantages of the Dvorak SKL are real.\n\nA proper, unbiased, thorough study is needed to ascertain the truth.",
