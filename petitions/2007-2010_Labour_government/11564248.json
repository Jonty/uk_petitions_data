            "background": "Since the banks are being supported, again, with taxpayer\u2019s funds we feel it only fair that they (banks) meet their obligations to those customers who purchased Mortgage Endowment Policies, and ensure they do what they were intended to, i.e. pay off the mortgage at the end of the term. \n\nWhilst the banks were recording vast profits over the years, these policies were allegedly underperforming and will not meet the sums promised when taken out.  We can only deduce from this that these policies were mismanaged, and the banks should make good the shortfall.  Where customers made successful mis-selling compensation claims, the banks should deduct the derisory payments made.",
