            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The issue we have is that inflation is increasing and one of the reasons is the spiralling costs of fuel.\nOil is not an infinite resource and therefore we need to reduce our consumption.  This is easier said than done because when I get on on a dual carriage way or motorway I have to keep up with those around me, yes sometimes up to 80.\nTherefore in this global shortage, I move that until such time that the price comes down we reduce the national speed limit to 60 on motorways and duel carriage ways.\nThis will mean we will not feel obliged to keep up with the flow of traffic, we will reduce demand on petrol and also cut back on accidents as a side issue.",
