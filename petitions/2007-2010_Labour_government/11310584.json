            "background": "Few people know the actual words to the English national anthem, it's dated and uninspiring. \n\nEveryone knows Bohemian Rhapsody and it's almost always voted as the greatest song of all time by polls all over the place. It is by one of the most famous and successful English bands of all time.\n\nThe band is Queen (obviously) and so there is still some connection to the monarchy in it and everyone would join in pride to sing along whenever it's played.",
