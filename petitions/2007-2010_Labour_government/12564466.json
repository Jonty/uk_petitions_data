All property provided by the state would remain the property of the state. Money would not be claimed directly for MP's for living expenses for their second homes. \n\nThe second home 'location' would be fixed at the start of a term in office, and vacated at the end of a term, or on retirement from parliamentary business.\n\nMP's salaries and allowances would be adjusted accordingly, now that they would not have to maintain a second home themselves.",
