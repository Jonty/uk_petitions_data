        "background": "Many people have reached retirement age ie 60 or 65 and still need to work to pay mortgages and household bills. These are not well paid executives but ordinary working people struggling to keep a roof over their heads. They have paid their full contributions towards the State Pension Scheme and paid tax on their earnings all of their working lives and are effectively being taxed twice. They have not had the benefit of \ntax havens and clever accountants. Please give them a tax break which will assist them in continuing to support themselves and their families. Without having to choose to 'eat or heat'.",
