            "background": "Prime Minister, you have categorically failed this country. Your government's debt stands at unimaginable proportions  - 1/2 the country's GDP and at least another -\u00a31 trillion to be included with Lloyd's and RBS on the balance sheet. Your government's policy under financial catastrophe has been to mount an assault on Sterling's worthiness by continuing to inject billions of non-commodotised currency into circulation and billing the public for this monetary policy abuse by way of inflation and then wantonly encouraging them to spend during a crisis to conceal and ignore the toxic debt. You have betrayed all principles of sound economic management and your behaviour amounts to gross negligence. Not only do you fail to recognise the irreversible damage you have inflicted, you justify these policies and persist with trying persuade the public that we are well equipped to deal with the recession, an enormous untruth. Under any results-based review your position is untenable.",
