            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "NHS Charges should be abolished because:\n\n1)\tThe NHS was set up with the promise to cover healthcare from cradle to grave and for this to be free to all at the point of delivery.  By charging for patient care the NHS is betraying this promise.  It is disgraceful that people should be stripped of their home and life savings to pay for health care for which they were already covered through their National Insurance Contributions.\n\n2)\tBy including savings the Means Testing Procedure particularly penalises those who have been financially careful during their lives.  It is unfair and a disincentive to saving.  The charges made on savings can be unfavourably compared to Inheritance Tax, having a much lower starting threshold and a tax rate up to 100%.\n\n3)\tThe system uses political skulduggery to justify its implementation (e.g. renaming nursing care as social care which is not paid for).  It uses emotional blackmail to achieve its aims (people are reluctant to query or refuse the charges because it seems like a betrayal of their loved one).  This is not a good basis for a system which is highly unpopular, causes much worry and distress and which has not been carried forward in Wales or Scotland.",
