            "background": "The leaked emails, data files, program data etc. from the University of East Anglia\u2019s (UEA) Climate Research Unit (CRU) have largely been ignored or played down by the main-stream media.  The UEA have admitted that the leaked data \u2018is\u2019 theirs and the emails, data files, programs etc. are genuine.  The information contained in this leaked data allegedly implies that scientist\u2019s from around the world working with the CRU have manipulated or been advised to manipulate climate and other data to conform to the CRU\u2019s preferred results.  The CRU\u2019s results have gone to make up the IPCC\u2019s findings concerning Global Warming Theory, in turn this theory has been put forward as the foundation of the Copenhagen Treaty.  If the Copenhagen Treaty where to be ratified by the governments of the world it would be an endorsement based on a gross deception and a deep embarrassment to all signatories.",
