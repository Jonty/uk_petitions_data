        "background": "Support and subsidies for Scottish agriculture are retained under devolution, and UK government has a duty to compensate Scottish farmers. They have been unfairly punished for diseases in England, FMD having been caused by a failure in biosecurity at a DEFRA establishment. Scottish livestock farmers are further from these outbreaks than many parts of continental europe, and also UPWIND of the prevailing wind currents. They MUST NOT be used as pawns in party political games, and must be fully compensated NOW, in line with Westminsters duties and responsibilities.",
