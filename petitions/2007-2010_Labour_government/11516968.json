            "background": "It has taken several years for HMG to enact a Bill that allows Commercial Water Companies to take into their ownership all the private sewers that are acting as a millstone around home owners necks.\nIn the event of a collapse of sewers within private boundaries the cost to owners is enormous, running potentially into thousands of pounds. Many people, especially those who are getting into an age where it would be impossible for them to raise cash to pay for repairs.\nAfter vast amounts of consultation, both DEFRA and HMG have agreed with the Water Utilities should and will take this burden off home owners.\nPlease action the existing Bill ASAP each month and year this is allowed to stagnate the costs will rise for all concerned.",
