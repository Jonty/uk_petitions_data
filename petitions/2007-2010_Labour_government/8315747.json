            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Although access to the internet has made researching potential employers easier job advertisments are still packed with 'spin' and buzz words ('market rate salary', 'competitive package' etc). I propose that all employers placing an advert for a employment opportunity should be obliged to include a rating A to G (with A being the highest)based on their 'value' as an employer. Benefits such as: an employee pension scheme; Save As You Earn share option purchase scheme; staff discounts;  flexible working practices; 'green' (recycling etc) programmes; life insurance; employer loans to purchase train/ bus season tickets; staff restaurant; afiliated sports facilities; contributions to the local community/ charitable causes; adult/ work based training/ education support; profit sharing schemes etc would all enhance the employers score and make the process of choosing a employer with a responsible attitude to all their staff more transparent. The rating would be calculated inline with Government specified criteria similar to the energy ratings on electrical appliances and validated by external auditors.",
