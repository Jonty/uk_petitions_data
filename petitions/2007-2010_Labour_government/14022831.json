            "background": "The docking of lambs and piglets tails should be banned. For one of many reasons being because they like to wag them - so that they can get some enjoyment out of life and they wag their tails to express themselves. Children and young adults today will wonder why our current sheep and pigs are not allowed to keep their tails. It should be a requirement that the sheep and pigs are allowed to keep their tails as part of their welfare for their own health, wellbeing and peace of mind. Otherwise it is the equivalent of loosing a limb. The sheep and pigs will notice that their tails have been removed and the sheep and pigs will therefore not feel cared for. And it is distressing to look at lambs and piglets, sheep and pigs without their tails. And also because lambs and piglets, sheep and pigs look like they get great enjoyment and happiness from having a tail.",
