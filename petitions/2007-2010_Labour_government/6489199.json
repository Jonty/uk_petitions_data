        "background": "The most encouraging recycling scheme I have seen was in Ipswich, where a big \"wheelie\" bin was provided for all recyclable refuse. No piles of wet cardboard outside the house, no stacks of plastic bottles in every nook and cranny waiting for the fortnightly collection, no piles of glass bottles and tin cans causing potential hazard. In Colwyn Bay and many other areas, a plastic box and an open plastic sack is supposed to be sufficient to collect all glass, tins and paper. No service for plastic or cardboard! The paper sack has blown away twice. The plastic box is constantly plagued by seagulls that leave refuse everywhere. We lost a bin collection fortnightly to receive this substandard service!",
