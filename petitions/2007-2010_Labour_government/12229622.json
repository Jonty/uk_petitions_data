However, at the same time MP\u2019s are voting themselves above average pay and pension rises and claiming immorally high expenses.\nThey write the rules by which we must abide, via the control of Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue & Customs, then formulate vastly different rules for themselves.\nWe, the electorate, feel that this imbalance must cease immediately.  Pay and pensions should be directly linked to inflation whilst the rules for expenses should be the same as for the general public.",
