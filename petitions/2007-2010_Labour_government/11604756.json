            "background": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to do everything in his power to exercise justice for responsible pensioners who verifiably paid their statutory dues during the working life through income tax, national insurance contributions, SERPS or private pension, but who are currently denied access to council tax relief, rent allowance and cold weather payments.\n\nThis petition recognises that the government exercises a threshold for access to social security benefits but urges the Prime Minister to review the existing ceiling in respect of responsible pensioners in the light of the spiralling cost of living and the hardship it is inflicting on these marginalised senior citizens who, having made voluntary provision for retirement, are now increasingly obliged to resort to using meagre savings to meet their statutory obligations.\n\nThis petition further urges the Prime Minister to consider exempting marginalised pensioners in their seventies, eighties and beyond from paying council tax.",
