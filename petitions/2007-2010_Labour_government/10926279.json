            "background": "In 2007 The Derbyshire (Isle of Man (IOM)) was sold to Kaupthing, Singer and Friedlander (KSF) (IOM). Depositors were given a full parental guarantee by Kaupthing bank (Iceland).\n\nOn 9 Oct 2008, following events in the UK, when KSF (UK) fell into administration, the Isle of Man courts made a Provisional Liquidation Order in relation to KSF (IOM) Ltd.\n\nDepositors with KSF (IOM) now stand to lose hundreds of millions (\u00a3). Many here are just ordinary hard working people from the Isle of Man, UK based tax payers, ex-patriots working/living abroad, pensioners and other foreign nationals. Some have their whole life savings at stake and are absolutely heartbroken.\n\nWith only a \u00a350k guarantee in the IOM, depositors find themselves floating in limbo between the full guarantees offered by the UK to UK depositors in Icelandic banks, and the full guarantees offered to Icelanders by their own country.\n\nWe ask for help from the UK Government to resolve this obvious unfairness.\n\nPlease help. Sign our petition.",
