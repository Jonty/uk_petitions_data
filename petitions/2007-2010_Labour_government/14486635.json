            "background": "In the case of very serious crime by children under the age of eighteen, the Crown should have the power to test if the parents should be held criminally responsible for the actions of their children. The test should be on the balance of probability that their parenting was significantly to blame, or not, for the behaviour of their children. The test should be conducted in a high court with a judge and jury. If the test finds that they were significantly to blame they should face the legal consequences for the actions of their children as anyone else convicted of the same crime.",
