        "background": "Are you fed up of energy companies deliberately raising prices, far in excess of inflation. This is nothing more than profiteering, and needs to be addressed urgently. And never mind a windfall tax, just get them to reduce the price to a more resonable level so that hard pressed families and the elderly can afford to heat themselves. The labour party should be ashamed of itself.",
