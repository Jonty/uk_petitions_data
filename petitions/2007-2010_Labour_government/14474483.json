        "background": "The biggest waste of money, and waste of Fossil resources in Britain is through half of a house that is not being used being heated when nobody is using it.\nIt would cost a little more to make central heating with two circuits, with both circuits only being on when required for going to bed or getting up, but the long term cost and resource savings would be enormous, dwarfing even condensing boilers.",
