        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "South West Trains (SWT) are reducing Ticket Office Hours and cutting frontline staff to cut costs.  This will be to ensure that Shareholders still make money at the expense of the Fare Paying Passengers.  SWT were the first to introduce the \u201cSuper Off Peak\u201d fare whilst simultaneously increasing the Off Peak fare penalising anyone wishing to travel before 11.00 on a Weekday.\n\nSWT entered into the new Franchise with open eyes and understood precisely what they were signing up to which involved increasing income significantly.  SWT feel they can only make the necessary money by cutting staff and services available to passengers whilst imposing large fare increases. Also they are introducing Ticket Machines which do not give all cheap fares found at the Ticket Office.\n\nThere is a saying \u201cif you can\u2019t stand the heat get out of the kitchen\u201d.  If Stagecoach will not hand back the SWT Franchise it should be forfeited without compensation.",
