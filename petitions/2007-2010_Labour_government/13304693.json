Although, in any industry, it is right to highlight and root out bad practice, we believe the national media coverage of the Collections and Enforcement industries is routinely unfair and not representative. We call on the Government to make a statement to promote the good work done by the Collections and Enforcement industry and to encourage consumers and the national media to consider that people have a moral duty to repay what they owe, where they reasonably can, and that the Collections and Enforcement industry has the right and the responsibility to try to collect in a responsible fashion, which it does in the overwhelming majority of cases. If consumers do not pay then - just like good drivers having to pay for bad drivers through higher insurance premiums \u2013 everyone will suffer in higher interest rates and charges.",

            "background": "Collectors work very hard to support those customers who have genuine difficulties in paying and who will work with them, but all consumers should also understand that they have a morale duty to pay back what they owe.\n\nConsumers must understand that the morally right thing to do is to pay what is owed, in the time-frame agreed or in the quickest time that is reasonably possible.\n\nThe collections industry demands and deserves genuine fairness of its own and that does not mean the biased consumer-focused fairness so beloved of the local and national media and the government, but real fairness.\n\nOnly this true fairness will allow the Collections and Enforcement industry to play an important role in the fledgling economic recovery.",
