            "background": "I support the stance taken by many churches that the proposals under consideration for estimating water bills should be reviewed as those proposals bear no relation to the amounts of water either consumed or drained from church buildings or  churchyards. Using churchyards as some sort of template is totally unacceptable. Requirements for highway drainage are tried and tested and must pricipally involve hard surfaces. This cannot be true of churchyards; and of course, highways do not consume water so there is no parallel there. It would be instructive to know how say parks or farmland are assessed when considering graveyards.",
