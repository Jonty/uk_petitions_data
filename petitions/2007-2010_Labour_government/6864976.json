            "background": "70,000 children and women are stolen and abducted every year in China. The children (usually toddlers) are stolen from their parents and sold onto other couples who want to ensure they have a son to carry on the family line and look after them in their old age. The state policy of one child per couple means that for some it is too much of a risk to possibly give birth to a daughter who would marry and leave to join her new family. Much less hassle and expense to buy a stolen boy and pay the necessary backhander to the officials to turn a blind eye.  Less frequently, little girls are also traded to couples who wish to raise them to the age of 10 when they can set them to work and at 20 marry them off to their own son. There is an acute shortage of girls and young women in China. As a result, teenage girls are also abducted from their families and sold as \"instant wives\".  The Chinese government is well aware of this trade but is more interested in keeping its existence quiet than in dealing with it.  This silence cannot be allowed to continue.",
