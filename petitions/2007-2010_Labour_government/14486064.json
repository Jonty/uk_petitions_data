        "action": "Cut back green taxes on air travel",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The issue of global warming is far from decided. Taxing air travel has far-reaching negative impact on the UK. We believe by taxing air travel it has a negative influence on the economy resulting in job losses and lost revenue for the government. Furthermore, by increasing the cost of air travel, especially long-haul flights, we believe it interferes with the ability to maintain ties with family members who live in other countries and by making air travel too, expensive it will discourage the brightest from wanting to migrate to the UK. It is our belief there are other solutions to this issue such as giving airlines tax breaks to buy new planes and landing fee discounts to airlines that use new airplanes. We therefore respectfully request that green taxes on air travel be repealed.",
