In England you can leave it to who you want which causes huge family sorrow, quarrels and ill feeling and leaves those  left out feeling unloved and very often, wondering why.\nOur system leaves all family members vunerable to being excluded and is very open to abuse, the European system would effectively stop this from happening.",
