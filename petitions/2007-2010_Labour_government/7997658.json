            "action": "immediately remove the time wasting and anachronistic 'division' process in both the Houses of Parliament in this country, to one where those present may vote by pressing a button without leaving their seat, thereby creating much more time for our politicians to get on with dealing with the problems of this country instead of wandering in and out of their respective house to lodge a vote.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Having watched the vote on the EU Treaty live on BBC last night (21 January 2008) I was, again, appalled by the cattle market atmosphere which develops in the House of Commons when the Speaker shouted 'Division - clear the lobbies' to be followed an inordinate amount of wasted time before the result was known.  Both the recent democratic innovations in this country, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly have electronic voting;  the infamous EU also has electronic voting, allowing votes to be cast and known within 15 seconds.  For MANY decades other countries, including Russian, have had electronic voting.  This method of voting in our Houses of Parliament would speed up the process, make politicians more cost effective and allow them to get much more business done than they are able at the moment.",
