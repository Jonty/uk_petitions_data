        "background": "Professor Eric Sidney Watkins (OBE) has served motorsport with distinction for several decades. The improvements to safety within the sport have been dramatic over the years, and many are attributable to this Liverpudlian neurosurgeon. Medical Cars and helicopters at F1 races were upon his insistance, and he has saved the lives of many drivers, including the later double World Champ, Mika Hakkinen at the 1995 Australian GP. Time to give Prof Sid the knighthood he deserves?",
