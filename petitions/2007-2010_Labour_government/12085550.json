If the police came to interview us formally we would be removed from the property and taken to the local police station where my interview would be recorded and I could have a solicitor present. I therefore ask the Prime Minister to reform the law and implement the following changes. All parents being interviewed by Social Services or Cafcass should have the right to have a Legal Advisor present, and every interview should be recorded for the same reason's as a police interview, because this forms a record of evidence.",
