It seemed the perfect solution.\n\nBut the council disagreed. Joe\u2019s bungalow would be \u2018intrusive\u2019, planners said. And anyway, his case was not exceptional enough for them to waive strict laws and allow the bungalow to be built. \n\nThis decision must be overturned and common sense must prevail over petty regulations.",
