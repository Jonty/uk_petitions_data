            "background": "As we await the test case on unfair bank charges, the FSA have sided with the banks and have let them suspend any more refunds or compensation payments until the case is heard. Why should the banks not deal with any claims through the County Court until the test case is heard? This FSA ruling plays directly into the banks hands, as they will delay for as long as possible in order to recieve maximum benefit from keeping customers money for longer. It's a disgrace, especially as it's the banks integrity in question not the consumer. The test case is long awaited, but not at the expense of consumers who are left out of pocket, or who have already spent time and money trying to claim back these unlawful charges.",
