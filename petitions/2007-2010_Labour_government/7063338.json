            "background": "Without wishing to pass judgement on the existence of so-called psychic abilities, there are undoubtedly some people who claim psychic abilities but actually use deception and trickery (such as cold reading) to defraud the public. To counter this, the government should regulate and license psychics to reassure the public that the psychic they are consulting has genuine ability. Licenses should only be issued to those psychics who can demonstrate psychic ability in double-blind tests, under laboratory conditions and scientific scrutiny. Unlicensed psychics will not be permitted to operate psychic services in the UK, except for entertainment purposes.",
