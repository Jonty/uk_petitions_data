It already has specialist functions in the Gaming licence national centre, national alcohol intelligence centre and further new tobacco centralisation work could be sited there.So come on Gordon (and Alastair) as an ex chancellor get yourself down there and cut a ribbon on new work HMRC could put there and keep Greenock's long tradition with Customs alive - please !",
