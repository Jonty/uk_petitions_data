        "background": "Skateboarders, as well as tourists, commuters and families are sick and tired of intoxicated teenagers ruining their Friday and Saturday evenings by means of getting drunk and popping pills down on the SouthBank.\n\nSpecifically the underwell where the skateboarders are, though very rarely directly underneath the underwell. Once again, just to make a clear definition, the people who are causing trouble are not the skateboarders.\n\nIt is the emo/scene/'different' teenagers who are causing the trouble and should be stopped. The security and police are not doing enough. Im my opinion, local authorities should wait at the local stations and catch them before they even have time to destroy and give a bad reputation to a national landmark as well as what tax payers have payed for.",
