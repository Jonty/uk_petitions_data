            "background": "I am sure that I not alone in thinking that, dispite the late night drinking law being introduced, hoping that it would prevent binge drinking, it has in fact place more work on to our police officers. I believe that if pubs were able to serve alcohol between certain times,i.e. lunch times and evenings, it would encourage people to drink more responsabley.\ni also feel that since children were allowed to frequent pubs with their parents,it is now thought by them to be perfectly acceptable to drink, which is why we are now experiencing the drinking problem that we have with our younger population. we need new legislation to make it an offence to be caught drinking in the street. after all, it is now an offence to smoke in a public place, why not discapline drinkers too.",
