Pope Benedict repeatedly espouses irresponsible notions in direct conflict with the progressive efforts and values of the British people.  \n\nTenets such as \u201cabortion is a crime\u201d, \u201chumanity needs saving from homosexuality\u201d and \u201ccondoms aggravate the HIV/AIDS epidemic\u201d would not have gotten this government elected and therefore it is immoral to spend your voters' hard-earned tax money in this way.",
