We believe that the value of a transparent, accountable government in which true debate can be heard outweighs ministers' concerns about their own image or how the debate is presented to the public.\n\nThis petition is founded on the principles of Free Speech and has nothing to do with whether or not Professor Nutt's opinions are correct.",
