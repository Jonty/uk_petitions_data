            "background": "The food waste caused by multisaves/BOGOF (\u201cbulk promotions\u201d) is appalling.  We propose:\n\n(i) bulk promotions are not permitted on perishable food;\n(ii) increasing the price for a single item around the same time as the bulk promotion is deceitful and should not be permitted;\n(iii) the price for a single item should be clearly displayed alongside the bulk promotion;\n(iv) products should not be on bulk promotions indefinitely, but rather for a limited period of time (c.f. sales where shops are not meant to promote a product as being on sale indefinitely).\n\nThe practice is also simply unfair for single people who cannot benefit from promotions.  Even for larger households, promoting goods by X% off rather than the equivalent bulk promotion, would benefit larger households to the same extent as the present bulk promotions.  Bulk promotions also make shopping more confusing \u2013 trying to figure out what is in and what is out of the promotion; calculating the single item cost, the judgement of whether you would make use of an extra item, and ensuring it is honoured at the till\u2026",
