            "background": "Our government should not let current challenges distract it from the still ever-present\nthreat of a severe flu pandemic, such as avian flu becoming easily human transmissible. (For example, in Jan 2009 China suffered more H5N1 deaths than it had it over the previous year). Such a pandemic could kill tens to hundreds of millions across the globe. It remains one of the top handful of threats to humanity in terms of likelihood and lethality.\nCurrent HMG plans are to stockpile  anti-viral drugs for only up to 50% of the population  and not to attempt any \u201cpriming\u201d of the population via a pre-pandemic vaccine, due the to the difficulty of ensuring that the vaccine stockpiled will actually protect against the strain of pandemic flu that eventually emerges. However, in 2008, a universal vaccine against type A influenza (both H5N1 and the 1918-1919 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d are type A) was successfully trialled in humans by Acambis. This petition therefore requests that the Government stockpiles anti-virals for the entire population and reviews its policy against \u201cpriming\u201d in the light of the very latest scientific developments, i.e. the development of universal flu vaccines.",
