            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The reccesion is having a serious effect on both the Waste Management & Construction industries. Whilst inflation and interest rates are at their lowest for many years, landfill tax is planned to increase this year by another 25%. The Waste Managenent and Recycling industry has seen the value of recyled commodoties fall and therefore we have to consider passing on a higher proportion of the LFT to the producer, who in turn is feeling the squeeze as much as any one else. This is not a call to cancel the LFT but merely a simple proposal to postpone this years planned increase until April 1st 2010 in order to give industry a greater chance of trading through the difficult times ahead.",
