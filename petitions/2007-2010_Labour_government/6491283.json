        "background": "As one of  million people who have been economically displaced by the Mugabe dictatorship, I humbly request that the British Government implement economic and trade sanctions against Zimbabwe. \n\nThis action may hurt ordinary Zimbabweans in the short term, but we the undersigned feel that the extraordinary situation prevailing in the country calls for extra-ordinary measures. Mugabe's representative have called the current personal sanctions against a few of his closest henchmen \"illegal sanctions\" and they have made great efforts to portray these personal sanctions as economic sanctions in the media. The time has come to show them what real economic sanctions are, and bring more pressure to bear on their illegitimate regime.",
