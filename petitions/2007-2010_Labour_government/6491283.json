Mugabe's representative have called the current personal sanctions against a few of his closest henchmen \"illegal sanctions\" and they have made great efforts to portray these personal sanctions as economic sanctions in the media. The time has come to show them what real economic sanctions are, and bring more pressure to bear on their illegitimate regime.",
