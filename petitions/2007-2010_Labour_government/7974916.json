However the recent events, the murder of civilians, depriving them of food, water, heat, electricity and a basic standard of life, this is not acceptable and we have to use our voice to shape the future. Our government is quick in its condemnation when israelis are harmed, and rightly so. However the palestinians do not qualify for such compassion when their blood is spilt. Please condemn a crime, even when committed by your \"friends\". The double standards and bias seeM to be getting worse, please stop it and behave as an upright, leading nation should.",
