After having spent the time not driving that their licence has been suspended for the \"driver\" is unlikely to have improved their skill, rather the lack of practice will have made  him/her a worse driver. So before the suspended licence is returned the \"driver\" must take and pass a new driving test to prove capability and suitability to be on the roads.",
