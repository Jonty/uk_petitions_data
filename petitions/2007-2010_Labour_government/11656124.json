        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The purpose of this petition is to try to uphold plans to divert traffic down Renshaw Street in Liverpool, after 11 months of another Big Dig project which although was about 2 years ago, saw a lot of independent business lose revenue. These businesses are still trying to recover from the losses. This was due to lack of access to customers to the stores which were isolated for 11 months. One was a 153 year old business (Lewis\u2019s), Starting in 1856 Lewis\u2019s soon grew across the country. As shopping habits changed, Lewis's decided to refocus and become a local retailer in Liverpool. The store was taken over by Vergo, Who love keeping it local, gave small businesses across Merseyside the chance to run city centre concessions. The roadworks will last for over 2 months. For a small company which has just got out of losses of \u00a31.8m (Before the Big Dig they made good profits) due to the last Big Dig- And find it hard to attract shoppers back since, I think it could be right to at least uphold this round of roadwork\u2019s for the Central Village scheme. What\u2019s better, the loss of around of more than 264 jobs in the current economic climate or adhering to Regulators guidelines?",
