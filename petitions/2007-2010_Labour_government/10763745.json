            "background": "As profits and shares slump and profitable companies threatened with increased taxation consider moving their Head Offices out of the UK then the pensions paid to the nation's real workers are put at great risk by the greedy few who will always be paid inflation linked pensions directly out of taxation. \n\nMoney that should be going into workers' pension funds must not be diverted into the pockets of the idle and unemployed.\n\nIf we hand over our hard earned wages to the Pension companies, and they in turn invest it in the companies we work for then the Government and its employees must support that and not steal it.  It is wrong that those on the public payroll whose bottomless pension pot is the taxpayer can reap the rewards of power without taking the same risks as those they should serve.",
