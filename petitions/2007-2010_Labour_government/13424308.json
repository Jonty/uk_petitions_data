            "background": "They rob us out of prison, and we pay for their luxuries in prison, Why?\n\nWhy is it that prisoners do not pay for TV licences when MOD bases and accommodation are not exempt from TV licensing laws.   \nService families accommodation and single living accommodation must also be licensed separately.  \nA home TV Licence does not cover people whilst living on base. \nThe same rules apply to students in lodges, lodgers, etc.  So why are criminals let off? \nThis surely sends the wrong message? Criminals should not have TVs, it is prison, if they must because of some stupid Human Rights law, then they must also pay for the licence themselves!",
