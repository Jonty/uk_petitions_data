            "background": "For years women have been discriminated, but now i believe we are starting to live in a society where men's rights are being put second place. Yes women may still be discriminated when it comes to pay, but we are living in a society where men aren\u2019t given the same rights as women when it comes to maternity/ paternity leave. men want to spent time with kids, and if women and men are to have equal rights at work and in law, then why aren\u2019t they when it comes to paid leave? in addition men are discriminated when it comes to divorces, they get less settlements but when its the other way round and the guy is the main earner, women get more. Lastly men get discriminated when it comes to kids. Why cant men have custody of kids? in society today judges give custody to women but men are meant to be just as capable. at the end of the day if you are going to discriminate on men on these things, you can discriminate on women on other things. Yet women are getting more rights and men are losing many rights compared to women.",
