            "background": "The group of substances known as neonicotinoids could be banned in the EU. These substances have been shown to have a devastating impact on honey bees across the world, and a number of European countries have subsequently banned their use. We are urging the UK to do the same by supporting new legislation.\n\nHiltrud Breyer, the MEP overseeing the legislation explains, the new rules \u2018will create a win-win situation for all \u2013 for consumers\u2019 health, for the protection of the environment, but also for Europe\u2019s farming industry\u2019. The UK government is almost alone in opposing adequate safeguards.\n\n1] Neonicotinoid pesticides are systemic chemicals that work their way through the plant and attack the nervous system of any insect it comes into contact with. The substances also get into the pollen and the nectar and this is how they damage beneficial insects such as bees.",
