        "background": "Development charity Oxfam has released a statement claiming that the Treasury plans to slash the UK's international aid funding in this Wednesday's Budget (22/4/2009).\n\nThe charity said Chancellor Alistair Darling will use the recession as an excuse to cut up to \u00a3860m a year in planned aid spending, reducing it from \u00a37.5bn to \u00a36.6bn. It says that combined with the effects of a weaker pound, the value of UK aid could be reduced by more than a third in 2010.\n\nThis will send out exactly the wrong message just weeks after the Prime Minister successfully lobbied his fellow leaders to provide a bailout for poor people hit hard by the global downturn.\n\nThe UK should do what it can to help the innocent victims of the recession through maintaining its International aid.",
