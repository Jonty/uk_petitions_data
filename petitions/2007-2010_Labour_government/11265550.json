It's stupid. Please stop this.\n\n'The noisette triangle' is now 'the green one'. Why isn't the new Audi R8 called 'the fast one'? Why isn't an old English sheepdog called 'the fluffy one'?\n\nIt's stupid, that's why. Bring back the old names.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Cadbury removing crunchies from Heroes. That's offensive.",
