            "background": "To buy back properties from the people who are about to lose their homes at a fair price, to reinstate these homes under the control of the local authorites and to rent back to these families. We all have to pay to rehouse these families, the cost of the courts, the damage to the children pushed from pillar to post, arguments and break ups stem from problems like this. Society needs to see that the government really cares that families will remain together, it will cost money but at what cost? I would rather pay to keep families in their homes as opposed to rented accomodation at twice the price, a broken society is the last thing we need when all looks bleak. We saved the banks from their greed and mismanagement, now start to manage what really matters THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN",
