            "background": "In most secondary schools at the present time, Shakespear is being tought in English lessons and at GCSE level and exams. This is a very difficult subject for pupils to learn because of the extremely complex story lines and language. Students have enough to think about such as more important subjects such as maths and bussiness studies and other parts of the english curriculum than what shkespear wrote. I myself don't see the point of children learning about shakespear any more because of the these reasons",
