One example is RBS whose bailout will cost 1p on income tax for every tax payer for the next decade.\nBy taking excessive risks, a few company execs have been able to feather their nests at massive global economic cost.\nIn these exceptional times, we ask the PM to take exceptional measures and enact retrospective and targeted legislation to correct those excesses. \nThis would include the removal of pension schemes above and beyond state mandated levels.",
