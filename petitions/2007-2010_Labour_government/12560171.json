            "background": "Because home care for the elderly is means tested, it means that many elderly people do not receive help with every day things, such as washing and cleaning, which most people take for granted.  This leaves their families with huge burdens, or, if they do not have families, it means that they become isolated, or have to move into residential care, which is not always the right option.  Simple and basic homecare for every elderly person, whether they are rich or poor, such as being helped to change their beds, would make such a difference to so many people's lives, and is therefore worth every penny.",
