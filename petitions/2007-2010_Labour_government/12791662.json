        "background": "As one of many children of former (and now deceased) Bletchley Park workers in WW2, I have always been concious of the pride in which my mother and other relations held thier contribution to the War Effort and the trust that was put in them at the time. To the day my mother died in 1993 she never spoke in any detail of her work as she considered herself to still be under the obligation of secrecy that she signed up to in 1940. As members of her family we, like perhaps many others, carried that pride with us on her behalf and continue to do so today.",
