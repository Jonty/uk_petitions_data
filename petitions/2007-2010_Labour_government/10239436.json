            "background": "Majid Ahmed, 18, has been removed from a medical degree at Imperial College London. Ahmed, from Bradford, has 4 A grades at A-Level. Why was he turned away? Because he was convicted of Burglary in 2005. He received a four-month referral order for community service. The conviction is now legally spent. Majid moved schools and started to work with disabled charities and undetook work experience placements. He has clearly taken postive steps to change. I dont know Mr Ahmed, I only read about his story in the Guardian this morning, but I think he deserves his place.  \n\n\"I had the place and then it was taken off me. I am overwhelmed by anger that I have let something like this affect my life. I'm a kid who has grown up surrounded by violence and drugs. Give me a chance and I'll show the universities that I'm not a bad guy. I won't risk their reputation.\" (Majid Ahmed - The Guardian - 1st July 2008)\n\n\"To be rejected in this way, having apparently been open and honest with the university, seems very unfair\". (Stephen Williams, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on universities - The Guardian - 1st July 2008)",
