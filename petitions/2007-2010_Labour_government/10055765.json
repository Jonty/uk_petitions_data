            "background": "On the 14th June 2008, detainees at Campsfield Immigration Center rioted again.\n\nCampfield is notorious for squalor, terrible food, bullying, poor healthcare, insistence on removing men to places that the whole world knows are unsafe like Iraq, Congo and Afghanistan, use of isolation and removal to other immigrant prisons to punish men for small acts of resistance such as refusal of food. Men with families have been removed far away in reprisal.\n\nMost detaineed are political refugees fleeing danger, torture and even death from countries such as Nigeria, Algeria, Ghana, Turkey, India and Zaire. They are held without charge, without time limit, without proper reasons given, and without proper access to legal representation. Amnesty International report that these are breaches of internationally recognised human rights. The former Chief Inspector of HM Inspectorate of Prisons and The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture have condemned conditions at Campsfield House.\n\nPlease shut this facility down and provide humane, dignified and civilied facilities for processing asylum applicants.",
