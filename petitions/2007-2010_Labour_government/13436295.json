            "action": "disassociate the British government from the Pope's opposition to women's reproductive rights and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality. Ahead of the Pope's visit to Britain in 2010, we also urge the Prime Minister to condemn the Pope's opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV and the Vatican's lie that all condoms have tiny holes through which the HIV virus can pass.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Pope opposes the right of women to control their own fertility through contraception and abortion, and opposes legal equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. \n\nHe also opposes the use of condoms to stop the spread of HIV, which is putting millions of lives at risk, and has allowed the Vatican to promote the lie that condoms spread HIV because latex is porous to the virus (sic). \n\nThe Pope is a homophobe. He has condemned same-sex relationships as a \u2018grave depravity,' \u2018debased', 'a tendency towards an intrinsic moral evil,' \u2018objectively disordered' and \u2018contrary to natural law.' \n\nHe has attacked gay marriages as 'evil' and vilified supporters of gay equality as 'gravely immoral'. He has also denounced gay equality as a 'deviant trend' and condemned same-sex love as being 'without any social value.' \n\nAt the UN, the Vatican has blocked resolutions supporting women\u2019s reproductive rights and LGBT equality. It has refused to support UN statements condemning homophobic discrimination and the imprisonment, torture, murder of LGBT people.",
