Facile and silly presentations insult the intelligence of the viewer. They have become part of the television overpaid showtime culture. Please save us from all these \"actor/presenters\", - cut the glitzy presentations and go back to old fashioned weather reporting/forecasting in the style of the shipping forecast. \nLooking out of the window each day provides a more accurate idea than what this lot give.  Barbecue year indeed!",
