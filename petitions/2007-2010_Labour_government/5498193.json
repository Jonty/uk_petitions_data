            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In light of the recent terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow police officers should be routinely equipped with firearms (such as they are in many other developed countries such as on the continent and in the USA) so that they are better able to tackle terrorist attacks and the recent spate of stabbings and shootings within London and the surrounding areas. For example - with the terrorist incident at Glasgow one of the perpetrators was noted to be carrying a suicide belt - if he had been able to detonate it the casualties could be enormous - in other developed countries where the police carry firearms this would not have been an issue as the police would be both equipped and trained to shoot the terrorist dead in such a case, thereby protecting the public.",
