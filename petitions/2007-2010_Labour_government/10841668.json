            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I am concerned that the introduction of EPCs for small / older commercial property will frustrate what is already a difficult market.  Whilst I recognise the value of providing EPC's for new / institutional stock, I believe they will be meaningless for the majority of occupiers of smaller buildings of say less than 1000 sq m.  With a cost of \u00a3500 - \u00a31000 on average it is an expense most companies / individuals can well do without in the current climate.  I would therefore propose with immediate effect that the introduction should be postponed for any second hand commercial stock of  less than 1000 sq m to enable their introduction / benefit to be fully reviewed",
