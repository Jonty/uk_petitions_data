            "background": "Are you totally satisfied with the way in which your monthly Gas or Electric Bill is presented? Are you able to make a straight price comparison between your supplier and any other? \n\nMy view is that Bills should do away with Tiered pricing structures because that is very confusing to the consumer when it comes to calculating and checking their monthly bill. We need SIMPLIFICATION, ie If your meter has used a 100 units in a month then we need a pricing policy that ignores calorific value and Kilo Watt Hour conversions and instead provides a cost where you understand the cost per unit used of your meter reading. This added with a complete abolition of tiered rates will allow the consumer to make a real 'Apple with Apple price comparison when shopping around and not the Apple with Pears scenario as it is now'. We know the Energy companies have done this for their benefit only and will protest against change because they wish to remain competitive but the real fact of the matter is that we have no real valid way of making an informed choice under the present pricing regime.",
