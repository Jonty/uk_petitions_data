            "background": "I live in Newbury Berks and as a pet owner i have had to deal with 4 very stressed animals during the last 4 - 5 weeks worth of fireworks. On Monday 17th November my beloved dog Tessa sadly passed away due to heart disease, as we humans know stress is not good for this condition and i am certain that the fireworks played a major role due to the stress and anxiety that she suffered. I feel the time has come to ask for fireworks to be restricted to the November the 5th only, if at all as it really celebrates terrorism and since when do we support that.",
