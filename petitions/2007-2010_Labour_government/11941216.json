These imports are placing UK animals at risk as well as putting additional pressures on UK equine charities. We ask the government to ensure that all equines imported into the UK conform with the Animal Health Act 1981, the Importation of Animals Order 1977 and the Animal and Animal Products regulations 2006.",
