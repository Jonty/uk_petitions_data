            "background": "The government have already killed off the Post Office by opening up the market for competition instead of leaving the Post Office as a monopoly. Now they intend to tax the redundancy pay of the sub-post masters adding insult to injury and causing even more heart ache for those being closed.\n\nThe government should not be allowed to class this pay off as money earned and therefore take tax. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious that so many individuals have felt they have been affected by these closures and have signed many petitions to try and save local Post Offices. Has anyone of these individuals ever stopped to think about those behind the counter? Their families? The affect this loss of employment will have on these people?\n\nIf people really care about the Post Office then surely they care about those running the business. Please sign the petition to ensure that those affected the most don\u2019t suffer anymore.",
