It can even be helpful for the user to gain help from someone enjoying their hobby and hearing something that they can assist with as i've heard in the past.  It is illegal to listen to anything on a radio scanner except licensed broadcast stations (Radio 1, etc), Amateur Radio and Weather Stations.  Why can't it be allowed to listen to anything unless the user of such a frequency states when apply or editing their license information that they do not wish to allow their frequency to be monitored?",
