        "background": "The Deaf and Hard-of-hearing community experience an unparalleled degree of lack of communication in regards to public transport. In the world of the hearing there are enough complaints regarding unscheduled platform changes, and for the Deaf population this is magnified tenfold. The basic standard of having announcements displayed visually on screens as well as on an audible tannoy is not met, particularly when alterations are made at the last minute. A second issue with the train platforms for those without hearing and in some cases speech, is the \u2018Help Point\u2019, the use of microphones and speaker systems for people within the Deaf community makes it impossible to operate to any understandable degree. These Issues are incredibly inconvenient but easily rectifiable. By the inclusion of a simple type screen at \u2018Help Points\u2019 and visual displays of train times or platform changes, equal possibilities for those who are Deaf and Hard-of-hearing can be met.",
