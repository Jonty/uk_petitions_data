            "background": "A very significant number of children, especially those who are less able or from deprived backgrounds, find it very difficult to learn in the current education environment. Many subjects taught are dull and irrelevant to very many children. The facts pumped into them are of no use outside the school gates and it just turns them off learning altogether.\nSchools should focus on engaging children in interesting topics which are relevant to their lives such as citizenship, good communication and relationship skills and money management. \nSchools should also spend more time ensuring children can read, write and do simple maths before moving on to more complex work or some children will forever be left behind and will become totally disengaged from the learning process.\nIsn't it about time we brought the education system into the 21st century?",
