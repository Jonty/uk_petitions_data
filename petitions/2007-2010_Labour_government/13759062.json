        "background": "No one in Government should be able to sell off Englands - land - gold - property - Royal Mail or other assetts.  These belong to England to be looked after for future generations they are not for use by whichever political party that is in power at the time.  The government is in power to look after this country not sell parts of it off whenever they feel like it.  Just because they have got us into a financial mess does not mean they can sell off the countries gold etc to get themselves off the hook.  If past generations had not built up this country there would not have been the gold - property etc that we have now - we must not allow it to be sold.",
