The Amazon Rainforest is being cut down at alarming rates because it makes goverments in certain South American countries money e.g. Brazil. We wish to either lease or purchase a reasonable amount of the rainforest in order to protect it from harm and keep it for safe future generations. By owning a area of the rainforest for example 2.5% it would encourage other nations and possibly the EU to follow suit and this would save one of the most valuable assets we have. \n\nAfter all the Amazon is ' The Most Beautiful of all of Gods Creations'.",
