        "background": "We the people who are the tax providers and financial backers of this great nation wish to save the greatest gift given to us by Mother Nature and God. The Amazon Rainforest is being cut down at alarming rates because it makes goverments in certain South American countries money e.g. Brazil. We wish to either lease or purchase a reasonable amount of the rainforest in order to protect it from harm and keep it for safe future generations. By owning a area of the rainforest for example 2.5% it would encourage other nations and possibly the EU to follow suit and this would save one of the most valuable assets we have. \n\nAfter all the Amazon is ' The Most Beautiful of all of Gods Creations'.",
