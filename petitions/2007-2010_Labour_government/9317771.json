            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Under the new labour government private finance in the NHS has increased and latest moves to introduce polyclinics are part of the gradual NHS privatisation.\n\nPolyclinics aim to provide quicker access to services at lower cost however they are the destruction of the traditional family doctor. This does not allow for the fact that most frequent users of the NHS are those with chronic conditions and the elderly but these plans make these patients travel longer distances and remove any familiarity with those treating them meaning worse patient communication and more anonymity for these vulnerable patients.\n\nCorporate involvement in the NHS has already failed people only need to look at the financial disasters that are PFI hospitals and the poor quality of services from companies such as GSL in terms of  food and transport.\n\nThis petition calls on the p.m. to return to the founding principles of the NHS which is provision of a nationalised health service and also to consult primary healthcare providers over future plans rather than experts in robotic surgery so that the voiceless patients with chronic conditions and the elderly can have a fair say in the future of the NHS.",
