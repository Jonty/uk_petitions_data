            "background": "Changes are planned for the way water companies charge Scout Groups in England and Wales for the disposal of rainwater.\n\nIn the past, organisations like Scout Groups and places of worship have not been charged for the surface water which runs into sewers. \n\nGroups have reported an increase in water costs of between \u00a360 and \u00a3600 a year. This represents between 1% and 25% of their overall budgets. \n\nFor example, 1st Weston and Weston Point Scout Group in Cheshire are now being charged \u00a3564 each year. When added to their metered water charges this accounts for around one third of their total annual budget.\n\nThe changes are not universal but will affect Scout Groups who own or lease their Meeting Place. At present only some of the water companies have implemented the charges but Ofwat, the water regulator, is determined to see all water companies introduce them by 2010.",
