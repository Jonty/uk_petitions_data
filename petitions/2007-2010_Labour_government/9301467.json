Everyone wants peace in our time, freedom from fear and religious persecution, respect for differences, harmonious communities to raise our families and stable societies in which the economy can flourish - but these threats still need to be taken seriously. \n\nPlease examine some kind of registration system - like bail conditions, so movements can be monitored. Innocent, peaceful Muslims will soon pressurise more extremist elements into proper conduct for the greater good ! This solution will tackle racial tensions from WITHIN, communities rather than WITHOUT Muslims.\n\nEnjoying rights of citizenship requires responsibilities also.",
