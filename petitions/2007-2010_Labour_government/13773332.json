            "background": "Halifax sent a letter to us to accept the new overdraft charges.  Many people and children are on poverty people or on income support or students cannot afford to pay up to \u00a331 pounds per month with these new overdraft fees.  It is very difficult for them to repay overdraft facility or to pay with low credits!  \n\nEspecially on current difficult economics situation does not help.\n\nIn letter says \n\n* if you use an arranged overdraft up to \u00a32500, we'll charge you \u00a31 per day\n* if you use an arranged overdraft over \u00a32500, we'll charge you \u00a32 per day\n* if you use an unarranged overdraft, we'll charge you \u00a35!\n\nFor deaf customers, some halifax branches refuse to provide sign language interpreters - extremely difficult for them to communicate with Halifax Building Society, now Halifax expect them to pay new charges!  New Terms and Conditions without Sign Language Access or translation!\n\nIt is short notice to ask us to accept the changes on December 6th!",
