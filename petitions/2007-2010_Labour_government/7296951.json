        "background": "As a passionate and proud Welshman, I feel many of our historical hero's are falling by the wayside in today's modern society through lack of education and remembrance.\n\nNone more so than the last recognised prince of Wales Owain Glyn Dwr. \n\nThis petition is to help educate and remind the Welsh people, as well as other's within the United Kingdom, of our deep and rich heritage. Whether it be a full day, a half day or at very least a mention within our media, I truly believe that this date should be recognised and celebrated as it is sure to bring a true sense of national pride that would unite all of Wales.\n\nBy remembering Owain in this way, it would provide the possible impetus for the non Welsh speakers of Wales to study more into the History of Wales and possibly begin to take an interest in learning the language that perhaps they have forgotten through non residency or their day to day roles.",
