            "background": "Stephen Robert Irwin (22 February 1962 \u2013 4 September 2006), known simply as Steve Irwin and nicknamed \"The Crocodile Hunter\", was an iconic Australian television personality, wildlife expert, and conservationist. He achieved worldwide fame from the television program The Crocodile Hunter, an internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series co-hosted with his wife Terri Irwin. Together, they also co-owned and operated Australia Zoo, founded by his parents in Beerwah, Queensland. He died in 2006 after being fatally pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef.\n\nSteve's legacy will go on with the repeated showings of his excellent programmes which brought nature closer to all of us, and at the same time remained fun and watchable for the whole family.",
