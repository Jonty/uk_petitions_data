            "background": "Utility Companies are wrongly charging extra money from faithful, well disciplined, prompt, CASH Payers.\nA bank confirmed that the Direct Debit Charge to a Business Account for Customers paying a \u00a3200 regular bill, is more expensive per transaction, than a customer paying by CASH with a Giro Credit Slip each time. This cash payment, once paid is processed entirely automatically into the customers account within the business concerned, without need for any other employee to even wink at the customers Account.\nIt is therefore unreasonable, and inordinate for a company to charge extra money for faithful, prompt, cash payers. \nCash is extremely important for the individual\u2019s freedom, personal money control, and discipline.\n I appeal to the Government and all readers, to help get this extra charge for prompt, cash payers removed.\n Prompt, cash payers need to be honoured, NOT surcharged, please. \n\nReaders, please support this \u2013do have your say by signing, and pray to The Lord for victory.",
