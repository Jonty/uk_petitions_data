            "background": "The changing of clocks backwards and forwards causes inconvenience to every man, woman and child in the UK. It creates exceptional problems for certain sufferers, particularly of CFS/M.E. and various age-related diseases.\nThe 1968-71 trial of British Standard Time demonstrated that over 1,000 fewer people were killed or seriously injured each year by adopting British Summer Time for the whole year.\n\nFixing the clocks does not impact upon farmers or farm animals because they operate by when it is daylight, not the time on the clock.\n\nWill the Government please stop this unnecessary hang-over from World War One, move forward in the 21st century and adopt a single British Standard Time for the whole year.",
