        "background": "It is evident that the current government have lost the support and confidence of a majority of the British public.  Recent policies seem to almost deliberately ignore public opinion (\"pay-as-you-drive\" for example) and seem not to take into account people living on a budget by increasing fuel prices without apparently bothering about the \"knock on effects\" to consumers (i.e. food costs more).  \n\nAdd to this shocking lapses in Data Protection, the obscene nationalisation of Northern Rock, total lack of immigration control, armed forces starved of resources AND still expected to fight.  You see a country whose population have had enough.  This year's budget was the final straw, as it now seems that people prepared to work are being taxed to death to support the workshy.",
