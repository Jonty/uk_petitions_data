            "background": "While Westminster fails to act!!\n\nScottish Parliament introduced new legislation called the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007, which introduced a statutory framework for adult protection work, yet Westminster prefers to ignore the seriousness of the problem while hundreds of thousands of elderly people are having their homes, benefits and savings stolen by members of their own family or care workers.\nSometimes the elderly are not in a position to know they are being abused because of reduced mental capacity. This Financial abuse can include the simple theft of money and possessions. But it sometimes involves \"more subtle\" pressure from family members, who seek to withhold benefits or force elderly relatives into selling their homes, and the signs are that with the current economical situation this type of abuse is on the increase and nothing is being done to stop it.\n\nWe demand that the government act immediately to ensure elderly and Vulnerable adults are protected with the perpetrators of these crimes being brought to justice!",
