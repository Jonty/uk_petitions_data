            "background": "We believe Mexican food to be the finest cuisine in the world, and, as such, want the Prime Minster to actively encourage Taco Bell's parent company Yum! to begin franchises of its budget restaurants here in the UK. They provide quick, tasty food at inexpensive prices with minimal fuss, as well as excellent employment opportunities for young people and investors.\n\nThey have a large range of salads, wraps and tortilla dishes which we feel will encourage the populace away from less healthy fare - such as hamburgers, pizzas and the like.\n\nWe believe that in a modern Britain, a restaurant chain such as Taco Bell can add something to the average high street that other fast food businesses cannot.",
