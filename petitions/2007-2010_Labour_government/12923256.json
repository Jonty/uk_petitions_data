            "background": "In direct contravention of Article 239 of the Honduran constitution, President Zelaya sought to introduce a constitutional amendment that would allow him to stay in power beyond statutory limits. Violation of this provision, designed precisely to thwart demagogues such as him, automatically terminated his Presidency. Given a choice between obeying the Law, as encoded in the constitution and interpreted by the Supreme Court, or Zeyala, on the 28th June the Honduran army chose the former.\n\nUnfortunately, however, world leaders have inaccurately described the army\u2019s action as a coup, despite the fact that power remains in civilian hands, in an executive chosen by the elected legislature. Even worse, many seem intent on using economic, political and other pressure to force the return of Zelaya, running the risk of serious violence. We call upon HMG to recognise the Honduran government and support, rather than hinder, their attempts to protect law, liberty and order in their country during difficult times.",
