            "background": "This petition calls for a complete overhaul of the disgraceful expenses system currently in place for MPs. One which has led to the loss of all confidence and the suspicion of fraudulent claims made by already well paid civil servants. This will ensure those already serving as MP's who do so for their own personal gain will be less likely to stay as members. I am totally appauled by the complete lack of any morality or ethical substance of most of our MPs.",
