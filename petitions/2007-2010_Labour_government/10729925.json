        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "By introducing a maximum profit payable to shareholders of 30% return on their investment, and progressively taxing dividends paid above this rate. Companies would be progressively taxed on excess profits above 30% after deduction of their investments, and capital outlay. Profits can be reduced for tax purposes by employing more staff, investing in secure staff pensions or health insurance schemes, embarking on research and development projects, or in the case of utility companies, giving refunds to customers. Where investments are to be made using profits, but profits do not meet the expenditure, profits may be ringfenced for up to 3 - 5 years, during which time they are not taxable above the standard rate, if investment is not carried out, then they will be taxable at a higher rate, unless they are returned to customers as rebates.",
