            "background": "I love my country and admire how a working class student like myself has been given the opportunities that many less fortunate people in the world, have not. However with the hard work I put in to my studies in order to achieve my aspirations of going to university, I also have to work outside of academia. I am struggling to pass my driving test at the minute which in today's age is near enough a crucial skill. To pay 62 pounds on top of lessons means 12 more hours of work for me which is a lot considering my mother can't afford to help me out. Surely 20 pound is sufficient to pay the examiner for their time and surely the maintenance of the building will require no more than 10 pounds per person. This is considering the number of people who are tested each day. I therefore ask that the driving test cost to be lowered to something more appropriate such as 40 pounds. A small difference such as this could greatly help out the younger section of the working class population.",
