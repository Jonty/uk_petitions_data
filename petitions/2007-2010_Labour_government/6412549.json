            "background": "In most potentially harmful industries there are rules put in place to protect the vulnerable from bad practice. It is, for instance, illegal to serve alcohol to a person who is already intoxicated, and similarly casinos are obliged to restrict entry based on credit history and the likelihood of a person having a gambling problem. \n\nFinancial institutions are, however, free to lend money to whomsoever they choose, at their own risk. The only protection for serial debtors and those already in a terrible financial position is the financial institutions' own internal complaints procedure, of which the institutions rarely, if ever, make mention, and an ombudsman service who offer no clear guidelines as to what to expect from a complaint.\n\nWe the undersigned therefore call for clear and enforcible legislation restricting unsound lending practices and punishing companies who continue to lend recklessly",
