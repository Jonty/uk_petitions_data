For starters, the democratic Pakistani government will get an enormous major boost as they could then move most of their armed forces from the eastern front to the western front. The mindboggling resources spent on combating India can then be used to fight the Talibaan and the Al-Qaeda operatives on the western front and within Pakistan. The British Prime minister can use his good offices to pressurize India into adopting a more friendly approach towards Pakistan by coming to the table and talk concretely about Kashmir.",
