            "background": "Magic mushrooms were banned in the U.K in 2005 for no apparent reason, many traders went out of business because of this ban.\nthere is no evidence of any negitive health effects of magic mushrooms (apart from if taken by the mentally ill) and they are, by far, the safest recreational drug avalible (much safer than legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol which cause 100,000's of deaths a year and the legal \"fly agaric\" mushroom which can cause serious liver damage aswell as other health effects) they also grow wild in the U.K and are therefore easy to get hold of which means the legislation in place will NOT WORK as users can go outside, pick and eat them and this will be near impossible to stop. \n\nTherefore i am asking the government to stop wasting their time and tax payers money reinforcing this law and to focus on more serious, dangerous drugs (cocaine, heroin) and leave mushrooms alone unless a significant negitive health effect is found and proved.",
