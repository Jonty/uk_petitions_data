            "background": "It is simply inconceivable that a Labour government should tax people who are paid around \u00a350,000 per year at the same rate as people who earn this amount every week or even every day. It is also important not to discourage people working for very little money to give up and go on benefits.\nAlso the ridiculously complicated tax credits should be abolished ASAP.",
