        "background": "We the undersigned request that the Prime Minister urgently review the decision by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to introduce the teaching of Islamic traditions into the school curriculum via Citizenship Classes. This is giving Islam a privileged position it does not deserve in light of its recent introduction into the UK and the lack of benefit it has brought to the UK as a whole. Promoting one religion one religious belief over another also is divisive and will appear to give Islam a legitimacy it has not earned. Religion is also rapidly becoming a non-issue, side-lined by science and being shown to be nothing more than superstition. Education is there to educate about the facts, a set of fables of any strip does not do that and if the UK intends to compete on a global market it needs scientists and engineers, not preachers. Superstition and by extension religion of any flavour has no place being taught as part of a state sponsored education.",
