This is giving Islam a privileged position it does not deserve in light of its recent introduction into the UK and the lack of benefit it has brought to the UK as a whole. Promoting one religion one religious belief over another also is divisive and will appear to give Islam a legitimacy it has not earned. Religion is also rapidly becoming a non-issue, side-lined by science and being shown to be nothing more than superstition. Education is there to educate about the facts, a set of fables of any strip does not do that and if the UK intends to compete on a global market it needs scientists and engineers, not preachers. Superstition and by extension religion of any flavour has no place being taught as part of a state sponsored education.",
