            "background": "Motorists appear to be the primary target for the Government and Local Authorities in terms of restriction and improving revenue bearing taxation, through Fuel Duties, increasing Fuel Prices, Congestion Charges, Parking Charges, VED, Speed Cameras, and latterly a proposed Sales Tax on cars exceeding a level of emmissions etc. \nThe Government has not, as promised, been as quick to introduce effective and connective public transport at economic fare rates. As a consequence the restrictions and tax imposition on the motoring public and electorate to engage in economic activity and work for the good of society is discouraged.\nIn the key arena of Climate Change, we similarly see clear and draconian actions impacting the motorist, while larger pollution from the lack of energy efficient building controls and introduction of new technology, and on aviation, are clearly \"slow marched\" by the authorities.\nWe ask the Prime Minister for a fairer distribution of tax and legislation to ensure all members of society, agencies and stakeholders share the task of raising revenue and addressing climate change.",
