            "background": "Polar bears are currently under threat from changes in their arctic habitat due to global warming. We believe it would help to conserve these creatures by raising them on polar bear farms in the UK. Costs could be profitably met by selling farmed polar bear meat and fur in UK supermarkets. The government should make changes in the law to allow this to take place.",
