This government penalises the majority (through over-legislation) as a reaction to the very few grave crimal acts of a few people in this country.  They do not trust the British people and they treat the British people like children instead of enpowering them to lead a life with moral direction.  Everyone who cares about social and community freedoms in this country should sign this petition and send a message to Mr Brown that we are SICK and TIRED of the lack of trust and interference.",
