            "background": "As we need to encourage the use of digital radio vs. analog, and should also have a little real sense of real culture, we should migrate most national/regional radio broadcasting from \"FM\" (Correctly, VHF Band 2) to D.A.B. and leave those VHF2 frequencies free for unlicenced local stations to broadcast stuff that people actually want to hear, rather than the steriale homogenised tripe many BBC and commercial operators offer.\n\nRadio 4 should remain on \"Long Wave\", as well as DAB, at power levels that even a crystal set can handle, and swap idents with Radio 1 (as \"R4\" has seniority, in several senses of the word) Radio 3 should remain in FM2 at 100MHz, as a reference, and is it is the only thing that technically justifies the bandwidth it uses, and DAB spoils its quality.",
