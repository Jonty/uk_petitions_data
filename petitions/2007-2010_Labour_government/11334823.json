Creating such a group will result in the immediate termination of your Facebook account. \n\nYet there are hundreds of religious hate groups all over facebook and they are fully aware of all of them.\n\nWe have tried emailing abuse@facebook.com as well as privacy@facebook.com and NOTHING is done, not even a reply is given.\n\nTHOUSANDS of complaints have been made about these hate groups, yet they are still functioning, with NO response to members who complained. We demand that the UK prime minister ask Facebook to practice what it preaches, without discrimination - and terminate these groups and members who insult, offend, abuse and hurt innocent users.",
