        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The number of people who have been left penniless because of government policy over the last 12 years means that many who wish to put themselves forward to challenge the corrupt Members of Parliament currently occupying seats in the House of Commons simply cannot afford to do so.  There have been many utterances by socialist politicians about 'lowering the bar' so that more people can aspire to be MPs (some even argue that is why they were given tax free allowances and unrestricted access to taxpayer pounds in the form of 'expenses' in the first place) but the deposit - and the possibility of losing it - continues to put many people off.  Removing the deposit is the only way that corrupt elected   representatives being replaced by honest elected representatives is going to be achieved in this country.",
