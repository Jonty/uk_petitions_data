            "background": "If you drive a vehicle without a valid MOT it will usually invalidate your insurance, and if you have an accident or are stopped by the police, you will be liable to face prosecution for MOT non-compliance.\n\nI am amazed how common it is for people to over look the renewal of this important document.\n\nIt is hard to overlook tax or insurance because of the official reminders and the fact the renewal dates are fairly fixed. MOT renewals can change if your car fails its test and is off the road for repair. \n\nTherefore I propose that it is made compulsory for the DVLA to release details to your insurance company upon request of the expiry date of your MOT. Subsequently your insurance company must notify you that your MOT is about to expire 35 days before it actually does.\n\nThis reminder would allow for a timely renewal of your MOT and greatly reduce the chance of you forgetting it and falling fowl of the law.",
