The whole situation is turning into Vietman and it's about time we realised that. Why can't we see that with hindsite we shouldn't have gone in there in the first place and that mistakes were made, so rectify this before any more of our troops are killed. During the second world war, our country was at risk but now it's a different situation and is it that we are making things worse by being there.",
