        "background": "In today\u2019s schools there is always so much paper that is just thrown away and not recycled at all. The government proposes to have the whole country recycling in the very near future but to tackle this they could first go into school and start there. Perhaps then people could realise how recycling could not only help school's but the country and the world. If we could show the schools around the country that recycling could help reduce costs and make there schools a better place then we think that, that would be an achievement far greater than any assembly could teach or offer. We hope that you will help us make the country a cleaner and more eco-friendly place by signing this petition.",
