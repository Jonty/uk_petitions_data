        "background": "When pensioners reach 80, their pension is increased by a mere (and insulting) 20p per week. At Christmas, every pensioner receives \u00a310 bonus. These figures have been in place for a good 25-30 years. In those days, 20p did buy a lot of goods in supermarkets and \u00a310 covered the Christmas meal - turkey, trimmings, pudding etc. Now there is little one can purchase with 20p and \u00a310 does not cover a Christmas Day meal. These are two areas, the govt in the past 25-30 years has forgotten to take into account when reviewing the pensions.",
