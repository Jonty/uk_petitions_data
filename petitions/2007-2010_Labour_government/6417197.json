            "background": "In this high tension, high terror alert state, the wearing and display of full veils and fully covering up in the name of expressing a religious belief has allowed criminals to escape (Sharon Beshenivsky 's killer did it.)It would save on further fraud/illegal use of it. It is an offensive & divisive garment and should be banned in public. This would also free those women who are being forced to wear it, giving these women equal status in this country like they deserve.if all our youth started to wear full balaclavas in stead of the current \"hoodies\" they would soon be outlawed. This garment also causes offence to many free minded western people just seeing it appearing more and more on the streets. It shows division rather than inclusion into British society. at least a religious symbolism law like in France should be brought in to make integration a part of living in the UK and take it out of schools.",
