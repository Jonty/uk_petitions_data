Religion should not put people above the law to cause suffering to animals. Religious Slaughter is carried out under \"strict\" regulations according to the government and does not cause unnecessary suffering to the animal. But the fact remails the animal still suffers. Religious Slaughter should be stopped and all animals that must be killed must be stunned first.",
