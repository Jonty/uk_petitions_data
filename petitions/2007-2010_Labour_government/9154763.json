            "background": "High bed occupancy and patient turnover is widely acknowledged to contribute to MRSA infection. With little time to clean beds properly between patients and new admissions rushed into damp areas, nurses spend more time cleaning that actually caring. One of the problems is that bed management (for the lay person - the admission process bed allocation to different wards) is being undertaken by managerial professionals, with inadequate clinical decision - making - so, say, if a casearrives in casualty with a broken femur, but gets sent to a cardio - thoracic unit, then transferred to orthopaedics - the bugs (as well as the cash!) follows th patient ! \n\nThe recent maternal mortality occurred on a medical respiratory ward is evidence of how poor the system is working at present. Maternity cases (inc post operative) should be managed by obstetricians and midwives, trained in recognising pregnancy - related complications, on wards allocated to each sub speciality - at the moment, it seems a chaotic free for all !",
