            "background": "The so called \u2018Bayeux Tapestry\u2019 is in fact an eleventh century embroidery made in England and is one of England\u2019s most important cultural and historical treasures, which should never have left these shores.  The return of this unique and iconic national treasure should be made the occasion for a celebration of our important and wonderful Anglo-Saxon cultural, political and linguistic heritage.  Our Anglo-Saxon ancestors gave us our nation\u2019s name of England, our world language and our identity as the English people.  \n\nWe should never forget how Anglo-Saxon England created the bedrock of our society, nor should we forget the cruelty and rapacity of the French and Norman invaders who destroyed and stole so much from England.  \n\nIt\u2019s time the French people made apology for their ancestors\u2019 actions and the homecoming of this Anglo-Saxon treasure to England will symbolise this better than anything else.      \n\nWe want it back, now!",
