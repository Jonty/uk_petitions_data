            "background": "The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) has been tasked by the DfT to move 85% of commercial vehicle annual tests to private sector by 2012. As a result. VOSA is closing an unspecified number of its 90 test stations - but it is not consulting with LGV operators and is not ensuring there are adequate private Approved Test Facilities in place first. Our campaign Stop the VOSA Closures aims to halt the closure of more test stations until all LGV operators have a viable alternative.",
