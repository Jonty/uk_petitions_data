            "background": "The negative effects of Alcohol abuse and thelimited regulation for young people in particular regarding irresponsible use, needs to be changed. We can all clearly see the effects of alcohol in our society, people are out of control and are destroying their own lives as well as affecting the lives of others around them. Self control is not being applied with desired results. This also adds great pressure to policing which can be resolved by allowing police extra powers to control alcohol related crimes. This could also have a positive effect on the NHS and other emergency services being freed up to serve needy people who have non-self inflicted emergencies.",
