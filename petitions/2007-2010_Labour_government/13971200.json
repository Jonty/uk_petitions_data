            "background": "Foie Gras is illegal to produce in Britain, however, because the import of the product from France is still legal, people are still able to buy this unethical product in restaurants, on the internet, in supermarkets etc.  This petition asks for import of foie gras to be made illegal.\nTo produce foie gras, the batches of chicks are separated by sex, the females are killed then and there and the males taken to the cages where they spend their lives. They are force fed with metal tubes that cause bruising in the neck, their stomachs are pumped with 10 times the normal amount of food causing discomfort and liver disease. At 3 months old, the birds are slaughtered by slitting the throat and taking up to 10 minutes to bleed to death.  It is this diseased liver that is considered a delicacy.\nIt is completely savage and inhumane.",
