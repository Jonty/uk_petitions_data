            "background": "Every day I find that someone who is disabled has preference over me!  For example myself and my wife purchased a car yesterday, I went to the post office to purchase the tax disc but could not because the car taxation class was disabled, because I am able bodied I have to go to DVLA to tax it. This increases my carbon footprint and costs more than if I was disabled I feel that this is discrimination!!",
