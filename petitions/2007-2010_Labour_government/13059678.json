            "background": "Further to the recent reduction in bank interest rates for savers, some banks have kept savers on low interest rates (0.1%) without informing them of newer savings accounts with better rates of interest (2-3 %). Information on changes is not supplied to savers until a statement arrives, months or as much as a year after rates have been reduced. Savings represent the results of years of working life in order to accumulate funds and loss of interest represents a major financial detriment to savers. Banks owe a Duty of Care to such savers whose efforts are rendered ineffective, but which results in financial benefits to banks. This practice is inappropriate and should be subject to new financial legislation, imposing a duty of care on banks.\nProposed:- Banks must be required to inform savers when their \u2018old\u2019 savings accounts with reduced interest rates have been replaced with newer accounts at better interest rates, and to provide transfer options to those better accounts, subject to stringent penalties if they fail in their duty of care to savers.",
