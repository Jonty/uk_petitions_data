            "background": "While ocean currents move slowly relative to typical wind speeds, they carry a great deal more energy. This is because water is more than 800 times denser than air, so for the same surface area, water moving 12 miles per hour exerts about the same amount of force as a constant 110 mph wind. Ocean currents thus contain an enormous amount of energy that can be captured and converted to a usable form without the environmental drawbacks of e.g. barrages.   OCT is not to be confused with \"wave power.\"",
