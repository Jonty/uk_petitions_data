            "background": "This petition has been started by football fans of the Rivals network who are moved and infuriated by the recent death of Rhys Jones, an 11-year old football fanatic from Liverpool who was shot dead in the car park of the Fir Tree pub.\n\nWe feel that the rise in incidents such as these indicates a need for direct action to be taken to remove these weapons from the street.\n\nOur logic is that if these people want to use guns, they should have the opportunity to be trained to use them and also to have the object of their actions shoot back at them.\n\nWe also feel that this will help save the lives of innocent young soldiers currently serving in the forces.",
