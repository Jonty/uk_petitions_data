            "background": "The public is under increased financial pressure at the moment and we need all the help we can get from our government. We urge you to either abandon or indefinately postpone the planned two pence increase in fuel duty.\n\nFuel increases the cost of everything that a standard household uses and food prices have already risen dramatically over the rate of inflation. We need to eat and we need to be able to get to work, this increase in duty is not protecting the people of the nation nor the national economy.",
