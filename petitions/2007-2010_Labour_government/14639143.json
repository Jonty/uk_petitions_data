            "background": "When the government sells its stake in RBS (should it ever manage to do so) the entire amount should be used to provide free PV solar panels for residential use. If there is more demand than supply for the free panels then a simple lottery should be conducted to determine who gets them. This would a, help offset the coming energy crisis and could b, provide a genuine kickstart to some kind of PV industry in the UK rather than the current feeble FIT tariffs. Hardly anyone is going to buy a solar panel for \u00a312 k when they are already drowning in debt.",
