        "background": "In the wake of the recent news that at least 24 Muslim women have had their virginity 'restored', courtesy of the NHS via the British Tax payer, we  demand that an immediate end is put to this practice.  At a time when the NHS has never been more hard-pressed, it is indefensible that money is being wasted to shore up the antiquated ideas of any religion, let alone a practice that demeans the women in question by defining them by their so-called marriageability. 'Virginity' or better cancer care? You choose.",
