            "background": "We are connected with a UK based international charitable organisation which wishes to appoint as its leader a person from the Ivory Coast.  If he comes to this country in this capacity, he will clearly need to bring his family. We understand that the nearest UK High Commission has refused his request.\nHis case is still subject to appeal so we do not want to give any more details as the issue on which we wish to petition is the general point rather than his particular circumstances.\nWe consider that it is detrimental to the interests of this country that international organisations should be forced to move elsewhere because the immigration rules are this tight; and so we believe the rules should be changed as soon as possible to allow bona fide people like this one to come to this country to work and to come with their immediate families.",
