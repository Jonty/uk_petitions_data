            "background": "This petition has been set up because more and more Christians in this nation are under attack and are being threatened in their jobs, in their churches, and in their neighborhoods. We feel that more and more pressure is being brought on us as believers by Islamic, secular and humanist groups. This nation was established on Christian principles. Our Christian heritage has brought change to this nation: hospitals, schools, an end to the politician trade, and community welfare, to name but a few. We are in danger of turning our backs on our national character in the name of political correctness. We take extreme care not to offend those of other faiths, or no faith, Christians and their faith are offended, and threatened with the legal action and loss of employment, with impunity. Although we often think that persecution only happens in other nations and cultures, Christians are being persecuted almost daily here at home.",
