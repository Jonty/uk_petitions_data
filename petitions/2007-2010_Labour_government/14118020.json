            "background": "Until the year 1998, a time you can hardly call an 'age of barbarism' it was mandatory that anyone who was found guilty of committing the crime of piracy with violence would be judicially hung.\n\nIn abolishing the death sentence for piracy we believe that you have effectively sentenced the Chandler\u2019s and many innocent people to death by torture and barbaric methods at the hands of their captors, whom you have so kindly provided with hot food, supplies and a morale boost.\n\nHM Government and the Royal Navy have proven themselves completely ineffective at fighting piracy, and tougher measures are needed now to prevent more people from being kidnapped and killed in the future. If you are unprepared to judicially and humanely kill the pirates then you are allowing them the freedom to kill innocent British citizens or citizens of any nationality.",
