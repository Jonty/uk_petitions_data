Mitchell, the designer of the Supermarine Spitefire, should be posthumously presented with either the Victoria Cross or the George Medal.\nHe gave his life in designing such a beautiful aircraft, that stood against the tyranny of the nazi's, and it is a disgrace that he has not been honoured by the highest award this country can give him.\nHe gave up so much for the few, and for the many.",
