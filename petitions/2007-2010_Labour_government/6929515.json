Marrying someone who is themselves a close family member carries a risk for children - a risk that lies within the code of life; within our genes. \nCommunities that practice cousin marriage experience higher levels of some very rare but very serious illnesses - illnesses known as recessive genetic disorders.  Not only is the practice totally unfair on the children it is a financial burden on society as a whole.",
