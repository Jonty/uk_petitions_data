            "background": "Around \u00a3200,000 was spent on improving the City Square in Lincoln City centre to create an Event Space, the main event being the Christmas Ice Rink. Previously, this had attracted over 25,000 people into the city centre in an 8 week period.  This Christmas (2007), the people of Lincoln have had to witness the fiasco of the Ice Rink being cancelled, a big wheel planned, amended, installed and abandoned.  Then glorified fairground attractions were installed instead.  Traders have also lost a considerable amount of money in the process.  The people of Lincoln want to ensure that next Christmas we have an Ice Rink and not pathetic excuses.  We had the first Ice Rink in the East Midlands, there was a very positive reaction from retailers, residents and visitors.  The City Council are continually trying to put Lincoln on the map and bring business and job opportunities to the City, this fiasco will not improve their image.",
