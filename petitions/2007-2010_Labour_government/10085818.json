He has got this Country into a finanical mess with his excessive borrowing and over taxing of ALL classes, particularly low income families.  \n\nGordon Brown should hold a general election NOW, as he should never have been allowed to take the position of Prime Minister without the consensus of the public.  If he had held an electon he would not be in power today. Is he too scared of the public vote?",
