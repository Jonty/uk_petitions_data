            "background": "Nearly 50% of Front Line Ambulance Staff are Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT's) Under the Agenda for Change, pay banding is based upon job profiles. Points are given for various aspects of the work. Some Ambulance NHS Trusts place EMT's on Band 4 and other Trusts place on Band 5. Initial submission of these job profiles did not reflect the current working practises of EMT's. In addition, each year, new procedures and extra drugs are introduced, with no additional points being allocated. We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to encourage the admission of Uptodate Job Profiles, showing current working practises as agreed by Ambulance Trust Management and Staff Side representation",
