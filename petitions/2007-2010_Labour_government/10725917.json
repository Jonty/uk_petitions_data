            "background": "I live with my son of 16 who finished school in July and is doing an electrician apprenticeship. I have found out today that my child benefit, child tax credits and working tax credits has ceased. I work 16 hours a week and earn 88.32. What are my options? Do i ask my son to hand over the whole of his low apprenticeship pay? Do I leave my current job where I am happy and try to find full time employment at a time where job opportunities are few? My losses are in excess of 140 per week and I am terrified as to what is going to become of us.",
