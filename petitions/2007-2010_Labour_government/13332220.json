            "background": "In September 2009 Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Canning Town and Minister for farming\ncalled for legislation to ban the voluntary separation of men and women in public buildings. He likened this to racial segregation in the Deep South of the US or Apartheid South Africa.\n\nFitzpatrick's statements have brought the government into disrepute. It is a basic civil right that private social functions, so long as they do not break the law or bring harm to anyone, should be organised according to the wishes of the participants. The proposed legislation would affect a wide range of events. Not only would a number of religious ceremonies be threatened, such as Muslim and Jewish wedding ceremonies, but the proposed law seems to include women or men-only events at leisure centres, libraries and health clinics.\n\nThe Prime Minister should publicly dismiss this proposed legislation and remove Mr Fitzpatrick from his position at the Department for Food and Agriculture and also demand he issue an apology to all those threatened and insulted by his attempt to infringe basic human rights.",
