            "background": "every day more and more people (including celebraties) are admitting to smoking some form of cannabis \n\ni propose that the government legalises cannabis and sells it themselves \n\npros for government selling and legalising cannabis\n\n1, all cannabis dealers will be out of buisiness which leaves time and resources for more serios crimes\n2, government can place tax on it like cigarettes which gives more money to the econemy\n3, can be available without consiquences to those who need it (medical)\n\n\n\nbut it should still be illegal for unlicensed people to sell it or grow it\n\nthis way the government wins and so do the thousands of people that smoke it\n\n\nevery year there are thousands of deaths related to drinking, smoking, driving and harder drugs. \nvery little reports of deaths due to cannabis in comparison\n\ni believe there are more than 1 million people out there who share the same views and i think this petition will prove it",
