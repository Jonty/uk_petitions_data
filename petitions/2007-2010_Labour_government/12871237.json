It would appear that similar effort is not undertaken by The Prime Minister's office.  A large number of e-petitions are dismissed quoting existing legislation.\n\nThis seems to entirely miss the point of the petitions which in many cases is seeking to challenge that legislation.\n\nIf the Prime Minister wants to truly provide a platform for citizens to make their point then more effort is required when responding to e-petitions that have been submitted.  It is also important that a proposed plan of action is included.",
