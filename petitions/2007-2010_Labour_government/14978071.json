            "background": "Recently we,ve started to see so many cases of manslaughter, and the offender being given too lesser sentence.\nGreater weight should be given to the loss of a life taken unlawfully, and appropriate sentences given.\n Also to question the fact when a sentence is given, with a minimum time to be served, that the offender can appeal, just a year into sentence, all to easily and consiquently get the original sentence drastically reduced, causing more heartache for the victims family, with no explanation given.\n Only by the Criminal Justice System punishing these crimes in an appropriate manner, will we possibley see a reduction in this type of crime.\n We would like the sntencing guidelines council and sentencing Advisory panel to address this type of crime and ensure consistency in sentencing, and that a minimum sentence given should be served before the offender has any right to appeal or parol attempt.",
