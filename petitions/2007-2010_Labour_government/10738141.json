            "background": "Customs, Coastguard, Transport and immigration officers have to rely on the already stretched police force to make arrests and gather evidence.  All our security and customs services should be integrated and have the same powers (stop & search, arrest etc) as the regular police force.  This will increase the efficiency of these services as well as free up police manpower.  Additional training will be required for these officers and that will have to be scoped and funded, with facilities provided.",
