        "background": "July 16th 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown promised during Prime Minister's Question to freeze fuel tax for 12 months. In December 2008 where he added 2ppl to fuel to \"offset the VAT\" which means haulage companies cannot claim back taxes, only VAT. There are also plans to increase the fuel tax further within 2 weeks (before 2nd April 2009), thus charging 71 pence per pound in tax. The tax is sent to a general fund which can be used on anything from the NHS to helping banks, therefore once again the middle class families are funding the country and suffering for it.",
