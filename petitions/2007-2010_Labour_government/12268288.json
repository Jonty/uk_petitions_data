Hartlepool Council - a staunch Nu-Labour area which suffers the stigma of having spawned Lord Mandelson - is leading by exampe and has announced that 6 of its top jobs are to go, in a money saving exercise.  So when can we expect to be told when and how many of our government ministers are to go?",
