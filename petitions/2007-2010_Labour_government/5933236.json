Even the Parliamentary Ombudsman cannot make an award, he can only recommend. Which recommendation the HMRC does not have to follow nor be bound by!\n\nThere are no organisations of any kind, let alone any public authorities that can say to the layman \" You are responsible for your mistakes and for correcting ours\"\n\nI believe that HMRC should be answerable to taxpayers through the courts, the law is for everyone, and every organisation. HMRC is not above the law.\n\nUnder the Bill of rights, which has never been repealed, no one had the right to impose penalty, fine or forfiet other than through the courts.\n\nTherefore HMRC should have to prove its case before the courts, and not use the court system as a rubber stamp for its decisions!\n\nIf HMRC loses its case the amount of compensation to be awarded to be set by the judge!",
