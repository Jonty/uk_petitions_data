            "background": "The Zero tolerance which Singapore has with all street crime/,offences makes it a safe place to be any where night or day, at any age.    The quick no nonsense way offenders are dealt with by the police and courts,shows to offenders whos in charge and misbehaviour wil not be tolerated. I further petion the Prime Minister to visit Singapore and aquaint himself with there ways. From affordable houseing , roads , transport Singapore has been rebuilt in 40 Years.  Example (1) chewing gum banned, because of the mess it caused and expense to remove it. (2) Littering the streets, 100- dollar fine and made to sweep the streets. Bring the safety enjoyed by Singaporeans to Britain please",
