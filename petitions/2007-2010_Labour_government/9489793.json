            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nMyself and my husband have 2 perfectly healthy girls.i felt pregnant again with a wee boy and unknown to us our wee boy had a genetic condition.we discovered that Cameron had a condition that we never heard off before. we did everything that was possible to save our baby, to no avail. We cannot understand,how in this day and age (21st century, genetic conditions cant be cured, or lived with. We had so many hopes that Cameron could/would be saved by the medical profession, but that kind of thing is not possibly cureable.\nLots of parents have genetic conditions that they dont even suspect and end up losing their babies or having to take the dreading decision to turn off the life supporting machines (precisely what we had to do with Cameron). Ladies that are pregnant should be tested for those matters, or also sometimes parents are not carriers but the baby happens to be unfortunate and due to chromosomes badly  formed, end up with an abnormality. So even during pregnancy ladies should be tested.\nI WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD SIGN UP MY PETITION\n\nOn behalf of a lot of heartbroken mummies, please help.\nThank you.\n\nMrs Caroline Greig\nThis is my 3rd demand of petition.",
