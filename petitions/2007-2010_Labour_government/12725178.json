            "background": "Many countries, (including some in the EU)are using an injection known as the Depo-provera to ulter the production of testosterone in paedophiles. This injection has a 95% success rate meaning that convicted paedophiles are 95% less likely to re-offend once released from prison. We would like to see this made mandatory for paedophiles in the U.K to protect our children against sexual abuse and/or death through paedophilia. Chemical castration is much more effective than physical castration so is the preferred method used across the globe.",
