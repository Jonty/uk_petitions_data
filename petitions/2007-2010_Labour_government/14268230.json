            "background": "This petition is an effort to block the nationwide implementation of full body scanners that represent a total violation of privacy, a health risk, and tyranny.\nForcing people to pose for naked photos is a crime. If the government does this it will be a criminal government.\nIf the body scanners are allowed to be implemented travelers will be forced to do worse things under the threat of being treated as a terrorist if they refuse the violation of their dignity and freedom.\nProfessors of Molecular and Cell Biology maintain that there is no safe dose of ionizing radiation.\nIn addition to these issues, full body scanners would not even have stopped the Christmas Day bomber from boarding Flight 253, according to a British MP who helped design the machines.\n\u201cI must advise the Prime Minister \u2013 and the British public \u2013 that the scanners are not a \u201csilver bullet,\u201d said Ben Wallace, who worked on the scanners at defense research organization QinetiQ. \u201cYou would be mistaken to think that they would counter the new threat.\u201d",
