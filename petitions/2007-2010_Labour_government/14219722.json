            "background": "I have been deeply moved by the actions of the people of Wootton Bassett in the way they have shown their respect to the bodies of our serving Servicemen and Women on their return to the United Kingdom. The actions of the whole town in representing the people of our Country, by showing their respect, are so selfless.\n\nI would like to ask if Gordon Brown would consider bestowing the title of Royal Wootton Bassett on the town in recognition of their unstinting and selfless dedication to ensuring that every respect is shown to each and every individual as they pass through the town. I am in no doubt that this is of huge support to the families and friends who remain and are struggling to come to terms with their loss.\n\nEvery time another plane lands and the cortege passes through the town I feel that the people are representing me and I am deeply grateful to them.\n\nI understand that the residents of Wootton Bassett line the streets without any wish for thanks, but they are representing the people of this Country who are not able to do so each time and Royal status would be a gift from those people.",
