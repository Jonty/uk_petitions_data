            "background": "My son, and obviously many others attend Beddington Infants School in Wallington, Surrey. We have NO form of crossing next to the school. There is a crossing down the road somewhat. This is outside a Secondary school, and is a full traffic light crossing. Surely Nursery and Infant children 3 years + need some form of crossing, even if it is a zebra crossing a lot more than older children\n\nWe always do our best to encourage children to use a crossing and be safe. This school is on a major road, and people will cross in the middle of the road if there is no alternative.\n\nPlease help our children to stay safe!!!",
