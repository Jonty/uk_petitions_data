            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Even with fuel now topping \u00a31 a litre it is still, sadly, not yet prohibitive for the man in the street to drive. With the continued and increasing waste of fossil hydrocarbons, a fundamental and irreplaceable raw material for manufacturing, by treating it as mere fuel to be burned while it lasts, it is imperative that the Government act now to bring fuel to a reasonable price at which this waste stops. Adding a gratuitous 20p per litre to all hydrocarbon fuels will encourage industry to find alternative energy sources for transport, heating and power. We understand that this cost will decrease the personal spending power which is so essential to a consumer-driven economy, perhaps the additional proceeds could be added to the annual state pension bill.",
