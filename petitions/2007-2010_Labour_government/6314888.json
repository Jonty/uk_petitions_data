        "background": "This petition requests that the Prime Minister and the Government reform our police and law services to restore order to the counties of the United Kingdom. More Officers and more convictions are required to combat the rising unrest of our youth culture with our counties.The introduction of the \"Budget\" Community Police Officers that have no powers has turned this country into a lawless society. This petition is to remind the Prime Minister that we, the general public pay for the policing services through our council taxes are not happy with the services we are getting.The Law Society should not consider the rights of the criminal, but should consider the rights of the victim and the community when they sentence the perpertrator.We have no room in prison is no longer an excuse.One answer is to send the offender to serve time in the services so that they can be retrained and make them a useful member of society.",
