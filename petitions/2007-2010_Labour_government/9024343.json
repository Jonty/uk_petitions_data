        "background": "Few people have given so much musically to the world and promoted a message of non-xenophobic British pride around the world for so many years. Iron Maiden are a genuine institution adored worldwide and as their latest tour takes in dates all round the world their songs, mainly written by Steve, continue to unite fans and their proud display of the Union Jack  and use of Winston Churchill's speeches as a concert intro show they are the very essence of British hard work and success - Steve being an East End working class lad who made it to the top of his game.",
