            "background": "I hear that London is at danger of flooding in the future and that the Thames Barrier will not be able to cope, that there is now plans to build another Barrier. I would like to propose this idea be put on hold while the government consider my idea. Lets build something new. A \u2018Dam Lock\u2019 across the Thames, this being a Dam that can be used to generate electricity power, but at the same time to allow ships to be able to pass using the technology of a lock as already used on most rivers around the country. The most ideal place would be at Tilbury just after the docks. \nWorking with the present Thames Barrier we should be able to allow the incoming tide to fill up the area between the barrier and the Dam, areas down river should be allowed also to store the incoming tide and by closing the barrier on the out going tide we then open the Thames barrier to allow the additional water stored and forth coming supplies from all other adjoining streams and rivers from Devises. The Dam Lock could also serve as another river crossing as that has been placed as unable to cope, therefore yet another method of income. If successful this could be used around the country to support the National Grid. George Treloar",
