            "background": "\"Trident\" is a New Deal for Communities regeneration programme in inner-city Bradford, West Yorkshire. Bradford Council has at the request of the Board of Trident conducted a parish review and is recommending to the Secretary of State that a parish council be created to cover the same area of benefit as part of its \"forward strategy\".  This covers in part three distinct neighbourhoods - Little Horton, West Bowling and Marshfields - but the new parish would only cover part of each community and therefore be a \"zone\" rather than a real geographical community.  Furthermore, only around 300 residents out of an affected adult population of at least 10,000 have signed a petition in support of this move. We think these proposals should be rejected on the grounds that Trident is not a community and there is no real popular support for this proposal. Little Horton, West Bowling and Marshfields are historically established communities with their own strong geographical identities and distinct boundaries such as trunk roads. Local residents have not been consulted on the alternative of each neighbourhood having its own parish council as this option does not fit in with Trident's plans.",
