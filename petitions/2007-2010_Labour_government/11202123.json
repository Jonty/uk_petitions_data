The current system of linking our clocks to the position of the sun in the sky during winter and adding one hour during summer is by far the most logical approach and should be retained.",

            "background": "The United Kingdom is on the western edge of Europe and straddles the Greenwich Meridan. It is therefore entirely logical that it should have GMT as its standard time, in the same way that countries to the east in continental Europe have CET as their standard time, and countries to the west, such as the USA, have times earlier than GMT. Pretending that the country is somewhere else and aligning our clocks with those countries is not very sensible. Let's leave our clocks alone.",
