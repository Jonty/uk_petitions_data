            "background": "Victims should also get PACE. They  remain vulnerable when dealing with Police. Not in fit state to understand exactly their rights - gets taken advantage of. Victims (adults) should be given an appropriate adult/service provider with them (especially when dealing with vulnerable victims/victims of an attack where not been established exactly what has taken place) at time of taking of statement - often victim traumatised & in shock. Doesn't matter if it takes longer. Victims should have right to waive this (opt out rather than in). e.g. lone female attacked at night - forced into park off main road & beaten by attacker (male) with items taken from her & being clearly distressed - appropriate adult/service provider from sexual offences team to rule this out, clarify true nature of offence. At moment, unless anything specific mentioned (not always possible), adult victim has statement  alone or if they do take someone in with them, it's because they've expressly asked. Shouldn't have to ask. Criminals get PACE - Victims should get PACE.",
