            "background": "Soon a film called Corpus Christi will be shown in America. Christians do not want it shown here as it represents Jesus and his desciples as homosexuals. This is blasphemy. The Bible states clearly that homosexuality is an abomination.\nPlease do not reject this. Muslims have had a play removed from the stage because it upset them. atheists have blasphemy about there not being a God plastered on buses. Remember we are still a \"Christitan\" country. please listen to its citizens. thank you",
