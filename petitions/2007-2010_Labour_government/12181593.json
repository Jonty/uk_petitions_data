            "background": "What was the Royal Tournament?\n\nFor anyone who was not lucky enough to witness the Royal Tournament in person or didn\u2019t have the opportunity to see the television coverage, it\u2019s difficult to imagine the scale of the Tournament. The Tournament began as a series of skill at arms competitions however; it quickly evolved to include military bands and a variety of acts.\n\nStaged in London each summer, the Tournament was different each year. In the latter years, each Tournament was given a theme as each of the three armed services took it in turn to take the lead. The opening and finale of each show would often include huge numbers of musicians and performers.\n\nThis was one of the biggest recruitment drives that the armed services had, and gave a great understanding of what they do.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to the Royal Tournament and it made me feel proud of our armed services.\n\nLets bring back the Royal Tournament, let us be proud of our armed services and let us be proud to be British.",
