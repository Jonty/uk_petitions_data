        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In 1997, over 50 years after it's formation, 8 times champions and one of Bradford City's most prized assetts, the Bradford Dukes, Bradford's very own elite and highly successful speedway club had its Odsal Stadium lease revoked by Bradford City Council. \n\nThe Duke's lease was renewed annually to allow the club to race at Odsal Stadium, one of the finest racing tracks in the world which produced some of the most exciting speedway racing in the world. \n\nMany thousands of Bradford Speedway fans have been denied the opportunity to support their local team. Many thousands of speedway fans from clubs outside of Bradford have also been denied the chance to see some of the most spectacular speedway racing in the world. Speedway has missed Bradford and Bradford has missed speedway. \n\nThanks to Sky Sports, speedway popularity is now increasing at an incredible rate. Television revenue is flooding in to the speedway clubs. Having won 8 Championships, produced a World Champion in Gary Havelock in 1992, and hosted a number of World Speedway Finals and International Grand Prix meetings, the return of speedway in Bradford would help to boost local & UK economy and put Bradford back on the map.",
