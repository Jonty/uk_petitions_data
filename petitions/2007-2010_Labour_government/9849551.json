This is factually incorrect because there are some 640 citizens of this land - including himself - who merely pass their utility bills on to the taxpayer therefore they cannot possibly be being affected by rising gas prices.\n\nand,\n\nb.  he stated that he 'communicates with his electorate'.  It is a known fact that scottish constituency MPs occupying seats in the english HofC no longer have an electorate to 'communicate with' because the people who voted for them are now properly represented by scottish MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.  Indeed the Scottish constituency MPs sitting in the english House of Commons are legally barred from representing or voting on matters decided by the Scottish Parliament which affect the people who previously voted for them.  They are therefore in the HofC  fraudulently and only maintained there because the Prime Minister needs their votes to survive and to keep his own fraudulent position.",
