            "background": "A democratic nation DOES NOT descriminate against it's own people, so why is it the line ''Rebellious Scots to Crush'' continues to be used in the song God Save the Queen.\n\nIt is not morally right. The song is extremely unpopular and is very much hated with a passion in Scotland, so why is it still in use? \n\nIt is racsit towards Scots and although the line refers to the Jacobite rebellion it still does not make it right that it is in the song. Why does it not say rebellious Brits to crush? \n\nThe song ISOLATES Scots from the rest of the United Kingdom hence why it is never sung in Scotland by Scots.\n\nThat is what this petition is all about.\n\nSuggested new national anthem - Rule Britannia or LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY\n\n\nthank you for reading.",
