As a result, dishonest officers may then go on to other jobs,which they would not have got, had this loophole been closed earlier. They also get to keep their police pensions.\n\nThis must end, in the interests of transparency, there should be a blanket ban on such practice taking place.\n\nAny officer wishing to retire/resign on health grounds should be paid S.S.P. until the conclusion of the hearing/trial verdict.",
