This undermines the presumption of innocence and is unfair.",

            "background": "No innocent person should be listed as a criminal suspect on what are basically statisitcal grounds. This unfair practice flies in the face of natural justice. Using personal information supplied in order to register one's right to vote in a democracy in this unfair manner is especially outrageous.\n\nA full and independent investigation with the aim of clear and statutory limitations on NFI data mining and an explanation of how the NFI initially falsely believed this is 'unambiguous matching'  is urgently required.  \n\nWhile no one should defraud the taxpayer, innocent and entitled people should not be stigmatised and bullied as they are in these guesswork based investigations.",
