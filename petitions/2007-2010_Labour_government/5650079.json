            "background": "Kwik-Save staff worked without pay for 6 WEEKS because they thought this would save their jobs.  Now almost all of them have been made redundant and they haven't even received any redundancy pay; in spite of this one has received a P45 saying he is liable for tax on his non-existent redundancy payment.  They have been treated very badly; I feel, strongly, that something should be done for them.  Also, by extension, a law should be brought in to make it impossible for any other employer to treat staff in this way.",
