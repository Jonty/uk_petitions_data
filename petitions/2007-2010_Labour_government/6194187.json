            "background": "Help the NHS and businesses alike. Whether you are in favour of private healthcare or not, we must consider the benefits of having private healthcare. THe NHS is overstretched and doing a disservice to everyone because they can't cope with the numbers of patients. Patients suffer long waiting times and a confused and unprofessional organisation. Businesses lose huge numbers of man days through employees taking time off waiting for treatment that could be dealt with swiftly in the private system. We should be encouraging the expansion of Company provided healthcare to alleviate the pressures on the NHS and to reduce absenteeism in the workplace. Remove all income tax on Private healthcare and actively encourage and incentivise companies to look after their staff.",
