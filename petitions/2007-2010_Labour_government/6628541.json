            "background": "The Government have spent over \u00a33.6Billion on the National Offender Management Service(NOMS) & have spent over \u00a320 Million on consultants to NOMS, NOMS has no mission statement and no real purpose and is an umbrella body to which the Prison & Probabtion Services come under. This has been a waste of time by this government and a massive misappropriation of government/ tax payers money. NOMS was designed to make prisons and probation work closer together but does it really have to cost \u00a33.6billion to achieve this?\nNOMS has been a complete waste of time and money, money that could have been better spent improving the criminal justice system. We would like to see the immediate resignation of Helen Edwards- Director of NOMS & Phil Wheatley - Director of HM Prison Service",
