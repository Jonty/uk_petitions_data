            "background": "Dr Maggie Atkinson stated that the killing of Jamie Bulger was 'exceptionally unpleasant' and that children commiting such crimes should 'make reparation'. I dont see how his killers can make reparation for such a crime and to call such a brutal murder exceptionally unpleasant, is an insult. I find this view totally abhorrent and an insult to the memory of James Bulger and his family. Her actions must only add to that family\u2019s grief. I believe the only reason for her making these ridiculous statements is self promotion, and her position as Children\u2019s Commissioner is untenable.",
