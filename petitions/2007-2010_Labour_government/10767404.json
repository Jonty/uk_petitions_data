            "background": "Dear Mr Brown,\n                               This year over 1,361 teenagers have gone to court for knife crime and 22 fatal teenage stabbings have happened, the total of 12 in the capital. The way we could try to stop knife crime on the streets is have a metal detector in every shop in Islington and Hackney, and police could do more stop and searches on teenagers from age 13-18 also Police women should stop and search girls because men give the knives to women to carry around because it is unlikely for female officers to check girls pockets. The reason why teenagers carry around knives is to protect themselves but if kids see other kids carrying a knife around then they will do the same because they will fink if they can protect themselves with a knife I can so they do it. Altogether we should STOP KNIVE CRIME ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!!.",
