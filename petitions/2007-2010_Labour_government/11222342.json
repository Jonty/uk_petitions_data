            "background": "On 5th December the Internet Watch Foundation acted with reckless irresponsibility in blocking several pages on the Wikipedia website because they featured an image of a record sleeve which had already been in the public domain for 32 years. We the undersigned consider that it is totally unacceptable in a democratic society for internet content to be arbitrarily censored in this way by an unelected body, and we therefore call upon the government to abolish the Internet Watch Foundation on the grounds of incompetence and unreasonable judgement. We regard censorship of the internet to be generally unacceptable other than in the most extreme instances, and have no confidence in the ability of the Internet Watch Foundation to properly adjudicate in this area. We further remind the government of Article 10 of the Human Rights Act which upholds the right to freedom of expression.",
