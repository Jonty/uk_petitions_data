            "background": "i think to change the classification of cannabis is going to be a waste of time.The police have their work cut out as it is with drugs,they still need to keep there attention on the harsher drugs such as Heroin,Cocaine and Ecstasy,being an ex heroin addict i know from 1st hand experience what these harsher drugs can do.To add cannabis back up there would just increase the work load of an already streched police network.Cannabis does have its draw backs but on the whole i think they are minimal compaired the heroin and others.Let the police keep on at the class A/B,the ones that cause real misery and keep cannabis class C.",
