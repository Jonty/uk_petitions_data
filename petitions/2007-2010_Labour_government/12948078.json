        "background": "I was shocked to learn that many senior managers in my organisation receive their retirement pension and a heating allowance whilst earning in excess of \u00a330,000 per year. In these times of being told that the young people of this country will have to work until they are 70 it is scandalous that these people are receiving such benefits. When I worked in the pension section at the DWP in the late 1970's you had to do one thing to receive your retirement pension, \"retire\" !!! I would like to propose that retirement pension is only paid to people after they have retired and that the heating allowance should only be paid to people in receipt of retirement pension",
