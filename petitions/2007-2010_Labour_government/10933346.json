One of the things that harms productivity is Lotus Notes.\nWe would like the government to take action and force companies to use email systems that are built for people.\n\nOverall we feel that life without Lotus Notes will be better than our current situation.\nThe UK will benefit from a competitive edge since we would be the only country free from the system.\n\nPrograms exist that will allow other email clients to work with the Lotus Server. Therefore it will not impose a huge burden on businesses.",
