        "background": "RAF Puma helicopters were to have been retired next year. At a unit cost greater than that of purchasing new helicopters with equivalent or better capabilities the MoD intends to refurbish the existing fleet at a total cost of \u00a3300m. This is a waste of money and a grave disservice to the troops in Afghanistan the procurement is supposedly intended to benefit.\n\nGiven that MoD procedures exist for the rapid procurement of equipment to meet urgent operational needs there and that better equipment can be procured more quickly and more cheaply, the Puma upgrade should be cancelled at once.",
