        "background": "We have recently been advised by the Isle of Wight Council that they intend to cease funding three of our services with effect from 30th June 2010.  These services are\n \nBefriending,\nShopping\nand Active Networks of Support (Social clubs).\n \nThese are preventative services that have provided long-term support to over 600 older people in the last year, enabling them to stay independent and live in their own homes. The cuts will not only have a severe effect on the quality of life of older people, but also their families and carers too.\n\nThe consequences of all three of these services ceasing will be far reaching for older people. These cuts will make living independently harder for some of the most vulnerable people in society and reduce their quality of life.\n \nAge Concern Isle of Wight is a local, independent, registered charity. It has been working to enhance, support and celebrate the lives of older people on the Island for over 35 years.\nAs the lsland\u2019s leading charity for people who are 50 and over, our team helps around 3000 older people each year.\n\nPlease sign our petition to help us to help these vulnerable older people.",
