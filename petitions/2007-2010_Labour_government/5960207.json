        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Young children should NOT be left without a babysitter, carer or similar. Children under the age of 12 years, and DEFINATELY of toddler age should not be left alone at home; in a car; nor in accomodation on holiday.  \nChecking on children from time to time is inadequate; this indicates that there is a requirement for supervision, or that there is potential risk; but is insufficient to dispense with the duty of care. \n\nSome parents think it is ok to leave young children alone; and others do not. That there is this disparity seems to indicate that guidelines are needed.  \n\nIt would be great to be able to assume children are going to be safe at all times - it would also be unrealistic.  Most people are aware of the risks to children that exist in our society. \n\nIt's inadequate to be anything other than cautious at ALL times.  This shouldn't be written off as being paranoid, or pandering to the deeply unpleasant elements of society -it's doing what's necessary to protect vulnerable young children.\n\nTo issue guidelines means that ALL parents - even articulate, middle-class ones that would ordinarily never need to have their parenting skills examined - are absolutely clear on minimum requirements.",
