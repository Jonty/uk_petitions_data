            "background": "As our roads become ever increasingly clogged up with motor traffic, it is now essential to revive the old public transport network and trams, to reduce the cars on the road and our C02 emmissions. \n\nMany EU countries, such as Finland, have well co-ordinated public transport, which has kept the numbers of cars down substantially. They make public transport so cheap, that most citizens there find no need for the car.\n\nSo why can't we do the same?",
