            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, people who are in Money Purchase Pension Schemes can take upto 25% of their final Pension Pot as a Tax Free Cash Lump Sum; the remaining 75% has to be used to purchase an Annuity.\n\nThis Petition seeks to change this so that people can take all of their Pension Pot as a Cash Lump Sum when retiring.  \n\nBeing forced to take an Annuity means the insurance companies who provide annuities are the ones who benefit most - they are not repaying your capital, but simply the return they get for it.  And when you die, they benefit even more, since they keep the money.\n\nI understand the tax benefits that people get when they contribute to pensions and so the gov\u2019t would want to restrict the usage of this money.  Therefore, I propose that whilst 25% of the pension pot can be a Tax Free Cash Lump Sum (as currently), if people take the other 75% as a Cash Lump Sum, that this is taxed, thereby meaning that some of the tax benefits granted by the government are repaid.\n\nWith this change, people shall be incentivised to contribute more to their Pensions, as they will forsee more flexibility when they retire, as opposed to relying on an insurance company whose sole motive is to make a profit from annuity provision.",
