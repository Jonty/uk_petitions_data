            "background": "I would like the government to close the loop  hole allowing taxi licenses to be issued for use in other towns,And  make all potential taxi drivers take a knowlege test of the area they are going work.\n Taxi firms in Darlington are using \nthis loop hole to get a taxi license for people who cannot pass the test in Darlington ,where they are based.\nThese drivers are getting a licence from Berwick, which issues a licence on production of a valid driving licence. No knowledge of the area is necessary. \nThis has led to Darlington having foreign taxi drivers who cannot speak a word of english and no knowledge of the area.It is very annoying having to guide a taxi driver to your destination and even more so when they can't understand a word your saying.  \nThis makes a mockery of all the good work Darlington Borough council have done in raising taxi standards in Darlington.\nThese drivers have to resort to these measures because they would not pass the taxi driver test in Darlington.",
