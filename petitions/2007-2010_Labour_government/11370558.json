        "background": "Businesses understand the importance of protecting the local economy by providing jobs and giving people the goods and services they want at prices they can afford.  In the current economic climate that is a huge challenge and the business sector needs all the support it can get.  Strong businesses need a strong local government structure which understands \"one size does not fit all\". The economies, employment prospects and community needs of West Suffolk, East Suffolk and the Ipswich area are all different and businesses need to build partnerships with councils which are locally-focused.  West Suffolk is inextricably linked to the Cambridge sub-region which has very different economic priorities to the areas around Lowestoft and Ipswich, for example.  Our local communities look to work, shop and spend their leisure time in areas with distinctly different identities.  Please support local business - and local democracy - by supporting three unitary councils in Suffolk.",
