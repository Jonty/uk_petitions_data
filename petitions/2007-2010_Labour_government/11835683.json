        "background": "The current age for Cervical Smear Tests is 25, this should be lowered to 16 to prevent more women going through the pain of Cervical Cancer.\n\nYoung women should be able to get a smear test as soon as they are sexually active, and most are at the age of 16.\n \nCervical Smear Tests should also be available to all women at least once a year or upon request of the patient.\n\nMuch like when you are able to visit a sexual health clinic to get tested for STD's, STI's & recieve contraception, Cervical Smears should be a service that is also offered.\n\nWales & Scotland currently start Cervical Smear Tests from the age of 20.",
