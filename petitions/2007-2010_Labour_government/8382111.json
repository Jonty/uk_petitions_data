And why are they striking a deal to sell the land to the muslim community in 2011 for a price of just \u00a372,000?  The land is estimated to be worth from \u00a3500k to \u00a31m.  I'm all for building communities but this, at least financially, seems crazy.\n\nThis needs to be investigated and it is in the public interest to do so.",
