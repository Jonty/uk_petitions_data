            "background": "Supermarket frozen food sections are always open to the heated area of the supermarket.  This means that large amounts of energy are wasted on cooling down air, the cold air then spills throughout the shop meaning the supermarket must be heated much more.  This is a massive waste of energy that could be reduced instantly by banning open freezers and fridges in supermarkets.  The prime minister would not leave his fridge door open all day, and should make sure that supermarkets do not waste energy in the same way.",
