            "background": "It is estimated that over 60% of all share trading in the USA is automatic \"high frequency\" trading where computers buy and sell shares within fractions of a second using mathematical models to ensure a profit. It is likely that the same volume of UK share trading is actioned automatically in the same way. Such systems defeat the primary objective of the market to provide capital for industry and business and uncrontrolled, they could create another market crash. The government should require all share purchases to be held for a minmum of (say) 24 hours.",
