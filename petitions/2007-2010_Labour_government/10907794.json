            "background": "It is my opinion (also shared by many in this country) that marijuana and magic mushrooms are NOT dangerous 'drugs'--the effects of which are supposedly to be guarded against--but simply substances which grow NATURALLY on this planet, and incidentally, happen to facilitate the mental evolution of our species. These substances provide those who use them, with a great sense of personal well-being and (for want of a better term) 'spiritual' enlightenment. I propose that the legalisation of these particular substances would very likely change our country for the better, by making those who desire to try them more empathetic, contemplative (thus ultimately more emotionally intelligent), and less aggressive individuals. If they are legalised they can be regulated; for instance, extra strong (chemically modified) skunk--which no doubt, to a certain extent, plays a role in the decline of mental health in the country--can eventually be eradicated, and we can all (if we wish) enjoy the natural crops which many of us know and love.\nPeace.",
