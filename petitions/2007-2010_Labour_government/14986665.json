            "background": "There are lots of lorries from other countries usuing our roads they come by ferry or tunnel into the UK. This would a fair tax to these lorries say \u00a310.00 per day or \u00a350.00 per week. These lorries use our roads and put nothing towards it.They come here with cheap fuel bought aboard and enough to last them while they are here.Britsh lorries pay over the odds for fuel and also road tax in the UK. British hauliers going aboard also have to pay to use roads aboard as well as the taxes from the UK.This is unfair. Perhaps this will raise taxes that are needed instaed of hammering the British people more. I would like to see this in the next Budget.",
