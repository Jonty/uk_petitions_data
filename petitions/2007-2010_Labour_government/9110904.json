        "background": "There has been speculation that the Red Arrows will not be allowed to perform at the 2012 London Olympics because it may be construed as too military and may offend some people.\n\nThe attitude of China offends me. It oppresses its own population and militarily threatens its neighbours such as Tibet and Taiwan. It is essentially a military dictatorship.\n\nAllowing China to host the 2008 Olympics and have this splashed all over our media is a propaganda coup for a country which refuses basic rights to its own people and refuses free reporting of the truth about its behaviour.\n\nTo allow them such publicity legitimises this behaviour.",
