        "background": "The government seems to be convinced that speeding is the cause of road deaths and that if they reduce our speed limits, road deaths will be cut to zero. This is misinformed policy-making. By all means develop other ways of making roads safer, but leave the speed limits alone. If you start proposing measures that the majority find ridiculous, you will lose all credibility and no-one will obey your traffic laws. If you lose the driving public's respect they will do as they please. The government is treading fine line, it should be careful it doesn't cross it.",
