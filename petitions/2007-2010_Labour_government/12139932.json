If the nit nurse was back in our schools then this would be reduced by far as childrens heads would be checked routinal and sent home and asked not to return their child until they are treated and clear of lice. I have put a group together on facebook called bring back the nit nurse and already has hundreds of members all agreeing to this. I ave also been asked to draw up a pettition so parents around and about schools even the teachers can sign in agreeance to bringing back the nit nurse!",
