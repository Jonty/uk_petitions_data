He has also become a renowned and respected historian\nwho gives of much of his time to historically linked movements\nsuch as, most noteably, the Mary Rose Trust (for whom he is a\ntrustee) and The Battlefields Trust. He also gives, generously,\nof his time to many other worthwhile causes around the country.\n\nFurther, Mr Hardy is always the consumate gentleman and is a\nwonderful role model and inspiration to many through his\nhard-work, demeanour,commitment and kindnesses. Certainly, he is\ndoing much to bring attention to areas of our past which are\ntoo often ignored.\n\nWe, the undersigned, feel that a knighthood is long-overdue and\nthoroughly deserved.",
