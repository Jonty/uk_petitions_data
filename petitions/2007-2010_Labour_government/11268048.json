            "background": "Please do not force the people of this country to carry the burden of borrowing simply to keep the car industry afloat. Many Landrover/Jaguar cars pollute the environment disproportionately. Furthermore, climate change necessitates that we use cars less in general. If, as government policies indicate, we must use public spending to boost the economy and provide jobs, please invest in some of the following instead: alternative jobs for car-workers (such as building ambulances, buses etc.), alternative energy provision, more and better low-cost housing, and much-needed charities which are presently having to cut back on their valuable work. All these would put public money to better use than compounding the damage already caused by too many cars. We need a real change in attitude.",
