            "background": "This petition is for anybody who feels they've been let down by this governments shoddy Adult Learning Grant which is part of the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nDelayed Applications by 2-3 months, payments not being paid, learning agreement forms apparently getting lost, long waiting times on the phone 15 minutes or more. The list of failings of this department is endless.\n\nI myself applied for an Adult Learning Grant in September, 2 of my Agreement Forms have suddenly vanished, and still have had no money. Yet I\u2019m expected to support myself. Instead I have to borrow money from my Father who is an OAP. \n\nWhen the Governments wants money from you, its very quick to pounce on the matter. When it\u2019s the other way round, they take as long as humanly possible.\n\nThis government needs to sort out the ALG fund, they need more staff working to clear this backlog, more staff on the phones, and they need put in a system where numerous Agreement Forms are NOT lost.",
