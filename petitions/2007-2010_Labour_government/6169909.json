            "background": "In the USA and Germany the level of recycling of bottles of the glass and plastic variety has dramatically increased after a resonable level of deposit was placed on these items. All shops must recycle the bottles and return deposits no matter who sold the original item. This includes soft drinks bottles, beer bottles and more.\n\nThis idea is similar to the EC directive to force the recycling of electrical goods.",
