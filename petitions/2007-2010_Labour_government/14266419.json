            "background": "This petition is to stop the proposed demonstration of Islam4UK through the Wiltshire town of Wooton Bassett. The town has been the place of repatriation of the dead service men who have fought and died on our behalf. We owe them a debt of gratitude.\n\nThis petition does not call on the Government to censor what Islam4UK are saying or to stop any form protest or free speech. But the selection of Wooton Bassett as the place of protest is a disgrace to those who have fallen, those who have been injured, those who have served in the past, those who continue to serve and to those who hold our Armed Forces in such high esteem.\n\nPlease sign the petition to call for the Government to block the protest through the streets of Wooton Bassett.",
