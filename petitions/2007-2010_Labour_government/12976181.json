        "background": "I feel that it is unfair that, in the event of my not having exact money for a parking meter/machine, I am effectively forced to overpay. \n\nThis appears to be the case all over the country and is allowing local authorities to overcharge for the 'service' of providing parking facilities.\n\nIf I buy any other product from a 'vending machine' I, rightly, expect change to be provided. I believe this should be the case for parking meters also.",
