The previous bridge was washed away and they need the link to provide services to a major visitor attraction. It could be a major publicity coup for Network Rail if they could provide a redundant safe Railway Bridge removed as part of their \"Bridgemaster\" replacement scheme and would boost visitor numbers to North Yorkshire and Castle Bolton not least possible freight movements removed from the ailing road network.",
