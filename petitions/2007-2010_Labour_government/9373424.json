Retrospective Taxation is wrong.\nEveryone is paying more for less.\nThe government wastes billions on pointless PFI and QANGOs.  \nThey lend BILLIONS to private companies (banks for example) with NO benefit to the working person.\nMPs have few checks and balances for their own personal expenses.  They vote their own payrises through.  Isn't it time we saw whether the people who have to pay for all this are happy about the way the country is run?",
