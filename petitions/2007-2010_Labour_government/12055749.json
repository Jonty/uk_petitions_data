        "action": "Initiate a massive expansion of (underground) railways in the UK",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition proposes a massive expansion of the railways country-wide, which would go underground where necessary (e.g. to avoid built-up areas). The aim would be to make catching a train a real alternative to the car for at least 90% of car journeys.\n\nLondon, Newcastle and other cites with their own tube systems, could be allowed to grow their systems, which could eventually link up with similar systems based in and around towns and cities that don't currently have them.\n\nLike Rome wasn't built in a day, building such a system would take decades, but if it was a national strategic objective it could eventually be done.\n\nPart of the funds could come from switching existing investment in the road network to rail - there would be less need for extra lanes on motorways etc. if the rail system was extensive. There would also be a payback from the reduction in road traffic, reduced pollution/environmental damage, and less demand for fossil fuels which are in decline.",
