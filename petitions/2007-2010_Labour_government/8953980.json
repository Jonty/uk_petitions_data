This is not some Christian, Right Wing, Political Push, but a fact because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented.  It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools.  If God offends you, then I suggest you try another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this.  But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you to take advantage of one other great Australian Freedom,\u201d\n\n\u201cTHE RIGHT TO LEAVE.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t happy here, then LEAVE.  We didn\u2019t force you to come here.  You asked to be here.  So accept the country YOU accepted.\u201d",
