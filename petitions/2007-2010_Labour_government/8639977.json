            "background": "More & more European people are being allowed to take up residence in Britain to do unskilled labour. In the meantime 1000's of young British people are unable to find secure employment, Whilst this is happening Europeons are causing an almighty strain on our emergency services. Immigrants are coming here to have children at which point they are elligable to recieve health/welfare services and benefits. How much is this costing the taxpayers of this country? We are not against immigration where there is need for labour but given the statistics of people claiming JSA, surely these people need to be motivated into securing jobs before they are taken by immigrants. So I ask, stop unnecessary immigration by forcing the unemployed to take these jobs.",
