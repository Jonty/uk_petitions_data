            "background": "There are times when it is in the best interest of a child to be removed from their parent(s) such as in any kind of abuse.  However when parents and family need support to keep their child or children together we feel it is wrong to remove them.  \n\nAs an example:  If a mother who has never harmed her child requests he goes into care as she suffered a breakdown.  Social services places her boy in foster placement based on incorrect information.  Social services are trying to get him adopted despite asking for expert witnesses; both said he should be returned to her care.  Two experts said her baby should be at home and social services should provide respite care if there is a crisis. Social services have done nothing to support her and her baby.",
