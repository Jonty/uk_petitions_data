        "background": "Silsden is a small semi-rural town in West Yorkshire, surrounded by the much larger settlements of Keighley, Ilkley and Skipton.  It has a declining local economy as its small independent retail sector struggles to survive; its local community organisations are underfunded compared with those of the larger nearby settlements and public service investment in the area has been reduced over recent years.\n\nThis petition calls on the Government to recognise Silsden and its surrounding Cobbydale area as an independent people's republic.  There are plenty of examples of highly successful micro-states for Silsden to follow, such as Andorra, Gilbraltar, Monaco and Liechtenstein.",
