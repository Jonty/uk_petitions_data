            "background": "Dangerous driving and also careless driving are being mis-used on a MASSIVE scale by the prosecuting agencies throughout Britain. This mass over use is leading to the charge being regarded as a joke and nothing more than a slightly more serious speeding offence rather than what the charge was designed for. The present definition needs heavily re-worded and the meaning made far more clear so that it's mis-use is stopped. If this is not to be a route for the government to consider then it is high time that they publicise exactly what currently constitutes dangerous driving so that the people of Britain can have a chuckle at what is happening at their expense and how thousands of motorists are being convicted of offences which amount to little more than speeding.",
