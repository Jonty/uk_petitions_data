            "background": "I drive mainly in Gosport/Fareham Hampshire but I'm sure people around the country suffer intimidation from drivers that come up to close behind. When they drive to close they are unable to respond to an emergency stop in time, also they cause irritatation for the driver infront, which could result in an accident by distraction. The driver behind will eventually overtake only to be one car infront at the next set of traffic control lights. Usually after hurling lots of abuse or making childish obscene jestures.\n\nWould you please join me in making it illeagal for a car travelling behind to be within 5 metres to a car infront whilst cars are moving.",
