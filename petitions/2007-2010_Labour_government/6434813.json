As of yet it seems there is no reassurance that these cards will be safe and that any thief could steal it and use your money. What is wrong with conventional cash? Are we all so lazy that we dont want to wait an extra minute to ensure our safety? Stop the introduction of these cards or at least allow the choice for cash payments.",
