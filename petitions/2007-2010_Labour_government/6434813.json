        "background": "In London this autumn a new \"touch and go\" credit card is being introduced intended to minimize the use of cash and allow people to merely touch their card onto a reader to pay for items less than \u00a310 without using a PIN or signature. As of yet it seems there is no reassurance that these cards will be safe and that any thief could steal it and use your money. What is wrong with conventional cash? Are we all so lazy that we dont want to wait an extra minute to ensure our safety? Stop the introduction of these cards or at least allow the choice for cash payments.",
