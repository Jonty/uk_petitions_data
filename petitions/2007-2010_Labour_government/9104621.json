This will make sure that we only allow immigrants who can contribute to our economy, reduce the strain on local councils and public services, reduce the housing shortage, reduce social segregation, reduce the burden on infrastructure on roads and therefore taxes. This not a matter of racism, we are a small island and we cannot hold anymore people. So we must look after the people that are here now and for the future, that is both immigrants and British Citizens.",
