            "background": "Instigate an immediate General Election in view of the deplorable conduct of many MP's and in light of the general principle of this government to reward failure of individuals to perform their duties in a positive and correct manner.  To this end I hold up the many bankers who have profited and today we hear that Michael Martin is to be rewarded for his failure to carry out the terms and conditions of his post only to be given a pension and honours that many members of the public who work just as hard have no opportunity to attain.  Parliament is in disarray, integrity in the persons and institute of Parliament is at an all time low. We want the opportunity to trust our MP\u2019s, many of whom are honest and trustworthy, given the weak leadership and the many bad decisions of  this government we and they need to know that the right people are making the decisions that reflect society\u2019s attitude.  The time is now right for Gordon Brown to make the most honest and courageous decision of his career, just like many of the bankers and Mr. Martin his time has run out.  Leave with dignity and have the courage to trust in the British people to make the right choice.",
