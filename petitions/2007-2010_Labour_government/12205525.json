        "background": "All those below 16, or over 60 now have free swimming, however rich, without means testing.  Those on Benefit also need to keep fit and healthy, which would also save the NHS billions.  We also need to be fit for employment, in the hope that we may, at some future point, be allowed/assisted back to a normal life by means of honest toil. \n\nSwimming should also be free for all parents and children under school age, as the best way to cumpulsory swimming for all.  All swimming aids should be banned, as an extremely retrograde step which denies the \"victim\" the opportunity to learn/improve the necessary self-confidence.  Obviously, the heaviy disabled would be exempt from this measure.\n\nOn the plains of Central Europe they have done this for at least 25 years.",
