        "background": "I implore the Prime Minister or Government to intervene with regards to the subject of the Edinburgh tram system.\n\nThe incompetence of the senior level management charged with the tram lines construction has led another of Edinburgh's construction and regeneration projects directly into the same preconcieved and avoidable financial hardship that we, the people funding such projects(taxpayers) had to endure with the construction of the Scottish Parliament.\n\nI am sure that the detrimental impact that the construction of this project has had on local businesses, residents and tourism has not been lost on the Prime Minister, however, in order for the project to be completed as close to the originally designated timescale and budget as possible without further inconvenience, loss of revenue or damage to the local economy or residents, the immediate necessity has arrisen for the Prime Minister or Government to intervene and assume control of the project or to appoint a replacement contractor to continue the works at the negligible cost and timeframe previously agreed.",
