            "background": "The country is in an economic mess with record levels of public borrowing and debt that mean our children and grandchildren will be paying higher taxes to repay this debt for years to come, it is not fair to all the hard working individuals whose pay packets are taxed so heavily  that this country gives away over \u00a36 billion of taxpayers money a year to other countries when we can not afford to do so. If individuals want to donate then they should be able to do so via a charity, it should not be up to government to decide to give our taxes away when we need the money in our own country. Overseas aid must cease and the money saved used on looking after the UK population instead of being handed out to other countries",
