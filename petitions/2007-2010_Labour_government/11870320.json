There should be no censorship at all, especially under the guise of political correctness, which, as every non political person knows is just two faced, superficial, and eroding everyone's freedom of speech and act.  Although a powerful tool within politics it is, in the realms of 'normal folk' just a means of censoring what people want to say. One cannot call a spade a spade nowadays( and I refer to the garden tool variety) These freedoms have been slowly taken away and the only petitons that get allowed are suspect and impotent, therefore, not a true reflection of what the people think.  I myself have had more turned down due to silly reasons rather than just posted as I have written it, having to change them for various reasons, thereby, only accepted if I conform to the criteria stated......isn't this censorship?",
