            "background": "This petition is to halt the building of a Mosque and community centre on the Hall Street sire in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley.\nThere are many mosques in the area and such a substantial building would change the character of the area and should be used for a new business enterprise site. It is undemocratic to build such an eyesore when so many local people have signed petition after petition to stop it. \nThe local people dont want it, the local council have rejected it and it will create bad feeling if it went ahead.",
