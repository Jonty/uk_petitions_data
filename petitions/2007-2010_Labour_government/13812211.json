            "background": "The North Surrey Domestic Abuse Forum would like you to sign this petition to raise awareness of the lack of funding that goes into the provision of services available to men who are victims of domestic abuse and to urge the Government to provide funding and to breakdown the inequalities that exist between the services offered to women who are the victims/survivors of domestic abuse and those offered to men.\n\nIt is perceived that men are not victims and that they are strong both physically and emotionally.  With this view commonly perpetuated it further creates a divide and adds to the isolation of this marginalised group.  The invisibility of services due to the lack of funding makes it very difficult for men to realise that they can be supported when they are in an abusive relationship.  All the while the Government refuses to fund such initiatives the problem will stay hidden.",
