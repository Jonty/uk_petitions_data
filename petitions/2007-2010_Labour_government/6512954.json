            "background": "Northern Rock is solvent and viable business with strong community links to the North East. It has performed numerous good deeds through the Northern Rock foundation.\n\nIf the Government were to take any deliberate action that would jeopardise the Independent Future of Northern Rock, we believe that this would be a betrayal of North East and would represent  undue favouritism to large London and internationally based institutions who can more easily use tax legislation to avoid making their fair contribution to society. In effect the Government would indirectly subsidising progression toward a banking monopoly.\n\nWe therefore call on the Government not to take any deliberate actions that could endanger the independent future of Northern Rock and further we call on them to conduct a review of the conflicts of interests and monopolistic practices in larger financial instructions which have ultimately led to the current credit crunch.",
