I answered simply that I would treat all human beings the same and, as a result, was unsuccessful.  As an applicant for a job, or as an employee, I should not be expected to 'promote' any agenda that is political in nature - this is dictatorship.  It should be made illegal for any organisation and especially for taxpayer funded organisations, to discriminate against employees/applicants simply because they are not prepared to promote a political agenda.  The government should examine how organisations are promoting this agenda and should work to stop this dictatorship towards employees/applicants.",
