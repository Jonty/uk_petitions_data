            "background": "Despite overwhelming public outrage, developers have received permission to demolish The New Piccadilly Caf\u00e9 in London's Soho. The Caf\u00e9 is due to close on Saturday 22nd September, and unless the decision is reversed the area will be reshaped as yet another office, domestic and retail development. This petition is to serve notice that we, the undersigned, feel that a surfeit of thoughtless and greedy planning decisions are in danger of excising the very soul of our capital, leaving a characterless, sanitised, corporate wasteland in its place.",
