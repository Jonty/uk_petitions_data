        "background": "I'm afraid that this policy has no justification whatsoever. I drive a Ford Mondeo and will be paying \u00a3400 a year by 2010 just to tax it. If this was a green policy the government wouldn't be increasing the tax on cars that are already on the road. (Unless you are expecting us to crush them all?!) So we the undersigned want a straight answer to the following; why increase taxes for cars already on the road and where is the extra revenue being spent?",
