        "background": "Costs of owning, running and fueling a car / motorcycle have increased substantially in the last couple of years, while the Inland Revenue allowances have remained unchanged. As car / motorcycle owners who are called upon to use their car / motorcycle for business we find the increased cost against the return / allowances unsustainable and call for an immediate uplift of 40% to these rates. This increase is neccessary to reflect the inflationary increases in vehicle licences, insurance, increased interest on hire purchase payments and hyper inflation on fuel. To not raise these allowances in light of the dramatic increases to costs is unfair and effectively compels the Employee to subsidise the business and the Treasury.",
