Piecemeal resignations and by-elections will not solve the problem; this needs the Prime Minister to show real Leadership. We propose that the Prime Minister should act to halve the number of MPs, by eliminating all those who have exploited the expenses system above a certain value, that value being determined to achieve the prescribed reduction. There should be no by-elections; those constituencies that become unrepresented should be merged with neighbouring constituencies, as the price to pay for electing individuals who lacked the integrity to uphold the standards expected of them.",
