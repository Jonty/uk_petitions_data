In my very strong opinion this one fact totally negates any defence there might ever have been for pavement cyclists; I do understand that some roads may be considered too dangerous for them to ride on but in that case they should walk on the pavement, wheeling their bikes next to them, until they come to a road which they perceive as safe.\n\nThe publicity requested could take a similar form to the \"Think Bike\" adverts on television.  Pedestrians' safety - and lives! - are just as important as those of motor-cyclists.",
