        "background": "The slow loris, native to large swathes of Asia, must be one of the most appealing creatures on the planet. \n\n\"The pet shops advertise them, and they're very popular to Japanese ladies,\" says Masayuki Sakamoto from the Japan Wildlife Conservation Society. \n\n\"They're easy to keep, they don't cry, they're small, and just very cute.\" \n\nThe Slow Loris definately need a certain amount of care and attention and are definatly not to be kept in wire cages but i believe these beautiful little creatures would be well looked after in a traditional English home and be fed and cleaned appropriately.\n\nThey are on the endangered species list and so allowing them to be pets within this country would only encourage breeding and allow them to grow in numbers.",
