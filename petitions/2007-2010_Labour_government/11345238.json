Usually a child grows out of asthma when they are around 14 years of age; however some don't.\n\nOnce an asmatic becomes 18 they have to pay in the region of \u00a37-\u00a39 for their inhailers and i think this is unfair;  other hereditory conditions are subsidised and covered by the NHS, why not asthma?",
