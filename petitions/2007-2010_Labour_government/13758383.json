            "background": "I request that the Government ends discrimination against pet owners who are living as private tenants in rented accommodation.   A regulation in my existing lease states \"No bird dog cat or other animal shall be kept in any Flat or in any other part of the building.\"  For 7 years, I've lived in the same building with my cat, and now I'm being evicted for being in breach of this term in my lease.  What should private tenants to do in such a situation?  Animal-shelters such as Battersea Dogs Home are already overpopulated with abandoned pets.  And living with a pet provides a great \nsource of comfort for the elderly, the disabled and for people suffering with a mental illness (in addition to single people, people who don't have children etc).  I feel that this regulation should be removed from all leases so that pet-owners are not discriminated against and have the same protection as non-pet owners.",
