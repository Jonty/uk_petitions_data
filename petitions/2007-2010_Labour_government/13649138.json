            "background": "Air traffic is increasing and with it noise pollution, visual pollution and probably most importantly air pollution.\n\nWith global warming threatening and the ice caps already dissapearing the time to act is now. Aviation creates a huge amount of CO2, which is the major contribution for climate change. \n\nAlso it is difficult to find anywhere, even in the countryside, where you are free of noise pollution from planes.\n\nLots of the domestic flights around the UK are unnecessary as trains can take you to most plaes in britatain cheaper and sometimes quicker than planes.\n\nReducing traffic or preventing the growth may also reduce the need for airport expantion.\n\nPlease sign this petition and send the Prime Minister a clear message that we need to act now!",
