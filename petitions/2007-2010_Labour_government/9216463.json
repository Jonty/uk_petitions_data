        "background": "assessing capacity for information and breach of confidentiality should be covered by the Caldicott Report but junior staff are still clumsy in their management of sensitive issues raised in what was once termed \"means testing\" - address this, by improving the environment, and I dare say, you will reduce some of the conflict. Get them to read case specific notes as well - I was aksed \"what am I doing to get work ?\" when my husband has only been given 6 months to live - the point was I was there because I was unable to work IN THE JOB I ALREADY HAVE after a head on collision and being asked to fill in five identical forms is a waste of space - the British govt really should compensate and/or refund petrol expenses it was so useless ! The two centres lost 3 identical sick notes, too. A shambles. Would you really put up with this ? God knows how much the photocopying all costs !",
