Get them to read case specific notes as well - I was aksed \"what am I doing to get work ?\" when my husband has only been given 6 months to live - the point was I was there because I was unable to work IN THE JOB I ALREADY HAVE after a head on collision and being asked to fill in five identical forms is a waste of space - the British govt really should compensate and/or refund petrol expenses it was so useless ! The two centres lost 3 identical sick notes, too. A shambles. Would you really put up with this ? God knows how much the photocopying all costs !",
