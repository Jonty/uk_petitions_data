            "background": "Either the global population needs to decide to do without mass produced products of the industrial age (cars, glass, houses, fridges, toys, clothing, road travel, air travel) or the increases proposed by environmental groups will be doomed to failure.\n\nThe net effect of huge artificial cuts in carbon emissions in the Western world, for example, is to simply move the entire manufacturing process to an undeveloped nation such as China, whose annual carbon emission increase far outweighs any 40% decrease.\n\nHowever the side effect is a sharp increase in UK unemployment, leading to poverty.\n\nThe UK has fine scientists and industrialists: when consumers demand ethical and environmental alternatives, market forces will reduce carbon emissions. However the present reality is that a significant majority of the population simply do not care. Therefore pushing an environmental agenda unsupported by market forces will simply lead to UK recession, for zero environmental benefit. We should be encouraging our population to develop the country, not pushing them to meet targets they do not support",
