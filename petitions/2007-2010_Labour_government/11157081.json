It should be made ilegal. Everywhere I read in a newspaper or on TV how dare they use My Kings Name like this. All you other christians out there will feel the same way as I do. So Mr Gordon Brown stop sitting on your lazy backside and do something about these people who wish to upset \"Us religious people.\" Because it is the best thing that ever happened to me was giving my life over to christ. So he would change me for the better now I think of others more and I am happy. I am prepared to make a change and turn the whole world to Jesus Christ. Amen",
