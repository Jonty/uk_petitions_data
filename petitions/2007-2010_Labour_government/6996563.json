            "background": "Use of a motorcycle reduces pollution and congestion. The current no charge regime for motorcycles at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing recognises this fact. In 05/06 more than 300,000 motorcycles used the crossing. Installing a passing lane at the Crossing will free motorcyclists from the hassle of stopping at the barriers and greatly improve safety. There have been a number of incidents when motorcyclists have collided with toll barriers due to a lack of coordination between the biker and the toll operator.",
