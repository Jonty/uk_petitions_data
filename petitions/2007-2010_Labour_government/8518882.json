It is only small, Select Groups in the UK that are like this. The Media Know this, yet they still portray all Teenagers to be like this. The Media's View on this is increasing tensions around the UK and many people are beginning to turn round to this fake media's view. This Petition is Aimed at Stopping this by Stopping the Media from doing this.",
