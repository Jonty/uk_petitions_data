            "background": "How is it that young professionals just cannot win in society. Young people in better paid jobs have to pay well over the average in general taxes, national insurance and council tax - most of whom have private health care at a great expense so are not burdening the NHS system, most of whom do not have children etc, so why do we have to pay for schools at this stage?\nIt is no incentive to work hard at school if you get to the stage where you cannot even afford a house to live in, but also get bullied into shelling out hard-earned money. It is time the government made tax breaks for young professionals and stop punishing us!!! PLEASE LISTEN!",
