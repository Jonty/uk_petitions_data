            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There was a stamp duty land tax holiday in 2008/2009 and ended Jan 1st 2010.  Then, the budget announced that a further stamp duty land tax holiday from March 2010 for 2 years, for first time buyers.\n\nUnfairly, those first time buyers (encouraged to get the market going) who completed on their transactions in Jan 2010 to Mid-March 2010 had to pay stamp duty land tax; that's less than 3 months.  How is that fair or justified?\n\nAll first time buyers should be repaid all or part of their tax for unluckily completing in those 2.5 months.  First time buyers do not have the spare cash to pay tax, it is expensive enough as it is, and the Government has let down those who paid their tax in those 2.5 months only for it to be exempt a month later.",
