            "background": "The public display of human remains, for example mummified bodies taken from their tombs in egypt, or the body of a young child dug up and displayed at Avebury in England, is a complete disrespect of these peoples beliefs and a violation of their rights, and the rights of their people.\nThe very idea of being dup up and displayed 1000 years in the future is horrific.\nWe need to realise that these peoples beliefs are valid and their rest should not be disturbed, or their traditions violated\nWe need to bring in legislation now to stop this horrific violation of these peoples rights, and to ensure that the same treatment does not befall us in the future, and to ensure that more belief systems are not rudely thrust aside by the massive fascination the current culture has for staring at dead bodies",
