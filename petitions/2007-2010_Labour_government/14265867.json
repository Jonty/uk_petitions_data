In today's paper, a woman with 13 children receiving \u00a3700 a WEEK in benefits vows to carry on having children, yet she has never worked a day in her life. We, the hard working citizens of this country, are suffering, we aren't going to get out of this recession if our government keeps throwing money away. In this day and age, it seems you are better off not having a job! This isn't right!!",
