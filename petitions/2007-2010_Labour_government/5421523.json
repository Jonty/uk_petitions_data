        "background": "Many people are suffering from noise pollution and litter from late retail outlets like Tesco Express. Crime has incresed partly due to the sale of alcohol from such places.I propose that opening laws should be reviewed so that the operating hours and delivery times are 8am to 10pm and 9am to 5pm respective. This will allow residents close to these places to have some relaxation time and be able to go to bed at a reasonable time without noise. Also these places should be made responsible to keep the streets close-by tidy.",
