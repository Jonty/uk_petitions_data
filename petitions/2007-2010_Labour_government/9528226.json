            "background": "The Scotland Act, 1998, devolved responsibility for certain matters to the Scottish Parliament and reserved other matters to the UK Parliament. MPs elected in Scotland could therefore no longer represent and act on behalf of their constituents for matters for which the UK Parliament ceased to be responsible. They have nevertheless continued to deal with such matters although they are not answerable for their actions to their voters. This is contrary to the basic principal of a representative democracy and no revision of our Constitution should be permitted unless it makes this clear.",
