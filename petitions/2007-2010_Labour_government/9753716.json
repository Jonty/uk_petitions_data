The recent free vote on Human Fertilisation and Embryology produced one of the most ballanced debates, that resulted in a truely fair and sensible vote.  It is time for the archaic system of voting on party political lines and the 'punch and judy' politics we now see on our TV sets everyday to be abandonned in the interests or our democracy.  This country needs simple, sensible and workable legislation; something that is only delivered on the very rare occasion of a free parliamentary vote.",
