        "background": "The childrens index which is going ahead could mean that children and families are at more risk if held on a central computer system, although access is to be restricted this does not stop information getting into the wrong hands.  Although no details of consultations will be shown or case details, childrens dates of birth, addresses and guardianship names including staff involved and their job title will be displayed. This leaves vunerable children/families whether it be though domestic violence etc exposed.Also, it does not take much to know if their are issues with families or children if certain professionals are involved. I would urge that the government rethink this, and is it legal holding all this information on people without their consent!!",
