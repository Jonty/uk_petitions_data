        "background": "Being a  staunch Labour voter I was appalled to watch our Prime minister lying to the house and thus the British people when stating he would be increasing spending over the next 5 years. Get real, the pot is bare, debt is spiralling, it doesn't take a genius to know we need to tighten our belts. At least treat us with respect and tell the truth instead of trying to score cheap plolitical points. Shame on you Mr Brown, you have finally lost the last bit of respect I had for you and with it my vote.",
