            "background": "The Home Information Pack (HIP)is having a detrimental affect on the already stagnated housing market. It is prohibitive in nature and is yet another stumbling block that sellers must cross to put their properties on the open market. Many families are desperate to sell due to the current economic conditions but are forced to find a fee of anywhere between \u00a3150 to \u00a3300. We request that the Home Information Pack be suspended for a minimum term of 12 months in a bid to regenerate the collapsing housing market.",
