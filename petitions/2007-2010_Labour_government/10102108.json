            "background": "Home Information Packs are costly and ineffectual as a means of speeding up the home-buying process and had a hugely detrimental effect on the housing market, well before the 'credit crunch' took hold. Energy Performance ratings are useful, but should be voluntary. Far better to implement a policy similar to the Scottish system, where buyers and sellers are legally bound once an offer has been accepted. This would restrict the number of time-wasters and should speed up the process.",
