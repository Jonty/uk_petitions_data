        "action": "Scrap HIPs and introduce a legally-binding agreement for property sellers and buyers which comes into effect once an offer is made and accepted and which makes each party liable to any costs incurred by the other party if one party pulls out of a sale or purchase for reasons of their own making",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Home Information Packs are costly and ineffectual as a means of speeding up the home-buying process and had a hugely detrimental effect on the housing market, well before the 'credit crunch' took hold. Energy Performance ratings are useful, but should be voluntary. Far better to implement a policy similar to the Scottish system, where buyers and sellers are legally bound once an offer has been accepted. This would restrict the number of time-wasters and should speed up the process.",
