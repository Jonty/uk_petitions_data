        "background": "Open wards must become a thing of the past. Open wards severely compromise the dignity, security and privacy of in-patients in hospitals and cause patients a further layer of deep distress and anxiety on top of their illness.\n\nThis is just one example of what happened to me when I was on an open ward. The ward comprised several bays of six beds in each bay. In the bed opposite the patient was close to death and had a round-the-clock stream of crying relatives around her. Next to me was a very distressed woman who cried and screamed all night. She was doubly incontinent and stenches, including during mealtimes, were inevitable. In another bed was a kleptomaniac who stole items from all other patients throughout the day and night. I knew everyone's diagnosis and prognosis because nobody had any privacy apart from a thin and raggedy curtain. I was not permitted to pull my curtain around as this inconvenienced the staff. \n\nThis hellish scenario occurs every day and most people are too ill or otherwise vulnerable to complain. A plan needs to be put in place to put this to an end.",
