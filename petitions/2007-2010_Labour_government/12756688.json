            "background": "We believe, following the recent snub by Nicholas Sarcozy and the French government over the D-Day commemorations, that the time has come to revoke our support of the French Resistance over the entire period of German occupation, and our subsequent liberation of the country in 1944. We are not necessarily advocating a literal occupation by Great Britain, more an indication that we wouldn't stand in the way if Germany fancied another go. \n\nAll American citizens reading this petition are welcome to sign on behalf of the United States if they wish.",
