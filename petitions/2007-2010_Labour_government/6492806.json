        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sport based physical education does not provide fitness for anybody not already fit and confident in that sport, it also promotes bullying by those more apt at a particular sport. I suggest that sport be a purely extra curricular activity in secondary schools, and that fitness excercises that can be practiced in the home and into adulthood should be taught within the curriculum to promote life long fitness for all.",
