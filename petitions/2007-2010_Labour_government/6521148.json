            "background": "I have seen too many times people using the wrong lane on roundabouts, causing either near misses or actual accidents.\n\nWhether or not this is out of lack of knowledge, laziness or arrogence we will never know. Sometimes I have witnessed shocking pieces of driving, like going right in the left hand lane, cutting others up on purpose or turning a crash from a possibility into a foregone conclusion out of some inexplicable attitude of being right is more important than being safe.\n\nTherefore, I propose that on every roundabout with more two or more lanes to have arrows indicating which lane is for right/straight over/left. this should stop the vast majority of problems where one thinks lane A is for straight, and another thinks lane B is for straight, and if there is only one car space on the exit, there is an accident waiting to happen.",
