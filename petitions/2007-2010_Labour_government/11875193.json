            "background": "Worrying about the crunch and sick of businesses / banks getting our money instead of giving it back to you!!!\n\nWhat would you do if you got rewarded \u00a32000 for every year you've worked so far??\n\nImagine if the government gave every worker in the UK \u00a32000 for each year they have worked so far, which would be paid in accordance to NI contributions.\n\n> Old age people would have \u00a31000s and not worry about being cold at Christmas.\n> People with negative equity or huge debts could get back on the straight and narrow.\n> People would start to go out and enjoy lives instead of worrying about their money problems.\n> People would start to spend more, and help banks get back on the road with more savings, which would then let encourage the banks to lend more!\n\nOverall if the government did this, the crunch would go instead of giving billions to fat cat banks and companies who couldn't balance their books!\n\nThey could increase VAT to 20% to balance things out because one way or the other they'd get this payout one day!\n\nSo come on Brown get your finger out, reward the workers and not the bums. Let the people of this country rebuild the mess you made, give us the money and we'll go out spending!",
