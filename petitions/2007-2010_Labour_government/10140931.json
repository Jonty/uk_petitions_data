            "background": "Public houses routinely exclude children quite legally. The exclusions frequently are arbitrary and vary in time and scope. Since it is illegal to discriminate on the grounds of race or sex, this should now be extended to children. Removing child discrimation from public houses while ensuring the necessary safeguards to child welfare vis a vis being accompanied by a parent or responsible adult, will only serve to improve the public house and create a more family friendly atmosphere as experienced in other EU countries.",
