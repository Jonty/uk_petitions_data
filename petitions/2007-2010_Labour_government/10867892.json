            "background": "By making it compulsory for ALL smoke detectors, fire alarms and other related fire prevention/detection equipment to be permanently wired into the mains electrical system of all houses, this would help save lives and money.\nEach year, the fire service spends vast sums of money to tell us to \"Push the button, not your luck\" \u2013 informing us to make sure we have working batteries in our smoke alarms.\nSmoke alarms however, have the design fault of being battery operated, not hard-wired into the mains electrics system. At present, \u2018hard-wired\u2019 fire alarms are only found in public buildings and private houses that are larger than a certain set size.\nIf however, \u2018hard-wired\u2019 fire alarms were built into all new houses AS STANDARD and a legal requirement made so that all battery operated alarms are replaced with hard-wired alarms, this would reduce deaths caused by the negligence of people who didn\u2019t have working smoke alarms, and would save money on adverts which could be spent on equipment.",
