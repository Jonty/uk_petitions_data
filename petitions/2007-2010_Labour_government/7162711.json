            "background": "In regard to contact of Children, that parents can not approach the court directly until they have actually made an effort to mediate and have come to an agreement. That COURTS No longer make the decisions in regard to parents capable of looking after their children. Only Acknowledge the agreement made.  \n\nThat when mediation has been requested both parties have to respond to the questions posed by a deadline and can not generalise or be vague. \n\nWhere possible a questionaire is produced where the parents can work through the questions in regard to contact. So that issues that may not have been thought of are dealt with and they both are aware of the others position in regard to the issue (s), for instance Punishment of the child.\n\nThat there can be a withdrawal of Benefits or CSA payments when the resident parent refuses the visiting parent to see their children. This can only be requested after mediation has not taken place.",
