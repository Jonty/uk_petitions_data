They are unaccountable to most other organisations, and only provide summaried versions of accounts to Companies House and the Charities Commission. They operate virtually without any public scrutiny, and avoid the spotlight provided by the FOIA 2000 that all other public bodies operate under. There are arguments going on at present to make these organisations accountable as public bodies, regardless of this they should be liable to requests under the FOIA 2000. Please Prime Minister make these unnaccountable organisations, more accountable using the FOI Act 2000.",
