        "background": "The unanimous decision of the European Court of Human Rights in late 2008 showed that the United Kingdom failed to comply with its obligations to the European Convention on Human Rights. In order to correct this failure, the most direct remedy to this is for the Home Secretary to make an order to amend s61 (1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, such that it is returned to the situation before the enacting of Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 so that samples taken on arrest are destroyed after an acquittal or decision not to prosecute, and the data from them is removed from the database. This would also bring England and Wales in line with the Law in Scotland and ensure that arrests for minor offences which are not prosecuted do not lead to the potential for discrimination laid out in the decision in the case.",
