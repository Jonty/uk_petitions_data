            "background": "Dear Sir, \nWe hereby petition you to include Mr Tony Lawdham, formerly of Beechen Cliff School, Bath, NE Somerset, on the New Year's Honours List for services to teaching. Mr Lawdham dedicated  his working life to the teaching of English, and did so with a measure of charisma and application that is likely unsurpassed within the field. For many pupils who passed through the national education system under the auspice of the aforementioned institute, Tony Lawdham was the epitome of all that a fine teacher should be; learned, encouraging and committed to his work. As the very fabric of our Anglo-Frisian tongue is degraded through complacency and the ever-shifting focus of public scrutiny, it seems fitting that its most loyal adherent and defender should be honoured for his services to the state. I imagine, and trust that I do not assume to cajole, that an MBE would do very nicely.\nYours etc etc.",
