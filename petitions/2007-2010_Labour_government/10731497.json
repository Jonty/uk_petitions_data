            "background": "The proposal to move production of the Liverpool Echo to Oldham, Manchester is disgusting.  not only will it mean potentially losing many jobs it would also mean that production of the media that involves all of our current affairs would now be done from outside of the City.  what a great way to keep your finger on the pulse.  in the time of carbon footprint reduction, what a great way to reduce it by moving production away and increasing all delivery distances.",
