            "background": "In most cases a person goes over drawn by \u00a32.00.  Banks are charging \u00a325.00 for this which is disgraceful.On a weekend I pay my take into the bank on a Monday morning as I work Saturday nights. Any direct debits etc due to come out of the account on a Monday are taken out on Sunday at Midnight.  I have been onto the bank requesting for them not to be taken out until midday on Monday, this they cant do. I therefore request that it be made illegal for bank charges to be charged before the end of the day that payments are taken out of an account so that people who work on Saturdays and Sundays have a chance to get the money into the account without being penalised. If they dont put it in then its fair that the bank should charge.",
