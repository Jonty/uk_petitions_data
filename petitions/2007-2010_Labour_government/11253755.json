In poor visibility (fog, drizzle, heavy rain, diminishing light) it is extrememly difficult to see other vehicles which are about to overtake you if they haven't got their lights on.\n\nI can only imagine the problem is the same for HGV drivers and van drivers.  Surely this would be a sensible way of making the roads safer, as not all drivers turn their headlights on when the conditions call for it.",
