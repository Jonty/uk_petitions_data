        "background": "Many News articles and offical bodies seriously underestimate the rise in heating costs and in regards to heating Oil, the truly reflective figure (compared to last year) is a rise of 106%. \n\nWith prices now more that double last years price (and set to continue to rise); We belive that the prime minister should not only help those on a low income (who are struggling to heat their houses as a result of this) but those with moderate incomes by decreasing the legal minimum delivery of heating oil to 200 litres instead of 500 litres.",
