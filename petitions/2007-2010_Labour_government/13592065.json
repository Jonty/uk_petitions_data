            "background": "Aubery de Grey believes that there are people alive right now who can live to 1000 years. His ultimate aim is to mnake people better, happy and live for a long time. He has an extraordinary beard which any sane person would wish to snuggle up against. Surely, this is the most optimistic man in the country; and his flowing optimism should be sanctified by the recognition of government. \n\nWe, the undersigned, wish to be filled with the belief that Aubery de Grey would do nothing but good for our country, our ambitions and our love for big beards (cf. Brian Blessed, Henry VIII and that 'Rosen' chap who does poems and was on the telly in the 70's). Consequently, Mr de Grey should be our country's Happiness Czar, to give us hope - however deluded - whilst the world crashes about us.",
