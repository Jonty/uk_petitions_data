            "background": "It seems pretty simple logic to me that if you had not been missold an endowment mortgage you would not have a shortfall to pay off. The moral and financial burden of that misselling should lie with the advisor not with their victim. How can the FSA, and this Government, justify a situation where so many people have large shortfalls \u00a310.000+ and get a tiny amount of compensation or none based on the difference between the interest only and a repayment mortgage.  How can you leave the shortfall on the missold policy out of the equation. ???? And yet they can take your savings into account when working out compensation!!It seems there are little or no consequences or deterrent for such dishonesty.  Where else does the perpetrator of a fraud get asked to work out the victims compensation!!!????????",
