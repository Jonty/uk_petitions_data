            "background": "This act has provided little in terms of effectiveness, but has given in huge volumes new webs of red tape and added costs.  This act is adding to overwhelming pressure placed on British pubs, especially when licensing officers, who have never had any experience in running a pub and are only ill-informed pen pushers, dictate to decent publicans how to do their job.  Place these powers back in the hands of the magistrates, where there was at least a presance of common sence, and keep the bumbling councils away from this type of decision making.",
