            "background": "Emergency tax (BR on payslips) is when your salary has 20% deducted without your personal allowance. Even employees give their P45 still get the emergency tax. This causes no end of grief and distress to both employee and employer. Plus costs time and money for the tax office. Why can't everyone be put on the basic tax allowance of \u00a35,435 (\u00a36,035 from Sept 08). Then if the person needs a better tax code, then they won't lose out as much. Plus, it is a bind for claiming excess tax back.",
