            "background": "It is a postcode lottery when it comes to the extent and type of care received by women when pregnant. Some areas offer a wide variety of tests and scans on the NHS, whereas in other areas certain tests, such as the 12 week Scan to allow for the Nuchal fold measurement, are not available. Women have to pay privately inorder to get this service. \nIt seems unfair that in some regions such tests are available on the NHS when in others they have to be paid for. \nThe level of care varies across each region, with the number of pictures available for each scan varying widely as well as the cost to purchase the pictures.\nThe birth facilities on offer in each area also vary greatly. There should be the same things available within each region to make the birth as stress free as possible no matter where the women lives.\nWe therefore petition that the extent of testing and care available to pregnant women is made consistent across all areas.",
