            "background": "I live in York, and when I called my local council to ask about the possibility of having a regular recycling scheme being set up in my area, I was told my street was 'too narrow'. Since then, a York City Council van has driven down the street so it's occupants could buy their lunch from the sandwich shop at the end of the road. Some areas of York have very good recycling facilities, others don't have any at all. I'm sure this is the case in most cities and rural areas. This petition aims to get the government to organise a uniform scheme across the UK,  to make it easier for every household to recycle as much as possible.",
