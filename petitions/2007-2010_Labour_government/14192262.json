        "background": "Currently front line Police Constables and Sergeants do not receive shift allowance despite working a 24 hour shift pattern.  It is stated that a form of shift allowance is incorporated into a police officers salary however a police officer who has a 9-5 office job receives the same pay as a response officer who works a 24 hours shift pattern. This is unfair in my opinion. There are also more office based police officers than front line officers. Civillian Community Support Officers (PCSO's) on front line duties do receive shift allowance / weekend working enhancements / unsociable hours payments which in some cases can boost their annual salary by at least \u00a32000 - \u00a33000.",
