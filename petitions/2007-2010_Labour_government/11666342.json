            "background": "Gliding is a hobby/sport enjoyed by many people.  It is also the greenest, quietest and some might say purest form of flying.  Yet gliding is the forgotton victim of increasing airport expansion.  With extra commercial flights come more crowded skies and less unrestricted airspace for gliders. The vastly unpopular expansion of Heathrow and flightpath re-routing threatens several London based gliding clubs as well as the environmental damage.  We would like the government to review the proposed expansion of LHR, LGW, STN and re-routing of their flightpaths and offer support to gliding clubs.",
