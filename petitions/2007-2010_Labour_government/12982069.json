The lesson will attempt to tackle confidence issues early so they don\u2019t have a chance to develop, so young people in the UK will not be held back by their lack of self esteem and self belief. The lesson content will be created by a team of experts and psychologists and will include preliminarily:\n\u2022 talks from outside experts\n\u2022 making teens aware of the techniques magazines and fashion houses employ to make models/celebs look unrealistically perfect\n\u2022 challenges to help the teens not to obsess so much about appearance and not to use as much make-up/fake tan;\n\u2022 tips for body confidence collated by psychologists\n\nThis is an incredibly important campaign, as nothing is being done in our schools to counter-act the incredible swelling in the UK of media exposure and its consequent negative influence on teenage self esteem. Your backing would be greatly appreciated.",
