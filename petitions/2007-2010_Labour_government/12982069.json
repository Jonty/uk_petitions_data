        "background": "A proposal for a new compulsory hour per year in the PSHE curriculum that will deal with the problems teenagers face when it comes to their appearance. The lesson will attempt to tackle confidence issues early so they don\u2019t have a chance to develop, so young people in the UK will not be held back by their lack of self esteem and self belief. The lesson content will be created by a team of experts and psychologists and will include preliminarily:\n\u2022 talks from outside experts\n\u2022 making teens aware of the techniques magazines and fashion houses employ to make models/celebs look unrealistically perfect\n\u2022 challenges to help the teens not to obsess so much about appearance and not to use as much make-up/fake tan;\n\u2022 tips for body confidence collated by psychologists\n\nThis is an incredibly important campaign, as nothing is being done in our schools to counter-act the incredible swelling in the UK of media exposure and its consequent negative influence on teenage self esteem. Your backing would be greatly appreciated.",
