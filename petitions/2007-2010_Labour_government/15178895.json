            "background": "What non-sense to keep paying money to under developed coutries when their births and population know no controls.\nIt would make more sense to institute an education about birth control backed up with free birth control.\nThis should be a proviso in all aid programs that the country accepts a birth control package.\nThe populations of the third world countries would then diminish to a manageable extent, there would be less starvation and the aid money would have a chance of doing some good. What sense does it make to keep having more and more children who die of starvation because there is insufficient food and medicines to save them,or if by some miracle they survive they could become orphans due to their parents being killed in a needless war for the limited food and resources in that country.\nThe result would also be that we could reduce the cost of aid to them and focus on our own problems. Allowing the governments of the respective countries to regain control and bring about a safe, peaceful, and ordered environment",
