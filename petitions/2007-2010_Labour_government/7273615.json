        "background": "GMT today reports that more than a third of older people have put a friend or relative into residential care, but nearly half failed to get any advice when they did so. 11% of the 57 % of people who have had to help fund the place themselves, according to financial services group Partnership.\nThe health and social care services are chaotic - to counteract criticism of a postcode lottery system which affects those most vulnerable - the ill, elderly and financially incapacitated, the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to commission a systematic review of all facilities - with leaflets to be offered to local councils. Perhaps even legislate to encourage Local Councils to commission English depts in colleges (geographical response) to produce a leaflet of :\n\na) What to do \nb) Where to find help\nc) Who's who \nd) Whose responsible financially - 19% said they had needed to sell everything the person owned.\n\nIt could be seen as a good response to  the Shipman Inquiry and is close to many voters hearts.\n\nThe group found that 56% of people either had no idea how much a residential care place cost, or they dramatically underestimated it.",
