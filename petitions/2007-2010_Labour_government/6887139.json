        "background": "U.K. family bonding advocate Monic Joint and we, the undersigned, ask the Prime Minister and the U.K. government to freely and widely provide all new parents/parents-to-be with manuals and a website with the sole purpose of teaching expectant and new parents about healthy parenting practices through methods such as 1)bonding with their babies, 2)positive, confident parenting and 3)methods of positive discipline/alternatives to smacking.  We believe that all new or first time parents can benefit from help in parenting as parenting is not an exact science. We believe that if the U.K. government would provide free access to pre-natal education of positive and confident parenting including positive child discipline methods that all U.K. families would benefit by supporting all parents to raise happy, confident and secure children throughout all of British society.",
