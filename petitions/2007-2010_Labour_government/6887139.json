We believe that all new or first time parents can benefit from help in parenting as parenting is not an exact science. We believe that if the U.K. government would provide free access to pre-natal education of positive and confident parenting including positive child discipline methods that all U.K. families would benefit by supporting all parents to raise happy, confident and secure children throughout all of British society.",
