            "background": "every year britain has had to listen to our goverment tell us more tax will be added to this and that prices of cigarettes, alchohal ,fuel , road tax and thats only the start we paymore tax every year to cover the govermants spending from bailing out banks to funding pointless wars, and for some strange reason the tax is rising quicker than the minimum wage no wonder there is so many people signed onto the doll . i try to work over 40 hours a week to cover the bills whilst if i were a single mum i would be able to claim benefits and never have to work unfortunatly i am not a women and not on the doll , i think the goverment should cut benefits in half and increase the working persons wage give the money to the people who work hard and help pay there taxes that goes toward helping the goverment and the public .Its time the goverment took a stand and instead of saying to people go get a job make a stand cut down on benefits appreciate the working class",
