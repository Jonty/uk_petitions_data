            "background": "Many people oppose positive discrimination; they make the point that applications, for anything, should be considered on individual merit ONLY.  This is a perfectly valid point; or it WOULD be if not for the fact that, for CENTURIES (and probably still to at least a certain extent), white, heterosexual, middle-class, non-disabled men have effectively benefited from a tacit, or non-overt, form of positive discrimination which was so taken-for-granted that few even noticed it.  \n\nPositive discrimination is therefore needed now; to ensure that the majority of people not fitting the above description can have a chance to acquire positions of power where they may decide to appoint people like themselves (as the men who DID/DO fit this description have through the ages).  This will continue to be needed until people of BOTH genders, EVERY ethnicity or sexuality, and ANY type of disability are considered for any suitable position without any form of prejudice.",
