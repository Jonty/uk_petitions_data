        "background": "Why would we possibly put even one police officer at risk by putting their name badge on display.  Why would we even subject one officer to the traumatic experience of having a criminal threaten them, and knowing their name which could at the very least cause them to feel threatened, or the obvious worse possibilities.  Even if it only happens once, believe me it will happen.  It's simply not worth the risk.  And it's a really bad idea, I mean if our politicians are really considering this, I think they should be questioning their own ability to run a country.  Does it matter if they dont have their name on their uniform?  I mean, they have a badge number, and can easily be asked their name.  I've heard the arguments for this, and they're all easily brought down.  Even if a lot, or most, of the police support this idea, at the very least a few will suffer anxiety, stress, and even violence as a result.  Please reconsider.",
