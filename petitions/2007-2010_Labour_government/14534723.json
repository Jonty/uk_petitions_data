            "background": "For those with special needs should be able to have free access into all attractions and places to visit so that it helps them with their budgeting, helps them be more active and they have a more enjoyable life and know that there are places out there for them to enjoy without any fee.\n\nAll the government need to do is see if this would be a possible thing with all the attractions/companies and places we visit and say it is for the benefit of those with special needs. Also to think, the government could also look at those with special needs having a card/pass that entitles them free access.\n\nThis I believe would also help those with special needs living independently manage their money and have more freedom!\n\nIf this could ever be considered as a new rule for those who suffer with special needs, this would be a great thing for those and help them so much with money management.",
