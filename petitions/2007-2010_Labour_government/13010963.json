        "background": "Teignbridge District Council, as part of it's asset selling programme, intends to sell this service along with its building to privateers. This is the oldest working ferry service in the Uk and provides a link between the town of Teignmouth and the village of Shaldon. It is part of the South West Path, used by commuters and Tourists. The fear is that the ferry service will be asset stripped and when abandoned will never function again as the set up costs will be subtantial. Retentian of our ferry, in public hands, is therefore essential.",
