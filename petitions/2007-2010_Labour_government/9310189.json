            "background": "These create unequal opportunities for students and discriminate against poorer student who went to worse schools/colledges. As the institutions are predominately funded by the tax payer there should be equal access for all. The current system allows wealthy parents to buy access to the most empowering and well paid jobs for thier children. As there are no private universities it seems that grades are a replacement for money as a way of achieving access to the best education.",
