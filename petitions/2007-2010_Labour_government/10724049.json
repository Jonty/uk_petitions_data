        "action": "Compel the Train Operating Companies (in particular Southeastern) to stop expanding Driver only Operation outside of the London (Metro) area and ensure that all trains have at least one more (apart from the Driver) safety critical member of staff on each service.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Despite assurances which have no substance, from managers on Southeastern they are determined to try to force through an extension of Driver Only Operated Trains to the Kent Coast.\nThese trains will carry up to 1000 passengers in two separate units through more than 15 miles of Tunnel. On the Train there will only be one trained person responsible for safety of the the train and passengers (The Driver). Statistically they are likely to be one of the main casualties in any derailment or crash and therefore they will be out of action. Leaving no one to ensure the safety of survivors.\nThis is unacceptable and any other industry would not even consider it.\nPlease consider our request and find a way to stop profits being put ahead of the safety of us all including our families who will at some time need to use these services.",
