            "background": "British Waterways is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of our Canal system. Recent funding cuts by the government are putting at risk the canal system, both by forcing maintenance cuts and staff reductions. Restoration projects supported by British Waterways have also been cut. An efficent well maintained and extensive canal network will greatly assist the regeneration of derelict areas, promote the return of cargo carrying to the canals and boost the leisure use of the canals. The more people who will holiday in the UK, the greater the environmental and economic benefit to this country by keeping holiday spending in England not abroad.",
