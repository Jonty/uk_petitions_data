After the government banned the SATs from school, so now it isn't compulsory, my school Waldegrave and many others are going to buy the paper and still give it to their students to to do. THIS IS SO UNFAIR!!!  After the government banning them, the schools are buying them, I dont see anything that has changed apart from the fact that our teachers are marking them and not all the teachers are exactly the fairest people in the world. Nearly every teacher in my school has a favourite, so they are so obviously going to be gentle on the people they like and be harsh on the people they dont like. \n\nSign and you will never get to do the SATs paper, whether the school has bought it or not. Quick, time is running out!",
