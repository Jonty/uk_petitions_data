        "background": "In this time of a supposedly higher level of threat from terrorism and international crime, we are constantly warned of the threats against our country. It seems that the Government's favoured method of combatting these perceived threats appears to be a steady erosion of the civil liberties of the general population.\n\nThe recent announcement that GCHQ wishes permission to eavesdrop on all phone calls, internet activity and emails is yet another nail in the coffin of the free society which such measures are supposedly designed to protect. Apparently the Government has not heard the saying that freedom is like a butterfly - hold it too hard and you will crush it. Or perhaps they simply prefer the maxim of O'Brian from Orwell's 1984 - \"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever\".\n\nStop the current advance towards the police state. Stop the Government spying on the general public.",
