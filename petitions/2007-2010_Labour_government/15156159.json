            "background": "\"In 2003, Unesco \u2013 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation \u2013 adopted a Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, including \"traditional craftsmanship\", which argued that any effort to safeguard traditional craftsmanship should focus not on preserving craft objects, but on \"creating conditions that will encourage artisans to continue to produce crafts of all kinds, and to transmit their skills and knowledge to others\". More than 100 countries signed up. Britain did not.\"\n\nWhy not?\n\nKeep our heritage Crafts alive - support them through the Craft Council, English Heritage or the Department for Culture.\n\nHow many people in this country bear the name Smith? Or Cooper, Turner, Cutler, Wright? It is part of our heritage and it is what made our country what it is today. To lose these crafts and trades would be turning our back on who we are.",
