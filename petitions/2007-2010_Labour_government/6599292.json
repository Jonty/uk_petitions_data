        "background": "At Present there is no obligation for a company to provide time off work for Special Constables to perform their duty.\nMany companies continue to pay their staff who volunteer for the Terretorial Army. We believe Special Constables should be given similiar allowances in regards to the time they commit to their country and not be forced to use Holiday Allowance.\nSpecials provide a valuable service to the country and have the same powers as a regular Police Officer. They could vastly increase Police presents and help enforce Neighbourhood Policing if given the time they deserve",
