We believe Special Constables should be given similiar allowances in regards to the time they commit to their country and not be forced to use Holiday Allowance.\nSpecials provide a valuable service to the country and have the same powers as a regular Police Officer. They could vastly increase Police presents and help enforce Neighbourhood Policing if given the time they deserve",
