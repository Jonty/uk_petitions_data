            "background": "Young workers under the age of 22 in the UK are currently discriminated against on the grounds of age.  They receive less pay per hour for exactly the same work as their co-workers simply based on their age. We believe that:\n\n\u2022\tYoung people pay the same for basic expenses, such as food, utilities and rent, as other workers.\n\n\u2022\tYoung people don\u2019t work more slowly or with any less competence simply because of their age. Ability to do a job comes from experience and training, not from growing older.\n\n\u2022\tAge-related wages can effectively price older workers out of the market.\n\n\u2022\tYoung workers on Modern Apprenticeship schemes often have no minimum wage protection whatsoever.\n\nWe call on the government to abolish the differentials in the National Minimum\nWage and apply the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.",
