            "background": "Block Turkey entering into the EU. \n1) Human rights in Turkey are not up to recognised EU standards and may never be despite any promises. Turkey has reluctantly agreed to end its death penalty in a bid to join the EU, but only in peacetime, and this is a country that has had to be forced to outlaw people smuggling to join the EU, it has had to be forced to outlaw this despicable act, it wouldn\u2019t have outlawed it on its own. Turkey is not part of Europe, it is in the Middle East, and has its borders with Iraq, Iran & Syria, who next to join, Iraq or Iran or Syria or all 3?\n2) The EU club is big enough and not one British citizen (except the PM) has ever been given the vote for this to happen\n3) This will cause an influx of Turkish people to the UK as happened with Poland\n4) The majority of British people do not want the EU any larger or Turkey to join it.\n5) Its about time the PM went with the majority in his own country and not because it makes him look popular in Europe.",
