            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The SHA wants to impose changes very quickly to the current scheme without accurate data or proper consultation.\nThe plan is to deliver patients to either Basildon, Papworth or the Norfolk and Norwich hospitals.  \nThis would mean that patients living in East Suffolk would be at very high risk of long-term heart damage or death because of the planned withdrawal of administering Blood clotbusting drugs by paramedics. \nIt is assumed that patients will reach one of the areas within the recommended time frame to receive Angioplasty.\nDue to the geography, poor road conditions, weather and frequent accidents / repairs to the A12 it is simply not possible to guarantee that patients will reach their goal in time.\nI would urge that a rethink is urgently required before such changes are made.",
