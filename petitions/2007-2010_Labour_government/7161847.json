            "background": "The case reported on AOL today of the Heathrow Airport worker who called herself the \"Lyrical Terrorist\", the first case of a woman convicted under new terrorism legislation, shows how subversive and therefore difficult to understand terrorism as a movement is. \n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to :\n\na) Outline an individual's right to self protection\n\nb) Clarify their citizenship responsibilities in reporting suspicions to the police EG There is an unidentified Imam travelling around my local area - but he too is innocent till proven guilty - what should I do ?\n\nc)Revoke the rights of tenure of those involved in criminal cases and convicted of perjury and sedition. \n\nd) Actually use the new legislation outlined in the Queen's speech given that \"The court heard she visited a website linked to jailed cleric Abu Hamza and stored material about weapons at her family home.\"\n\ne) Liaise more closely with internet providers\n\nf) Whilst not wishing a return to wartime pogroms, clearly outline what living in Britain means - if it continues to be a UK govt policy to recruit from overseas for the public sector. My personal opinion is that this is irresponsible short - termism.",
