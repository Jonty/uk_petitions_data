It is obvious to all that it is a monumental conflict of interest and an abuse of power to prevent disclosure of the information to the people who are themselves unable to access tax-free allowances to the same extent, despite that they have to bear the cost of providing them to some 650 people who would rather not divulge how they are using the money.",
