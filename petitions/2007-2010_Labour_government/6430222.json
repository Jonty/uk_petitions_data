        "background": "Why should the public, particularly those who do not follow Christianity at all, have to pay for chaplains to be available to prisoners and hospital patients? Surely it cannot be right, when there are millions of taxpayers who have no interest in religion or at least the Christian faith but still have to pay for others to have the services of a chaplain. Let the individual boards of directors or those who want chaplains at hospitals and prisons pay for them theirselves, not the public.",
