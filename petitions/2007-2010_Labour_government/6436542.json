        "background": "The current format of the 'Sellers Pack' is unfair and unmanageable. Providing an Energy Report certainly seems sensible and indeed necessary to improve energy efficiency. The legal information currently required is not only unecessary but it also discriminates against those who are selling leasehold properties who in the most part are first time sellers. It discriminates in the sense that it will cost them more and take longer to gather the information required. Also it seems unreasonable to ask a seller to provide searches when we cannot get agreement from purchasers mortgage lenders as to whether they will accept searches provided by the seller.\nWhat has been proposed as a method of improving the sale process is obviously seriously flawed and is creating more problems than it is solving.",
