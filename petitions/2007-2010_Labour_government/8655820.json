        "background": "Current press attention focuses on cheap alcohol and the temptation it provides. Surely the real scandal here is how much pubs are allowed to charge for NON - alcoholic drinks.I have paid \u00a34 for soda water - the same price as a large glass of wine. The mark-up on my drink must have been astronomical. 'Free market' prinicples do not work - plenty of people who do not wish to drink alcohol all night go to pubs. They are usually with a group of friends (eg as designated driver) but can hardly ask the rest of the group to leave so they can shop around to find soft drinks at a fair price. What message does this send out in 'binge Britain'? It is grossly unfair yet very simply remedied. Those interested in this idea should be aware that there is also a petition to subsidise low alcohol beer which I have also signed and encourage you to do the same.",
