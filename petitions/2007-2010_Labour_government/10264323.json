        "action": "examine the fuel costs of hospital visiting in efforts to manage the credit crunch, the govt. would do well to agree about some concessionary policy for public transport. Prioritising fuel - for the emergency services, fire, police and ambulances has always been essential - and it is often the bravest in society who are hospitalised, often traumatically. Please consider their relatives too.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "However, the petitioner is urging the P.M. to consider involvement of rail and public transport services to co - ordinate between districts and hospitals for the general public. One of the main gaps in services is out of hours, around A & E depts. and in emergencies.\n\nCan the P.M. please reassure me that A & E depts. have a policy on how best to help relatives, who sometimes might not know the area and be poorly orientated. Clear sign - posting is one of the successes of the modernised NHS - but more needs to be done institutionally and by state depts rather than chaotic ad hoc free for all management - which appears to be simply every man for himself !\n\nWhilst working as a nurse, I feel very sorry especially for young mums who are obviously trying to juggle the demands of all family members, young and old, in and out of hospital. Please help.",
