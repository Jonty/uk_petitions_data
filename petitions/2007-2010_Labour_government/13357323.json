This products have been an integral part of British life for century's. So they should be protected by the goverment by way of been given tax breaks. \n\nThese incentives should be exclusive to real cider, beer and ale, not mass produced products. This would help the producers reduce there prices to stay competitive in the market: E.g. One 500ml Bottle of Westons Vintage (a real cider)costs between \u00a31.67 and \u00a32.05 however you can buy a mass produced cider for \u00a31.99 for four 440ml cans.\n\nThis is a British tradtion that needs help to stay alive!",
