            "background": "I think considering the climate change issues, that we desperately need to address this problem sooner rather than later. If instead of making plastic bags we should be making paper bags that are as strong as the bags cat litter comes in. they are reusable and they biodegrade also, we can sustain them by planting more trees. As for the plastic packaging our foodstuffs come in, we neither want them or need them. If only more people were to buy fresh food instead of all this prepacked rubbish (which is not good for us anyway) there would be no need for all the plastic rubbish we generate. As it is we have no alternative for some of the food we have to buy.",
