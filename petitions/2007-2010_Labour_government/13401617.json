            "background": "Pc Fletcher was shot dead outside the Libyan embassy in 1984. The bullet was fired from inside the building but her killer was never identified and was thought to have been smuggled back to Libya. British police officers have been secretly training members of Libya's force despite the country's refusal to hand over the killer of Pc Yvonne Fletcher.\n\nIt is understood that Pc Fletcher's own force, the Metropolitan Police, was among those thought to have sent officers to Libya, along with at least one officer from Northern Ireland, where dozens of civilians were killed by IRA bombs made with Libyan-supplied Semtex. \n\nThe Prime Minister should do the right thing and adhere to the ethics that we as a naition hold close to our hearts.",
