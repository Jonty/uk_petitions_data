        "background": "In my experience of trying to give feedback to government departments and to NHS Trusts I usually get nowhere.  It usually takes a long time to get a response and then this respoinse is usually woefully inadequate.  Resistence is high.  Customer satisfcation is low.  And much time is wasted both by complainants (feedback providers) and complaint handlers.  I think that complaint handlers tend to fob customers off because they feel powerless to respond in more constructive ways.  Therefore, complaint handlers need to be empowered within their departments to make a difference for the organisation and for customers.  I see a great need for empathy and empowerment training.  Maybe all that is required is a much greater emphasis on delivering ever higher levels of customer satisfaction.",
