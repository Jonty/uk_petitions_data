            "background": "This year's student loan interest rate is 0% for post 1998 student loans despite the fact that it should have been -0.4% within the terms and conditions.  It appears unlikely that this decision will be reversed, so instead we are suggesting that the negative interest that would have occured this year should be deducted from future interest that is applied to the student loan i.e. if the interest rate for next year is due to be 1.6%, then the rate should instead effectively be less than 1.2%.",
