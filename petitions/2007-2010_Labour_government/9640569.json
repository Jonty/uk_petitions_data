It's a shame that such a great contest is all about political back scratching, rather than the music, clearly evidenced by this and other years voting patterns. \n\nIt's time to stop this nonsence and pull out and stop our public contributions to this event.  The contest just shows how far removed the UK is from Europe.  The public money spent on Eurovision would far better be spent on more worthwhile causes for example cleaning up our hospital wards.",
