        "background": "These days, you can't walk down the street without seeing a \"larger\" person. It's about time that those of us who are a healthy weight shouldn't have our taxes spent on diabetes treatment or heart bypasses for fatties.\nAlso, why should we pay for all the extra fuel they use on air planes or public transport. Then there's the amount of food they actually consume, the extra cows needed, farting and contributing to global warming (applies to both the cows and the fatties).\nIn addition to costing us all money and destroying the environment, fat people are also an eyesore. So in summary, pretty much all of the worlds problems could be solved by swift and decisive action to rid the world of these people. We could even convert them into biofuel, correcting some of their wrongs.",
