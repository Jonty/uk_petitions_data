            "background": "Over the past few months I have signed numerous petitions opposing the closure of wards/units/hospitals, and every time the Government response is that it is a decision made locally.\nSurely local trusts are being forced to make such decisions in order to comply with Government policy (ie. \"client choice\" and introduction of the private sector), and in order to balance the books as a result of Government funding. The ultimate responsibility for these closures, which directly impact upon client care lies with the Government, and I am asking the Government to accept some of that responsibility.",
