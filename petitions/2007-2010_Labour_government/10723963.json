            "background": "The government promised in 2006 review its policy on free prescriptions and have not done so.  Now many cancer patients are choosing between light, heating and fuel before paying for medication.  It is all very well saying that they can get a PrePayment Certificate at the cost of \u00a3102.50 but this has to be paid in one lump sum or by Direct Debit.  When Cancer hits a patient loses their job and this in turn means they are hit hard financially and means they also lose their bank account.  They are therefore making the choices above and its not fair and its not right.  Cancer is a terrible illness and causes real financial hardship.  Please please change the prescription charge to help those who really need free prescriptions and at present are not able to get them",
