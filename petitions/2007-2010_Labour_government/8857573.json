When this feature is at an end of an estate that has no passing traffic, set up in a way that the landowner can not enjoy the visual amenity (but has the financial and physical upkeep of the area) or the majority of properties in close proximity of the feature are not being heard when the landowner wishes to make beneficial changes to the layout, the feature should be included in the owners  herediment and be governed by normal planning regulations. Also the local planning authorities should consider the views and feelings of the majority of people affected.",
