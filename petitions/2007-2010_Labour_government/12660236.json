        "background": "I petition Gordon Brown to hold a snap general election as has been requested by David Cameron and others on numerous occassions. \n\nThe government, who is empowered and has been put in place by us, the people, has an obligation to listen to what the people want. \n\nWe want our voices heard again and not simply to be told \"we are listening\" with no action. \n\nThe economy is in its worst state in living memory, no more boom and bust we were promised. \n\nHouse prices have collapsed and dragged millions of people into poverty.\n\nUnemployment is set to reach over 3 million by the end of this year.\n\nTaxes are due to rise astronomically to repay the unprecedented levels of Government borrowing. Our children will be paying off this governments mistakes.   \n\nGordon Brown, do the right thing and allow the people of this great nation their voice, which you have repeatedly silenced or ignored.\n\nWe want our vote!",
