            "background": "When the current government came in to power it was with the mantra of 'education, education, education'.\n\nTo create a truly modern economy, an information economy, the state needs to provide access to higher education for all. \n\nWith ever increasing university fees, and an economy in decline, this vision for our future is slipping away. Investment in education is a sure fire solution to secure the future of this country.\n\nThe Open University system of distance learning is primed to enable this dream to come true.  \n\nFully funding all courses will enable the people of this country access to higher education and the knowledge needed to turn the economy around and take us all to a brighter future.",
