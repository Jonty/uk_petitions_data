Most of us have hordes of coins which when times are bad take to one of those machines in found in supermarkets in exchange for a voucher which can be redeemed for cash.  Well times are hard for this country so lets pull together our resources and make our change work for the good of us all!  I think this country could be sitting on a gold(copper) mine!",
