            "background": "When a formal job position becomes available, the employer offering the job should advertise it somewhere in the public domain e.g. a newspaper or jobs website.\n\nIt is grossly unfair how so often nowadays people only get jobs depending on who they know, and so many skilled applicants who would make excellent candidates are left out because these jobs go completely unadvertised and are only offered to current employees of a company.\n\nThere should be a law forbidding employers from hiding job vacancies from the majority of people and only offering them to friends or current employees.\n\nEVERYONE should have the right to apply for a job. Of course current employees also deserve the right to apply, but anyone else should be able to apply too, regardless of where they work or who their friends are.\n\nAlternatively (or as an extra), whenever a job position is filled, the employer should by law have to declare everywhere (s)he advertised the job, and the employee should have to declare where (s)he found the vacancy, to ensure that no unadvertised job offers occur.",
