            "background": "Asset-freezing orders imposed by the Treasury under United Nations anti-terror laws are legally flawed because Parliament was \"bypassed\", the High Court has ruled.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to fill in these gaps - I know you'll act in the interests of public safety - \nbut criticisms of \"Britain's financial Guantanamo\" in the press are hardly reassuring in an unstable age.\n\nPlease be strong, on suspected criminals whose millions have been made from terror and who then use these funds for fraudulent practices. Although people are presumed innocent until proven guilty, of course, please ensure consistencies are addressed (further to my earlier petition asking for changes in plea - bargaining at US recommendation).",
