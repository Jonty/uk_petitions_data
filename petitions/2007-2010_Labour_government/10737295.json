It is already not being used in the promised way. The people of Manchester were told after the Commonwealth Games that the Stadium would be rented by Manchester City Football Club and that other events for the whole of Manchester would be staged at the ground.\n\nThis never happens and we feel let down by Manchester Council that their promises have not been fulfilled.\n\nIn light of the recent takeover of Manchester City Football Club, the council can not be allowed to sell off the stadium and the surrounding land to a foreign investment group.",
