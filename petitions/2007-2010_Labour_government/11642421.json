            "background": "Turner Syndrome involves the life long need for prescription medication . It is not currently listed as a reason for exemption for prescription charges . All other conditions involving the replacement of a hormone if a gland is not producing it are listed such as hypothyroidism and diabetes . Turner syndrome can cause other medical problems which also require prescription drugs . Turner Syndrome is now more widely researched and diagnosed and I feel it should also be recognised by the government to qualify for prescriiption charge exemption",
