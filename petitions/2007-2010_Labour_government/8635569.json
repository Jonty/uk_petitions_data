        "background": "We're lucky to have just such a converted disused railway track near by (the old Bath to Bristol coal track- thank you Sustrans) and it would be marvellous if all over the country these level and often scenic routes could be re-opened for cyclists and walkers. \n\nIt would tempt more people to commute by bike; it is safe; allows wheelchairs and buggies and would thus be great for leisure use where the track goes through the countryside. \n\nIf the government is concerned about levels of obesity and carbon emission then this is one relatively easy way forward. And it would provide employment.",
