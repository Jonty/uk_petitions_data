            "background": "I would like to see the current rate of fuel duty on diesel reduced by at least 25% for commercial vehicle operators, to include both lorry and bus operators holding operators licences. This can only enhance economic growth, through lower transportation costs.And also reduce the cost of public transport by lowering passenger fares, which will increase the ammount of passengers using public transport, and in turn reduce road congestion and total vehicle emissions.",
