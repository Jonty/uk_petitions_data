            "background": "Sherlock Holmes is one of Britain's best known fictional characters, internationally recognisable and loved by many. This cultural icon is currently at risk of being ruined by an idiot. The idiot I speak of is Guy Ritchie, creator of a myriad of mockney guff such as 'Snatch' and 'Rock 'n' Rolla'. One can only imagine what Guy Ritchie will do to Sherlock Holmes. The only thing we can be certain of is that it will be packed full of mockney caricatures and leave you feeling culturally violated.  \nI concede it is not possible to ban Guy Ritchie from realising his hideous vision of making a film of Sherlock Holmes but it may be possible to stop him doing it in Britain. There must be a law on the statute book that can be used.",
