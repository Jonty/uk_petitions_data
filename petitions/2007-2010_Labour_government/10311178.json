            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recent plans for the application of a voluntary curfew in Redruth is jeapordising the rights of children and young adults in the area. The current 9PM curfew for under 16s, besides being a breach of basic rights, will inevitably increase tensions between the adult general community and their younger citizens. The act is alienating potential future members of the political community and generalises the youth of Britain in such a way that would rightly be seen as horrendous were it to be targetting an ethnic or religious minority. The act is a huge backward leap with regards to children's rights and needs to be countered as soon as possible.",
