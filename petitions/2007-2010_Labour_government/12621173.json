It cannot be, therefore, that food purchased from a supermarket and delivered (or taken by an MP) to his first or second home, can be for use in entertaining political or government business colleagues in  a restaurant in the area of the House of Commons.  This is fraud and MPs who have claimed reimbursement for food for other than when eating in a restaurant are fraudsters.",
