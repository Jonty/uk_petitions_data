            "background": "Recent history has shown that when members of Parliament are made the Home Secretary they immediately swing wildly towards the most illiberal and offensive opinions and policies, whether it's David Blunkett 'celebrating' Harold Shipman's death, Charles Clarke on ID Cards or Jacqui Smith suggesting gay asylum seekers can be sent to homophobic countries if they are 'discreet'. This, combined with the continuing meddling with the police to attempt to be seen as 'tough on crime', shows that such matters should be removed from the hands of poll-chasing politicians.",
