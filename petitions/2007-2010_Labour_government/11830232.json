            "background": "As MD of the London estate agents John D Wood & Co. I have been selling property for over 30 years, experiencing two significant recessions during that time.  Property transactions have fallen from circa 1.3m in 2007 to circa 600,000 in 2008, and the forecast for this year is no better.  The revenue generated from Stamp Duty has therefore decreased dramatically and for the foreseeable future will not be reversed.\n\nWith this in mind I believe action should be taken to re-energise the housing market; encourage the free movement of labour by giving home owners the confidence to move and boost all the trades associated with moving house such as solicitors, surveyors, builders, decorators, etc. where revenue is generated by VAT.  A very simple way of doing this would be the suspension of Stamp Duty until better times, say 2012.  Please add your name to my petition to raise greater awareness of this harmful tax and urge the Government to suspend it as part of their plans for economic rescue.",
