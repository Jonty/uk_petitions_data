            "background": "We need to set a target that delivers the reduction in UK climate-changing gases that is needed \u2013 the science tells us the target should be at least 80%, not the 60% the government proposes, which is based on out of date science.                           The apparent findings of scientists working for the International Maritime Organisation, the UN agency that regulates the shipping industry, show that shipping creates three times more climate damage than was previously thought. Until now, estimates of shipping emissions had not fully accounted for the complexity of the industry.\n\n\"Now that we know the true extent of shipping emissions, it is even more important for the government to include these in the climate change legislation currently before Parliament,\" said Peter Lockley, Head of Transport Policy at WWF-UK. \"As with aviation, including the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases is essential if we are to have credible carbon reduction targets.\"",
