        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "When basic bank accounts first launched there was a significant gap in the facilities offered by the basic account compared to the so called \"full\" accounts. The main differences being basic accounts offered no debit card or a cut down debit card and no overdraft or cheque book\n\nThese days however, banks are now offering full debit cards (visa debit or maestro) and overdrafts and chequebooks on a full account are still assessed on an individual basis anyway. As such there is little difference between a basic account and a full account with no overdraft other than the stigma that can be attached with only holding a basic account.\n\nWe ask the prime minister to use the governments shareholding in certain banks to push them into scrapping the basic account and make them offer full accounts to all with facilities tailored to a individuals personal circumstances",
