            "background": "Every Bank and building society is allowed to set its own charges and fees. If there was one \"right across the board\" pricing structure, every person would be able to know and understand, what fees they are paying.\nQuite often the language that is used in the \"terms and conditions\" issued by banks is hard to read and understand. The eldery often get confused because of this. One pricing structure for all will alleviate confusion and make this simple and easy to understand. It will also stop banks  / building societies from setting rip off fees and charges.",
