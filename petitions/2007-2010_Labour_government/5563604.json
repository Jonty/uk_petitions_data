        "background": "After 50 years of poor maintenance the Civic Centre in Plymouth is up to be Grade 2 listed. Problem is the poor maintenance means it needs some money spent. But its probably better to refurb it than destroy it and replace it with a bar, a shop and a drop in centre for druggies. I propose we save it and that the nice new Prime Minister finds some funds to help.",
