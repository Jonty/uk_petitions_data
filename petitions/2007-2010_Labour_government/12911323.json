            "background": "Through UNITY is an extended family of families, backed by a coalition of supporters determined to 'stop talking and start walking' over knife, gun, gang and youth violence. As community leaders we seek to build that village which brings up a child in safety and love. We champion corporate and personal responsibilty. We challenge everyone to work in their own communities to bring mentors, out of school activities, youth clubs, training, jobs and most of all hope for all young people to feel valued and useful members of society. They ask that others are not terribly hurt as they have been by the loss of a murdered loved one and seek justice and safe guarding against those determined to cause violence. It recognises that not all young people are feral youth. It leads in inter-generational engagement and works with and supports our police.",
