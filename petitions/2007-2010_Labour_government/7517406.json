        "background": "The actions of the Home Secretary, The Right \"honourable\" Jacqui Smith MP in effectively reducing the agreed police pay rise from 2.5% to one of 1.9% not only treats our officers differently to those in Scotland (which in itself is indefensible),but it sends out the completely wrong message to all the officers who daily put their lives at risk for the protection of us all. Do not treat them with contempt. Give them the respect that they deserve. This petition demands that the Prime Minister takes urgent action to resolve this dreadful situation. (And no, I'm not a police officer).",
