            "background": "Pet Passport scheme should not be country specific but testing facility approved.  \n\nIf your pet lives outside one of the listed countries (i.e a Caribbean Island) then you should be able to have the chip and blood test carried out by an authorised Vet using a listed country testing laboratory.\n\nFor example.  I live in the Dominican Republic and wish to return to the UK within the next year but my 2 dogs will need to go into quarantine because the Dominican Republic is not a LISTED country.\n\nWe have a US Vet and can have our dogs microchipped and rabies vacinated with blood test done in Miami, which is in a LISTED country.\n\nGerman PET Passport scheme holders are allowed to do this so if we are part of the EU, why can't we?",
