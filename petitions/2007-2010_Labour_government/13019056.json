            "background": "Due to the costs involved in the recyling process, goods made from or with recyled materials are often more expensive than those made from new.  To boost demand for recyled goods, and to stimulate the green economy, some sort of subsidy needs to be applied in order to make recyled goods more competitive. Abolishing VAT would be simple and effective.",
