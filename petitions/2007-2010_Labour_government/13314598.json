            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Disability Living Allowance is crucial to all who receive it in it's current form (including people with Autism). They can choose what to spend the money on, whether it be for example, educational toys (for a child), speech & language or wheelchair facilities & much much more to improve their way of living. Many people & their families rely on DLA for their everyday lives and to abolish it & integrate it into social care funding would be catastrophic and disastrous to the disabled person themselves & their families. Some families have problems accessing the local authority support already & so they would come across similar problems with the money they would have received by DLA which would then be at the discretion of the Local Authority. Disabled people would definitely miss out on many opportunites with the local decision-making and they would be basically not have a greater quality of life which they would have if the DLA remains in its current form.",
