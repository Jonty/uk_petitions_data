            "background": "There is currently no ombudsman for private tenants when they have a grevance with their landlord. Private tenants have to pay through the nose for housing services and when things go wrong there are some landlords that wont put things right. If landlords chose not to fix things when they are broken, the only re-course a private tenant has is through small claims court which is expensive, timely and uneccassary. When you pay for a service, you expect to get it; when you dont you dont pay, but with private tenacy agreemants you continue to pay full price even when the heatings is broke for two weeks otherwise you will be evicted and given a bad tenacy reference. The current laws covering landlords are not enough and do not settle disputes between landlords and tenants quickly. I propose a ombudsman that makes it compulsary for all landlords to join and to comply to a set of standards they must abide by. This also where tenants can voice compliants and can be dealt with quickly and efficently. The ombudsman would rule whether a landlord has acted correctly and compensate tenants accordingly where they are paying rent and not getting full services they are paying for.",
