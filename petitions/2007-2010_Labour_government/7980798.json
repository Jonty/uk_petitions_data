            "background": "With the continual stream of departmental mistakes and errors putting ever-greater risk on members of the public and their privacy/identity/safety, along with a severe lack of accountability for serious errors, we need to make any government and the departments thereof more accountable and answerable for their actions. We are therefore calling for and introduction of legislation that will establish accountability and effective legal or compensatory recourse for members of the public in either a class action or individual case. Government departments should not be immune to the consequences of the actions they take or fail to take.",
