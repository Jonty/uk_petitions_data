            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The EU are introducing legislation on the 16th July governing operating procedures and equipment on passenger carrying aircraft.  Due to a lack of thought this will cause all historic aircraft to be prevented from carrying passengers as the requirements of the legislation cannot be met on these old aircraft.  For example; it will require escape slides to be fitted on an aircraft that has a door only 4 feet from the ground; fit oxygen masks on an aircraft that is un-pressurised and never flies high enough to require them.  These aircraft have many years of safe flying left in them, which would provide hours of enjoyment to so many people and maintain a link with our historic aviation achievements during WW2 and beyond.",
