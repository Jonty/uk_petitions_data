        "background": "The petition asks the Prime Minister to change the law around which electric cars are categorised in the UK. Categorisation must not be based alone on  technical details such as a car's engine size and weight (light versus standard electric car) but public safety. Regardless of their many non-polluting benefits, electric vehicles are indisputably used on the public highway which the drivers have to share with  vehicles much heavier than theirs. It is therefore essential as far as public safety is concerned that such vehicles adhere to the same road worthiness and safety laws as heavier vehicles to ensure that their body frame is strong enough to protect their occupants in the event of an accident.",
