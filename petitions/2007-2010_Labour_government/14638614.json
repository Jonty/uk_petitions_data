Far greater and more deserving people then ex prime ministers wives exist in this country.\n\nNo member of parliament or elected official will be honoured in any way if they have been asked to repay any expenses irrespective of whether they have done so.  To give such people honours would appear to be rewarding either dishonesty or, in the case of a genuine mistake, rewarding negligence.  I do not believe that the British people would want to see either.\n\nAnd finally, that any resignation honours will be apolitical and used to honour people who have served the public selflessly, charitably and in a non political way.",
