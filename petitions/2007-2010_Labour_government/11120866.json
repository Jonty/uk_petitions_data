            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Government should force Large Supermarkets to reduce the cost of all those items which incurred a price increase due to what they claimed was the price of fuel. eg milk, small companies manage to sell 4 pints for \u00a31 permanently!!!!!!!! We also saw many other store cupboard items increase by 40p per item i.e mayonaise, tinned food, cereals etc although we have seen the price of fuel decrease recently these items have not. Supermarkets are boasting huge profits at the moment a clear indication of the \"great british rip off\". 8 months ago I could do a weekly shop for about \u00a31 average per item now its \u00a31.50 thats 50% although inflation is less than 5%. Its about time this \"rip off\" was culled once and for all, no one item should be allowed to increase in price by more than 10p once a year. We dont want cupboards full of BOGOFs and cheap economy labels, we want quality reasonably priced all year round.",
