            "background": "The winter fuel allowance is given to all those over sixty regardless of their capital or income. This is creating an anomaly for those in receipt of Disability Living Allowance many of whom spend much of the time at home some with arthritic conditions effected by cold weather. We would urge the PM to examine this issue and consider extending the fuel payment to all those receiving DLA. The funding could be found by limiting the allowance to those over 60 in receipt of pension credit or applying the Council Tax Rebate rules regarding capital and income.",
