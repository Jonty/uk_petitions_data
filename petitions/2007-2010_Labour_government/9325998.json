        "background": "Steve McClaren failed in his job and let the country down when the England football team in his charge failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 tournament\n\nAs a result of that, not only do the country's football followers not have their team to support this summer, but many companies' profits have been hit and jobs lost as a direct result\n\nIt is staggering that the BBC have now seen fit to employ him as an expert summariser for the tournament - this shows no regard for the feelings of the licence-fee payers who will ultimately be rewarding him for failure, bearing in mind also that he has already received a substantial pay-off from the FA\n\nWe ask the PM to intervene and ask the BBC to revoke the contract offer",
