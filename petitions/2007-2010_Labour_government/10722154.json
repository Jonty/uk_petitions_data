Yet many supermarkets\nrefuse to serve over 21's if they can't provide proof of age ID (which\ncosts money to acquire).\n\nTo ask someone in the 30's or 40's for proof of age ID when they are\nnot carrying any is a humiliating and frustrating experience.\n\nThe Government should do more to stop the middle aged being forced to\ncarry proof of age ID if they happen to decide, perhaps on the off\nchance or whim, to do some shopping which includes products restricted\nto the over 18's.",
