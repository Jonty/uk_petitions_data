            "background": "The current car driving test asks you to perform a set of manouvers in a way that if you fail one you do not pass your test. For example hitting a curb reversing around a corner. This does not mean you cannot drive but that you have failed to perform a 'trick'. You should at least have 3 opportunities to do each manouver before accruing a 'major' fault. Also night driving, wet weather driving, skid control and motorway type driving should be included in lessons. Also your lessons / training should form part of your test as course work does at school so that 'skid training' could be passed by instructors before the test.\nThis would train new drivers to 'drive' rather than pass a set of 'tricks'",
