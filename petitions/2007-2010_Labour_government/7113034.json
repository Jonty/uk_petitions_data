            "background": "There are many benefits of having a national DNA database such as direct crime resolution and indirect resolution i.e. deduction by elimination, identification in case of accident etc.  The creation of this kind of database is opposed by those who feel a compulsory database infringes the rights of the individual subsequently depriving us of a potentially highly valuable source of information and crime fighting tool.  I propose the creation of a voluntary DNA database where those over 16, who wish to contribute their DNA to the database, should be able to do so whilst respecting the rights and wishes of those who choose not to.",
