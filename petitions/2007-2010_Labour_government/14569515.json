        "background": "We the undersigned request: \nthe end of British sponsored government and interference and the dismantling of corrupt British institutions i.e. CSA-Community Charge, UK Tax Office, VAT and car licencing laws, driving and points systems on the basis that many of these bodies are corrupt, unjust and incoherent, and a rod for the people.\nThe cessation of political gerrymandering, the complete withdrawal of British political parties (Labour LibDem Cons, BNP and so on)  and bribery of political leaders to keep a small elite in power, who have very quickly shown how corrupt they can be,  as in the outrageous case of the wife of the first minister, who has bought shame upon the state of the province of Ulster. The people of Ulster deserve much better.  Note: this is not a petition to dismantle any institutions that are part of the traditions of the province. Simply-NO MORE CORRUPTION.",
