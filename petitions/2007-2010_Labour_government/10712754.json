            "background": "As matters stand, the Government has legislated that it will be illegal after 31st December 2008  for a home owner (or their estate agent) to begin advertising, erect a For Sale board, prepare flyers - indeed undertake any form of marketing until a Home Information Pack (HIP) is prepared and returned to the seller or agent. Existing experience of HIP delivery times has already established that a 10 day delay  in production is not unusual. Owners or agents can be fined  \u00a3200 a day by Trading Standards Officers should they begin marketing before their HIP arrives. We call upon the government to continue to permit intending house sellers to be allowed to put their homes on the market on the day they choose to and not to have to wait for their HIP to be delivered first.",
