            "background": "The British government's refusal to recognise the genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire against the ethnic Armenians is utterly shameful. What message are we sending to the rest of the world when we favour political expediency over doing the right thing? With every passing year, more and more countries are recognising the horrifying events that occurred in Anatolia as \u2018genocide\u2019. What is more, historians are in agreement that what happened does indeed constitute genocide as delineated in the United Nation\u2019s Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n\n(Ps we recognise that this is a sensitive topic in the nationalistic Turkish Republic; however, there is no logical reason for contemporary Turkish people to deny history. After all, they are not responsible for what happened \u2013 they had nothing to do with the slaughter of 1.5 million people. Similarly, modern Germans are not responsible for the slaughter of Jews, gays and et cetera during the Second World War.)",
