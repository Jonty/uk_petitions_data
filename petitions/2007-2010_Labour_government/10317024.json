The Tibetan people have benefited enormously since their liberation from virtual serfdom under the autocratic subjugation of the minority ruling elite headed by the Dalai Lama. We call on the British Government to persuade the Dalai Lama to relinquish any claim to authority in Tibet & ask him to call for an end to violent protests.",
