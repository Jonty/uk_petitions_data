            "background": "The publication of the expenses of Members of Parliament at Westminster has exposed a culture of greed and self interest of many elected representatives. I just have a hunch that the Euro gravy train makes Westminster look like small beer when compared to the Euro parliament excesses. As tax payers we should hold these representatives (often elected by minority because of low turn outs) to account. Sign this petition and pass it on - send it to the media and try to circulate it where possible.",
