            "background": "The UK's roads have become full of drivers who have either forgotten, or do not know, the rules of the road they were supposed to know to pass their test. \nAlthough most people witness this daily, it remains only an occupational hazard \u2013 that is until you, or a member of your family, are the innocent victim of their incompetence in the culmination as an accident.\nThe deaths and/or resulting serious injuries, with resulting disablements, irreversibly change the lives of individual citizens and entire families.\nHealth and safety law requires people in industry, who operate far less dangerous equipment, to have refresher courses over a period of months/years.  A health and safety tribunal would not accept a defense such as, \u201cthey were ok when we checked them for 35 minutes, 30 years ago\u201d.  Why should motoring be any different?\nA re-test every 10 years from gaining the license would make our roads safer.  The proposal has no prejudice.  Insurance could be lower as accidents become fewer.",
