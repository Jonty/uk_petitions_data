            "background": "A Bronze Age sauna and one of the oldest prehistoric roundhouses in the UK have been unearthed on a Taunton site earmarked for a park-and-ride scheme.\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered 3,000 years of history at the site near the junction of the A358 and the M5 at Cambria Farm.\n\nThe Iron Age roundhouse with a diameter of 56ft (17m) is one of the largest prehistoric roundhouses ever found in Britain.\n\nIt is thought to date from around 700BC and has been uncovered alongside three other roundhouses.\n\nA mound of burned stones indicating a 2,500-year-old sauna has also been discovered as well as the remains of a Roman farm.\n\nA number of skeletons, all but one Roman, have also been unearthed after archaeologists spent more than three months on site.\n\nTo cover this in tarmac is absurd and we need to preserve these old monuments to our past, not wipe them out so future generations cannot associate with their past.\n\nSave the Sauna Now!!",
