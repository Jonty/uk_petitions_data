            "background": "We should increase the minimun wage and create a maximum wage of something like \u00a3150,000 a year plus bonus's. This would prevent people earning obscene amounts of money e.g. \u00a3100,000 a week and would help bring people out of poverty. We should stop this cycle of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, this would happen if we increase wages for the poor and capped them for the rich.",
