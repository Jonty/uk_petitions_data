            "background": "Please Prime Minister recognise it is a pointless waste of taxpayers money to detain these individuals.  The heavy handed police approach (e.g. arresting Anne Darwin by the use of a team of armed police) is a bizarre waste of resources for a alledged insurance scam.  These people are not a danger to the public and are in fact more entertainment value.  Prison space is precious and would be better used for those who are a danger to society.  Please intervene in this case and allow them out for the new year with their family.",
