            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The CITB has reduced grant payments to construction companies due to the recession.  They however, have no sympathy for the construction industry which is on it's knees.  They still threaten legal action for overdue levy payments, which they demand in full without reductions.  The levy is calculated on expenditure, so if a company breaks even, how are they to find this levy payment?  The citb now has the audacity to plead poverty and reduce grant payments.  Their letter expects the construction industry to understand their thinking behind this.  Why can they not show the same understanding when collecting the levy from a struggling industry?  Spreading payments is not enough, reduce the levy or give companies the choice to opt out.  Most companies have no workers to train at the moment anyway.",
