            "background": "It may have taken a while but sanctions worked in South Africa eventually, so we the undersigned support the UK policy of a \"push for further sanctions against Iran...through the United Nations to achieve this. We do not support the nuclear ambitions of that country.'' Quite right - the world is still paying the price of 1919 and 1939 - almost a century later. Any nuclear capacity within this region would further destabilise. Iran is pleading to the international community that it is a peacful nation - but action speaks louder than words ! Let not any more British soldiers die in vain - as the EU's foreign representative Javier Solana is scheduled to begin talks with Iran's new chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, in Rome. There will always be conflicts worldwide - and GB will continue to have a statutory duty to the UN peace - keeping force. Get them to sign an ICC treaty, Gordon, then you can legally take international action - UK might is much more than military and the pen is often stronger than the sword, albeit not for Chamberlain.",
