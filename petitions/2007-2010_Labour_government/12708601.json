        "action": "protect the conservation area of Barford and Wramplingham in Norfolk from a proposed 30 acre sub-station.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As part of phase 2 of the Kyoto agreement, Dudgeon Offshore Windfarm will be created 32kms offshore from Cromer powering 240,000 homes.  This power will be cabled underground inland where it is proposed that a large 30 acre substation be built to store this energy.  The location of the substation is being decided but is likely to be in Wramplingham or Barford.  An alternative is to extend Norwich's main substation at Mangreen from 8 to 16 acres.  Award of consents are aimed for by April 2010.  \n\nThe Barford and Wramplingham sites are in the Tiffey valley, a river corridor and an area of outstanding beauty.  This is a conservation area comprising of important wildlife and biodiversity.  There are two Country Wildlife Sites, established trees and hedgerows, archaeological remains and hundreds of dwellings many of which are ancient and listed.\n\nThe proposed industrial site would be a visually dominant concrete-based facility which will devastate the landscape and community, both culturally and financially.",
