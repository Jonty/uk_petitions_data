If it believed that we would not be in control of our own vehicle whilst smoking, then maybe children should be banned from travelling in our cars, as I can honestly say that I have been more distracted whilst driving since having a baby, than I ever have been smoking in my own car!  This is totally against our human rights.  I'm furious.",
