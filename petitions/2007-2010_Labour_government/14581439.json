            "background": "I believe people with Type 1 Diabetes should be entitled to free dental care. The reason for this is as part of their condition they regulary have to take glucose tablets and other sugary foods, which then over time damages their teeth. They need to visit the dentist more frequently and have more treatment. Which even on the NHS becomes more expensive. Diabetics have to take Sugar not through choice, but through needing a steady blood sugar.",
