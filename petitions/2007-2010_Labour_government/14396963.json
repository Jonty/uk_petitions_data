Those on community service should be sweeping streets, picking up litter, cleaning graffiti etc.  We should take a look at the Australians - they are proud to be Aussies and do not bow to policitcal correctness - which is how we should all feel.  If others do not like our  ways and beliefs and rules - go elsewhere!",
