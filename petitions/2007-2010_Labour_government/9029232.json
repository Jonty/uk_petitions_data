            "background": "As a taxpayer paying insurance through my wages(PAYE) I would like to pay this money into a private scheme where my health is protected. At the moment, paying through my wages, i find the only people who have a full entitlement of healthcare and are able to access it are people on benefits. Its ironic that the working population are struggling to meet the costs of dentists, opticians etc ,but because of the amounts we pay in insurance (PAYE), the lowest paid are elligible but not the people who have made this possible .Therefore this is to petition the Prime Minister to allow people to opt out of insurance paid through wages (PAYE) and be able to take care of their health concerns themselves.",
