        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe that all children under the age of 15 should be given a chance to try out as many sports as they want (within reason, i.e. sky diving is unsuitable)\n\nHowever one major problem is that you tend to have to sign a membership for most clubs. This can hamper the hopes of many children if their parents can not afford to pay.\n\nWith all sports clubs free for the under 15's then the Government can help fight child obesity as it will encourage all children to take part in a sport and thereby encourage a healthy life.\n\nIt could also encourage young people to stay off the streets and continue taking part in sports after 15.",
