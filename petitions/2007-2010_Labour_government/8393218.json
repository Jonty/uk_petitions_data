            "background": "Fluoridation of water does not stop tooth decay proper nutrition and cleaning does \nThe BDA are quick to point out how well children in Birmingham and the North East do with less tooth decay but fail to point out the statistics and research which show that these areas have the highest rate of children born with thyroid problems, an illness which is know to be caused by excess fluoride. Birmingham also spends more on dental care than manchester, so is it the fluoride or the money which keeps those statistics up. There are many other illness this has caused. \nWhich would we rather have, perfect teeth or a nation of people with long term health problems costing the country. \n\nFluoride added to water is not the same as that which occurs naturally it is a class 2 poison made from fertilizer, banned in most european countries, it was used in concentration camps to keep the inmates quiet and adding it to our water is a breach of human rights as it will be mass medication",
