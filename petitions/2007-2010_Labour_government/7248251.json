            "background": "Apart from the increase in  HGV movements on South Bucks\u2019 already congested roads, locating a single large incinerator to serve the whole county, and possibly beyond, will actively discourage re-cycling and composting, which are on the increase in the county. Grave concerns have been expressed about the health risks associated with incinerator emissions. Studies exist that suggest it is inappropriate to locate incineration plants so close to communities and, in the case of South Buckinghamshire, the 12 schools within a 2 mile radius of Springfield Farm, and the 11 schools within a 2 mile radius of Wapseys Wood, along with numerous cr\u00e8ches and nurseries.",
