            "background": "This petition is to see what the public think about creating a block of flats of say 30-50 flats that can be used on a pro-rata basis for any Minister who requires to stay overnight in London due to business in the house of commons.\n\nThis would be a one off fee and stop the need for 2nd house expenses for Minister's as this one block of flats could be used instead, over the years this would save the taxpayer having to pay for Minister's expenses for upgrades and mortgage payments and also take away the ability for Minister's to make personal profit's when selling their properties after refurbishing them with taxpayers money.\n\nPlease sign this petition so that the Government can analyse this as an option to the 2nd home expense rule that exists at present.",
