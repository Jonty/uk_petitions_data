            "background": "Commuting through Selly Oak / Bournbrook either going into the city or heading for the M5 is never a straight forward journey which always ends up with stoppages through out this section of road from Selly oak railway bridge until past Tesco express. Many vehicles are parked on both sides of the road including peek times which does not allow for flexibilty of traffic to flow and enable road users to change lanes and encourage greater continous flow of traffic. Some vehicles are parked outside tesco express and prevent a clear line of site to pull out safely. Buses sit in this traffic and pollute the environment and as a conservative estimate for around 10-15 minutes on this stretch of road",
