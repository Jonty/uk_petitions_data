            "background": "The unwillingness of Mortgage Lenders to provide funding for property purchases in the UK is affecting the credit files of responsible borrowers adversely.\nOur business involves buying properties suitable for the rental market, improving distressed properties and providing support to local communities by providing decent homes for individuals and families.  \nWe also provide much needed support to Local Authorities unable to satisfy demand for housing.\nAs we are obliged to approach more than one lender during the current financial crisis, the resulting cumulative searches are creating negative profiles/footprints on our Credit Reports.\nWe are being penalised for simply making too many applications over a short period of time.\nThe Credit Referencing Agencies, who are unregulated, have the power to influence a potential lender even although some of the information held on files is often inaccurate.\nWe ask that Credit Refencing Agencies are either regulated in an attempt to minimise the serious damage that is being caused to many a good name, or that they allow 'registered' professionals to have more than the seemingly acceptable 5-12 searches per year carried out.",
