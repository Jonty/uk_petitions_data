            "background": "A new Banker/Building Society Fair Treatment Code of Practice for their Customers is needed to stop them enticing in Savers to open ISA with attractive Interest Rates at the start of each Financial Year, then lowering that Interest Rate, once Savers are \"locked in\" to them, and then opening a new Savers Account at much higher rates of Interest, but denying existing Savers the opportunity to Transfer their existing Savings Account into the new Savers Account, within any current Financial year.\nPensioners are particularly hard hit by this deplorable and deceitful practice, which reduces their income and living standards as a consequence.\nWe want \"Fair Play\" Code of Practice that protects the Savings of us, the little people of this Nation",
