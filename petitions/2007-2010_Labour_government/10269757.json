How many more have to die before anything is done! or even injured. Action needs to be taken now and make carrying a knife without good reason carry much higher penalties. If people want to carry a knife then they have to take the consequences of their actions.\n\nTime for change is now, if that includes use of metal detectors in public places, continually doing random checks to safe guard the Community.",
