I would like to petition the government to provide a voting forum with which to voice our approval /disapproval of the methods used to manage public finances.\n\nTaking on the level of debt that the Chancellor has indicated will cripple the uk economy for a generation and I believe it is only honourable to let that generation have a voice. Bring forward the election to Autumn 2009 or provide an alternative and country wide vote on the actions in the budget followed by a consultation period involving business leaders and representatives of the 3 main political parties to discuss the various options.",
