            "background": "I/We request that you make it illegal for companies to re access personal and business accounts for funds other than on the date specified on the mandate and no more than once in any one month.\nAt present to give a direct debit is like giving carte blanche access to your funds with no redress.\nBanks will quite happily add charges for non payment but no one appears to be addressing the issue that a direct debit is given in good faith (often with no option of other payment method so dictatorial if you require certain services) and that companies are misusing this to recieve funds and  additional penalty charges and such with random access throughout the month.\nGive the consumer more control to alleviate the mounting debt caused by such nonsense.",
