I do not qualify for mobility allowance as I was too old when registering as disabled.  I use a Toyuta Corolla Verso which is almost 6 yr's old and has only done 17 k miles.  Not polluting the atmosphere as much as a 1.4 which does 10k per year.Public transport i.e bus,train or taxis do not cover the needs for me moving around.  I am sure that there are many more with the same predicament.",
