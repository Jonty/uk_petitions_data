All the detained lawyers, human rights activists, journalists and political workers are immediately released;\n\n4. All restrictions on the media are immediately lifted;\n\n5. General Elections must be held on time under the auspices of the restoration of the judiciary\n\n6. General Pervaiz Musharraf must resign from all offices and the military should no longer interfere in the democratic political process.",
