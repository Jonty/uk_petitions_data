The UK people should choose the Prime Minister.\n \nUK people are fed up of the current administration, of high income tax, fuel and stealth taxes, incomprehensible immigration levels and greed by the Government. The vast majority of UK people DO NOT want to be part of the EU. We want to make our own decisions and this opportunity to decide this for ourselves has been taken from us\nby the lack of an EU referendum, or a general election.\n \nWe need a government who want to run the country as a country - for the BRITISH people - and not as a business, as the government are doing in a dictorial fashion.\n \nDo the decent thing Gordon. Resign. Call an Election. For the good of YOUR people and YOUR Country.",
