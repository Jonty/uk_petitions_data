It proves that the government is out of touch. \nRoyal Mail should be investigated by the monopolies commission.\nThe handling of the privatisation of Royal mail is a joke.\n\nA competent postal service is essential to creating a greener Britian.\n\nNo one benefits from the strikes, no one. \n\nIts a disgrace to the crown and postal laws need a shake up to protect the consumer.",
