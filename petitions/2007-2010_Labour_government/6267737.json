        "background": "Michael Porter has been convicted for crimes against children.  One of his victims was a mere 18 months old.  Yet he will not serve even one day in prison.  The Judicial system has decided that as he is a 'man of faith' and as he will undertake 'therapy', he didn't need to be imprisoned.  He was a man of faith whilst abusing young children - this didn't stop him.  \n\nThis is an absolute disgrace. This man is a menace to society and a danger to our children.  His victims will have a life long sentence through no fault of their own, while the offender walks away laughing at the system.\n\nWe ask that this case is reviewed and a proper sentence applied to a man who has perpetrated such despicable crimes.  Twenty years wouldn't be long enough but it would be a start. \n\nThese children deserve and have a right to, our protection.  They deserve justice.  They have neither from this ruling.\n\nThe man who gave this ruling should be made to retired.  He obviously has no idea of what the word 'justice' means.",
