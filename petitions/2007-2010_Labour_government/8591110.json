            "background": "I believe there should be an outsourcing tax on companies that offer services to the uk public and then outsource the technical support and Customer care services etc.\n\nThese companies are taking money from the British public and not investing in the country this needs to stop.\n\nIf there was a heavy tax on companies which choose to run their services from 3rd world countries I believe more companies would choose to manage there services within the UK.\n\nThey sell their goods to us, why should they not employ us as well?\n\nA lot of companies are taking this way as its cheaper.\n\nInternet providers telecoms companies banks etc, and they will carry on until the goverment introduce a tax to make it not worth their while taking this route.",
