            "background": "In venues such as cinemas, music festivals &etc, customers are forced to pay through the nose for basic commodities.  In particular, at concerts and festivals it is essential for health and well being to drink water.  However, customers are charged extortionate prices for water and forbidden from bringing in with them water purchased at the supermarket at reasonable prices.  Captive audience exploitation must not be allowed to continue.  The element of competitive prices available outside must apply to cinemas and concert venues too.  Venues should not be allowed to charge prices higher than the High Street and audiences must no longer be exploited.  It is not acceptable to over charge just because the audience is forced to purchase from inside venues.  Paying between \u00a31 and \u00a33 for water at concerts and more than \u00a34 for milkshakes in cinemas is explotation and not equitable.  This practice must end.",
