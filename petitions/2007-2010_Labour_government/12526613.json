Where, in spite of increasing media coverage, the number of signatories has virually stalled. This is all the more bizarre as within the first five days of the petition being launched by Dr Jansons, the e-Petition shot to the number one spot with over 48,000 people signing.\n\nIt is becoming apparent that many people are registering on this petition, but not being counted. This may bringing the Downing Street Petition reputation and standards into possible disrepute.",
