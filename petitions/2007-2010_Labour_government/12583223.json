This repayment should be assessed by taking the  proportion of the expenses claimed over the total costs during the period of ownership and applying it to the actual gain.\nThe Prime Minister should enact legislation to ensure that any sitting MP who does not sign this pledge resigns immediately and offers himself for re-election. Similarly if a former MP does not sign the pledge, he should be stripped of any title and be prevented from holding public office.",
