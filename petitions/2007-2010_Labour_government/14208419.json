        "background": "Forcing break-up on a successful business would be a radical step with few precedents. BAA was privatised as a single entity in circumstances where there was arguably far greater scope for competition than exists today. In the view of the BAA, this was because it was thought that joint ownership would provide a stable basis for expansion of airport capacity. We would argue that this rationale still holds true. Against this background, BAA submits that any decision to break up the company needs to be based on sound evidence that there are clear, demonstrable and significant benefits to be gained from break-up and correspondingly few costs and risks entailed. BAA believes that the OFT\u2019s preliminary analysis falls well short of this hurdle. Is it really in the best interests of the consumer?",
