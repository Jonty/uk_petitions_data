        "background": "The Chinese government are enforcing \"birth prevention operations\" in Tibet in order to suppress the reproduction of the Tibetan population. Tibetan women are being forced to have abortions and are sterilised without their knowledge. In China it is \"legal\" to inject women up to nine months pregnant to induce abortion and if the baby is \"delivered alive, the foetus is also injected so it will die\". A mother will often hear her baby cry once and will then be told the infant is dead. These are murder crimes and against Human Rights. We can stop it by refusing to buy any Chinese goods.",
