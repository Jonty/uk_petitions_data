        "background": "This plan is foolish.\nThe people currently running older cars either do so through choice ie classic cars, and wouldn't scrap them or through financial necessity and the paltry \u00a32000 would not be enough to get them into a British-made new car unless they were to borrow money. Which will not happen in the current economic climate.\n\nFurthermore, the dust-to-dust lifetime pollution of motor vehicles is such that keeping an older vehicle running for a longer period makes sound environmental sense.\n\nThis voucher scheme would have an take up rate of almost zero were it to be implemented, it wouldn't do anything for the British motor industry and would end up costing the country hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nForget this foolish plan!",
