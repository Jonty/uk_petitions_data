        "background": "Currently both parents must work at least 16 hours per week in paid employment to be eligible for the childcare element of working tax credits.\n\nI would urge the prime minister to consider people who are unable to work 16 hours per week yet still require childcare for their child. \n\nAn example of this would be a student of nursing/midwifery or similar where half of the course is made up of placements involving working 37.5 hours per week. People in this situation require childcare for these 37.5 hours yet as they are unable to work an additional 16 hours per week do not qualify for any childcare assistance from the government. \n\nHMRC should recategorise employed and unemployed to also include students who are 'unemployed' into the employed status when attending university for a certain number of hours each week.",
