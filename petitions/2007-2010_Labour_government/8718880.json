            "background": "Special Constables undergo a significantly lesser amount of training than their regular counterparts, due to financial constraints and the fact that they are required to work only 4 hours per week. However, they are required to do exactly the same work as a regular Police Officer, and are granted the same powers. Currently Police Services across the UK require that Special Constables wishing to work for the Police full-time complete the same application as someone who has never stepped inside a Police Station. When currently serving officers with exemplary records fail to get into their own Police Service, it is demoralising and raises the question as to why they were accepted to do the job for \u201cfree\u201d. Surely it would be more appropriate for officers\u2019 personal development records to be examined, and an interview conducted, as well as a medical and fitness test, rather than making them fill in the entire competency questionnaire and attending an assessment centre. This would save money and ensure that they are employing people who actually want to do the job, know what it is all about, and will not drop out within the first six months.",
