            "background": "Public life in Britain has been blighted by immoral behaviour on the part of politicians, both local and national, for decades. Recent exposures have highlighted the public's disgust with the political establishment as a whole,and events involving Glasgow City Council, MPs and peers expenses, and the cash for questions scandal are current and immensely damaging to the public perceptions of the body politic. If no action is taken to reverse the trend, Britain will soon resemble one the countries we regularly criticize for corruption in high places. This matter needs urgent action.",
