        "background": "Currently only a handful of channels on satellite are Free-To-Air with the rest being Free-To-View. What does this mean? People with bad terrestrial reception can install a satellite dish and a satellite box (from any company, not just BSKYB) and get a few channels that are unencrypted Free-To-Air, such as bbc1, bbc2, itv etc, but NOT Channel 4 or Channel 5.\n\nIn order to get Channels such as Channel4 and Channel5, which are encrypted by Sky and only Free-To-View, you need to buy a Sky box and a Freesat card from BSKYB.\n\nThis limits the potential for other companies to provide better viewing solutions to the people in the UK who live in a bad terrestrial reception area or who wish to benefit from the better picture quality of a satellite transmission.\n\nIf the channels are already broadcast over freeview unencrypted, why encrypt them over satellite? Surely non-sky customers deserve to see the freeview channels? Sign the petition if you agree.",
