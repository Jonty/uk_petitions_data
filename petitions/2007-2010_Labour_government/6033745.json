            "background": "The diamond industry causes death and misery to millions of people worldwide, year on year. The entire industry is riddled with corruption and greed and must be subjected to far more stringent regulation to erradicate 'blood diamonds' from filtering into the market. Families in Africa are torn apart, entire communities wiped out and children used as slaves to support this disgusting trade and remarkable as it may seem, it really is going on in this manner today.",
