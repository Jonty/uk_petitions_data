            "background": "The Acts of Union established the unions of England and Wales, England & Wales with Scotland and Britain with Ireland, the result was one country the UK. No official recognition was given to the constituent entities. In fact even though we often refer to England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland as countries, they are not as far as the Acts are concerned. The only reference to parts of the UK in the Acts is to North Britain (Scotland) and South Britain (England & Wales).\n\nFormal recognition should be given to these entities as constituent parts of the sovereign state, that is the UK?\n\nThe conventional term for a territorial unit within a state is 'province'. Recognising England, Wales, Scotland and N Ireland as provinces of the UK formalises the union of those territorial units with the sovereign state and constitutes official unification.",
