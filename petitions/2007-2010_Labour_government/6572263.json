        "background": "Back in March 2007 Gordon Brown, then chancellor, announced that he would be adding 2p extra duty to fuel and as an additional result collecting 0.35p extra VAT on every litre sold at the pumps.\n\nThe normal relaxation of fuel prices from summer to winter has not been very apparent this year as pump prices are still at 95p on average.\n\nWith the prosed tax increase the price will raise to 97p on average which will put many places throughout the UK up to \u00a31 per litre. Next summer will push these prices passed this mark and the \"new\" ceiling will become \"\u00a32\" per litre.\n\nVote now to put an end to this ridicules trend, or/and vote with your feet come election day!\n\nThank you.",
