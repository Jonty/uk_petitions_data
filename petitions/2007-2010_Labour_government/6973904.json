            "action": "recommend that Hull City Council take over the core funding of seven threatened youth projects",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are 7 projects in Hull that take disaffected young people off the streets and out of classrooms and engage them in positive activities. These projects have an amazing success rate at changing young peoples' lives by getting them back into education, training or employment. The external ESF funding is due to end at the end of the year and the projects will die with it - unless Hull City Council takes over the funding on a permanent basis. The total per year is only 1.4 million which covers everything from staff to sports equipment and minibuses.\nThese projects are vital for the young people they reach and incredibly important in the fight to solve anti-social behaviour.\nThe Council has a moral obligation to fund these activities.\nHelp support them by signing this petition!",
