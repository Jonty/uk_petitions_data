            "background": "Green spaces near your home are even more important to people than green spaces further afield because they make a huge difference to the quality of life in a town.\n\nIt is right to protect green belt land, but we think that the everyday proximity to parks and fields within towns has a beneficial effect on people that is seldom considered when deciding to build on green spaces in towns.  Houses these days rarely have the past luxury of being built with large gardens or on wide tree-lined avenues, so using the last areas of public green space to build housing in towns means that people lose out more than ever.\n\nOnce a green space has been built on, it is gone for good.  There should be far more stringent conditions to be met that recognize this fact when selling green space in towns for building development.",
