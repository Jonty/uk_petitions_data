            "action": "immediately conduct a referendum (the ordering of which is well within his powers as Prime Minister of this country) of the people of this country to find out from them if, as he stated at PMQ today (27 February 2008), they actually DO think he did the right thing over the Northern Rock situation.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is nothing more than sheer disprespect and arrogance for the Prime Minister of this land to stand up and state that he believes he knows what the people think, without actually asking the people.  His statement betrays the principle that politicians of all shades claim every day, and that is that they cannot possibly state what other people believe and the people concerned should be asked to say what they believe.  If he has the courage of his conviction then he will immediately give me (and I believe what he did was wrong) and the rest of the people who will be required to pay any consequential cost arising out of his handling of the Northern Rock situation, an opportunity to say so in a referendum.  If he has any morals at all - and if he is, as he so arrogantly claims, 'in touch with the opinion of the people' he will cause this to happen immediately.  Having made the statement he must have confidence that he is right and the result will support his claim.  To deny a referendum is to demonstrate to everybody that he IS being disingenuous and is intentionially and criminallly misleading the people.",
