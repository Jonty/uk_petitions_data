            "background": "As someone who is on long-term Incapacity Benefit, I am appalled that the conservatives are planning to abandon it if they ever get into power, and to force everyone on it to either work or get no money, despite being deemed unfit for work by a doctor, and unable to claim any other benefit as we don't fit any other benefits criteria (i.e. IS, JSA etc).\nI petition the Prime Minister to safeguard Incapacity Benefit so that this can't happen, and also to alter the rules so that those who are on Incapacity Benefit, who don't work can claim free prescriptions and other help that people on other benefits can claim i.e. free dental/optician treatment as the benefit in some cases is not enough to cover these costs.",
