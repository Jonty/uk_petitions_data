            "background": "We petition the UK Government to recognize the killings of ethnic Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus under the \u201cAktiris Plan\u201d between 1955 - 1974 at the hands of Greek Cypriots be officially recognized as genocide.\n\nBased on the definition of Genocide, the events of 1955 - 1974 account to Genocide.\n\nFor example: The case of Bloody Christmas 1963\n\nHistory: \nOn Bloody Christmas, over 600 innocent Turkish Cypriot men, women, and children were ruthlessly slaughtered in one night. Journalists Rene MacColl and Daniel McGeachie described Bloody Christmas and the events that followed it as \"too frightful to be described\" and referred to the suffering of the Turkish Cypriots as \"horrors so extreme that the people seemed stunned beyond tears.\" The Washington Post reported on February 17, 1964, that the \"Greek Cypriot fanatics appear bent on a policy of genocide.\" \n The Wash Star was reporting that \"bodies littered the streets and that there were mass burials.\" \n\nThe Akritas Plan had an uncanny resemblance to Mein Kampf for Turkish Cypriots. \n\nI say once again so you know what we are petitioning for and that is for the \"Official recognition from the UK Government Of The Turkish Cypriot Genocide\"",
