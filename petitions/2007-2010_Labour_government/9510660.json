As the military government in Burma clearly lack the political will to distribute aid with anything like the expediency necessary, we insist that our Government intervene, irrespective of the vetoes of other nations.\n\nWe call upon this government to deliver aid by all available means, air drops or by sending in militarily protected and escorted aid workers if necessary.",
