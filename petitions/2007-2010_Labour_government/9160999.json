            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The tax system has been distorted by the removal of the 10% band on earned income while retaining it on investment income. This penalises those in employment amd those with no savings. Furthermore, anyone with savings has surplus income in comparison with someone having no savings, making this situation deeply unfair. This redistribution to the better off should be halted, and the additional tax take should be applied to further redistribution to the poor",
