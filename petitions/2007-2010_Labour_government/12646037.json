            "background": "Trust, faith and confidence in the Houses of Parliament and all its politicians within it is the key to a reliable and successful Government. Since the unelected, Gordon Brown, came into power, it is felt that this key element has increasingly eroded and is now at a crucial level where trust in the people who run our country is on its last thread. By dissolving Parliament, it gives the opportunity for UK citizens to fairly and democratically elect a new Government, restoring some faith and trust to lead it without corruption and not repeating recent events. \nThese recent events have been appauling, shameful, embarrassing and disrespectful to the people who work hard and have any hope in retaining the confidence that Great Britain will improve. \nBy dissolving Parliament, there can be a clean slate where a new Government will work on leading Britain to a brighter future, avoiding previous mistakes and will do all in their power to stop misconduct and corruptive activity. \nA successful Government listens to its people and gives them the democractic participation they deserve to contribute to politics of the day, and what importantly matters to them.",
