Also the carbon footprint for the repair is lower by using these recycled parts.With a relevant British standard for the quality of the parts insurers should be either forced or allowed to use them.It will reduce the cost of repairs and hence could lead also to a reduction in the cost of insurance.Why melt down these parts to make new ones when a perfectly good used one is available?",
