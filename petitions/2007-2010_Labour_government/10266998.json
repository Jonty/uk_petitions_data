        "background": "As soon as the school holidays arrive the cost of airfares and package holidays go up. An average holiday for an average family (4) goes up by a minimum of \u00a3200. Long haul flights by several hundred pounds. This prevents many families from visiting loved ones abroad and chaos is caused for school attendance figures, as so many families take their children out of school before the prices rise. Lastly and most importantly - vital chunks of education are missed by our children every year. We are forced into choosing between family, a well earned break and our childrens education! We ask that offera more reasonable deal during school holidays.",
