            "background": "There are estimated to be 950 000 horses owned in England and Wales and on the increase (DEFRA). With this increasing market is the demand for livery yards. The value of this market can only be estimated to be sizeable as from observations it is conducted significantly in cash. There is legislation on Animal welfare to be strengthened in the next 2 yrs but nothing to consider customer rights of these services (DEFRA). Some may opt to be part of the British Horse Society register which is voluntary. (only 10%)  Prices vary, service vary and can change at will without consultation, they do not need to consider the customers, only their own business interests. Demand of services is often more than supply and this makes it difficult to move if it does not meet customer expectations\nThere are concerns over health and safety conditions.  Please consider the creation of a regulatory body to ensure basic standards and customer rights for paying for a service as well as the Animal Welfare are considered.",
