            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Britain is one of the few Countries in the world which does not have a fully armed Police Force. With terrorism, Drug Dealing and Gang Crime more police officers need weapons. The Prime Minister should think about re-arming the whole Police Force or at least introducing more Police Marksman. France, Germany and Spain have armed police forces to name a few. Britain is also an Island and it could be said we are in more need of Armed Police than our European Counterparts. The rigorous training that our SFO (Specialist Firearm Officers) receive would also help to mature Officers. The process would take along time and I'm not asking Gordon Brown to just hand out Hessler and Kochs, but just to look at the long term benefits and try to see past the obvious comparisions to America. The American police force is very much different to the UK's Police and is made up of many different departments. People will be worried that our schools will be subject to Columbine esq massacres but it is only the Police Officers who would receive weaponry.  \n\nPlease Mr Brown, help our Police force and let our Country keep up with others.",
