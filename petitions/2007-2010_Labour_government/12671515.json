There is, almost certainly, no legal impediment to her doing so, but the constitutional objections against such a course would be likely to prove overwhelming unless there were some constitutional crisis...\nThe mounting public anger at the lack of transparent and accountable self-regulation by MPs cries out for the exercise of discretionary sovereign power. The last thing the public wants is a Parliament-driven solution to a problem created by the very MPs who constitute Parliament and many of whom have the strongest possible interest in a \u201csolution\u201d that will not serve the public interest. \n(Times Online May 21, 2009)",
