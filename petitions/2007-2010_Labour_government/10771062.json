            "background": "We have a non-authoritative statement by an EU politician stating that there is no EU objection to the use of Imperial measurements for trade internally to the UK.\n\nHowever UK law still requires all measurement to be in metric with Imperial given only as a secondary indication; and UK law will still abolish  Imperial units at the end of 2009.\n\nPackers will have to continue to pack in metric. It will be uneconomical to maintain two sets of measurement and the Government must commit to phasing out Imperial units",
