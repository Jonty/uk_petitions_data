            "background": "This petition simply requests that once a diagnosis of and Autistic spectrum disorder is confirmed that an automatic right to support for services such as disabled  (Blue badge) applications, social and local authority support such as respite care be put in place rather than a further uphill battle with red tape and the constant need to prove yourself worthy of support. This often leads to many who need support not even wanting to ask due to the increased stress and anxiety of the official process.",
