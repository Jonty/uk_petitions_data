The process is an established one in the United States, and resulted in the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger. For this petition, the context is the UK Parliament and it concerns an MP deemed to be seriously failing in their role from the perspective of their constituency, for breaching parliamentary or legal laws and rules, or for changing party in between elections. \n\nThe process to initiate the recall machinery should be transparent, and will depend upon the trigger for the recall. In the case of the constituency view of no confidence in their MP, a petition, signed by a specified proportion of the qualified voters, must be filed with the appropriate officials who then, after verifying the signatures, order a by election.\nIf a MP crosses the floor, joining another party which challenges the legitimacy of their electoral mandate, an automatic by election should be called. If there is behaviour deemed to breach legal or parliamentary rules, then the trigger should be an order from the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.",
