You do not buy a pet without looking into the price of insurance for pet plans weather or not you can afford food vet bills and we certainly should not be paying any benefits to migrant workers and the families especially the ones that don't even live in this country.\nsoon there wont be enough working people to pay all the benefits to those not working and family tax credit because if you have two or three kids you dont need to work at all,those that do work will be paying 60 70% tax soon.",
