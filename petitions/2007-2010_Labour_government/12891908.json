            "background": "In this society, animals should not have to suffer at our hands. Animals they continually lead miserable lives in the cramped conditions of factory farms, just so we can have a few more quid in our pockets. It is simply not worth the pain animals must endure. This level of cruelty can never be justified, and we must stop it completely, by refusing to buy their pitiful produce. Only then will the factories and the suffering end. Bring back the independent farms, and stop monopolisation. Thank you.",
