        "background": "The American people celebrate Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday in November, at the end of the harvest season. \n\nIt is a national holiday to express thanks for one's material and spiritual possessions.  It's also a great excuse for a party with friends and family, in a month which is notoriously dreary, gloomy and dark.\n\nSeeing as you've changed the clocks to make it dark earlier in the evening - couldn't we do with something to look forward to in that long gap between Bonfire Night and Christmas Day?\n\nCome on Gordon! Make a stand! Give us a special Thanksgiving day on the same day as the USA, and we can cement our \"special friendship\" with our American cousins by joining them in a non-religious celebration of all the good things in life and Turkey sandwiches.",
