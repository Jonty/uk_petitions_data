            "background": "The children of the United Kingdom are bombarded with advertisements in TV broadcasts, children's publications and children's events.  The advertisers use all the sophisticated effects at their disposal on impressionable young minds to convince them that they NEED the product to be happy.  Parents are then pressurized into buying the product that more often than not does not live up to the promise of the campaign and leaves the child disappointed.  It is time our children were allowed to grow up without the media convincing them that that they are deprived and unloved because they cannot have every item they see advertised on the TV or in a magazine.",
