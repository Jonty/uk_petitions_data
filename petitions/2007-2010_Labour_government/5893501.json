        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current taxation laws for motor vehicles including motorbikes is sufficent, we do not need another law chipping number plates in order to check that motorcycles are taxed. We already have a system via the DVLA and the Police, if a vehicle is not taxed then the Police can check with the DVLA. We beleive that this is a waste of tax payer's money. The vast majority of us pay our taxes but the ones that don't are not going to listen anyway as these people could not care less about the \"LAW\". Making laws for the sake of it is  not good for society or the Government. If the Government wanted to ensure that ALL road users pay their taxes, scrap the road tax and put the price up on petrol, at least that way anyone driving will have had to pay.",
