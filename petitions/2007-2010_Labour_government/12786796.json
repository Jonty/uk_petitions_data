        "background": "I am one of 1000's of IT contactors that have had security clearance of one form or another in order to work for government departments and agencies, I have had many years working for Government agencies and departments via large IT Service providers but my security clearance has since lapsed. I am getting turned down for roles that I could easily do because I am no longer cleared. But at the moment individuals can not clear themselves, in this time of current climate condition the PM should allow individuals to pay and get themselves security cleared in order to obtain a new role thus giving government departments a much better choice of skilled candidates.",
