        "background": "A recent press release has stated that Islam4UK plan to march through Wootten Bassett in a mock muslim repatriation ceremony.  This is a disgrace to the members of the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom and also the residents of Wootten Basset.  Any march of this nature should not be allowed and any group wishing to promote their political aims by parading though this town should not be allowed due to the fact that our fallen travel this way en route to their final resting place.",
