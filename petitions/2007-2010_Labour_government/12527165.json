            "background": "Stop paying benefits and housing to underage/ single girls who fall pregnant.  Either their parents keep them or the child is taken from them and put up for adoption.  More awareness should be made to these children that if you get pregnant and your parents will not keep you and your child then the state will not keep you and the child will be taken from and put up for adoption and given to people who can afford to keep them without claiming benefits.  Most girls only get pregnant so they can get housing and claim benefits.",
