        "background": "The new proposed law banning the sale and importing of swords is both poorly thought out and a waste of time.\n\nNearly all Samurai swords purchased in the UK are by collectors for decorational reasons or martial artists. Attacks on people are so rare this ban would be utterly innefective at saving lives. The attacks which have happened would still have gone ahead with some other sharp household item used in lue of a sword had one not been available. \n\nThis law would be counter productive, would not save lives and would devistate the many businesses which rely on the sale of these items and upset the thousands of collectors in the UK.",
