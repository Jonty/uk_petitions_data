        "background": "Whilst it is accepted that there has been and still is an inequality for women, we are in danger of men being pushed to the sideline due to us not having appropriate representation at Government level. There is a Minister for Women, which is a good idea, but with the role of men being ever diminished with the family and other walks of life, I feel that it is time for there to be a Minister for Men to balance it out and to give equal representation to men and women so that both interests are met appropriately",
