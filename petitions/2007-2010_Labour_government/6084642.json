            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Sefton council has recently introduced an alternate week collection, one for household waste and one for recyling.\nThis is causing hardship for many families with children and creating an ideal environment for vermin to proliferate.\nBin bags of rubbish are left in the streets, as the bins are only designed for one weeks rubbish and now have to accomodate two weeks worth. The Binmen refuse to take any excess waste bags, so the bins fill up as soon as they are emptied. The Council say they are doing this to reduce tonnage for landfill, as the Government are to charge \u00a3150 per ton and they encourage us to take our excess rubbish to the local amenity site. The rubbish that is deposited there goes to landfill anyway, so what is the point of a two weekly collection of household rubbish? Furthermore people are using their motor vehicles to get to the tips and so introducing more CO2 emmissions into the atmosphere.When the council rates were set, there was a weekly collection of household waste and recyled waste, so I believe Sefton Council now owe each household affected, a rebate. The Governments own select committee is against fortnightly collections, stating them as of no benefit.",
