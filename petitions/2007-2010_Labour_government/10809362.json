We no longer need this government, LINCOLNSHIRE could fund itself ! From the Humber to the Wash we have 3 great ports (Immingham, Grimsby and Boston) we have our own oil reserves which benifit us not 1 iota and in this county of rich arable land we grow 20% of the whole nations food.In short the country needs LINCOLNSHIRE more than we need it. Keep your multicultural con to yourself mr brown, give us the freedom to rule ourselves. Kosovo was granted this, give us the same, you gave them a homeland, let us have ours.",
