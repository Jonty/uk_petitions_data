I have launched this petition in the hope that with enough support that animal lovers up and down the country will finally see a sentence befitting of the crime, and implimented Nationally.\n\nThe Law was changed in 2007 after 96 years to make people accountable. This law is seldom enoforced, and it is my express intention to raise awareness and see a further increase to legislation because quite simply, it's not enough.",
