            "background": "As teachers in England and Wales we are appalled that the latest government White Paper proposes a renewable licence to teach. \n\nAfter three years graduate study, a year of teacher training, an induction year that must be passed and constant performance management thereafter, the government already has in place excessive checks on teacher competence.\n\nWe also oppose the intention to give headteachers the power to recommend licence renewal.\n\nWe also reject the implicatiion that there are thousands of colleagues who are failing to teach well.\n\nWe call on you to drop this policy from any new legislation. \n\nInstead we call for regular, guaranteed opportunities for teachers to lead, contribute to or undertake professional development on a sabbatical basis.",
