I personally think, and Im sure allot will agree with me, that more funding is needed is both Northern Ireland and the U.K.\nG.P's need more training in the understanding of Eating Disorders. More faclilities, services and out-reaches are needed for the sufferers and the carers. There simply just is not enough been done for this type of illness, but yet for so many other illnesses there is help?!\nAnorexia/Bulimia is just a \"taboo\" subject and is not talked about enough and people do not know enough, the truth.\nThere are 1000's suffering who need help!! So please sign this petition.",
