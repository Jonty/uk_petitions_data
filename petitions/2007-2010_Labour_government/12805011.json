            "background": "As we're all aware, the majority of the world is in recession, and although a number of experts have said there are signs that certain areas are seeing some positive improvements, petrol prices are continuing to rise.\nIf petrol prices do not come down, this will start impacting on a number of areas, Such as food and general goods which will rise in price, those who commute to and from work will find it increasingly difficult to do so, and a number of businesses will be affected resulting in more redundancies .All these factors will result in a much longer and deeper recession. So please support this petition \nBest Wishes",
