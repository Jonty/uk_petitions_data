            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "on a regular basis either a prisoner or prison staff are injured with a shaving razor by inmates who have removed the blades from the razors and made them into a weapon to cause injury to other people,I have seen horrific injurys both to prisoners and staff at prisons caused by these easily concealed weapons, prisons do not allow sharp objects into the prisons so why do they freely distribute such dangerous items and allow them to be used unsupervised?The risk of being attacked with a razor is becoming high in prisons,I would also like to add that prisoners are also using razor blades to committ suicide as well as tattoo eachother which carries a high risk of HIV infection as well as Hepatitis infection as a lot of the blades are not cleaned and are being used to tattoo/injure different prisoners,Our prison officers have a hard enough job to carry out without having to have the worry of being attacked which could ultimatly cause death,I ask that all people that agree with this petition to sign it as we could be saving lifes not only of prisoners but also prison staff who are doing there duty to protect law abiding citizens by maintaining security in prisons and keeping offenders locked away,",
