A political move by the Sudanese authorities should be met with a political response by the UK Government.\n\nSudan continues to abuse human rights and shows total contempt for the lives of those living in Darfur. The UK Government has to respond to this using the only tool at its disposal - Sanctions and the withdrawal of UK aid.",
