            "background": "Private equity firms abuse loopholes in the tax system intended to nurture entrepreneurialism, cut jobs in some cases with voracious asset-stripping and bosses often pay less tax than their cleaners.  This loophole sends out an awful message about Britain's commitment to equality in the wake of a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation alleging that the income gap is at a 40-year high and is anomaly which should be gotten rid of.",
