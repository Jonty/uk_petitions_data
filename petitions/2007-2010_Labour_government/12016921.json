If the Government believes that the electorate still trusts and believes in them to lead our country through the difficult times, put it to the vote. \n\nOnly then will this Government have the genuine mandate of the people to govern us. If the Government wants to be vilified and put into opposition and into 3rd place where the Lib Dems are today then carry on.",
