            "background": "This morning (29 Aug 07), a small fortune belonging to the British taxpayer was spent to ensure the dedication of a monument to Nelson Mandela. In Staffordshire at the National Arboretum, charitable donations have been collected and spent to establish a memorial to the brave men and women who have given their lives in the service of their country since the end of WWII. This Prime Minister who intends to attend its dedication together with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will not give a penny to the service of dedication although he will of course quite happily drink and eat for free on the day. It has cost this government nothing to create this monument, the least they can do is pay for it's unveiling (approx \u00a3200,000)or is that yet again too much to ask on behalf of our armed services.",
