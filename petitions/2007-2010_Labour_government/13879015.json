            "background": "The British Government often reiterates commitment to furthering human rights & equality globally & is often at the forefront of calls for condemnation of acts that violate the fundamental rights of all individuals. While it should be applauded for open condemnation, we the undersigned don't believe that words reach far enough, & petition the Prime Minister to create the Department of Global Equality & Human Rights.\nThis follows news of the Anti-Homosexual Bill that has been introduced in Uganda's parliament. If enacted, it would condemn homosexuals to a life in prison and even death.\nThe French foreign ministry, equal rights groups & American lawmakers have expressed deep concern over the legislation, but have raised only verbal condemnation.\nWe need a far more proactive approach to tackling all kinds of human rights abuses & promoting & enforcing global equality rights. We the undersigned believe that Britain can, & indeed must lead the fight against global discrimination.",
