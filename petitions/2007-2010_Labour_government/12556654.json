            "background": "The environmental cost of nuclear power is too great for humanity to continue to use this as an option for energy production.  It is also one of the key factors in the continued manufacture of nuclear weapons and therefore reliance on nuclear power also increases the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  If we are going to tell other countries that they cannot have nuclear weapons we should set an example ourselves by cutting out the root cause and stop using nuclear power.  This will create a safer, healthier and more peaceful environment for our children and the generations that follow.",
