        "background": "Grandparents may apply to have unsupervised access to their grandchildren, whether or not the parents consent. This breaches the parents right to decide what is best for the child until they are of an age to make decisions themselves and, in some cases, may put the child into a dangerous situation. Parents should have the right to deny access to any person who is not the mother, father, adoptive parent or registered legal guardian of the child, regardless of whether the reason is founded or not.",
