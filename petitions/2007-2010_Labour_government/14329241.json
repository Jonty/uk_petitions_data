We are not getting non bias reporting.  Nick Robinson is an ex Tory supporter at his university and David Dimbelby is an ex member of the same champagne club as the Tories.  Andrew Neill is probably still being paid by Murdoch.  And the BBC say they are impartial.  They do not no the meaning of the word.  I blame producers and editors.  All of this at our expense.  We are not getting a good service.  We need a clearout at the BBC.",
