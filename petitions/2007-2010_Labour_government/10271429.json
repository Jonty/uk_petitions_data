        "background": "Homework is very stressful, and reduces a child's time for fun which they can not get back once they are working adults. There is no reason to ban homework (or coursework), as it is essential, but giving students, sometimes even after stressful exams such as GCSEs and A-levels, homework during the holidays, which are named so for a reason, is purely irrational (as they might do it at the beginning and forget about it in later weeks) and irritational (the student should be allowed a break). It's a perfectly fair request that ensures students will become fresh-minded and less stressed to work harder in the up-coming term, knowing that they won't get bored and will have another break soon.",
