            "background": "Search 'Tenants are 'recession victims'' on the BBC news site for background info.\n\nEven though a tenant has paid the rent they can still be evicted from their home because of their landlords financial problems. The government proposal to increase the eviction notice period from 2 to 7 weeks fails to address the issue that innocent people lose their homes. \n\nA more relevant measure would enable the transfer of ownership (or management) of the property to a housing association (or local authority). Either government could provide funds directly to housing associations to allow them to buy the properties or government could compel the rescued banks to provide finance to housing associations for the same end.\n\nThe benefits are that the tenants would obtain continuity and security of tenure (providing they meet the conditions of their tenancy). Government would avoid some of the costs of private tenants calling on the public purse and obtain some tangible benefit for the public money already provided to the rescued banks. The banks would avoid the problems of repossession and trying to sell the property in the current uncertain market.",
