It has since built a largely peaceful, tribal/democratic society.  This is based on a democratically elected lower house, and a tribally selected upper house.  \nThis is in marked contrast to (Italian) Somalia, and to Puntland - both failed states. \nThe Somaliland navy has completely controlled piracy in its national waters, and has offered base facilities and cooperation to the international anti-piracy forces.  \nIt is time the UK recognised its former colony as a successful, independent state and as a partner.",
