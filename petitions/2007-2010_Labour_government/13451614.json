        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Recently the government allowed an exemption for stamp duty on homes which meet the Code for Sustainable Homes level 6. This is a positive move to encourage growth in low carbon buildings, however, the UK is currently experiencing a huge growth in interest of passivhaus buildings. The passivhaus system and CSH are not directly comparable as they use different technology to analyse performance, however it is clear that the passivhaus system has created more low carbon buildings worldwide than the CSH. CSH is currently being re-written to become more like passivhaus, this recognition should be shown in a relief of stamp duty for passivhaus certified buildings.",
