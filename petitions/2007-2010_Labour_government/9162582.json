        "background": "AOL today reports that 31% of people transferred from one hospital to another are at risk of malnutrition, especially those from care homes and 43% of those moved from care homes to hospitals are at risk.\n\nMalnutrition on admission to hospital varied significantly according to where patients were being transferred from, the study showed.\n\nIdentifying these high risk health factors and user groups - transfer between and within institutions - can't we as a nation somehow address this problem ? What does the rest of the nation think ? As well as limiting hospital stays, promote discharge planning / home care, any ideas ?\n\nEfforts to get people well and back into the community will be from a minus zero position if they're not well fed to begin with.",
