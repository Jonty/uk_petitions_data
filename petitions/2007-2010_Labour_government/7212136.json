            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are hundreds of firework injuries each year. The noise limit of UK fireworks is 120 decibels, while the noise level created by aircraft rarely exceeds 80. The smoke & toxic dust contain Heavy Metals, affecting asthma sufferers. Green colours are from Barium \u2013 a poisonous radioactive. Blue\u2019s come from burning Copper - linked to cancer. Other harmful ingredients - Lead Nitrate, Strontium, Rubidium, & Sulphur Dioxide. Ammonium Perchlorate propellants are a source of contaminants in drinking water, linked to disease of the Thyroid. There are age restrictions relating to the sale of fireworks, but there is no concern given to a spent rocket, laced with residues of the above, being picked up by a child in their own garden. There is no UK restriction controlling the amount of fireworks sold & therefore no limit to the volumes of pollutants, toxins & radioactive chemicals that are generated. It would make sense to ban public sale & limit fireworks to licensed & organised displays at which safety, noise pollution & environmental impact can all be properly controlled and monitored.",
