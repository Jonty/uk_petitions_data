            "background": "The UK Postal Service is in a Big Mess with huge delays and high costs to distribute the mail. \n\nI suggest that the government should \n\n1) Stop delivery of Mail to the persons residence\n2) Deliver Mail to the persons residence only if they have registered and paid an special subscription free\n3) Use the huge volume of jobless people to give voluntary service to the Post Office. Thus they can be used for sorting and delivery of the mail. No payment need be made to them as they already will be receiving payment as Job Seekers Allowance \n\nMassive deficits could force the US post office to cut out one day of mail delivery per week, the postmaster general has told Congress",
