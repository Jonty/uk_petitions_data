            "background": "Social services have become a joke, they have too much power which is often abused and there appears to be no regulating them. Complaints are dealt within the social services department itself, including ones sent via local MP\u2019s, and so complaints are dismissed completely.\n\nChildren are often left or placed in the care of known abusers where they are endangered, even when the police say the child has real evidence of physical and sexual abuse social services say stop bothering them. Other children are taken from their parents for no good reason or threatened with the endangered children\u2019s list for as little as the parents having an adult toy locked in their own bedroom cupboard.\n\nThe elderly are also victimized and forced into care homes even if they have care and want to remain at home.\n\nThis cannot go on. Social services are a disgrace. They need to either be replaced including their staff, or a body set up to investigate the social services who so far have enjoyed the freedom to abuse their power.",
