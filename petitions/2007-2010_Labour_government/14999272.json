            "background": "The Cult of Scientology, as testified by the many ex-converts and workers in coverage by the worldwide media, uses unethical techniques of 'mind control', involving physical and psychological attacks on individuals, in order to recruit and exploit them for the profit of their business. This is an obvious breach of Human Rights; and while a tolerance of beliefs and faiths must be upheld, the induction to such systems must not be through manipulative techniques, which Scientology's affiliates have consistently been reported as using, and actively encouraging.",
