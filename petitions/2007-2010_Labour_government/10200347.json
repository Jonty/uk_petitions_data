            "background": "As a parent of 2 diabetic children, and a headteacher, I appeal to you to fund stem cell research so that a cure can be provided for diabetics. From a financial point of view, your Government are paying out millions, if not more to care for diabetics and cover the cost of their insulin, needles etc.Add hospital care to this, the additional burden this places on hospital beds and care clinics.  A cure is out there, via stem cell research and the reason we do not have it currently available is because the pharmaceutical companies are making a fortune (from yourselves)to supply diabetics with their monitoring and control medication. It annoys me that the answer is out there and greed on the part of the pharmaceuticals, and complacency on the part of the government, are keeping diabetics from having the freedom and the quality of life they deserve. They are at the mercy of your decision.  I appeal to you therefore, on behalf of all diabetics,to put money into stem cell and push for a quick completion to their research. You will be aware that there are a huge number of diabetics in the UK and you know the cost to taxpayers.  Stem cell is an obvious solution.  Please consider it?\nSigned:  Briege Daly,",
