If a person does not have a valid MOT certificate for their vehicle then they can be given a fixed penalty notice of \u00a360 or worse.\nA reminder is sent for Vehicle tax before it becomes due, but nothing is sent for MOTs.\nThis petition is to ask the Prime Minister to instigate the sending of reminders to vehicle owners before their MOT is due for renewal.",
