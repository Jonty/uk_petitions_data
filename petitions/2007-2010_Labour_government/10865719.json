In any case why do sports programmes NEED discussion? I've never seen discussions in any other sort of programme (unless it's an integral part of the programme; e.g. Question Time).  \n\nI admit that I have created a similar petition before.  I am now concerned, however, by reports that the Government is currently considering the \"Crown Jewels\" of sports programmes; I fear this will mean even MORE sport on terrestrial T.V. so the point about discussion is that much more trenchant.",
