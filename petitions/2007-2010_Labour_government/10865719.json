        "background": "This is a cause of great annoyance to non-sports fans; it's bad enough that the actual match or whatever takes up most of an evening without having the discussion as well!  In any case why do sports programmes NEED discussion? I've never seen discussions in any other sort of programme (unless it's an integral part of the programme; e.g. Question Time).  \n\nI admit that I have created a similar petition before.  I am now concerned, however, by reports that the Government is currently considering the \"Crown Jewels\" of sports programmes; I fear this will mean even MORE sport on terrestrial T.V. so the point about discussion is that much more trenchant.",
