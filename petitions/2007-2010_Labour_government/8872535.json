            "background": "Currently the Drink Drive Laws do not include passengers of vehicles committing offences whilst being driven by drunken drivers.\nThe law should be amended to apportion some blame onto passengers of drink drivers.\nMost passengers know or should know that their driver is under the influence of intoxicants and usually don't care as they can simply walk away if the vehicle is stopped by police.\nIt is suggested that passengers of drink drivers should be dealt with be way of a fixed penalty notice to the value of \u00a380 in line with simple offences such as low level shop theft, criminal damage and public order offences.\nThis could be dealt with at the roadside or in custody should the passenger be too intoxicated to understand the procedure they are required to undertake.\nWe also suggest that the permitted prescribed limit for alcohol in a persons body should be reduced to 10mg of alcohol in 100 mls of breath.\nWe request that the law is revised as soon as possible.",
