        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Stop giving handouts of any sort, to people who wish to come to this country (or those who were born here but choose not to work). This would, stop the majority of people wanting to come here, which in turn would take pressure of our housing, health service & education system, and reduce our carbon emissions. Britain is a small island & in 20 years time we will be bulging at the seams if things carry on the way they are, no green spaces will be left.Violent crime will continue to increase as people are living on top of each other. We need a politician that is not scared to stand up the way the Australian Primeminister did to stand up for our way of life. We need some one with balls to run this country and stand up for the traditional British way of life. The people who have paid into the system all their lives, and fought for their country should have the right to good medical treatment & a decent standard of life in retirement.",
