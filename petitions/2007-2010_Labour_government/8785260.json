        "background": "I was concerned to read of suggestions that Turkey should be admitted to the EU, because I believe that, to the extent that immigration has worked for us to date, it has been because the countries whose residents have been eligible for it have been culturally and ideologically diverse, and the population increases that we have seen as a result have not been from any one religious background. Whilst recognising that Turkey's poverty could be a cause of future Islamic radicalisation, and that outright exclusion from the EU (which in any case is probably not in our power to impose)might fuel a swing in that direction, I believe that we should seek to ensure that the admission of Turkey is counterbalanced by that of, say, Russia, or another country of varied cultural provenance.",
