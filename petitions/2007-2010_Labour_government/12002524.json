            "background": "The UK's fishing fleet has been in decline ever since the UK agreed to sign up to the Common Fisheries Policy. Boats are being decommissioned with men losing jobs. Inshore fishermen's livelihoods are at risk too. Regulations over quotas are threatening the very existence of jobs in the communities which rely wholeheartedly on the fishing industry whether directly or indirectly. Fishermen who work small inshore boats are sustainable in the methods used to catch fish and the amount of fish they catch each year. The economies of rural areas face collapse without fishermen, ending traditions which have continued for thousands of years. The Government need to solve the problems facing the UKs inshore fishing industry and listen to the very people who make fishing sustainable.",
