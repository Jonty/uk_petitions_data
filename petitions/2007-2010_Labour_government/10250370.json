            "background": "The current PM promised us that smear tactics and spin were not to be used in government as they have been in the past.\n\nAndy Burnham's comments about Shami Chakrabati and David Davis are quite the most unpleasant muck spreading tactic that New Labour have employed in recent memory.\n\nBurnham has caused grave distress and embarrassment to both families and for that reason alone should resign.  If the PM has any decency left he should demand his resignation and should himself apologise to both families publicly.\n\nThis petition asks the PM to clarify that  he is not behind the whispering campaign against Shami Chakrabati nor does he support it.  Further he should apologise publicly to all involved and seek Burnham's speedy departure from the cabinet.",
