            "background": "Gordon Brown is to give evidence to the Iraq Inquiry, as he was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the Iraq War. The relationship between him and the then Prime Minister \u2013 Tony Blair, was a partnership of equals. The Blair government\u2019s progress was dictated as much by the Chancellor\u2019s willingness (or not) to fund certain policies as by the Prime Minister\u2019s enthusiasm for that policy. This country would not have joined the United States in the War had the Treasury \u2013 in the person of the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown \u2013 not been prepared to pay for it.\n\nThe Inquiry should be concerned that the principle financier of our country\u2019s involvement in the War intends to give evidence only after the forthcoming General Election. He must give evidence as soon as possible.\n\nFurthermore, it is reported that Cabinet Ministers at the time of the Iraq War, who no longer hold the same office, are to give evidence to the Inquiry before the Election. Gordon Brown surely falls into this category.",
