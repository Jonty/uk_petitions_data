        "background": "We urge a review by the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport of the events on Saturday November 8th during the football game between Barnsley FC and Sheffield United FC.\n\nSpecifically we are asking that the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport do everything within their power to ensure the appropriate punishment is received by both Chris Morgan and Sheffield United from the Police and Football authorities. \n\nChris Morgan on that day inflicted a very serious and potentially life threatening injury on Iain Hume during a football game. As no attempt was made to play the ball, the incident has to be seen as an attempt by a professional footballer to purposely injure a fellow professional. This cannot be allowed to go unpunished for the good of the game and the safety of all football players going forward.",
