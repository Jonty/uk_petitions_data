Although the warrant has now been with retracted, following this whole event our government has been rebuked and threatened by the Israeli Government into a frenzied attemp to bend British Laws to \"protect\" Israel from the rule of Law. This is unacceptable.\nWe support the Courts decision to make criminals such as Tzipi Livni accountable for their actions, which in her case directly resulted in the indiscriminate killing babies, children, men and women alike. She should be held accountable.\nOur goverment must support the action taken by the courts and demand that Israel reapect it.",
