        "background": "If you have taken your mortgage out on the property you live in after you brought it then you won't get help with payments, any benefit, unless the mortgage was for structural purposes or to add a water supply.  I, like a minority, took out my mortgage after buying the property though I don't have any savings.  So we have to pay the mortgage plus the leasehold fee, like the others, this is a struggle.  So when we are not at work we should get help with the payments.  Rent gets paid and other mortgage interest, why not our mortgage thou we live off the same benefits and child tax credit.",
