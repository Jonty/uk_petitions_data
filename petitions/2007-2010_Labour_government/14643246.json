            "background": "Enough is enough, are we to sit idly back whilst the supermarkets ruin our Dairy Industry, it's about time this Government got of it's backside and helped our Dairy Farmers from going under, by paying a fair price for milk (30p per litre) would help stop the rot in our Dairy industry, halving of the Dairy Farmers over the last 13 years is an absolute disgrace, yes we all want things cheaply but when it's to the detriment of a British Industry then it is not acceptable and for the supermarket to say it is what the customer wants is a load of BULL a customer will pay what they have to to get what they want. We should all be helping our farmers at home not those abroad.",
