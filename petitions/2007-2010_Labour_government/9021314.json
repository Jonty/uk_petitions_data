            "background": "Ghandi has no roots to do with Leicester, if the statue were to be put up i believe that it shouldn't be the peoples money of whom it shall not benefit. If there is a statue to be put up, the community assossiated with Ghandi should put up the money. I think that the money could be distributed in other ways that will be more constructive for the whole community of Leicester rather than just a selection of it's population.",
