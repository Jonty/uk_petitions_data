            "background": "I have started a new accountancy practise and have submiited an online VAT registration. Five weeks later I have yet to be registered and have been advised that the Office concerned is currently dealing with applications dated 24 April. On that basis I am unlikely to be VAT registered before September. Although there is a facility to charge VAT without a number many businesses will not process and pay such invoices. There is also substantial input VAT incurred in starting a business which cannot be recovered. This puts extreme pressure on new businesses and as such should have been addressed far sooner. HMRC raises some very stiff penalties on businesses  for failing to meet deadlines. One of the most onerous is a 5% surcharge for late payment of VAT. Some of my clients suffering cash flow problems are having the situation exacerbated by huge penalties for payments being days late. In my opinion HMRC should not be allowed to impose such penalties until they can process their own responsibilities in a 30 day period.",
