        "background": "The well-known comedian, television presenter and actor, Russell Brand, has expressed desire to interview the Prime Minister after being contacted about it a short time ago. I feel that this is a unique opportunity, one that will gain a more varied audience, and, therefore, be beneficial to the Prime Minister, the government and, primarily, Russell's career, possibly bringing a great change in the running of the country, as I am sure that Russell could give Mr. Brown a pointer or two. If people express an interesting in this, the Prime Minister may agree to the interview; I am certain that this would be both very entertaining and informative.",
