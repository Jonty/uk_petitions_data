            "background": "Ofgem, the regulator of the energy suppliers, has ended the right of the 45 million UK energy consumers to back out of their contracts with suppliers with just four week's notice. \n\nIn July 2003 Ofgem submitted a paper to the Energy Services Working Group in which it claimed that this rule gave consumers \"vital\" protection and did not stop energy suppliers from \"bundling energy efficiency measures with energy supplies\". \n\nLast week Ofgem claimed precisely the opposite as it cancelled our most important protection. \n\nThe regulator's prime responsibility is to foster competition and thereby protect the interest of consmers - it appears to have abandoned its central role and betrayed our interests. \n\nThis cannnot stand.",
