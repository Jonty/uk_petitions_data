        "background": "The proposed route for AirTrack will close each of Egham's three main level crossings by between 37 and 44 minutes every hour, cutting Egham in half.  There are no sensible alternative roads or pedestrian routes available. This will have a detrimental impact on businesses and residents of Egham, and the surrounding area. It will also have a serious impact on traffic in the area including junction 13 of the M25. AirTrack acknowledges these crossings will \"be significantly affected\". We call on the government to ensure that bridges or tunnels are provided as part of the AirTrack scheme, or if that is not feasible to re-route the track and provide a bridge in a feasible location.",
