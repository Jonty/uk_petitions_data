            "background": "It is the oppinion of myself and many others that the educational maintenance allowance system is simply absurd it is based on the fact that parents earning more than \u00a330,000 a year give out up to \u00a330 a week to there children either directly or through purchasing things for them, this is simply a lie . Thus i believe that there should be no wage limit on the minimal award,meaning all student's will receive at least the minimal \u00a310 ,this will be a fair system. Sign up now and lets help Mr Brown make a good popular decision that is right for this nation and that will improve school attendance across all backgrounds   by rewarding all students who work hard at school",
