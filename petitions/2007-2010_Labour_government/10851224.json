            "background": "These toys are dangerous and could prove fatal. My brother recently bought a rope toy for our dogs, the following day it came apart. It consisted of a ball on a short length of rope. When it came apart all the pieces that had been cut from the ball came out, having been placed inside the toy at the factory. Our concern is that if one of these pieces had been picked up by one of our dogs, or if had been in the hands of a child it could have caused the death of an animal or child. And I have been told that it has caused the death of a dog already by corroding the stomach, that is how dangerous these toys are, and why they need to be banned now.",
