I have had to self fund a recent post graduate qualification so I can make my way further up the career ladder, and give back to the community.  But with the repayments on the loan going up with interest rates, I\u2019m sure like many young people we wonder is it worth it if we have to financially struggle? \n\nPlease help get the Prime Minister to look at our plight otherwise I find it hard to think what our lives will be like in the future",
