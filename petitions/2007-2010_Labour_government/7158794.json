        "background": "Charging for rubbish pick up is a ridiculous idea as it can not be effectivly policed or measured like a water meter so instead why not make the recycle pick ups more regular ie every week and the garbage pick ups less regular ie fortnightly.  Charging people is just going to lead to littered streets and will cost even more money",
