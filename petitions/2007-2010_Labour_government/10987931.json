            "background": "The sketch in question involved Ross and Brand pretending to leave messages on Andrew Sach's answer phone, including references to Brand sleeping with Sach's grand-daughter. It was funny but generated two complaints at the time because of the bad language involved. 2 weeks later, after the press have whipped up a 'scandal' 20,000 people have complained - it is not clear how many have actually heard the sketch. Mr Brown is demanding the 'appropriate action' be taken by the BBC. Brown should apologise for lending credibility to a media witch hunt. Andrew Sachs has accepted their apology - that is enough. The BBC is suppose to be independent of Government - Mr Brown is endangering that independence.",
