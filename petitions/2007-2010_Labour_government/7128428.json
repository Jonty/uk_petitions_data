        "background": "since nobody has realised the knock on affect of the smoking ban ie job losses  singers,bar staff,landlords,cleaners,delivery,ect we need to rethink the smoking ban there needs to be a smoke room at least.old people who fought for this country now have to stand outside for oap to do this is disgusting.more clubs and pubs are shutting down so when they all sign on the dole that isnt going to look very good is it.when more people are going to the doctors due to having to stand outside in all weathers,when girls and women have to be alone standing outside they are at risk.even non smokers want the ban lifting it has segregated people not for the better,resentment is building.this counrty is not great any more its becoming depressed!i certainly will be if my husband loses any more work.everyone has rights so why does'nt a smoker,it is an addictive drug so why are smokers not getting compassion like drug takers do they can take their drugs in a warm enviroment ie clinics chemists ect.lift the ban before any more places close and before any more loose their jobs.",
