            "background": "I would ask that craft both powered and unpowered be restricted from access to all  rivers unless there is a history of access and are on a designated navigable river, or is a section of river which has been specifically set aside for water sport. This would maintain a seperation between all river users, preventing conflict of use, and maintain   privacy to all users and land owners.",
