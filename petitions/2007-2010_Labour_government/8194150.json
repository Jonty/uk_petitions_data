It is NOT their money which has been misappropriated, but IT IS taxpayers money!  Why, also, do we see company directors and other taxpayers (who are NOT elected politicians) being charged with criminal offences by people like HMRC when it is apparent that elected politicians may merely 'apologise' for their criminal activities to their colleagues (in crime)for God's sake, and everything is OK, business as usual.  This man is a criminal, he needs to be put on trial before a jury of taxpayers to decide how long he should spend in prison, not merely how long he should be suspended from the HofC!",
