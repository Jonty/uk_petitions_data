            "background": "Gorseinon missed a huge opportunity last time when petitions stopped the development of the asda store in Gorseinon. the last few years have seen big blows with the closures of corus and valeos and now news of 3ms another major employer in the area.\n\nAsda plans a \u00a325 million investment in Gorseinon giving 100s of jobs to the well hit construction industry as well as providing a further 300 full, part and flexible time jobs to the local community. \n\nAt present, around 75% of the towns population leave gorseinon to shop in other areas such as Llanelli and fforestfach. and often spend they're money in the smaller retailers that have set up shop around these and other big stores.\n\nbringing the majority of these people back to gorseinon as well as encouraging people from neighbouring villages gives gorseinon the potential for further investment, employment and development as well as more trade in our high street stores.\n\nAsda is a great opportunity for Gorseinon. SAY YES!!!",
