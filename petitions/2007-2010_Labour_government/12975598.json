            "background": "I petition the Government to invest public funds to create a manufacturing facility similar to the one in Speke (Nr Liverpool - Small scale production only)that can produce enough vaccine to cover the whole of the UK population (90 million doses within a short time frame - typically 2 months). Having this secure access to UK manufactured vaccine would stop any risk, in an emergency, of a foreign country or company overseas stopping delivery of a much needed vaccine until their population has been vaccinated.",
