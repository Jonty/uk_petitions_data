As a result, continuity of care and access to training opportunities for surgeons in training will be severely affected with potentially disastrous outcomes for quality of care and patient safety.  \n\nStark warnings about this impending crisis have been issued by the Surgical Royal Colleges, the surgical trainee bodies and by elected patient representatives, with evidence that care is already being compromised.  \nThe profession is best placed to advise on optimising patient safety and we would urge the Prime Minister to consider urgent changes to UK legislation, to allow the modest increase in working hours, to a maximum of 65 hours per week, which is required to maintain a first rate standard of care for NHS patients.",
