            "background": "The advent of the dog-owning hoodie has brought with it a dramatic rise in dog attacks. The reason being, the dogs are acquired for status and encouraged into aggressive behaviour. The young owners are also often unemployed or on basic wages and many cannot afford basic vetinary costs such as neutering.\nCouple this with the dogs living in unstable and erratic conditions and frequently changing hands, (as I see constantly in my role as a hostel worker in West Yorkshire)then it becomes a recipe for disaster that will spiral out of control as more animals breed and move into the cycle.\nSteps must be taken to control the ability to acquire dogs as pets, the essential condition being that the applicant is over the age of 21\nThis would ideally be followed by a vetting procedure to ascertain the suitability of applicants as owners.",
