            "background": "We believe today's governmental bailout of  irresponsible and greedy banks is an insult to the hard working British tax payers. For years the banks (and the government) have cautioned us towards financial prudence. The banks have routinely penalised members of the public for even the slightest financial discrepany, yet all the while have been totally incapable of managing their own finances. Stop the bailout - if we are to have a system of free market economics, then let that system take its course and let the weakest financial institutions go to the wall.",
