East Lancashire needs the government to invest in areas such as this, not aid the degeneration by removing some of the better jobs the area has to offer.\n\nServices to the public will suffer as a result. HMRC are committed to maintaining enquiry centres - but, this commitment has so far amounte\nto a terraced house with one member of staff in Nelson. The people of  East Lancashire deserve better treatment t\nan this!",
