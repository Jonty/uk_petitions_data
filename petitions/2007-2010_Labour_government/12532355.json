        "background": "The Further and Higher Education Act 1993 put higher education funding into two QUANGO\u2019s the Higher Education Funding Councils for England and Wales. The Public Audit Act 2004 took away the power of intervention by respective Auditor Generals in cases of financial mismanagement. The result is that we the taxpaying public have no right of complaint, and that both QUANGO\u2019s nor respective governments for England and Wales have any jurisdiction to intervene in  issues of financial mismanagement etc. \n\n \nThe taxpaying public are also banned from any form of consultation concerning standards or levels of service, if this applied to other forms of public service, there would be an outcry. In keeping with proposals for schools and the same standards that apply to other public sector workers notably FE lecturers, teachers and social workers. We call upon the Prime minister to reform higher education and legislate to give the public a voice on provision, standards, accountability and regulation.",
