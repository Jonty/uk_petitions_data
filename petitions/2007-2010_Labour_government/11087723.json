            "background": "A new department, independant of social services, should be established. It should be accesible as a first point of contact for those dissatisfied with the child protection services being received (or not) by a child they believe to be at risk of abuse. \n\nWhere concerns are raised about the handling/protection of a child, the independant department would be required to follow up with an immediate investigation of proceedings regarding that child. This could involve contacting the individual that alerted them of the concern, social services, police, educational and medical professionals with knowledge of the child as well as the child/family in question. \n\nSocial services would be required to explain the handling of the situation to date and plans should be made about how best to deal with the situation and assist the child.",
