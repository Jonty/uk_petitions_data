        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I'd like to see the government subsidise the cost of purchasing and/or maintaining a Bicycle.\n\nI believe that this would encourage more of the public to take to their bikes to get to and from work, oppose to driving their car to work, with no other passengers.\n\nThis would potentially be a component to reducing the NHS (National Health Service) cost's.  Cycling reduces the risk of serious conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity and the most common form of diabetes[1].  It also has the ability to reduce levels of depression and stress, improve mood and raise self-esteem, and has also been found to relieve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome[1].\n\nThe government should see the cost of such a scheme recovered by the reduction in health and drug costs.\n\nObviously, this scheme should be backed up by local and national road safety initiatives.\n\n[1]: Claims backed up by a well known british health service.",
