            "background": "Gordon Brown: We petition you to listen to your health advisers', the police and the peoples' views on cannabis law reform.\n\nThe proposed re-classification of cannabis will turn hundreds of thousands of innocent UK citizens into criminals, and the friends and family of millions of us will become criminals overnight.\n\nThe re-classification of cannabis to class B is unhelpful in the times we live in and a policy of education and communication will be far more effective than prohibition in reducing the use of cannabis. \n\nMany adults 'choose' to use cannabis in the UK as an alternative to alcohol. This is our choice. Do not criminilise us for a plant we choose to use in our own homes. Why make us into criminals?",
