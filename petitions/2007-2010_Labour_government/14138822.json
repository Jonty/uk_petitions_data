            "background": "We voice our concern for the proposed changes which are being made to one of the wards in Knockbracken Healthcare Park. The female acute ward, Rathlin ward is being converted into a mixed ward, with both female and male patients. \nThe women who have availed of Rathlin\u2019s services in the past are extremely vulnerable and many of them have been abused by men, contributing to their mental ill health. To put men who are mentally unstable in a living environment with such vulnerable women would be detrimental to the health of both the female and male patients. \nRathlin ward as it is currently functioning is a very safe environment, a sanctuary for women going through a very difficult time. Why do the trust want to change it to a mixed ward? There are examples within the Belfast trust of mixed wards which are not pleasant, safe places to be, such as Avoca ward which I can only describe as a hell hole. \nMany service users in the community have been disturbed by the decision to change Rathlin ward. We want to know who made this decision and why?",
