Today it would be a fantastic link through the Peak District, bringing in tourists as well as getting traffic off the busy roads and improving the transport network through the Peak District. \n\nI created a facebook group in favour of openining this line, the group recived over a 1000 members in a week, showing a positive demand. \n\n(If you are a facebook user please search \"Re - open the railway line between Matlock and Buxton\")\n\nPlease show your support",
