            "background": "In order for the party to maintain quotas for men and woman MP's, constituencies like mine in NW Durham refuse to allow male candidates. I believe that irrespective of gender all candidates should be allowed to stand and whomever is the most suitable, albeit male or female should be selected by the NEC. \n\nThis gives everyone incentive to get involved and potentially stand as an MP rather than discriminating on suitable members in a certain location because of their gender, when their efforts in the local communit and ability may warrant them to stand as PPC for the constituency.\n\nEveryone should have the right to put themselves forward for nominaton and may the best candidate win. I have enough faith in good female candidates not to see a need to restrict males from standing in certain areas, and vice versa.",
