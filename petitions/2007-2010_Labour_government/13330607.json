        "background": "We the Citizens of this great United Kingdom demand of our elected representatives that NO special treatment is provided for the tormentors, torturors and murderers of Baby Peter Connelly, his Mother Tracey Connelly, his Step Father Steven Barker and Jason Owen. The segregation to prevent punishment by the inmates of the institutions in which they are incarcerated for their crimes and the provision of new identities, if and when they are released, will cost the British tax payer a reported figure of \u00a33million . We feel that these brutal monsters deserve nothing other than appropriate punishment for their crimes. If that punishment includes 'rough justice' then so be it. They gave Baby Peter no love, respect or hope in his short life. They deserve nothing from us!",
