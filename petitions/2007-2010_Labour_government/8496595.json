            "background": "I wish for the ban of all road legal 2-stroke engines because of their horrible smell and noise. Being stuck behind a 2-stroke moped with no safe means of overtaking is one of the most annoying features of driving today. The rancid smell enveloping the car is a disgrace and harmful to the environment.",
