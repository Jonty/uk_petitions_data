        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is a frequent occurance that software manufacturers stop selling, distributing and supporting older pieces of software, which many people still use. Occasionally this software is a particularly useful tool, or an old game to which people hold sentimental attachment. For several reasons, people seek to aquire old software which is not sold anymore-examples include games (notably Doom and Frogger) and larger pieces of software (for example, Windows 95, NT)-for their own personal use. To aquire such software is currently illegal, even though the copywrite owners make no profit from the software, and there is a genuine market for it. For this reason, we petition the government to legalise the distribution of software for which the creating company has removed support and no longer sells.",
