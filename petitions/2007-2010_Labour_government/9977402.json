            "background": "In 1951, the UK signed up to the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.\n\nThis basically states that, if anyone arrives on British soil and claims asylum, then the UK is obliged by law to at least consider their claim.\n\nThis treaty was suitable for the world in 1951. There were, for example, many Jewish people who had been persecuted and who needed international protection.\n\nBut now the world is a very different place. We now have asylum seekers arriving en-masse, claiming that they need protection. They have often passed through many other \"safe countries\" before they reach the UK. However, the reason they want to come here is because of all the benefits that life in the UK brings them.\n\nThey are basically ECONOMIC MIGRANTS.\n\nI'm not saying we should never grant protection to anyone genuinely in need. However, we should be free to make that decision ourselves, and not be bound by international law to accept these people when their claims are manifestly bogus.",
