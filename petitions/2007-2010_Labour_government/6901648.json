            "background": "We are being forced to switch over to digital TV, but why?? so that these digital company's can make lots of money.  This will have an impact on the environment with the extra use of power to power your digital/satilite box.  The government whats you to save power but this will not happen.  If you want to have satilite/digital then you can have it, but let use have the option.  But if they want us to switch then the GOVERNMENT should pay for every house hold to have a digital/satilite box.",
