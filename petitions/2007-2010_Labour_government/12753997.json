        "background": "We strongly feel the Furness Academy will be detremental to the education of our children and future children in Barrow in Furness and is NOT the way forward.  \n\nWe already have three very good schools that perform well and have their own merits. Each school has it's own unique community that has been built up over many years.  \n\nThe pupils protested on Monday 1st June at Parkview School to demonstrate their strong feelings against loosing their three schools and the loss of many excellent teachers.  \n\nWe do not want the Academy and without the co-operation of the pupils and parents it will not work.",
