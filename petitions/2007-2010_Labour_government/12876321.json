This will also bring ALL UK doorstaff to a level service standard.\n\nIf Doorstaff follow the approved techniques and guidelines, this may be used as a defence should an unfortunate accident occur. \n\nDoorstaff accross the world are committed to ensuring that the public have a safe night out, and to stop troublemakers from causing themselves or other people harm. When accidents happen, Doorstaff are usually shown in such a bad light which damages the reputation of doorstaff allover.\n\nTHIS MUST STOP NOW WITH THE STANDARDISATION OF ALL DOORSTAFF TRAINING IN THE UK",
