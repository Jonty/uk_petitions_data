        "action": "stop all flights of civilian and military aircraft to the Republic of Zimbabwe from the UK, UK territories and dependences and also not to allow the any Republic of Zimbabwe registered or owned aircraft to enter UK airspace unless in an emergency.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "President Robert Mugabe blames the UK and 'our friends' of trying to ruin the economy of the Republic of Zimbabwe and remove him from power. By removing any flights to and from we show we have no interest in his country and make it obvious to the wealthy members of Zimbabwe ruling parties and their children who regularly travel to the UK that they are not really wanted here by the inconvenience and added expense to their travel. We should also add inconvenience  by not allowing Zimbabwean aircraft into UK airspace unless in an emergency, if one does land it should be impounded.",
