            "background": "Apart from the fact that it would be so easy to kill an innocent person, capital punishment should not be brought back because it is inhuman. What right do we have to take away a person's life? How will that solve anything? Capital punishment belongs to a time when society was ruled with fear, unless we want to return to those days we must avoid this absurd idea. In fact the government should be encouraging other countries to give up the death penalty.",
