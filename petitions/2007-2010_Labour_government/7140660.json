If we cannot get the current system to work how is pouring more fuel on the fire going to help.  Where will the resources come from, all the new teachers (more immigrants ?) - our current schools and the quality of teaching is already stretched.  How will employers fill the gap when their 16 to 18 fodder disappears more immigrants and more strain on our ingfrastructure, schools included.  My school now has study days to allow \"parent evenings\" to take place during the day, more time off work more costs to employers.  We must be realistic.",
