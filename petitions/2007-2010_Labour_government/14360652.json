However, now many people in public and private life are paid bonuses on top of their pay, just because they have done their job well. This should be stopped completely. If someone underperforms then get rid of him/her, if someone does his/her job well, s/he obviously deserves the full pay as per the employment contract, but no bonus just for doing their job! These extra bonuses are obscene, are often funded by the taxpayer. Stop all bonus payments now!",
