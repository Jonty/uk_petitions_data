            "background": "This would cut out the need for Police to be involved with penalty notice offences relating to fireworks, reduce calls relating to fireworks and free up Police time.\nTime and cost savings to NHS also from reduction in injuries, and reduction to calls to fire service.\nThis would impact on Police and partnership agencies targets for reduction of Anti-Social Behaviour.\nRestricted to organised displays would impact on noise nuisance to the public as displays would only be licenced for the relevant periods.\nCalculated efficiency savings could be diverted to local authority displays, therefore lessen the impact on manufacturers/jobs through loss of sales.",
