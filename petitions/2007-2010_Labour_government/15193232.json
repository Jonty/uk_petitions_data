To make it more secure and make individual responsible for their act it is necessary to make the internet account as a bank account with individual to log on to access the web as a whole.  In this way we can give a restricted web access to our children and protect them from unwanted elements and make the web experience much more fruitful for them and our future.  I thankyou for the time you have taken to go through my thought.  \nThanking you once again\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJathindranath\n26 justins Avenue\nStratford-upon-avon\nWarwickshire\nCV37 0DF\n\n07525344966",
