        "background": "David Freud stated  in his view, fewer than a third of those on incapacity benefit are really too ill to get a job. \"When the whole rot started in the 1980s we had 700,000. I suspect that's much closer to the real figure than the one we've got now.\"\n\nThere are no studies or statistics whatsoever to support this claim.\n\n\"And it's ludicrous that the disability tests are done by people's own GPs - they've got a classic conflict of interest and they're frightened of legal action.\"\n\nAs every claimant knows, the personal capability assessment is carried out by Atos Healthcare doctors working for the DWP, never by the claimant's own GP.\n\n\"There are probably five to seven per cent of the people on IB today who are on the black economy. They're doing jobs and claiming too but they won't have a free lunch any more.\"\n\nAgain, there is no official support whatsoever for this claim. The DWP's research puts the figure for fraud at less than 1%.",
