        "background": "It has been announced that the MoD needs to cut the defence budget by \u00a3250 million this year to meet spending requirements, and sadly...as usual, that comes at the cost of the once proud Royal Navy. A senior Fleet officer has said \"What this means is that we are now no better than a coastal defence force or a fleet of dug-out canoes. The Dutch now have a better navy than us.\" The Government will not commit to two further Type 45 destroyers, which have been cut from 12, to 8, and now to only 6. This is a ridiculous position for a nation reliant on its navy for defence. We are all used to the hype, the largest Navy building program, and budget increase above inflation, but the reality is that our defence is being crippled, and that in real terms the budget now is less then it was in the 1980s. Can to Government genuinely commit to giving Britain a realistic Navy reflective of its international position as a a member of the UN Security Council and a key international player? Please, save the Royal Navy!",
