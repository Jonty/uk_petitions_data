            "background": "We as London Bus Drivers have had enough of drunken teenagers boarding our buses and verbally abusing and threatening us and basically being given \"permission\" to do so due to the Free Travel for under 16's scheme. Incidents of anti social behaviour by this age group towards drivers and other law abiding passengers have risen sharply since the introduction of this scheme and we urge The Mayor Ken Livingston to abolish this scheme forthwith thus cutting off the yobs free reign to treat drivers and other passengers and also our vehicles with pure contempt.",
