        "background": "Hi, \nOur roads are congested, the environment is suffering, road users are complaining about the cost of fuel and yet 9 out of 10 cars I see every day on the road have a single occupant!\n\nI myself have regularly transported a colleague to and from work on average 4 days per week for the last 6 years and yet as far as I can tell the only concession the government make to me is not charging me income tax provided I don't make a profit...\n\nIf the government are serious about reducing carbon emissions and want to ease congestion on the roads then surely car sharer's like myself deserve a bit more support. \n\nWhy should two lone drivers with vehicles which emit 99g/km of CO2 each pay zero road tax when others have to pay \u00a3205 for emitting 198g/km when they have two occupants??? The CO2 per occupant is the same!\n\nI would like to see a scheme introduced where a  car owner who regularly transports one or more passengers can claim a proportionate rebate on road tax. It should be the CO2/km/occupant which is important!!\n\nThanks for your time,\nCraig.",
