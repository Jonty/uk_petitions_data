        "action": "Guarantee that France will buy MORE than just one CVF class aircraft carrier and consequently pay a bigger share of the design cost",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If the French do order that 1 aircraft carrier, they will only have a total of two ACs. That is not enough (nor is it enough for the RN to have 2 aircraft carriers but that's not the topic of this petition). Having two ACs means that only one is permanently available. It is impossible for ONE aircraft carrier wing (ACW) to fight for more than 12 hours per day. However, if a task force numbers two or more aircraft carriers, it can fight over a continous 24-hour cycle, i.e. 24/7. And generally, please encourage the French to spend MORE on their military.",
