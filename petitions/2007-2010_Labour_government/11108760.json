            "background": "The Country is shocked by the awful situation of Haringey Council and Baby 'P.' Since the Victoria Climbie affair, one hundred and fifteen (115) complaints have been made to the Local Government Ombudsman about child protection in Haringey Council. Only one (1) of these complaints has been upheld with a finding of 'maladministration with injustice' with a paltry settlement of \u00a370. This outcome is a statistical impossibility and exposes the inadequacy of Administrative Justice within the UK. An independent judicial review is requested into these matters.",
