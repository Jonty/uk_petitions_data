            "background": "This petition proposes that the way both Job Seekers Allowance and Incapacity Benefit are paid is changed.\n\nIn short 'Job Seekers Allowance' should be changed to 'State Sponsored Employment'. There are many jobs in the public sector that people on Job Seekers Allowance could do. \n\nWorking 3 days out of 5 would still allow people time to search for work, but would make Job Seekers Allowance less of a soft option.\n\nOn the basis that the claimant would be working, payments at an increased rate would be justified. However, failure to attend state employent or non performance of duties to a satisfactory standard would result in the loss of all benefits.\n\nIn conjunction with changes to Job Seekers Allowance changes to Incapacity Benefit should also be introduced. \n\nInstead of a person being signed of work completely, they should from day one be signed off certain types of work only. \n\nIf the individual does not find suitable work in a set period that they can do, they should be provided with suitable State Sponsored Employment. Failure to take up the work provided, or carry it out to a suitable standard should result in the loss of all benefits.",
