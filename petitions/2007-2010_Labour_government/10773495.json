        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present companies selling energy often have a sliding scale of prices ie: the more you use the less you pay per unit- eg: the first 80 units per quarter might be 20p per unit and over that number only 15p per unit. This actually penalises the careful user and encourages more profligate use of energy.\nIf the companies would offer say 3 or 4 units per day to each person in a household very cheaply or free then charge a much higher fee for subsequent units, consumers would be more careful in their usage;  to the benefit of the environment.  It would not necessarily mean a loss of income for the producers.",
