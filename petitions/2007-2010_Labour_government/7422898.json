I think yes, but ... \n\nWould the party to which you donated be disclosed? I think no, but ... \n\nWould it be disclosed how many party's you donated to. I think yes, but ...\n\nImplement this on the big party's. With other party's allowed to receive donations directly until some threshold is reached.",
