            "background": "Two world wars were fought, and many thousands gave their lives to preserve the freedom of ordinary people; that freedom is each day being eroded by the 'do-gooders' who not only will not see that crime is properly punnished by the law, but many times prefer that the victim of crime should be the sufferer:  parents who would teach children how to behave, are themselves threatened by severe penalties if they attenpt to chastise their own child:  even in nature a mother animal will administer her own 'short-sharp-shock' to teach her offspring correct behaviour, she knows that the proper  attitude will ensure her issues' acceptance into the social structure of their own kind, and will also contribute to their future safety.\nIf you agree that the balance between perpetrators and victims of crime needs correcting, then please sign this petition.\nThank you.",
