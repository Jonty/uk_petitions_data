After that Belfast DPP has refused to meet in public.\n\nEvery other DPP in Northern Ireland meets in public and allows members of the public to submit questions about policing of their city/town or village.\n\nWhy are citizens of Belfast being treated differently ??\n\nIt cost the Tax payers \u00a3250,000 to fund Belfast DPP in 2008 and yet they don't meet in public and afford the citizens of Belfast the right to question policing of the city.\n\n\nPrime Minister please Instruct Belfast District Policing Partnership to meet in Public and let citizens of Belfast get involved in local policing as they did prior to 2008.\n\n\nJohn Collins",
