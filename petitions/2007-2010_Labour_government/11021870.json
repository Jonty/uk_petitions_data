        "background": "the more a person knows about the damage smoking causes to themselves, the more likely they will be to quit. by changing the warnings on cigarette packets from writing to pictures (eg. damaged lungs caused by smoking), the british government will be able to create a greater disincentive to smoke  which will therefore save countless lives each year and thus reduce the amount of public money spent treating smoking related diseases. we petition the government to take legislative action to ensure that the warnings on cigarette packets are changed from writing to pictures eg, damaged lungs",
