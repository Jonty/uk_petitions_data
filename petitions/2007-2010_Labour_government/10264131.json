        "background": "Given the understandable shortcomings of Witness Protection Schemes, the petitioner is calling on the govt. to better support innocent bystanders who happen to see something unusual, that may well be used as evidence in criminal investigations. Anonymous hotline numbers are a good initiative - but voices and locations can be traced and recognised - what about an anonymous online IT reporting facility ?\nThe only idea of my petition is to give even greater confidence in policing and tackle crimes, using the internet as a positive force, (if you pardon the pun !).",
