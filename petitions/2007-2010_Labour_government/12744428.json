We can save our vegetables and use the rounded up vermin to govern the country (they will certainly do a better job). The military can be recalled from foreign shores (saving british lives) and can save the British vegetable from further slug butchery. I am sure the SAS could deal with the slugs in a few short bloody encounters. Tally Ho.",
