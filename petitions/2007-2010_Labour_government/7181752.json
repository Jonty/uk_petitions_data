As at least one petition on this subject has pointed out cars are potential lethal weapons.  It is a known fact that the higher the speed at which a pedestrian, or other road user, is hit the more serious the accident (and, far more importantly, its consequencea to the victim).  Many petitioners who are opposed to limiting speed say that it is not the only, or most important, factor in road accidents; but it must be ONE factor.  In any case I would always take the stance that you don't continue to do something until it is proven to be harmful; you STOP doing it until it is proven NOT to be harmful.",
