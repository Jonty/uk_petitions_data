            "background": "We request that the Prime Minister informs most strongly the Department of Energy that Modern Multifuel and Wood Stoves are more efficient and give off less Carbon emissions than most modern gas or oil fired systems and is more economic for Rural Areas than Gas,Oil or Electric Heating. It is both Green and for every tree felled for timber two are planted helping to replace the Carbon Dioxide give by the heating system thereby giving a large Green footprint with Carbon removal from the air we breathe. \nThe Governments own people 'Warmfront' refuse to acknowledge the benefits as do the Department of Energy and Climate Change itself despite Scientific evidence to the contrary, please get the systems allowed for our own future",
