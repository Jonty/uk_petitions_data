            "background": "Margaret Haywood has been struck off by the Nursing and Midwifery Council for secretly filming elder abuse in NHS hospitals.  The offence was apparently betraying confidentiality, although all the families affected gave their consent to the footage prior to the BBC Panorama programme being aired.  \n\nThis is an outrage against human decency and moral justice.\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to demand her full reinstatement and a full and public apology by her NHS superiors and the Nursing and Midwifery Council for not only subjecting her to such treatment but also for not addressing her concerns earlier, which, had they done so, would have meant she did not feel forced to go to the Press to draw attention to the issue.",
