            "background": "Recently, the Case of Baby P has shocked and disturbed a nation. This petition is to assist with the idea and introduction, of electronic tagging for parents that are on a child protection register and who are uncooperative with multi agency parties, especially in cases of Child abuse. This will help to enable agencies to view the whereabouts of a parent when a lack of co-operation is prevalent, and to underpin if there is deception by the parental party. A result of this being - social services are able to observe families of an increased closeness. If deception is found, then the appropriate intervention for the child can be raised within a court of law. \n   Had the mother of baby P been electronically tagged as a result of numerous visits to the hospital with her abused son, then social services may have found they were being deceived, in order to cover her babies injuries and questions could have then been raised within a court of law.",
