            "background": "We have to help our Politicians help us!!!!\n\nThe reason why our Politicians don't dare taking the urgent action that is needed to protect our environment is that if they do we will punish them by voting them out.\n\nIf we are not unintelligent we all know deep down that we are polluting the air that we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that nourishes us and that there even is a big chance that we have managed to affect the earth's climate. \n\nI just sit back and wonder why our Politicians don't take any drastic action.  Don't you? \n\nBasically it is self-defence on their part. Hence the need to create an Environmental Agency that is independent from Politicians (similar to the Bank of England) and that will be able to take unpopular but necessary decisions.\n\nPlease sign this petition to a Prime Minister who has not yet grasped the depth and urgency of the problems facing us.",
