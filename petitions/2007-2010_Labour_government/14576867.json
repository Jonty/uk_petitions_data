Some naughty crooks found the log books and have been using them ever since to clone cars, the DVLA say it is nothing to do with them and nothing can/could be done.  They have posted the serial numbers affected on the internet...  \nThe most obvious thing to do is immediately change the design of the document, issue replacements for all vehicles already registered, problem solved...  \nThis raises the question, is the DVLA an incompetent organisation unfit for purpose?  In the light of many other failings of this organisation, should it be disbanded and reformed with a mandate to serve the people, fairly, honestly, and efficiently.",
