        "background": "Owners of vehicles which were purchased and/or newly registered before 2001 should not have to pay higher road tax JUST BECAUSE THEIR CAR IS OLDER! Road tax SHOULD be based on the ACTUAL EMISSIONS of each vehicle based on MOT emissions tests! People on lower incomes will be forced off the roads when they run older economical, smaller engined vehicles whilst conserving their hard earned fuel! If a car EASILY passes its MOT its road worthy no matter how old it is. MOT's should be made more stringent to handle this.",
