            "background": "CryptoFirewall and similar technologies allow printer manufacturers to lock the buyer-in to their own brand of replacement ink or toner cartridges. Ostensibly this is to protect the manufacturer's R&D investment, but the real truth is that chipping allows the printer to be sold at a loss-leader price, with the profits being made on extortionately-priced consumables. \n\nChipped cartridges are 'engineered-to-fail' technology. Most disable the printer after a set number of pages, or at a set date, even though the cartridge is not empty. It is a 'waste-making' industry, causing many thousands of perfectly-serviceable printers and part-full cartridges to be discarded annually. \n\nOnce one manufacturer starts 'chipping' consumables, others must follow suit, or else be seen as uncompetitive on the highstreet price of the printer. Thus it is a self-perpetuating practice. \n\nThis is clearly a case where legal intervention is needed; if the practice of cartridge-chipping were banned, then the price of printer hardware would be determined by normal market forces. The honest manufacturer, the environment, and the consumer would all benefit.",
