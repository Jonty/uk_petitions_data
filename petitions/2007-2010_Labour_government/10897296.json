        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We believe bonuses should only be paid by financially healthy companies. If the underlying business is shown to have unacknowledged or unrecognised financial weaknesses in the medium term then those who suffer losses (be they creditors, shareholders, (ex-)employees, pension fund members, customers affected by inflated costs or governments forced to financially support failing businesses) should have legal recourse to recover the bonuses paid to high value employees. The recovery should not be related to the culpability of those awarded bonuses but be a method of mitigating the financial loss suffered by the stakeholders through no fault of their own. This law should be retrospective.",
