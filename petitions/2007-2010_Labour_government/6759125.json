        "background": "I understand that Manhunt 2 does look like a very violent game, I also know that a petition was set up to stop the ban and that this petition was rejected. I have also just found out that even an edited version of a game (one that uses less violence and blurs out particularly violent scenes) has also been rejected. I feel that as adults we can make our own decisions and be free to do what we wish during our leisure time. Even though the uncut version has been banned (upsetting MANY) I create this petition to reconsider the ban on the edited version of Manhunt 2.",
