If we want to stop bottom trawling, we need marine reserves today. For healthy oceans -- we need marine reserves today.\nThere is a growing body of scientific evidence that demonstrates that the establishment of large-scale networks of marine reserves, urgently needed to protect marine species and their habitats, could be key to reversing global fisheries decline and restoring our oceans.  Greenpeace's plan to set aside 40 percent of the world's oceans as no-take zones could mean  survival  for sharks, tuna, whales, and a wide range of threatened and endangered species..\n\nYou can help us convince governments and the United Nations that we need to protect our oceans by creating a global network of marine reserves.\n\n(Taken from the Greenpeace web site)",
