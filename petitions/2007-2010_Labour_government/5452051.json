            "background": "Many aspects of Britain's dealings with other countries and peoples have been hidden from the general public, or distorted to suit the interests of current or successive governments. Some past issues return to prominence, such as the current debate on politicianry, or Suez. I feel it is important for citizens of this nation to be aware of what has been carried out in their name, and the names of citizens past, in order that they understand the responsibilities they bear when they elect a government and endorse a foreign policy programme.\n\nWe should try to understand what genuine grievances other peoples or nations might have against ours, and distinguish these from false claims or irrational aggression.\n\nThe prime minister's stance on cancelling inequitable foreign debt is encouraging. I would hope that he might establish a process to reveal the truth about our past, and then try to make good where we have failed to treat others in the manner in which we hope to be treated ourselves.",
