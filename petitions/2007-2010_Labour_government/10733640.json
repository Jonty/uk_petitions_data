            "background": "We are requesting that ratings produced for DVDs and other digital media by the BBFC will incorporate warnings of language considered blasphemous to Christians; that the name and/or title of Jesus Christ, when used without reverence, be noted. We believe that in the sanctity of one\u2019s home people should be given greater control to wisely choose what they see and hear; that entertainment products should carry sufficient warning for this to be achieved.\n\nUK institutions already go to great lengths to protect the feelings of other religious and secular minorities. Sincere Bible-believing Christians should also be offered this same respect and consideration. We do not think that this is too much to ask in a tolerant society. We are not even asking for such offensive material to be banned as many others do, because we know how futile this would be in light of the abolition of the blasphemy laws, but we only request that we are given simple warning of its presence in recorded purchasable media.",
