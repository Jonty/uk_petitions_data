            "background": "The condition of roads around Huddersfield and the Kirklees Borough are at a completely unacceptable level. We know of no other destination or town as large as Huddersfield that has such poor driving surfaces. This is not only dangerous as proven by damage to wheels, tyres and suspension, but also costs the driver when replacing components that should have an operational life much greater than currently seen. \nSimply plugging pot holes with bit of Tarmac does not suffice and definitely does improve the comfort to any motor vehicle driver or passenger. \n\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? \n\nThis is a question that definitely needs an answer.\n\nPlease fix our roads!",
