            "background": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to take action to encourage credit insurers who have withdrawn or down graded credit limits for UK companies in light of the current economic climate, to restore previous limits.\nCredit insurers are taking policy decisions based upon market sectors to remove or reduce credit limits previously granted, even though these companies may be in a better financial position than when the limit was granted.  The effect of this is to force companies to pay up front for supplies at a time when debtors are stretching payment days and normal funding from banks is more difficult than ever.  Should this continue unchecked, many companies will be forced out of business by these policy decisions. \nD B C I (Death By Credit Insurance)",
