            "background": "I matthew Redmond want to spend a week as Prime Minister of England, \nI believe it's important to give back to society and the country that we belong to. as well as neighboring country's. I believe that young people are the most important agents of change, and it's important in a healthy society for political institutions to have the input of young people,\" \nA healthy society is one where young people are engaged and involved in public policy.\nI proposed formalizing a process by creating a knowledge bank of both procedures and experts whereby other   countries would have resources available to them upon requested. \nWhen you look at the objective measures [like the UN Human Development Index], England always ranks very high. England already has a very successful democratic tradition with good standards of living and accountable institutions ,and other nations can benefit from thier expertise. Already countries like South Africa have looked to England to aid in thier effort to rebuild their own institutions post-Apartheid. Ideally, countries that used my ,our, model would become more stable and economically competitive\nA safer and more prosperous world benefits all of us.",
