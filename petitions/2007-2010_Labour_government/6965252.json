            "background": "The Park School have always operated careful budgeting strategies, even being congratulated as one of the top 30 schools in the country, of similar type schools for this as can be seen on the benchmarking site.  The School is opposed to any balances of end of year carry forwards being withdrawn from our school budget as it is because we have continued to be prudent that we have a carry forward at all. With our careful budgeting it allows us to pursue further projects to increase the quality of education provided at the school.  Why should efficient schools be penalised and why should the inefficent schools be assisted by the good housekeeping of the efficient ones?  \nWhat justification is there for this being considered?\nWe are opposed to this suggestion.",
