            "background": "Like cigarettes and alcohol, having sex under 16 can damage your health.  The legal age is 16 and therefore I would like to petition that contraceptives or the 'abortion pill' should not be given to under 16s without the parent's knowledge and consent.  There should be more media campaigns for abstinence before the age of 16 as part of a healthy living campaign.",
