            "background": "After a dismal summer last year, Britain's worst for many years, I have created this petition to embrace the summer this year with a celebration to break records and embrace Britain positively on a local and national scale.\n\nThe premise is simple, as a nation we enjoy great weather and barbecues. These are indisputable facts. I propose that at the peak of the British summer, local councils, private companies, government bodies - everybody living in Britain embraces the summer wholeheartedly with a barbecue on the same day. The event can be followed by local and national news teams.\n\nThe day can be called 'National Barbecue Day' and larger retail outlets such as Tesco's and ASDA can provide discounted prices on barbecue paraphenalia and food for that one day.\n\nI feel that Britain needs this, it will fuse communities, families and cities together for one day and on a global scale illustrate that Britain is a nation that knows how to enjoy itself.\n\nSign this position for the sake of a happy summer, and many more to come.\n\nYours Sincerely,\nNick Bennett",
