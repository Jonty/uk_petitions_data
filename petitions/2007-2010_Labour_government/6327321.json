            "background": "Removal of centralised HM Treasury jurisdiction over allocation of taxation & a degree of self-autonomy for individuals of how taxation is spent in their area. \n\nA starting figure of 0.5% (increased each year if successful) of an individual's tax to be allocated as they wish. \nSyndicates formed to pay for larger items\n\n\u2022 Tax will be more willingly paid & therefore yield increased \n\n\u2022 People feel they are making a recognizable & realised contribution to where they live \n\n\u2022 Companies / Individuals may structure tax liability to increase locally collected taxes rather than (inter)national taxes to aid their locality. Investment more immediately & business can help to improve areas through this investment. \n\n\u2022 National Treasury can focus on national picture of expenditure to bolster areas where further investment is needed therefore encourage a whole scale sustainable programme.\n\n\u2022 Cost saving on HM Revenue & Customs enforcement if tax if paid willingly\n\n\u2022 People will care more about local elections",
