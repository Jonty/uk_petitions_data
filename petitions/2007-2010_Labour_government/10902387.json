        "background": "I am campaigning for either an increase in weeks on the current 6 weeks allowance (at 90% of average weekly earnings) or an overall increase on SMP for co-habiting couples, married couples or those with  mortgages. Too much focus is given to single parents and the unemployed when couples who are tax and NI payers face a struggle to pay bills whilst on maternity leave. \u00a3117 per week does not match up to today's current cost of living especially in today's economy crisis. Where is the support for the British working family?",
