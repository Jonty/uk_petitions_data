            "background": "Basically lets cut tax on fuel by putting the tax on childrens clothes, cigarettes, cakes and foreign drivers.\n\nObviously not popular with some but its about time parents paid something back for their children running round causing mayhem on the streets.\n\nCigaretts well know one minds them going up in price. \n\nCakes yes nice but bad so kind of good for you in a way to stop eating so many. \n\nFinally foreign drivers come here and pay no road tax or fuel duty if there lucky enough not to fill up here. So tax them as they do us abroad and we can then share the tax burden acrross these groups rather than us motorists for once.",
