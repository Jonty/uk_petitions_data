        "background": "It is known that female teachers can often have gender \"issues\", and tend to compare girls favourably with boys. With new \"psychological\" research they may claim that girls have superior intelligence, almost like Nazi racism. Research about multi-tasking has affected men in the workplace as well. This type of psychological research is propagandist and should be banned as any research done towards racist aims should be banned.",
