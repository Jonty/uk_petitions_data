The mortgage is paid from post-tax income, the interest paid is income for the banks - and the banks are [or should be] taxed on it. \n\nThe people must be able to seek deduction on taxable income = the interest paid on a mortgage annually. Otherwise the same bit of money [our income] gets taxed twice!! \n\nPut money in peoples pockets by fair taxation - not \u00a3\u00a3 to banks to waste.",
