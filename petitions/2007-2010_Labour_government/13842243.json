I dont think the government can expect a body to provide impartial, fact based evidence and then punish it's members for openly stating an opinion contrary to the governments. \n\nWhilst acknowledging the executives right to disagree with said advice, I dont believe you can punish those who disagree with you in such a manner as has happened with Prof Nutt.",
