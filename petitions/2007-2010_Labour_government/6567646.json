            "background": "In remembering the case of a Lancashire couple, who recieved an horrific beating, for the way they were dressed and, in which an innocent young woman lost her life, the Alternative & Gothic community puts forward that the definition of hate crimes should expand to protect subcultural people where the law is concerned.\n\nMost gothic/subcultural people regularly complain of being harrassed, abused, spat on or attacked for the way they look, having done or said nothing to otherwise provoke this. People who prefer \u2018darker\u2019 fashions; who sport facial piercings, alternative makeup or dyed hair regularly experience being singled out on these grounds, by the less tolerant. When this escalates to physical attack and, in this instance, death of an innocent person, it is clearly unnacceptable.\n\nAccording to the home office, the definitions of \u2018Hate Crime\u2019 include race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation and disability. We feel this list should also include: \u201cOn the basis of personal appearance or subculture\u201d.",
