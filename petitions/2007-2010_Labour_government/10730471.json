        "action": "Withdraw the UK from the increasingly dictatorial and undemocratic EU if the present EU inter country warrant is passed.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This warrant will allow dubious countries like Romania and other Eastern European countries as well as the likes of France to extradite anyone from their home country without warning. This is because they will only have to tick a box saying that they have informed the defendant. The fact is that with the usual efficiency of the EU the likelyood is that perfectly innoccent people will find themselves with either the same nane as a criminal or that the foreign police have made a mistake and charged in the wrong name.\n\nWe therefore demand that Gordon Brown and his government take the necessary steps to stop this attack on our liberty and freedom and if necessary withdraw this country from Europe for ever. A move which will save us Billions of our cash for use in this country.",
