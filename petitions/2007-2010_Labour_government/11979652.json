In this time of economic downturn and the resultant increase in unemployment it makes sense to encourage people to set up companies to provide services for which they are particularly qualified and which will provide employment for others of similar or compatable qualifications.  I think specifically of all the trades people put out of work on building sites, who are desparately needed for work in private homes, offices etc.",
