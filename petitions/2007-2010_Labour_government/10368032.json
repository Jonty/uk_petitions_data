            "background": "Any politician should receive the proper funeral rites courtesy of his/her family, friends, admirers etc. They should not be able to draw on tax payers funds to do so. Many tax payers supported Mrs Thatcher by voting for her; even more declined to do so. Like all politicians, to a greater or lesser extent, she was a controversial and divisive figure. To accord her the accolade of a State funeral, with its implied recognition and approval by ALL the country is presumptious, insulting to those who disagreed with her and inaccurate.",
