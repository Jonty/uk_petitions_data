            "background": "It seems very hard for parents in this country to return to work. Childcare is hard to find and source and then fees are extortionate in relation to salaries.\n\nIn some other countries childcare is charged at \u00a33.50 per day where as in this country it can be as much as \u00a31000 per month! \n\nWe would like the Prime Minister to reduce the running costs of childcare providers and help pay salaries of staff. \n\nThere are too many people in this country that simply cannot afford to return to work so have to take the route of being unemployed and claiming benefits - we want this changed. \n\nLower childcare costs WILL equal lower unemployment and fewer excuses!",
