            "background": "British interests are not best served by being in the EU and the British electorate should have regular and decisive measures to determine whether Britain should stay in the EU. Since our entry in 1973, the world has changed, poverty and social exclusion, divided societies and a rise in nationalist politics and existentialism make the long term viability of the EU unsustainable. Denied the opportunity about whether Britain join or not join the EU in the referendum of 1975 (on the grounds of age), I want to encourage domestic politics to be just that and encourage a shift of emphasis away from europe towards nation state issues.",
