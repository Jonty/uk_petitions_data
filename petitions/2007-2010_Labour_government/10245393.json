Climate change threatens drought, flood, and storm. \n\nEnergy, communication (such as telephones) and public transport will be vital in the post-peak-oil, climate-changed world we will soon live in, where massive floods, storms, drought, food shortages and national energy crises are a daily occurrence. \n\nAs a matter of National Security, the Railways, Buses and other Public Transport systems, Telephones/Internet access, Energy and Water companies must be returned to public ownership, receiving massively increased Public Investment; to be run for the benefit of the People, not for Profit, thus increasing Efficiency and Value for Money; and so that they may be called upon instantly and efficiently as a United Network in the event of National Emergency.",
