        "background": "Dark days are ahead. Ever-increasing oil prices place British life more and more at the whim of unfriendly overseas governments and international market speculators. Climate change threatens drought, flood, and storm. \n\nEnergy, communication (such as telephones) and public transport will be vital in the post-peak-oil, climate-changed world we will soon live in, where massive floods, storms, drought, food shortages and national energy crises are a daily occurrence. \n\nAs a matter of National Security, the Railways, Buses and other Public Transport systems, Telephones/Internet access, Energy and Water companies must be returned to public ownership, receiving massively increased Public Investment; to be run for the benefit of the People, not for Profit, thus increasing Efficiency and Value for Money; and so that they may be called upon instantly and efficiently as a United Network in the event of National Emergency.",
