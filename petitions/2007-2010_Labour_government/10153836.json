        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Senders of unsolicited mail - junk mail, to you and me; marketing campaigns to the sender - should have to supply either a reply-paid envelope, and a slip with your address details, or a freephone number and a clear reference number for the recipient to quote, in all correspondence, so that you can - at no expense to yourself - request that your contacts details are removed from their mailing list.\n\nThey have to cease all mail to that address within 28days of receipt of that instruction.\n\nThis should probably only apply to companies that send out more than 10,000 mails per month, so that small companies  do not have to cover the costs of providing a freephone number etc \n\nThis will save resources for the company involved, as they will not continually be sending mail to people who do not wish to receive it. This saves on both printing - and delivery of printed materials - postal costs, and as such is less wasteful of environmentally sensitive resources.",
