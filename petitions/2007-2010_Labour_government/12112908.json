        "background": "I would like the Prime Minister to allow for insulin dependant diabetics to drive LGV / HGV.  If an insulin dependant diabetic has good control of his or her blood sugar levels and has good hypo awareness, there is no reason why they should be discriminated against driving HGV / LGV vehicles.  This is also preventing them undertaking jobs such as firefighter / ambulance paramedics etc. and it is unfair.  I do understand that if a diabetic is unable to control his or her blood sugar levels or has low or zero hypo awareness then they should not be able to drive any vehicle, however it is unjust to declare all diabetics unsuitable for these types of vehicles.",
