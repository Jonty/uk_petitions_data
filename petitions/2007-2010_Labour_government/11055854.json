            "background": "It's hard to believe in this country today, many children are still living in poverty, and being abused and murdered by the very people meant to protect them. It is also obvious that too many people view becoming a parent as a gravy train, a meal ticket, and a means of aquiring a house.\nThe welfare of their child is, at best, secondary, at worst, a hindrance, to the parents' own needs for material posessions / cigarettes / alcohol / drugs.\nThe incentive to bring the child into the world is not based upon love, so subsequently the child will not be loved. We need to remove this cash incentive, but still retain the facility to provide for the child.\nChild Benefit's should benefit the children, not the parent(s).",
