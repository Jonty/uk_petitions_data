            "background": "The John Taylor Bell Foundry prospered and is reported to have been at one time the largest bell foundry in the world. Here were cast bells for St Paul's Cathedral, London, including in 1881 'Great Paul', the largest bell in the former British Empire and the largest properly rung bell in the world. Bells and carillons have been exported from this foundry to all parts of the former Empire, USA, and Holland. It is one of the two operational bell foundries remaining in the country.\n\nMy request is for the prime minister to oppose the building proposals that want to demolish the great heritage that loughborough has, in replace for new housing establishments in an already overcrowded area.  Instead we would like to see the present government acknowledge one of the greatest businesses worldwide and give backing to  a project to perserve this historical asset Loughborough is so proud to have.",
