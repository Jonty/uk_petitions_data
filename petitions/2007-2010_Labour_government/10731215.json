        "background": "I am sick and fed up of this country sending our armed forces around the globe, to fight ever increasingly difficult capaigns, and then badly treating them whenever they are back in the UK. This is not just the recent apalling treatement of a soldier at a hotel. It is also the lack of proper R&R, the lack of proper equipment, the lack of proper housing, the continued interference of politicians in the running of the military, and our ever increasing tolerance of minority groups who continually seek to destabilise the fabric of our society. I am appalled at this and it is now time for all decent upstanding people of this once great country to tell our government, in the strongest possible terms, that this must stop. Having served myself in the RN I know how proud and patriotic the vast majority of military personnel are and I cannot begin to understand how let down they must feel, by the very country they serve with great pride. If you feel the same way, please register this by signing this petition to help reverse this unacceptable discrimination. Thank you",
