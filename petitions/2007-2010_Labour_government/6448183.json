        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I realise that in this day & age being a housewife/husband is unfortunately a dying breed. Having chosen to been a housewife & mother to bring up my children at home, I am quite aware of what a 'non-person' I seem to be in society around & especially as far as financial help from the State is concerned. Obviously in my position my income is NIL, BUT if I was in paid work of a few hours a week, I would be able to claim financial support for low income, free prescriptions & other benefits. Why should my husband have to pay out for my prescription charges as well as his own? We have gone without & made many sacrifices so that I can be at home for our family, but it seems this government gives no thought for those of us who are trying to keep our family unit together in this way - we are a forgotten minority. Why is there help for those who earn SOME money, but NO HELP for those who earn NOTHING? We don't sit at home all day drinking coffee with our feet up you know - we are actually WORKING for our family. Please consider our appeal & act. Thank you.",
