At a time when people in Burnley and the country in general are struggling due to the recession through job losses, reduced hours and struggling to make enough money to pay the bills, it is simply not right that an MP can justify claiming an extra \u00a340,000 for a second home in London for \"improvements\" when the average person in Burnley will struggle to earn half of this figure in a year through their job. Please support this petition to remove MP Kitty Ussher from her position as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and to ask for her resignation as an MP for Burnley",
