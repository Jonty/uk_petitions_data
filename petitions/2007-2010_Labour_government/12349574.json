            "background": "As a result of misleading information in the media most people are unaware that RIPA works in concert with Section 8 of the Human RIghts Act to restrict and control the use of pre-existing enforcement powers and techniques that were in use before the HRA blocked them.  If RIPA is simply withdrawn from Local Authorities enforcement officers will no longer be able to carry out their duties as the methods they had available before the implementation of the HRA will not be available to them.\n\nIn some cases, for example test purchases to detect underage sales of alcohol, the power is written into the Act and does not therefore require RIPA authorisation. Specific limited enforcement powers should be written into all legislation so that public expectations of enforcement may be met.",
