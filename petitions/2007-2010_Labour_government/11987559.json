        "background": "With the fact that we have reached (or will shortly reach) Peak Oil production, and the inevitable problems that are going to become apparent to any industrialised society as global oil prices soar, demand far outstrips supply and climate change begins to bite it is imperative that we now take positive action to look into alternative ways of living that are sustainable, low impact on the land and low emission based. \n\nIt is with this in mind that small communities of forward thinkers have already started to 'live with the land' in eco communities such as Tinkers Bubble, King's Wood and the Lammas Project, yet the efforts of these pioneers (and others who would like to join them in other sustainable low impact developments throughout the UK) are hampered by outdated planning regulations that were designed for another age but are being used by local authorities to stop innovation!",
