            "background": "The Chancellor proposes to increase the tax on petrol on 1st October. We already pay the highest price for our fuel in Europe. This government seems intent on taxing everyone out of this Country. If that happens who would be left to vote for them. If you are going to call an Election Mr.Brown an increase in petrol tax will be a vote loser for sure.",
