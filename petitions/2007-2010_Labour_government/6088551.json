        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There are a number of paedophiles in our prisons who refuse help of rehabilitation, if they were abused as children and do these acts of sickness because of this then they would welcome any kind of help, and some do. However, there are some who refuse help and cannot wait to get out and continue their obscene offenses - I propose we use these people to test out life saving dugs, they have no more a sacred life than a guinea pig or rabbit and they gave up their rights to be 'human' when they committed their horrible crimes. This research should be carried out on any heinous criminal without a conscience, who show no remorse of what they have done; rapists, murderers, muggers who kill or main - there are plenty of research fodder in our prisons who could actually be useful to us. But please take note - I am not proposing this for all prison inmates, just the ones who are deemed 'evil'.",
