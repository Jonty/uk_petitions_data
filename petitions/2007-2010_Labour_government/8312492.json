            "background": "I am asking for a petition to be set up for free bus and train travel to all disabled and pensioners and also all disabled people to get the same benefits as pensioners i.e the winter fuel payment, cold weather payments etc. it is wrong as the disabled people like myself who can not get dla etc to have to suffer on the pathetic money we are given to live on per week, I ask you do you think Gordon Brown could live on 80.00 pounds a week for bills and food and travel etc? no off course he couldnt Thats why I am asking people to sighn this petition as of last year I had a bus pass now I cant even get out basically as of the cost of the bus fares etc plus I also have to pay out extra money to also get my son from his mother which costs me an extra 40.00 odd pounds a month before bus fares so please support my petition to end this outrage of a totally selfish powerless government who are doing nothing to help this country but are just making it a whole lot worse for the lower class of forgotten people.",
