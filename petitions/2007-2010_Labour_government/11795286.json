            "background": "Grey squirrels were introduced by us to the UK over a hundred years ago and are now well established.  However, they are blamed by some as one of the causes for declining red squirrel populations as they can out-compete them in many habitats and can carry the squirrel pox virus which can be lethal for red squirrels.\n\nThe Scottish Wildlife Trust and Scottish Natural Heritage are now preparing to launch a joint campaign aimed at preserving red squirrel populations, primarily through a cull of grey squirrels.\n\nThey intend to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds killing thousands of grey squirrels over the next few years, in an attempt to conserve red squirrel populations. \n\nMost of the grey squirrels will be trapped and either shot or struck on the head with a blunt instrument.  Many animal welfare groups argue that this is unethical and unlikely to be effective in the long term.  Habitat management and developing a vaccine to the squirrel pox virus are the most viable means of cherishing ALL our squirrels, red and grey, for generations to come.",
