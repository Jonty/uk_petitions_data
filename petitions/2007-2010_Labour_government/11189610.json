            "background": "With living costs at an all time high, new fathers need full pay whilst on Paternity leave to support their partners and child/ren. The current SPP of \u00a3117 a week is NOT ENOUGH. A recent research study showed that less than half of all fathers of children under 16 years did not take paternity leave due to the lack of financial support. However, out of those fathers questioned, almost 90% agreed that if they were offered nearly full pay they would take paternity leave, instead of having to use annual leave. The goverment claim that they want fathers to take advantage of the current Paternity rights. How can fathers take advantage of it, when they can't afford to use it?? Support his petition if you believe that fathers should be entitled to fairer and better Paternity pay.",
