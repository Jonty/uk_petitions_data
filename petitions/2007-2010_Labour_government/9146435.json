        "background": "Meeting persons with other faiths, and more, is one thing, meeting a \u2018living God\u2019 or \u2018Gods\u2019 is indeed an another. This country does not consider the Head-of-State of Japan as a living God, neither does he himself anyway either. The Dalai Lama Himself, however, does so and has always done so. It is very doubtful indeed for any act of association with Him, without even being unconstitutional, for a person with his own personal official, political, legal, national, constitutional and personal private responsibilities, being Christian and all that. \u201cThe \u2018Soul\u2019 \u201d, remember? It is not as if He had to be met like some legitimate heads-of-states or -of-Governments, which He is not and has never ever been anyway. Surely that the (British) PM need not be troubled, due to importance or else, if even his counterpart His host His and the receiving Indian PM has not yet been so, well, not yet in this year anyway.",
