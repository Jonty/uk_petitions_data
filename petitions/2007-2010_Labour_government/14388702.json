            "background": "Royal Mail delivery personnel discard millions of elastic bands on the streets of Britain each year, sometimes wilfully. This shows a blatant disregard for littering laws and poses a real threat to wildlife and pets. Royal Mail say they ask their staff not to drop them and that the bands are re-used but the reality is the objects are so cheap and plentiful that they do not enforce this. They should be forced to stop using the bands altogether as this is the only way to prevent the problem. An alternative method of separating mail in mailbags should be researched and funded.",
