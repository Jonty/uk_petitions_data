            "background": "Mr Prime Minister,\nI feel it is your responsibility as a member of the G8, to propose at this upcoming meeting in Japan in July, for some form of Global Policing + Control of the price of oil.\nOPEC states, there is no shortage of oil, The demand does not warrent an increase in production, although they have compensated for problems in Nigerian production. They say it is the speculators are to blame, by stockpiling.\nG.W. Bush, could have shown iniciative at previous G8 meetings to instigate such a move as I now propose, but as American Politics is currently in somewhat of a limbo because of Presedential Elections,makes it an ideal opportunity for you to make this a priority at the next G8 meeting.\nMr Prime Minister without this the Global consequences could be dire. \n\n\"OIL IS LIKE TERRORISM IT HAS NO BORDERS WHEN IT COMES TO PRICE, THE SPECULATORS ARE BECOMING VERY RICH AT THE EXPENSE OF GLOBAL FOOD SHORTAGE, AND BASIC HUMAN NEEDS\"",
