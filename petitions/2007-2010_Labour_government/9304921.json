            "background": "When people work they are taxed separately but when they apply for benefits they are treated as a couple.  If the Chancellor and Mr Brown are looking for ways to help the pensioner then a transferring of allowances would certainly help those who have a wife who only received the married woman's pension due to Government bad advice area about 50 years and more ago and /or very small pensions as they could transfer the remains of their allowance to their husbands and thus ease the pension burden for them as a couple.  This would particularly help those who are only just over the pension tax credit threshold and therefore pay full Council tax etc and would no doubt be very popular.",
