National Rail deem it reasonable to charge a 16 year old an adult train fare, vene though they're most probably still studying for their GCSEs. Arriva deem it reasonable to charge a 16 year old an adult bus fair. \n\nI do not deem this reasonable, I am currently studying towards my A Levels, I am 16 and I pay \u00a343 a month just to get to and from my school which is only 3 miles away! We need to change this! It is ridiculous.",
