This library, though not vey big, serves as a good reference library for some of us in Edmonton. It is also a study place for those who cannot go to the library at Edmonton Green. In addiion, it is not as \"busy\" as Edmonton Green library, therefore provides an ambience for serious study. It equally has facilities that evey library has especiallly for our kids when they are on holidays.",
