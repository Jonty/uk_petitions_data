        "background": "The current (27/11/07) single fare on East Yorkshire Motor Services (EYMS) buses is \u00a33.75 from Pocklington to York. For a 17 year old unemplyed A Level student this is too expensive. Surely people in full time education should be able to buy half fares? It is clear to me that if you are in full-time education you obviously cannot work for enough hours to have the same disposible income as someone in full-time employment, so why should you have to pay the same fare?",
