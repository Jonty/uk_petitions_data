            "background": "Many employers are currently deciding whether to cut working hours (retaining employees) or simply lose employees altogether.  When skilled employees are lost the company is unable to take advantage of a subsequent upturn in the economy and some skills may be permanently lost to the country.  Other EU countries (e.g. Germany) support employees on short-time working for periods of up to 18 months.  Our Government should do the same for us.",
