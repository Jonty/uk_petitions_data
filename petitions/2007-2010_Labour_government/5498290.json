It would benefit all people concerned to pull out of Iraq for the fact we occupy Iraq radicalizes people as demonstrated in the Iraqi style terrorist attacks on the country recently. It has now become a threat to national security to remain in Iraq and we must pull out soon. End the Bloodshed, this is your people, those you are here to serve, speaking, prompting you to act, please, end the bloodshed.",
