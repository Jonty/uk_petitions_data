            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Combined Cadet force units currently have to make do with the outmoded L98A1 rifle which is prone to mechanical failure (i.e. cocking handle falling off, rifle failing to cock, stoppages), some of which were associated with the L85A1 (on which the L98A1 is based) and some specific to the cadet rifle.  The '98A2 would eliminate many of these problems, both those ironed out with the L85A2; and also on the removal of the cumbersome large cocking handle.  Furthermore, any reliability issue with a firearm can lead to safety issues and therefore a new rifle is urgently required.",
