            "background": "Muslims who want to live under Islamic  law were told to get out of BRITAIN. IMMIGRANTS MUST ADAPT.I am tired of us worrying about whether we are offending some individuals. Our culture has been developed over two centuries. We speak ENGLISH not Arabic, Chinese, or any other language. Therefore,if you wish to become part of our society Learn the language! \nMost British people believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian people, on Christian principles, founded this nation. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as home because God is part of our culture. We will accept your beliefs and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours and live in harmony with us. This is OUR COUNTRY OUR LAND and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining and griping about Our Flag,Our Pledge,Our Christian beliefs,or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great British freedom, THE RIGHT TO LEAVE\nIf you aren't happy here then LEAVE.",
