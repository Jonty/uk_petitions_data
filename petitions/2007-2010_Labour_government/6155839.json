            "background": "It is reported in various media outlets ( press and online) that although the e-petition site was created by the PM's office the PM does not actually check on a weekly basis about the progress and contents of the e-petitions submitted ,even the more successful ones e.g is he aware that one of the top petitions at the moment is the one requesting a referendum on the EU \"Reform\" treaty. I am sure that this claim must be wrong since the PM who has demonstrated his belief in the British people would be very interested in how they express their worries but I would like reassurance that whatever the media say a few minutes are put aside every week by the PM to study what the people think of the Governments policies and claims.",
