In most towns, there is a local youth forum which can deal with many problems. \n\nAbove this is the youth council for the local authority, made up of people from all parts of the area, who help to improves the lives of young people and survey the opinions of people in the area.\n\nAbove these people are the members of the Scottish Youth Parliament, who, like members of the House of Commons, can bring up the problems of their constituents and participate in national debate.\n\nHaving this system in every local authority would greatly improve the lives of young people throughout Britain, and help the government work with young people to support them.",
