        "background": "More and more companies are depriving the public the opportunity of contacting them any other way than via a high cost revenue generating telephone number.  The people of the UK are already paying over the odds for most things, compared to other countries in the EU, and therefore we MUST have the opportunity to communicate with these providers without being forced to pay exhorbitant fees for it. SKY television is a prime candidate, with whom it is impossible to communicate through the postal service BECAUSE NONE OF THEIR LETTERS HAVE A USABLE POSTAL OR EMAIL ADDRESS ON THEM.",
