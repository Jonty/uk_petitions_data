        "background": "New plans to force all schools to teach sex education will allow faith schools to educate pupils in line with their religious beliefs.\n\nThis will allow schools to tell pupils that homosexuality, sex outside marriage or using contraception is wrong.\n\nThe plans, will require schools to teach sex education from the age of five.\n\nHowever, a get-out clause for faith schools will allow them to present sex education \"in line with the context, values and ethos\" of the schools.\n\nThe government-commissioned review was authored by Sir Alasdair Macdonald, headteacher of Morpeth School in east London.\n\nIt concludes that schools will be legally obliged to teach pupils about health and nutrition, safety, drugs and alcohol and sex education.",
