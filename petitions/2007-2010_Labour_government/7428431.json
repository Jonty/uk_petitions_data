When arriving into the job (which he was not elected to do by the British people & without an Leadership campaign) he promised \"Let the work of change begin\". Whilst this hapless bunch have delivered change it is not one of a positive course. Since June we have seen the following:-\n\nA run on a bank.\nLow morale for our troops due to poor housing and inadequate equipment.\nHalf of the populations personal details \"mislaid\".\nUnlawful donations to the Labour party.\nNo referendum on Europe as promised in the manifesto.\n\nI believe this is no way that a government should behave, let alone one that insists on exporting democracy to other parts of the world - and it must be challenged by the British electorate with a vote of no confidence.",
