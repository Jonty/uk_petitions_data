            "background": "By limiting the number of homes a landlord can own would release a vast number of properties available to the open market throughout the UK.  The availability and subsequent purchse of these properties would then benefit of showing the real number of properties required to be built as \"affordable housing\" instead of the governments present reaction to the ongoing affordable housing situation which is to tell councils that they have to make more land available for this project.  \nThe next matter concerning this issue is why do individual council \"planning departments\" hold such power over what can only be described as a NATIONAL housing issue?.\nWe have to as a whole country make a stand over the number of properties that are available to purchase instead of standing empty and being available for rent long term for which the monthly rent cost only lines someone elses pocket instead of benefiting the country as a whole - come on help sort out the present housing issues for everyone's benefit as well as our environment.",
