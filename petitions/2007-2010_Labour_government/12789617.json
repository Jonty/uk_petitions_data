It would also lead to power in the hands of extremist mnority parties eg BNP.\n\nThe recent expense debacle has nothing to do with the \"first past the post system\". It is up to the ruling party to manage the public servants and implement effective systems to manage expenses.\n\nEuropean systems of Proportional representation do not give the same degree of accountability as UK systems. The current system along with a free press (also essential) has led to the expense scandal being uncovered and it will now be dealt with.",
