        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Local authorities with poor plastic recycling records frequently blame the difficulties caused by identifying & sorting the immense variety of plastics used in packaging. Total standardisation would solve the problem and make recycling cost effective. If supermarkets handled the returns with their empty lorries to depot: even more savings. Milk containers are standard, why not yoghurt pots, meat trays, margerine/butter containers, cosmetic containers (and lids)?",
