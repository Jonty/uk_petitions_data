            "background": "The dangerous dogs act appears to be only focusing on certain breeds. This is disgusting, after watching a documentary on television I was in tears watching owners be parted from their loving family pets just because they 'looked like' a banned breed. I impose that the act should be changed. If a dog shows it is Dangerous then put it down regardless of the breed, quit wasting our tax money on holding dogs that are not a threat and give them back to their owners!! The program showed that an expert in dog breeds confirmed someones dog did not have pitbull in him, and his behaviour test went through with flying colours as he was soft as you could get, yet you still chose to put him down! DISGUSTING HOW YOU PEOPLE THINK THIS IS FAIR!!",
