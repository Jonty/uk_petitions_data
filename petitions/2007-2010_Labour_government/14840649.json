In England, White \u2018Irish\u2019 and \u2018Gypsy or Irish Traveller\u2019 will have separate tick boxes, but not \u2018White English\u2019.  The numbers recording their ethnic identity as \u2018English\u2019 in the \u2018White Other\u2019 group will not be published. in the 2011 Census outputs.  \n\nIn Dec 2008, the current arrangements were placed before Parliament in a White Paper by a Cabinet Minister of Irish ethnicity and endorsed by a British government headed by a Scottish Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The result is racial discrimination on a national scale.  \n\nThe stated purpose for such information is to \u201cenable national and local government and health authorities to allocate resources and plan programmes\u201d, thus no particular account will be taken of the special needs of ethnic English, who will be disadvantaged in establishing their legal rights not to be discriminated against.",
