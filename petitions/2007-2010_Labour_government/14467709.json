            "background": "Council tax is something that we are all burdened with within our households and know that it is necessary to keep local public services operating, but this does not justify excessive annual increases such as double or treble inflation rises. \n\nI propose that the council tax system is aligned with the average current inflation rate which is around 2% and savings should be achieved by the council in terms of greater efficiency to make better use of existing revenue, rather than cutting public services such as Willenhall Baths, which Walsall Council want to close and charge residents 3.8% more for their council tax. \n\nThis should be combined with key performance indicators such as provision of public services, business support and success and the overall quality of life of residents including how clean the area is overall, whether they benefit from local public services and whether the perception of value for money is seen by all households through continued assessment.\n\nIf the KPI's are met by the council, then increases should be granted to inflationary level.",
