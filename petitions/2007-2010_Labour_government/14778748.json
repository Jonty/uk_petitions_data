        "background": "In the current financial climate, people want to hold on to their money - especially young people. These days, if you need money quickly, you go to an ATM and select the smallest denomination possible, \u00a310, despite only wanting to spend a few pounds. By dispensing \u00a35 notes, this would reduce the amount of change carried by young people and therefore the amount they could lose if they were mugged. By dispensing \u00a35 notes, banks would be encouraging responsible spending - by only giving out what people need.",
