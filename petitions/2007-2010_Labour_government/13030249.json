Recent evidence has shown that the increased use of sun beds by children is damaging their skin and could lead to skin cancers in the future. Skin Cancer is now the most common form of cancer in the UK; more than 1500 people die from it every year and that is increasing by 10% every year. It is not unknown for children as young as 8 years old to be badly burned by use of sun beds. It is grossly negligent of the government not to introduce the same ban that applies in Scotland to the rest of the UK.",
