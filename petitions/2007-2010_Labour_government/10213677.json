            "action": "order the amendment of section 4.4 of the Civil Service Management Code so as to remove any restrictions on civil servants taking part in political activities in their own time.  This will get rid of the ridiculous anomaly whereby those employed by the Civil Service who are clearly motivated by the public service ethos, who will understand public administration and government, be technical specialists in key areas of  modern society, and who are the diligent, honest and hardworking members of our Rolls Royce of a Civil Service are precisely the type of people who should be standing for political office, but at present face a complete ban if they wish to retain their employment.  This single and simple reform might well transform the quality of candidates for political office, the level of political debate and the competence of our elected politicians.",
