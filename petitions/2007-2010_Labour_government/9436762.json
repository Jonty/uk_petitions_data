        "background": "Over the last few years, services at Buckland Hospital, Dover have been moved to Ashford or Margate, leaving Dover with a suggested poly clinic. As a major port and town, this is not good enough. Transport to the acute hospitals is difficult, time-consuming and expensive, especially when ill or in severe pain and needing outpatient treatment. Without a car, it takes 2-3 hours plus. Dovorians have a right to a good local health service.",
