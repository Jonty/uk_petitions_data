            "background": "Children have now lost respect for the police and other forms of authority. The only way we can deter youths from commiting crime is by creating prisons where they are not allowed games, TV and other so called luxuries. Prison is a place where you go when you do wrong and this should be reflected in the surroundings and the way they are treated. If you commit a crime you should automatically forfeit your \"human rights\". After all they did not consider their victims rights, did they? Also, there are parents who evidentally see what their children do and cannot or will not try to control them. We should be reinforcing parents responsibilities by law and they should be punished for not \"doing their job\". They were responsible enough to be having sex and they should be made to live up to the consequences.",
