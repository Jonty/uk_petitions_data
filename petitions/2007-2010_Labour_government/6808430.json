            "background": "The measures announced in the pre-Budget Report abolishing Taper Relief on Captial Gains Tax will have a big negative impact on hundreds of thousands of true entrepreneurs taking risks and running their own businesses; on thousands of small investors in AIM companies and on tens of thousands of employees investing in company share schemes.  The government should re-consider this measure by introducing transitional relief so that these many thousands of people do not lose out after making decisions over the past few years on the (false)understanding that the Government were encouraging enterprise.",
