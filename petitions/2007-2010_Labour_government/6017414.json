Many restaurants receive zero stars with problems such as \"poor hygiene conditions\" and \"major non-compliance with food legislation\". \n\nAt the moment, display of the star rating is not compulsory and as a result, many people are eating at places where the food could be potentially unsafe without knowing.\n\nThe hygiene certificate should be on display in the restaurant/shop/caf\u00e9/pub in clear view so that people can make an informed decision about where to eat.",
