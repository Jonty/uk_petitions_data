            "background": "I am getting fed up with big money spending clubs poaching young talent from smaller clubs. People argue why the England national team is so poor at the moment, and surely this is one of the biggest problems. Kids are not getting enough experience in the game, before they are moving to big clubs and then never play a competitive game. We have got to find a way of putting a limit on the age or experience a player has before they can move on. I want to get enough names to send to the FA and once and for all get this matter sorted.",
