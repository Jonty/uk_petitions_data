            "background": "I have raynaud's quite bad, which means without medication my feet and legs go black with cold. After living in fuel poverty for 3 yrs now my hands are affected. This means on bad days I have trouble walking, reading, writing and using a computer. The only way to do my shopping is online. Due to the fact that I make sure that I walk even on bad days I am not able to get help with benefits. This is because I am under 60 making me too young and my sons are not school age or younger, so too old. People with Raynaud's should get this help, we are entitled to it.",
