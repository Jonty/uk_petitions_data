            "background": "My son has a wheelchair and is unable to propell himself. Both my husband and I are tall and find his wheelchair handles too short at times causing back ache. We were told if we wanted adjustible handles it would cost an extra \u00a3200! However we look after our disabled son 24 hours a day and I am sure it would cost a lot more if he was in restbite care because we were infirm. We have spoken to loads of carers who say adjustible handles would be a godsend! I am sure if you made them as the same principle on say adjustible crutches or similar it would cost a lot less. Surely in the long run it pays the government to keep all its carers as fit as possible and I emplore Mr Brown to consider this",
