            "background": "I believe that any places of worship should now be built as multi-faith centres and not just for one religion to support the diverse cultures in this country. \n\nAs land is in short supply now and very expensive I think it would be justified to build one building to cater for all faiths and communities.\n\nInstead of having separate places of worship, people will meet from all faiths and practises. This will provide an opportunity for people from all backgrounds and faiths to meet and understand each others religions.\n\nRecently there was a story about a mosque application in Torquay for a very small group of muslims. To make the project of building a place of worship more viable, build a place of worship for all.\n\nWe need to have places of worship for all, not just one or two religions who have the loudest voice.",
