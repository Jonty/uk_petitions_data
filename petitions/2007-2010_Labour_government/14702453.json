            "background": "The hypocrisy of tuition fee hikes must stop. Those that are arguing for larger fees and that are in power paid no fees themselves, and even received grants. Until their fees have been reclaimed there should be no increase in fees for current students.\n\nThe reasoning is obvious. It will help out the goverment debt crisis. It will stop the hypocrisy of a generation who received free education increasing fees. It will help out people under 25 in a time of high youth unemployment.\n\nInterest should be retrospectively applied under the same rules as the current student loans.\n\nPractically this could work through the student loan scheme, with the same rules applying. No amount will be paid until the worker is earning over \u00a315,000, and then 9% above that threshold.\n\nIt would also apply to students who paid less than the current rate. Their loans would be 'topped up'. As well as the payment of fees, the repayment of grants would also happen under this scheme.",
