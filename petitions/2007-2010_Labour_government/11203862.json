            "background": "The EU are proposing drastic changes to RSA by seeking to implement changes that will have devastating effects for already struggling & deprived coastal communities by placing major restrictions on Sea Angling. If allowed to happen, this will have a grave negative financial impact on the communities that depend on income generated from visiting anglers for their survival.\n\nMany jobs will be affected by the implementation of Article 47 of the proposal which seeks to treat low impact recreational fishing in the same manner as high impact commercial fisheries. Hotels, Caf\u00e9s, Bars, Fuel Stations, Charter Vessel Operators, Local Shops all depend on income brought to coastal communities from visiting anglers which they can't afford to lose.\n\nThe EU paper fails to show any perceived negative impact that RSA cause to our fisheries and also fails to note the positive impact they have on small communities which will suffer as a result of implementation. \n\nPlease support your local communities & RSA.",
