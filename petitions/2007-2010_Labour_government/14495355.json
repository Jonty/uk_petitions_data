            "background": "So many companies and brands who sell in the UK exploit their workers to make greater profits.\nA lot of the time, this happens in developing countries around the world. Without decent pay for workers, how can we ever expect to break the poverty cycle? \nDecent pay would help people help themselves.\nFair Trade should not be an option, it should be law.\nI know also that just changing this in the UK will not end poverty and exploitation completely, but it will be a start, so please sign so we can try and end poverty once and for all.",
