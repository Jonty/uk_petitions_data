            "background": "The Government has already introduced detention without trial and given police the right to hold protestors overnight without having to discuss their reasons for doing so. Now it wishes to introduce the concept of \"presumed consent\" in regard to organ donations. I think we all would agree that the more organ donors the better, however, this is not the way to go about it.\n\n\"Presumed consent\" is a concept full of holes. I wonder if I decided to let myself in Mr Brown's back door and borrow his belongings on the presumption of consent whether he would be happy to oblige? Equally the paperwork required - as with students claiming back initial taxation - to remove onself from the register will doubtless be very much devised in such a way as to sap the will of anyone wishing to do so.\n\nA democracy is about people having the right to make their own decisions, especially where their own bodies and minds are concerned. For anyone who wishes to still retain the right to make their own decisions I would ask that you  sign this petition.",
