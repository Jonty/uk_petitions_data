        "background": "This is a recognised problem by many of the general populas within the uk. That \"2nd home\" homeowners and people who buy \"to-let\" homes are creating a situation where the average person is unable to purchase a home due to being out priced from the market. whilst this is probably good for the economy of the country in the short term, increasing goverment revenue's. In the long term it is increasing the rich poor divide in the country, hindering the quality of life of the average young adult in the country.",
