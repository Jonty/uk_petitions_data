On 11 May he abused his position in the chair to criticise MPs who had spoken out against the abuse, and has therefore lost the confidence of many of the general public.\n\nThe Speaker is elected by the Commons, not by the government, but the government controls the allocation of Parliamentary time. It is therefore within the Prime Minister's power to allocate time for a debate on Michael Martin's future as Speaker",
