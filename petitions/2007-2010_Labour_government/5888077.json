        "action": "bring the UK into line with other EU countries and allow passengers to pass through airport security with more than one item of hand baggage.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There has never been an explanation as to why passengers should be restricted to one item of carry on baggage. If your flight is cancelled at Heathrow and your airline is fully booked for the rest of the day, you will be forced to reclaim your baggage and check in with a substitute airline. This means passing through security again but with bottles, cosmetics etc acquired in departures whilst waiting for cancelled flight. This a nightmare especially as the security staff appear to be poorly managed and devoid of initiative.",
