        "background": "The proposed Communications Data Bill poses the biggest threat to Civil\nLiberties and Democracy in our day. We must not allow this bill must to be pushed through under the blanket of \"Anti-Terrorism.\"\nThe fundamental flaw with this Bill is there is no guarantee that future governments will be benign. Once in place, powers such as these will be hard to revoke short of revolution. Imagine such a database in the hands of the Stasi! It will give Government access to detailed personal information about its citizens to which it has no right. We've all heard Lord Acton's quote, \"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\". It is a regrettable but undeniable aspect of human nature.\nIn order to safeguard the freedom of future generations the British people must unite to stop this Bill.",
