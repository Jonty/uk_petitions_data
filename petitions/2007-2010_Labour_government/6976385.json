            "background": "I truely believe that all unsociable and unacceptable behaviour in children stems from bullying, be it that the child is a bully (from peer pressure) or being bullied; in schools, neighbourhoods and their own family homes.  We can try and break this cycle by the government putting more into funding primary schools to give extensive awarness of bullying and what it can lead to, where the child is only just developing a personality and learning right from wrong.  Of course families play a huge part in their children's personal development too but so many nowadays just don't care.  So let's give these kids a chance by schools emphasising more on morals and behaviour",
