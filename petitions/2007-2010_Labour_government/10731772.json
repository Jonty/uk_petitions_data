            "action": "make it a criminal offence to purchase, or seek to purchase, the sexual services of another person; to remove from statute the criminal offence of loitering or soliciting in a public place for purposes of prostitution, and all other offences which criminalise people who are prostituted; to develop a national strategy for establishing and funding local services to assist people to leave prostitution, in consultation with voluntary organisations currently providing such services (while retaining harm minimisation services for those remaining in prostitution); and to initiate national public education campaigns about the exploitation and harm involved in prostitution.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many women first become involved in prostitution as young teenagers and the use of violence is common in recruiting women and children into prostitution. Trafficking women for sexual exploitation is now one of the most profitable forms of organised crime.\n\nBecause of the profits to be made from controlling prostitution, it will continue as long as there is a demand for it. The only effective way to prevent the abuses involved in prostitution is therefore to target demand. Swedish legislation criminalising the purchase of sexual services, and providing support services for those wishing to exit prostitution, has led to an estimated 30-50% reduction of the numbers of women in prostitution in Sweden since its introduction in 1999 and to a significant decrease in trafficking of women into Sweden. \n\nThe Swedish legislation was accompanied by public education campaigns about the nature of prostitution. Polls indicate that over 80% of the Swedish population now support this legislation.",
