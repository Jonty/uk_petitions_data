            "background": "When the government two years ago decided to relax drinking hours and allow pubs to open 24/7, it claimed it would improve matters by avoiding people drinking to excess in the hour or so before closing time. A 'Daily Telegraph' investigation, published on 23 February 2008, using the Freedom of Information Act, found that alcohol-related anti-social incidents, amounting to criminal offences, had increased by around 180,000 a year since the law was changed. In addition, it has been revealed that A&E Departments deal with over one million alcohol-related incidents a year. As a first step to reducing drunkenness and alcoholism in our society, 24/7 drinking should be ended and pubs should normally close at 11.00pm.",
