        "background": "1) Take wind-chill factor into account when deciding whether it is cold enough for a cold weather payment.  One could have a situation in which the AIR temperature in one area is zero or colder, whereas another area could have, say, plus 1 or 2, but the WIND-CHILL makes it colder in the second area.\n\n2) Pay it for EVERY DAY that the temperature reaches the cut-off point; do not wait till there are 7 consecutive days of such low temperatures.  What happens if a specific area has 6 days of - 3 or 4, say, and then the 7th day it's +1?  This would still mean the inhabitants of this area spending quite a lot on heating (ESPECIALLY now all the energy providers are increasing their prices).\n\n3) Pay it to EVERYONE on either the minimum wage or income-related benefits.  It's currently paid only to disabled people or households where there is a child under 5 (and possibly also to pensioners; but I've been a pensioner for over 2.5 years and never received one possibly because it hasn't been cold enough).",
