            "background": "The residents of Brotton have for the past 4 years put up with an accident black spot on the bypass. We wish the local county council to change it. To make it safer for people to cross the road, while being clearly visible to cars. And also to make it safer for all motorists to see clearly on comming cars.\nThere have been a lot of near misses and it is surely only time before somebody is killed on this badly designed stetch of road.\n\nWith more houses being planned for this area of Brotton is it a recognised problem, which is only going to get worse.\nPlease sign our petition today.",
