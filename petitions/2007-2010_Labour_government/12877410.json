            "background": "Currently taxpayers who fund OFCOM, for example, are legally barred from being represented by OFCOM in claims against communications companies.  This is while OFCOM is considering taking up the case of competitor companies and trying to force companies like SKY to sell its products to competitor companies at lower rates - thereby negating competition in the industry.  This is typical of the current regime in this country where the priorities are totally at odds with what is actually required.  OFCOM is funded by taxpayers and taxpayers CANNOT be represented by it.  Only in the UK!",
