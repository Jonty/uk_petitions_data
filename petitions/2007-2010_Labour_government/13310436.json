Councils are causing great upset and unrest as they are having debates with a select amount of people and not announcing details of such.   Splitting the country up in this way has caused us to be fractured.  Details of said debates could be placed in the free papers at no cost and we could write in to say we will attend.  I and others have argued with Councils about actions passed to which we have not no say.  If this is the way it will be all people should have and deserve a say.",
