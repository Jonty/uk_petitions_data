        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many people were encouraged to go to university aged 18 by the government, even though many did not know what it was they should study. Consequently those people may not be able to get jobs and have to retrain- but will be charged \u00a348,000 for a new degree. This is unaffordable for most. \u00a320,000 in debt for the first degree then having to work for minimum wage or pay \u00a348k to retrain?? Totally unfair, this needs to be scrapped so second degree students get the same fees as first degree students.",
