            "background": "Following reports that allies of the United Kingdom will continue to refuse to attend or supply detailed information to Coroner's Inquests held in the UK in respect of British service personnel who have become casualties of \u2018friendly-fire\u2019 incidents, thereby hampering the due processes of the British legal systems and preventing full examination of such incidents by independent authorities.  \n\nThe United Kingdom should withdraw all cooperation with countries who refuse to accept that a sovereign state has the right to investigate the loss of life of its citizens whilst serving overseas as part of multi-national forces, and severe diplomatic sanctions should be taken against countries that persistently refuse to supply such information as may be needed by the British courts.",
