            "background": "I am setting up a petition to get Bradford City player Donovan Ricketts back into the UK. He has been treated unfairly imo, there are so many spongers in the uk. Why should a person who is willing to work, and earn money/ pay tax, be kicked out? \n\nI know footballers get criticism, and Ricketts gets his fair share. But no one can deny the fact that he earns his money, and pays his tax's. \n\nHe deserves to be allowed into the UK on that fact. Im pretty sure if he was coming to play for Manchester United or Chelsea, or even the mother of all foriegn teams... Arsenal... there would be no problem what so ever. At the end of the day, he is only a human... just like those players for the above teams. So start treating people fairly.",
