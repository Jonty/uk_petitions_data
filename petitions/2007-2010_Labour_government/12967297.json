We dont need to be told what we already know( That Mr Brown is too scared to call an election and will leave it till the last possible momment). What we want, what we expect, what we AS YOUR BOSSES DEMAND is for a General Election to be called before the end of the year. The general consenus is that Mr Brown is an unelected leader( We as the electorate dont care about Labour Party systems) & that we deserve at this time of hardship to have someone WE put in office",
