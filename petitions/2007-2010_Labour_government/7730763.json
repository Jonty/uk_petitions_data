It's about time people took some responsibility, gained a bit of insight and perhaps realised that you can't just go to the top for every little moan.\n\nIf people actually took the effort to find out the best avenue for their problem, or better still stop moaning and be thankful they don't live in Burma or Democratic Republic of Congo, then this website would be reserved for only the biggest issues the prime minister can tackle. I realise this is one of those \"minor gripes\" but it is written in order to prevent hundreds more.",
