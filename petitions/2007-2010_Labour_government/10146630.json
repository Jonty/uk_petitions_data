        "background": "Whilst the smokig ban in general has had a major effect on the public house trade, private member clubs have been hit even harder.They are not open to the public and member numbers are decreasing. With a change in the law, if you advertise your private club as a smoking environment then the public can decide whether they wish to join or not, aware that smoking is allowed. Obviously, smoking would only be allowed in a member and guest area, thus allowing any members, signed in guests and private party guests the chioce of a smoke free environment.",
