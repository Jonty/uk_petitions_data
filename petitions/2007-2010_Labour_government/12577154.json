For it to work we (the public) need to trust our publicly elected officials. We (the public) should not and do not want to feel that publicly elected officials have their 'noses in the trough' and their own self-interest upper most in their minds. If this perception (of the current reality) persists then engagement will decline and democracy will stall. Act now (Gordon Brown) to promote integrity, it may be the last and most valuable thing you can bring.",
