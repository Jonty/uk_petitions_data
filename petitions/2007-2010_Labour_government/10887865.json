        "action": "provide funding into schools for weekend teaching purely directed at sport and physical education free of charge to parents",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Unfortunately we have a problem with obesity in this country and general lack of physical fitness in children. This comes from the lack of official programmes that can allow children to partake in sport within a controlled environment, around people they are comfortable with. Parents seek for a quick fix throwing their kids at clubs with children they do not know or have not built relationships with. Pumping investment into schools as a seperate fund so children can come in on a Saturday and Sunday and learn/partake in 2 or 3 sports a weekend will give these children the opportunity to continue this on in their chosen sport. The parents should not have to pay for their kids to be given opportunities, the government has a responsibility to develop a strong sporting nation where children want to play all sports and be able to pass this on when they grow older to their children.",
