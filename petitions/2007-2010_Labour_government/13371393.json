            "background": "The Student Loans Company has caused many problems in recent years, and we urge the Prime Minister to at least order an inquiry into how the Student Loans Company is organized, and how it could be improved to better deal with the increasing amount of students. Problems have included:\n\n- late loans (even when they have applied well before the deadline).\n\n- students being given misinformation which has now led to some paying back their loans while they are still students (some paying with part of the loan, as there is no other income).\n\n- applications not being dealt with properly and then being lost/delayed.\n\n- students not being able to sort out problems with applications due to a congested phoneline and the website going down.\n\nThis is simply unacceptable, and the system has broken under the weight of more students. It needs to change.",
