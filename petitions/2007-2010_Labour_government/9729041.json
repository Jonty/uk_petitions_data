        "background": "This would reduce congestion as people would leave cars at home. It would also promote community cohesion as groups of people who hadn't spoken to each other before met on buses and trains and found they had something in common with each other. It would reduce inequalites as poor unemployed people in newcastle have to travel more than rich fans in the south east due to the geographical spread of clubs. It makes sense on every level",
