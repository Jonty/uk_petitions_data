            "background": "By banning the sale of fireworks to the general public and allowing only licensed displays run by qualified people, the distress caused to animals would be limited. As profesional displays would be advertised people in the local area would have fair warning and be able to take the appropriate action regarding their animals. It would also mean that the anti social use of fireworks, causing injury to both humans and animals would stop.",
