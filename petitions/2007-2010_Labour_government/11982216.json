        "background": "With car park charges, people are thinking twice to go and park their for shopping, eating out etc.\n\nDue to this shops and businesses in these towns and cities suffer from reduced sales as people are travelling elsewhere where parking is free or do their shopping on the internet etc.\n\nDue to the recession, businesses need every customer as possible and councils charging to park is going against this. Councils say that they need the revenue from car parking. My first piece of advice is for councils to start switching off lights when theit buildings are empty!",
