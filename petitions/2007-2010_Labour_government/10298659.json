            "background": "As stated on the BBC consumer website - \"The NHS was set up to provide comprehensive healthcare to everyone in the UK according to their clinical need - not their ability to pay.  It should promote good health, prevent ill health, diagnose and treat injury and disease and care for those with long-term illness and disability\".\n\nWe the undersigned believe this government has a duty of care to put an end to the appalling scandal of the growing numbers of patients at risk from irreversible blindness due to the refusal by some Primary Care Trusts to fund sight saving treatments.  There is one PCT in Birmingham that has stated that the presence of Wet AMD in both eyes does not constitute an exceptional case for funded treatment and therefore continues to allow patients to go blind rather than provide licensed treatments.  \n\nWe further believe the those PCT's that continue to perpetuate this 'Postcode Lottery' for treatment should be held to account for denying patients what should be their statutory right.",
