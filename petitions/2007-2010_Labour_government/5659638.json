            "background": "Taking all commuting costs (i.e. costs necessary to travel from your place of permanent residence to your place of work) out of pre-tax income will have several benefits:\n1) To you, the commuter: This will reduce your commuting costs by 22% as a lower rate tax payer; or 40% for higher rate tax payers;\n2) The environment: It will incentivise people to move out of busy town centres thereby reducing pollution in these areas;\n3) House prices: This in turn will reduce demand in city centres for accommodation which will lead to a (much needed) reduction in house price inflation;\n4) Local communities: Rural and suburban community economies will benefit as a result of increased spending in these areas;\n5) Carbon footprint: By encouraging people to move further away from crowded city centres, they will be attracted to using the train as an alternative to cars thus reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nLastly, it's not fair that the full cost of travelling to work be taken out of your hard-earned wages. While it is that person's choice to live where they choose, the government should act to make this choice easier and make living outside of city centres a viable alternative.",
