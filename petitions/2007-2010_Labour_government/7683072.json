            "background": "It looks like we are once again on the side of a murderer, with the imminent release of the killer of Philip Lawrence twelve years ago. \nIt would also seem that the tax-payer will pick up the tab for re-homing him and his family and making sure they come to no harm by providing him with security and a new identity. My feeling is as that of Frances Lawrence in saying 12yrs is too early for his release, bearing in mind a daily paper has said that Home Office officials have expressed concerns about his \"present and serious threat to the public\" In addition to that I would say, if released, he should take his chance in the community along with the rest of the No-Marks and others released early and  not be pampered in this way.",
