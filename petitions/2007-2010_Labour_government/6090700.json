            "background": "For too long the government has allowed people to buy 2, 3, 4 or even 10s of houses, pushing up prices. Until supply can be increased, we have got to control house price inflation. If you heavily tax the buy to let brigade, they will sell some of their properties, freeing up supply for the rest of us!\n\nAll those people like me who earn a modest income but cannot afford even a small modest home unite and sign this petition. Why should we pay the mortgages of the rich??",
