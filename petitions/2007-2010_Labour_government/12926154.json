            "background": "It is disgraceful what outskilling is doing to our country. For instance, HM Revenue & Customs is flying in cheap Indian labour to do jobs in Telford that should be done by British people. Similarly, Lloyds Banking Group is alleged to be flying in hundreds of Indian IT workers, thus denying British citizens jobs - all in the name of saving costs. What about the cost to the livelihoods of British citizens? We have families to feed and mortgages to pay. We are in a recession as well! Why is this being allowed to happen? The Prime Minister said, 'British jobs for British workers'. Why can't he stand by his words?",
