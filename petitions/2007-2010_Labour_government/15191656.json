            "background": "Leaf blowers create noise and disturbance every autumn, and in many cases these outdoor vacuum cleaners are used all year round by people with an obsessive compulsive desire to remove any kind of debris from their lawns and paths. Not only is their noise pollution causing misery for thousands, but the way they remove any form of leaf and plant litter deprives birds the chance to pick through the debris during autumn and winter to find worms and grubs. California has banned these unwelcome additions to the long list of gardeners' noisy and polluting power products, and we urge the prime  minister to ban their sale and use in the UK.",
