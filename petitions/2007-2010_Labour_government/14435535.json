            "background": "we demand that child maintenance( including arrears) are assessed by a court based system whereby maintenance and access go hand in the hand. the csa is not accurate or fair and should be used as a tracing company only not for maintenance payments. This court system will ease the burden on the taxpayer and will ensure that both nrp and pwc finances are taken into account and that access can also be enforced along with maintenance. 1st and 2nd family poverty needs addressing now.",
