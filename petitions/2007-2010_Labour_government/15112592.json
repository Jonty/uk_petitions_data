I believe that a citizen of this country that does not over indulge themselves with these \"vices\" deserves the right to free health care whereas someone who has abused their body should be denied. For example if a priest gets lung cancer and has never smoked in his or her life they should not have to wait for treatment on an ever increasing list of people abusing their bodies for the sake of it. I ask the government to move against such a thing happening for if they are so willingly going to pay for an increased risk of disease they should have to pay for their healthcare as well",
