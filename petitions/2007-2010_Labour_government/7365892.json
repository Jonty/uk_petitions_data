            "background": "While in the early 1980s almost 5% of the UK's GDP was spent on our armed forces, today that has plummeted to 2.5%.  This, along with higher costs for more complex military equipment, has led to our forces and defence research being under-equipped and under-funded.\n\nThe Prime Minister should resolve these problems by returning spending to nearer the GDP percentage levels they were once at, so that the United Kingdom may continue to live up to its proud military history",
