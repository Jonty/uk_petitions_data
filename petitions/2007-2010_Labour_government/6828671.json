        "background": "Every year, on the sea floes of Canada harper and hooded seals are killed for a commercial industry, 98% of these seals are under the age of 3 months. They are killed with wooden clubs and guns. Although guns are used they are shot at from moving boats, meaning they are normally injured and not killed humanely. Since the government deduct $2 for every bullet hole in the skin of a seal, if the shooter doesnt kill the seal it is left to die slowly. Over the past 3 years almost a million seals have met this fate. These are only the seal who were killed, the real numbers are probably much higher. The seals are killed for fur, normaly for fashion garments.",
