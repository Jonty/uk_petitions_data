            "background": "We want people to stop for a moment and think before they go out, and get into a routine where they take shopping bags along with them. We want to follow the example set by residents and traders in Hebden Bridge and fight for change on our doorstep in Leeds and Bradford.\n\nWe are kicking off an anti plastic bag crusade across the region by appearing in a huge \u2018bag for life\u2019.\n\nApproach PR are using their PR and media communication skills for an eco friendly campaign.\n\nWorking in Little Germany, Bradford we've made an outsize shopper to kick off our \u2018Don\u2019t Get Carried Away\u2019 campaign to rid the district of plastic bags.\nWe're very conscious of what is happening in the world. We feel the environment is being adversely affected by the unnecessary use of plastic carrier bags and it is so easy to change by simply not using them as part of your daily routine.",
