            "background": "Whilst we all understand that workers must have certain basic rights, it has proved too disruptive to the public at large when strike action is taken over matters which, while highly important to individuals, are comparatively trivial from a national perspective.  (This especially applies to unofficial action, take note Oxfordshire!)  Such action causes distress to a great number of people, who rely on an efficient postal service for vital document transfers.  It also undermines public opinion of the Post Office, which provides many other essential services.",
