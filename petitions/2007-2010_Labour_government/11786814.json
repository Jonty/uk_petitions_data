        "background": "During the heavy snowfalls in Febraury 2009 most if not all schools closed in Milton Keynes. Over a 2 week period Mainstream schools closed for approx 2-3 days, S.E.N schools 5-6 days. The S.E.N schools rely on authority provided transport to travel to and from school but the roads around the schools were left untreated leaving them too dangerous. These schools need to be better supported by the authorities so that our disabled children are no more disrupted than our mainstream children.",
