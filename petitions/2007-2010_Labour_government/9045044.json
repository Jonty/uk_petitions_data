I work hard I pay tax, I pay inflated petrol prices, Why are you increasing the tax in 2009 by \u00a350, and not capping the oil burning gas guzzling cars prereigstered before 2001? How many old knackered oil spewing cars do you see? Why are you penalising the same people, why not get the dole budging layabouts into work, why am I subsidising them. Dont get me started on the war. Keep whipping the willing horse. If you want to keep in power get real and stop going tax mad. Quit Iraq and save us some money.",
