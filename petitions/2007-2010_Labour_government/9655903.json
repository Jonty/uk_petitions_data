        "background": "i think it's unfair that the non resident parent has to pay more csa because they dont spend time with the child than if they did.  Especially when they are not allowed to see them by the resident parent.  My partner hasnt seen his daughter in 3 years he pays 50 pounds a week maintanence and cannot afford to go to court to force visitation rights.  there are many in the same boat as him its not fair the csa needs to change its rules.",
