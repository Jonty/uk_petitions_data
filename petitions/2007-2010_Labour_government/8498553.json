            "background": "The Bee population is crashing.  This is catastrophic for life on earth.  Including the human race.  Research suggests the increased use of mobile phones has a lot to do with the crash.  The electro magnetic waves disrupt the bee's navigation systems.  They can\u2019t supply the hives so the hives simply die.  We need to get greed from our minds.  Money does not mean happiness.  People are getting greedy and materialistic.  The earth is on the brink of disaster for many different reasons, yet we still waste what the earth has given us. We need to wake up and see what we are doing.  Ignorance is no longer an option.  Prime Minister if you care for the earth and for the future generations of human beings please act.  This must be of top priority.  No more bee's no more plants, no more animals.  Plants and animals give us food and oxygen. No amount of money can save us if the Bee's die out.",
