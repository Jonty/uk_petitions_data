            "background": "I am a 16 year old girl who has recently visited the Auschwitz complex where many horendous events have happened from 1940 up to 1945. Seeing the exhibitions and gas chamber is emotionally difficult to take in but the experience is amazing. 1.5 million people have died there and I feel future relatives would be sad to see it be demolished. By keeping this complex up and running I feel the government should fund anually to the concentration camp so can purchase the materials needed. Keeping Auschwitz would be a world wide sign to humanity to stop widespread genocide which is happening across the world.",
