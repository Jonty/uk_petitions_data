            "background": "I'm sure a lot of people in the UK have been affected by the practice of buying large quantities of event tickets primarily to sell them on at a highly inflated price. One major example was that of Live8, a free charity event! Some people were selling tickets they received on for huge amounts of money on a well known online auction site. After much pressure from the media, eventually the tickets were withdrawn from sale. If these people knew that they were not going to be able to make any money from event tickets, the events would still sell out, but now all of the tickets would go to legitimate fans and not people who are looking to make a quick buck out of a popular show.",
