Such an initiative if \nimaginatively produced would help \neducate and inform and should increase \nrecycling effort generally. Such a dvd \nshould be understanding of the \ndifficulties for many. The soundtrack \nshould have alternative light classical \nmusic to ensure many can watch and \nenjoy. It would help counteract the \nagitators on some tabloid \nnewspapers. There would be a 25 minute \nnational section and another locally \nproduced part for each region of the \nUK.",
