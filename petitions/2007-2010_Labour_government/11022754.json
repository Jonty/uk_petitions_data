            "background": "It may be the most intensively used major diesel-only route not serving London. Four \u2018fast\u2019 Transpennine Express trains per hour run alongside two stopping trains from Leeds to Huddersfield and two others from Huddersfield to Manchester. In total, 6 tph.\n\nThis frequency justifies electric trains, and the new 3-car diesel trains are not long enough to cope with peak-time demand.\n\nWith around 90 miles of electrification required on a line so intensively used, it has a stronger case than longer lines such as Cross Country. Replacing DMUs with EMUs would start a cascade, increasing capacity on other lines; allow inferior \u2018Pacer\u2019 trains to be withdrawn; and provide sufficient rolling stock to run new services over reopened railway lines.\n\nTo continue to build diesel trains is not sensible. Oil is likely to be in short supply before the time that the newest diesels are life-expired. Electric trains should replace diesels on the busiest lines and older diesels replaced by the existing newer ones.",
