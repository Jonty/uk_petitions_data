            "background": "The defence secretary has stated that the reason military personel are paid less, is due to the fact that they would not be able to obtain employment in civilian life to the same pay.\nMany soldiers after leaving the Army infact gain key roles in industry! Some go on to persue further education.\nI find the comments of the secretary offensive and counter productive to our armed forces and believe that military personel cannot have any faith in the MOD with comments such as this being placed in the civil domain.",
