Please will the British government take steps to investigate the torturing of victims on their daily basic lives by the electromagnetic, microwave and direct energy weapons. We need to stop E/M harassment. We want to stop microwave weapons. We want to stop direct energy weapons. A signal detector would get rid of all the perpetrators activities.
