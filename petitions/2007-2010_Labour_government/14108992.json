In any other job, attendance is not optional, and the fact that hardly anybody turns up is tantamount to earning money without having to turn up to work.\n\nThis absenteeism can be equated to be as scandalous as the recent 'MP expenses', which our PM has failed to put into law.\n\nFor the above reasons, we need to have our MPs attendance in the house of commons made compulsory.",
