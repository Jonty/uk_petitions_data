            "background": "Since July the price of oil went from $147 per barrel to $65 per barrel these days. This is a cut of more than 50% in in value.\n\nYet the prices of Petrol and Diesel have not been cut to 50% since July Prices and Oil companies failed to follow suit and to pass the benefits to consumers.\n\nTime to help revive the economy not use gimmicks to protect this obscene greedy level of profits to those that already have benefited from the high raise of oil (i.e. average $100- $120) and collecting billions of dollars in the process to the coffers of the likes of BP and Shell.\n\nI want the Prime minister to set up an independent enquiry to investigate why oil companies are not passing these cuts to consumers and why these oil companies are still keeping a huge margin of profit when Oil price has fallen considerably from $147 to $65 per barrel.",
