            "background": "Currently the enforcement of not wearing a seat is a \u00a330 fine - for all.  This penalty is not ensuring people where their seatbelts - if fitted.\n\nNot wearing your seat belt in the front can cause the driver or passenger to be hurled at the windscreen or steering wheel.  Equally, sitting in the back without a seatbelt can cause the passenger to be hurled into the seat of front passengers in some cases causing death.\n\nPersons under 14: Driver to have \u00a360 fine and three points\n\nPersons over 14: Issued with \u00a360 (and three points if in possession of a driving licence).\n\nThis, I feel, will help in reducing deaths on the road.",
