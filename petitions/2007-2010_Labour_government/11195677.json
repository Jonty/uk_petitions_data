He is then in a state of vulnerability which leaves him open to DRUGS , ALCOHOL and MENTAL HEALTH issues. And before you know it the next time you see him he will be so deteriated the system will now say that he is not fit to see his children. And all he wants his a place of his own to spend quailty time with his children.We all know that positive role models are crucial to the up bringing of children and society as a whole.Please support this worthy cause.",
