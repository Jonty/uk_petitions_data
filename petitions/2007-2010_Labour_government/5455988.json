        "background": "This petition is a vehicle the purpose of which is to respond to prejudicial perceptions of the living habits of \"students\" - people engaged in full or part-time study at University, regardless of age - which are propagated particularly by the neighbours of student residences. The mentioned neighbours, it is widely accepted, belong overwhelmingly to the social group of slightly lonely, listless forty-year olds who are caught between old-aged antipathy and the youthful alacrity that they themselves attack. This petition appeals to those students out there, and any other adherents to the cause, who will defend the cause of playing musical instruments and not washing as frequently as would be medically desired!",
