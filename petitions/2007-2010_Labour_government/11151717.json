            "background": "This year's X Factor winner will release a cover version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'.\n\nThis song is art, it's history and it is special to a lot of people. We heard the best version in 1994 by Jeff Buckley who has since passed away.\n\nLetting this year's winner release another cover of this song would be deeply inappropriate, disrespectful,  and I for one strongly doubt they can do the song any justice.\n\nSo, please sign this petition to prevent yet another cheap commercial song from being released!",
