        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is very unfair to have to pay just to apply for university. This petition lobbies for scrapping two sets of fees; the application fee by UCAS, and the testing fees for entrance exams many courses need. In the credit crunch, it is not fair to levy such charges. \n\nThe UCAS application fee has increased this year from 15-17 pounds, an inflation busting increase of over 10%! This should be free.\n\nAs well as applying, one needs to pay for certain entrance exams before going to certain courses, like medicine and dentistry, law and vet. studies.\n\nThese all cost alot of money, from 75 pounds for UKCAT to 230 pounds for the GAMSAT test, to get into medicine. BMAT, LSAT and others have their own fees. \nFor some, you can get a bursary, but this is still only partial.\n\nAll fees associated with university applications need to be scrapped, as it makes it a heavier burden on those wishing to achieve their potential.",
