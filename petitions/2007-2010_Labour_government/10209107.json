            "background": "The requirement for \u2018unique child assessment\u2019 as currently proposed is difficult if not impossible to implement effectively.  It detracts from and fragments the teaching effort, and worryingly, it is resulting in an ever increasing loss to the profession of previously motivated practitioners.  The practicalities of looking after children in their early years do not appear to have been adequately addressed when setting the policy aims.    Current authoritative advice is simply to undertake \u2018good planning\u2019, but this does not recognise the logistics involved in tending to the constant, individual and changing needs (and demands) of a large group of 3 and 4 year olds.   Each child is (and has to be) treated as a unique individual, but to create a formalised and unique curriculum for each child is time consuming, inappropriate and unhelpful in the context of trying to engender a shared understanding of, and respect for the equally valid needs of friends, adults and society at large.",
