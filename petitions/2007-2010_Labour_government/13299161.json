        "action": "better govern the use of overseas call-centres by British organisations.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "After around a decade of UK companies using overseas call-centres to boost their profits it is clear that there has been a negative reception to their use. Most people are not in any way racist they are merely frustrated at not being understood, not having the same levels of communication with the companies they have been loyal to for years and in some cases being made redundant because massive call-centres are just up and leaving for India and other such foreign destinations. Why pay for a so called 'British' company which invests billions of pounds of our money into another countries' economy in the current financial climate when we should be helping our own. Obviously the more profit these companies make the more HMRC can collect in taxes, but how about reducing the amount of people claiming benefits and giving tens of thousands of people back the work and levels of cutomer service they so desperately need?",
