            "background": "Enterprise Inn's have announced that both Carlsberg draught and Castlemaine XXXX will be withdrawn from its supply list at the end of January next year.\nIn a letter to its 7750 licensees across the country, seen by The Publican, the company said the decision had been taken because\u201ccustomers and retailers have moved away from these brands over the last few years.\u201d\nThe letter received by pubs last week said Enterprise had conducted a review into its standard lagers, which shows the two beers were \u201cno longer viable\u201d.\nThe letter said: \u201cAs part of the review we have concluded it is no longer viable to offer Carlsberg Draught Lager and Castlemaine XXXX as the number of stockists and volumes have fallen to such a low level.\u201d\nMy thoughts are with people like myself who rely on their regular customers, many of which are carlsberg and XXXX drinkers, of which will now go elsewhere where these brands are sold! In a very challenging market place with declining beer sales and pubs closing at a rate of around five a day, surely this is suicide to our establishments??",
