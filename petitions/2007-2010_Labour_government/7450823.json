            "background": "Although I agree that cat ownership should not be allowed to just ANYONE - the cat's/cats' welfare should of course always be paramount - I am not persuaded that forcing potential owners to have licences is the best way to ensure their welfare; it is surely FAR more important to check the ability of the potential owner to care for the cat/cats properly and, especially, to give him/her/them love.  Cats deserve the best of care because they give so much love themselves which helps with their owner's/owners' EMOTIONAL well-being; as someone who has lived with, and loved, cats most of my life I always say they generate love.  Stroking one is also well known to reduce heart rate and therefore to promote health and well-being in that way as well.",
