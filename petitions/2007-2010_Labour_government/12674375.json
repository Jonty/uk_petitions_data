            "background": "the law should change so that sixteen year olds can ride a 50cc bike. doing thirty miles an hour is slow and un safe. it is unsafe when you have cars going past at 50-70 mph it makes the rider feel like they are in danger but has no choice about it as public transport is expensive. I live neer a dual carriage way and going on there at thrity whilst other car drivers are going over 50, it doesnt feel safe. Also going slow causes more accidents as people see the L plate and start trying to push you into the gutter.",
