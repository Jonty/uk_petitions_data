        "background": "As a parent paying CSA, I struggle to keep a financial balance supporting my own life and that of my child. I work overtime so that I can maintain my CSA payments and keep my own life and home secure. These overtime payments are taken into account when being assessed. The assessment covers the previous annual salary. Future salaries including overtime can change considerably from the previous earnings. For a fair assessment CSA should only take into consideration actual annual salary and not overtime or bonus payments.",
