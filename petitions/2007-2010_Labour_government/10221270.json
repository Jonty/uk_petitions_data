            "background": "The local planning department is trying to block an application to redevelop a derelict building situated on the A46 at Faldingworth.  The plan is to turn the building into a martial arts training centre which will benefit the surrounding villages by giving the youngsters something to do instead of hanging round on street corners.  The activities provided will teach them respect and also a new sport; they will also get the opportunity to compete at a national level.  Local jobs will be created to run the centre and as no machinery is required, the centre will be environmentally friendly.  The local planning department are objecting to the centre as it is not directly in a village and therefore will create more car usage.  We believe the centre will give the local youth somewhere to go and participate in sport, redevelop a derelict eyesore and create local jobs.",
