        "background": "The cancellation of Liverpool's world renowned Mathew Street Festival at what amounts to the 11th hour is the latest in a long line of failures that demonstrates a chronic lack of vision, competence and organisation amongst the city's political leaders and unelected quangos.  Failed projects, red tape, poor planning, hair brained appointments, and continued attempts to force pet projects onto local communities regardless of their needs and wishes are just a few items appearing on this list of shame.\n \nI ask the Prime Minister to condemn this latest failure, and to urge a fresh impetus of cross-party co-operation.  I also ask that an independent enquiry be set up to examine the repeated failures of those in charge, and for them to publically apologise for making the city they represent a laughing stock.\n\nFinally I ask the Prime Minister to urge visitors not to be put off coming to Liverpool, and to reaffirm we are a welcoming city, despite the failures of our civic leadership.",
