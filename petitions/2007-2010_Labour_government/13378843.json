        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Wicken Fen Vision is a far-sighted plan to create a new nature reserve covering around 22 square miles to the north of Cambridge. The project requires the acquisition of over 5,000 hectares of farmland by the National Trust over the next 100 years. The land which, like much of Cambridgeshire\u2019s farmland, has been exhausted by centuries of intensive agriculture, will then be carefully managed such that it slowly returns to a mosaic of natural fen, providing a vital habitat for many threatened species of wildlife. In addition to this, the Vision will create much needed additional public access to open spaces in a county that has significantly less accessible countryside than the national average. We believe that the Vision is well planned, and that the National Trust will carefully preserve the area\u2019s important heritage sites and Lodes whilst returning the fen to its natural state. We do not believe that the Vision - which, after all, accounts for less than 0.1% of the UK\u2019s arable farmland - in any way threatens the UK\u2019s food security as some opponents have stated. Rather, we feel that the country as a whole will benefit greatly from it.",
