            "background": "I am appalled that my measly pension from my work of just under \u00a310,000 pa is actually taxed. My wife and I cannot live off that sum.  When I die my wife will receive just over half that amount.  When I qualify for State pension we may be able to breathe but when I die she will not get even that at all.  Yet, the Government can find billions of pounds from somewhere to pump into the system when the great brains earning six figure salaries who are responsible for the economy fail and then, themselves, receive massive pensions. I want my wife to continue receiving my full pensions, both from work as well as State pension and, also, for neither pension to be taxed at all.",
