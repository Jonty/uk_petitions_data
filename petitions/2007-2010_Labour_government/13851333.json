            "background": "Assisted Dartford Crossing Escort Patrols, for the QE2 Bridge and Tunnels, were discontinued on the 31st July 2009, by the Highways Agency.\n\nThe Highways Agency is responsible for providing a safe National Road Network for all users.   After approximately 40 years, however, they have stated this assistance was withdrawn by them as there is no requirement under legislation to deliver such a service for the convenience of users.\n\nFor many the service just being there has given people the confidence to use this part of the National Road Network.   Many people in this country are not aware of the change due to lack of publicity, with information being publicised only a few days before being introduced.\n\nIt does not only adversely affect the drivers but also their families, relatives, friends and in some cases firms/companies whom these people work for, besides holiday travel.\n\nTherefore, to have this service reinstated and if required the necessary legislation passed, please sign this petition.",
