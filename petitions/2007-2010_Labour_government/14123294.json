        "background": "We despair of  politicians who appear to be self-serving, lacking honour and fail to connect with us, or show concern for us or respect.  \n\nThe symptoms are clear.  The expenses scandal, misleading information, our questions are avoided and many other issues which cause us not to trust politicians.\n\nAttitude determines action. \n\nAll action should go back to the precept of respect for others. Flipping second homes, charging living expenses, making profit out of tax payers money and milking the system would not occur except in the rarest instances.  \n\nMPs are elected to serve the country (their consituents in particular) and work for the common good.\n \nAll prospective MPs should understand this clearly and publicly acknowledge that the principle of service with honour will determine their actions, at the point at which they apply to stand, by signing a straightforward declaration to that effect is a grave reminder that to serve is not to self-serve.\n\nThe same reality check should apply to all prospective and existing elected representatives in local government at all levels.",
