            "background": "This is in response to a petition which expresses opposition to such workers being allowed to strike.  If they were not allowed to do so it would be only fair to ensure that their conditions of employment were such that they would never NEED to strike.  For instance decent salaries (at least 50% above the minimum wage), short hours, pleasant working conditions, and - above all - the right to be consulted about any issue affecting them and to have their views taken into account and acted on.  Employers frequently impose conditions of work on their employees but it is the people who actually DO the work who know what the best course of action is on any relevant issue.",
