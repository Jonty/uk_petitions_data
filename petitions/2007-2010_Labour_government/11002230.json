        "background": "The Bank of England interest rate bears no reflection on the average interest rate charged by banks.\nThe british public have now poured Billions of pounds into the Banking system, yet are still punished by high interest rates on credit cards, loans, overdrafts etc.\nIf the prime minister wants to HELP the general public, bank interest rates should be capped. This would enable people to pay off their debts and pour more money into the economy. British banks owned by British people should not be punishing British people, who ultimately own the banks",
