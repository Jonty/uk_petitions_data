        "background": "Do you \"the taxpayer\" like giving money away, more than \u00a3130 a month. :)\n\nSave the taxpayers money and stop giving DLA to those who dont deserve it.\n\nWho is finding the recession hardest?  The taxpayer!!!  We make the majority.  Make the right choice.\n\nDont give luxury cars to those who dont pay.  Be green, give them a cheap, fuel efficient car.  India is producing cars for less than \u00a31300.  Have big DLA stickers on the side of the cars.  Let them not drive in pride.  No more \u00a310,000+ cars.\n\nMake it harder to qualify for DLA.  There are simply too many healthy looking claimants.\n\nOne more thing.  Means based testing.  Make them work!!!\n\nGive people who DESERVE DLA the extra money they require.\n\nThank you taxpayers.",
