This dogged determination to swim against the tide for the better good of society has made us who we are. For this reason, and the fact that for those in the know there is just NO substitute, we urge the Prime Minister to bring back lime milk shake and not to succumb to the stereotypical choice of strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla only. Please let us maintain our right to be different and green!",
