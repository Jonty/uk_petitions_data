        "background": "I have been on long train journeys (Bristol-York and other similar distances) and had to stand up some of the way. Yet, the train was nine carriages long and four of these were first class. Could have put the first class passengers in 1 and a half carriages. Train companies need to seriously reduce their first class seats and scrap them completely if the train is smaller than a certain number of carriages.",
