            "background": "The Council on the Isle of Man have recently banned dogs from all 'Public Green Areas' in its capital Douglas and elsewhere. This ban is causing many dogs to be re-homed as owners now have nowhere to walk their dogs. This includes many elderly and disabled people that have owned their dogs for many years and their daily routines and social lives depend on their animals.  This ban is causing considerable suffering for many elderly/disabled dog-owners. We have brought this matter to the attention of yourselves following repeated protests, petitions and talks with our local Government all being quite futile.",
