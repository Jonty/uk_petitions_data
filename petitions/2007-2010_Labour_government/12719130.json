            "background": "The European Government should be the new name for the European Commission which decides which legislation goes before the European Parliament/Council of Ministers and becomes law.  Commission is a confusing title but Government is a far clearer and a more meaningful name.  27 nominated ministers from each of the EU member states make up the European Commission, the UK minister is Baroness Ashton.  It is very powerful organisation that also decides how EU budgets are spent and supervises observance of laws and treaties, and as such should be called a Government.  This will hopefully make it easier for people to understand what EU does and how it operates.",
