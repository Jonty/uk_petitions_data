            "background": "Alcohol has not had any real increase in prices for years, whilst the cost of cigaretes increases twice yearly, it's about time alcohol was increased the same way more deaths, injury's and offences are caused by alcohol than anything else. There are many reasons for putting up the cost of alcohol inline with inflation + 2%. Let see this goverment do something right for a change and protect those who need it most, those who get beaten, killed or injured because someones husband, father,wife or mother has had a drink, most of all protect the children from such things they really can not fight back.",
