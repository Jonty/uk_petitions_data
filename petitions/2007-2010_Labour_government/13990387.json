            "background": "The current approach to identity theft, based on information provided by my credit card company, is that if party X enters into an agreement with party Y to borrow money based on false ID, party Z is held accountable. This arrangement is blatantly unfair since Z took no part in the transaction. If lenders were made responsible for verifying the identity of borrowers, and responsible for any losses when they get it wrong and lend to criminals, presumably their security measures would become much more effective? Holding a 3rd party responsible for a crime they have had no involvement in appears to be a fundamental breach of human rights and the legislation should therefore be revised.",
