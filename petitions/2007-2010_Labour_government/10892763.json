            "background": "Inconsiderate farmers have placed bird scarers near to my village.They are  going off 3 times every 4 minuites. They start at 5 am, until night fall. \n\nThe NFU Code of Practice states that they should not really start before 7am and then only go off 4 times every hour. They should be baffled with straw bales,and pointed away from housing.  Many farmers are choosing to ignore this.The enviromental officer has had many complaints from my area.The  problem is tracing the culprits, as farmers \u2018let\u2019 out fields, and there is no way for the enviromental health to trace farmers or know which fields they are renting.\nThe RSPB have stated that birds are reactionary to movement rather than sound, (that\u2019s why they do such a good job of synchronised flying), and that these bird scarers are inefficient.Birds get used to the regular sound. Far better to have a \u2018jack in the box\u2019 in the field! \nPlease sign this petition to ask the NFU and the government to properly regulate the use of bird scarers in the countryside.",
