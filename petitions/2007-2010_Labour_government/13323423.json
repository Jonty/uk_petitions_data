            "background": "Many people seeking asylum in the UK are mothers* fleeing war, persecution, rape and other torture; \n\no To protect themselves and their children, mothers are often forced to leave their children behind \u2013 travelling together may put everyone at risk and usually they don\u2019t know where they are going or how they will survive; \n\no Mothers may lose contact with children back home or hear of them unprotected and suffering, and can do little to prevent it; \n\no It can take many years for an asylum claim to be settled; but the pain of separation and of trying to be a carer long distance is invisible and unrecognised. \n\no When mothers win the right to stay they are not automatically granted the right of family reunion. \n\no If children turn 18 while their mother\u2019s application is being considered they lose the right to join their mother.\n\nSee demands above.\n\nContact: Mothers\u2019 Campaign of the All African Women\u2019s Group, 020 7482 2496, aawg02@gmail.com\n\n*We are a mothers\u2019 campaign, so we speak particularly of mothers, the primary carers in every society, but we know that the problems and heartbreak we describe is often the same for fathers, grandparents and other carers.",
