            "background": "The current situation nearly always results in the \"customer\" being prosecuted, and the prostitute being let-off with countless warnings.\n\nWhy on earth is this the case?\n\nThe law is far harsher on drug-dealers than it is on drug-takers for example, so why not apply the same rational logic with prostitution?\n\nThese prostitutes are illegally offering sex on a regular basis, and are therefore the direct and main cause of the crime - just like drug dealers.\n\nThere is an endless 'supply' of potential customers for this crime, but only a limited number of people who would actually lower themselves to become prostitutes.\n\nProsecuting this smaller group of people will be a lot simpler, and a lot more effective.\n\nLet common sense prevail.",
