        "background": "Manchester United is in huge debt at the moment and majority of the revenue collected is used to payback that debt. By every passing day, situation is getting worse with ever rising debt. As part of their aim, the Glazer family are taking or thinking to take drastic but abominable actions such as rasing ticket prices and selling valuable resources i.e. training ground, etc.  The Glazer family were not financially viable to buy the club, however they still went ahead and bought our beloved football club with borrowed capital. Through this petition, we request a direct action against the Glazer family in order to stop our football club going into further debt.",
