            "background": "In 2007 I instigated three separate actions against the one defendant, two with no monetary value and the third for damages of not more than \u00a35,000.\n\nThe defendant failed to respond to the initial correspondence on two of the matters and failed to respond properly to the third.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant elected not to contest one of the actions.\n\nIt is my belief that for a defendant to fail respond to, or respond properly to, initial correspondence prior to the commencement of proceedings denies the litigant the right to a fair hearing on the grounds that he or she would not know what the defence is likely to be and could be a contravention of Article 6.1 of the Human Rights Act.\n\nFor a defendant to seek and be granted an order for costs after failing to respond to, or respond properly to, initial correspondence advising of potential legal proceedings could be a contravention of Article 6.1 and/or Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.\n\nFor a defendant to seek and be granted an order for costs after electing not to contest an action could be a contravention of one or both of Article 6.1 and/or Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.",
