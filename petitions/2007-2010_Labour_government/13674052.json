        "background": "There is much propoganda but no hard evidence that giving a child a cigarette is harmful and therefore no justification for the court to imprison anyone; If the child lives to old age without a related disease how will the courts and Government appease their consciences? Many native children smoke with no ill effect and have done for centuries. Abhorrence and guesswork is not proof of criminality.",
