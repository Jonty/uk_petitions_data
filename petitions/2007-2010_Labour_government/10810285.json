As a result this public institution, which spends millions of pounds of taxpayers' money and which represents the country nationally and internationally, is entirely exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAs British citizens we should have the right to know what public officials are doing in our name, how they are making decisions which affect us and our money.  The royal exemption should be removed and the monarchy should be subject to the same FOI rules as any other public body.",
