            "background": "To counteract the loss of the 10% tax band, I propose that the current arrangements for those aged 65-74 be extended to everyone below 75.\n\nThose with high incomes won't gain as there is an income limit above which the increased allowance decreases by \u00a31 for every \u00a32 above the limit (currently \u00a321,800).\n\nIt would especially help low income workers who are unable to, or for whom it is difficult to claim Working Tax Credit for whatever reason (certain part-timers, workers with no children, self-employed with fluctuating income etc) and women of 60-64 who have officially reached state retirement age and are receiving a modest personal or company pension in addition to their State Pension.\n\nIf set at the right level, the gains in actual income from an increased tax allowance could replace Working Tax Credit and would certainly be easier to calculate accurately.",
