They only think about themselves as they have the highest wages and do not have to worry about just making ends meet.The latest budget has just proven that with all the increases in tax on fuel and duty, This is guarented to have a knock-on affect with food in the shops and everything else. The tax increase to 20% even means more tax has to be paid on your wages as there is no 10% on the first amount earned. Surely this has to stop!!!!!!!!",
