            "background": "Homework for children can sometimes be very challenging, and when a child comes home from school they shouldnt have to think about school even more. Homework should be completely banished, giving children their own time when they come home to relax. Schoolwork should be kept to school and therefore shouldnt be given to children to do at home where most often than not, they have a substandard amount of help. Children therefore get frustrated and get very stressed.",
