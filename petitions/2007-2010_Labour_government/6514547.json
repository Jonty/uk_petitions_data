            "background": "I myself happen to live near too, 2 off these Unitary Authorites Portsmouth,& Southampton. I feel these have been a Big Success + Investment in Portsmouth is improving the area, & making the lives of Residents better. However Im in Hampshire and I have spoken to Councillors on several ocassions and they say that because they have a much bigger area to look after it has a lot less money per district to spend and they have to spread it best they can on a needs basis over the County. I would like to see more Local Councils Combined to become Unitary Authorities,& County Councils scrapped. Local People should decide what they need. Local People to run Local Services this is what I think people want more of a say in Local affairs and how there taxes are spent Hampshire County Council is ok. County's have huge areas to look after, with less money to spend on roads & other services. The voters feel cut off from Decision making. The need to create more Unitary Authorities is a must. I would like to see more introduced soon. I feel the Big County's are cumbersome. And there is a Better way. = Unitary Autorities",
