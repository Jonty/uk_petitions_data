            "background": "We have an anomalous situation where, on one hand, there are moves to lower the voting age to 16 and, on the other hand, to raise the driving and drinking ages. Further, children are encouraged to be independent of parental guidance by their early teens but places at university are still subject to preferential allocation based on parent's income.\nIt is time to rationalise the situation where children under 18 are clearly identified as minors and subject to parental control - and hence to parents being informed about medical and educational matters. As minors they should not vote, not drink, not smoke, not do jury service and not be expected to fight for their country. After 18, all parental responsibility should fall away and the young adult should have all the normal privileges and responsibilities of citizenship.",
