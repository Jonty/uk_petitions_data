It is the LAW'S fault as the pedoephile is known. This is also at the fault of the little girls parents who have given her permission to create an account on the MSN/Hotmail site, but it is in there terms and condition that applicant must be over a certain age. Labour MP's must have realised this and this is not the companies fault. it is the laws and the parents of the YOUNG child.\n\nplease reconcider.",
