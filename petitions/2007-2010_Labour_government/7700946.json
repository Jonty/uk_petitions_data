            "background": "We urge the prime minister to make 2008 the year in which he takes action on the amount of plastic shopping bags used in the UK.\n\nEach bag should be subject to a 10p per bag \"environmental tax\" which should go towards recycling initiatives for plastic bags.  Furthermore, every store in the UK should be forced to offer paper bag or cardboard box alternatives to plastic bags so that shoppers have a viable environmental alternative should they want one.\n\nFinally, all large stores and shopping centres should be forced to set up collection points for carrier bags for reuse by customers and recycling.",
