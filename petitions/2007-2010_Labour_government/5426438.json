Too many of our young people can't cope with the 5 days a week in college.  In many cases thats why they didn't do very well in school, but they thrive in the working environment with day release.  Sadly there aren't enough apprentiships to go around.  So sadly, many fall by the way side, as they did at school.\n\nAs the army focus on those from lower income families for war fodder....  Let focus on all our young people to help them support our nations physical infrstructure.",
