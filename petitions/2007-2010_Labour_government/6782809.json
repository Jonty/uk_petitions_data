            "background": "To create foie gras \u2013 French for \"fatty liver\" \u2013 pipes are shoved down birds' throats, and they are force fed up to 4 pounds of grain and fat (pumped directly into their stomachs) two or three times a day. The birds' livers become diseased and swell to up to about 10 times their normal size. The pipes often puncture the birds' throats, causing the animals to bleed to death.\n\nA recent RSPCA poll showed that nearly two-thirds of Britons believe foie gras sales should be banned. The cruel methods used to produce foie gras have led many retailers to ban foie gras in their stores.\n\nThis is a totally unacceptable practice and I would ask you to back this petition by signing it and passing the information on to everyone that you know.",
