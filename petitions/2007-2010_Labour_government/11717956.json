            "background": "I am Susannah Baughan and although I appreciate the rail service C2C provide, I do not agree with the age limit you have on purchasing child tickets. I have recently turned 16 and I am still in full time education, therefore i strongly feel I should only have to purchase a child ticket as my family income has not increased since I have turned 16. I used to pay \u00a34.50 for a daily return as a child, now i have to pay \u00a39.00 as I am classed as an adult. For a weekly ticket I used to pay \u00a321.00, i now have to pay \u00a340.00.\nI believe a better alternative to the current scheme would be to issue a card for all pupils still in full time education which entitles them to get a child fare.",
