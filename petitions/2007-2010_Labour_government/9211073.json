        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Patient's Charter is a freely available, widely distributed public consultation document, produced by gvt itself, which clearly and categorically states that \"same time\" appointment systems should be abandoned. \n\nWhy is this then still happening ? Patients, sometimes pre - operative are asked to arrive early morning , but wait until late afternoon before procedures are carried out. Please agree on a better system eg. \"staggering\" and amke recommendations universal. \n\nHoisted with your own pertard - the report that came out last week criticised the NHS for not putting the patient as the priority and in many ways, even today, trusts appear to function for the staff, but more especially the consultants' convenience.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to ensure local authorities and trusts who do not implement best practice recommendations, contravening govt. advice be prosecuted. Please set up a better system than patients' advocacy groups (which may be an outlet to voice concerns, but have little authoratitive pressure).",
