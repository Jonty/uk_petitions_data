            "background": "Under the equivalent learning qualification (ELQ) regulations, people with a previous degree who wish to study for a second degree will have to pay overseas student fees which are more than double the home/EU student fees. Although some degrees, including medicine, nursing and science related subjects are excluded from the ELQ regulations, unfortunately osteopathy is not one of the excluded subjects. The majority of osteopathy students are changing careers and many have previous degrees. The ELQ regulations will make it incredibly difficult for dedicated people to retrain as osteopaths who, once qualified, could make a real difference to those with health problems and as a result relieve the burden on the NHS.",
