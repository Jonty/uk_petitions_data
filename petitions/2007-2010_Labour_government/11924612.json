            "background": "NHS Norfolk have acknowledged that the current Occupational Therapy service is not equitable across the County - but in particular there is currently NO Occupational Therapy service for children with a diagnosis of ASD in West Norfolk. \nSensory difficulties are recognised as being a charaterism of Autism however all too often these difficulties are over looked, an OT should play a fundamental role in supporting sensory difficulties & can design programmes and often make adaptations to environments to ensure individuals are able to live as independently as possible. My son is 8 years old and has NEVER recieved any OT from NHS Norfolk - we have received assessments saying he has sensory difficulties but there has NEVER been any intervention!\nCurrently there are too many gaps in services and unfortunately its children with autism that seem to fall through them.\nNHS Norfolk should ensure people with Autism are included in the planning of their services.\nI have approached the Health Overview Scrutiny Committee but i have been informed they can not investigate this matter further for at least another 6 months!!",
