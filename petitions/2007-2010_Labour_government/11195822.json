        "background": "There are many thousands of people who can not afford to buy their own house and yet do not qualify for social housing. They have exactly the same difficulties as people who are paying mortgages and face losing their homes. People in rented accommodation are discriminated against in favour of home owners, especially as they are in the main, less well off than those who own their own house?\nWe the undersigned believe that any help offered by this government to home owners where possible should also be offered to tenants.",
