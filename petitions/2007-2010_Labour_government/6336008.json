            "background": "The lifetime ban on Christine Ohuruogu will mean that she will be unable to compete in the 2008 Olympic Games in China. A one year competition ban was imposed on her because she forgot to submit dope samples at the correct time. She has paid the price for that and come back from adversity,proving herself to be the best in the world by winning gold in the 400 metres at the World Championships in Osaka.\nChristine deserves the chance to compete for her country in Beijing and her country deserves the chance to see her run in the Olympics.\nWe're all immensely proud of her.",
