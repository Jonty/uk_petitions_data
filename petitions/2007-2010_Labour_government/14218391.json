            "background": "It is an absolute disgrace that, at a time when British servicemen are dying almost daily in Afganistan, you have the audacity to announce cuts to the services in an attempt to balance the books after bailing out the banks, who got themselves into financial trouble due to greed!\nMost absurd amongst these cuts is the decision to close RAF Cottesmore and reduce the number of Harrier squadrons! The harrier airframe is the 'weapon of choice' in the Afgan theatre, having flown thousands of missions in support of our men on the ground. Thier replacement by the Tornado has yet to bear fruit and will overall be less effective.\nAdd to this the fact that the reasoning behind this atrocity is to purchase 22 Chinook helicopters which have not yet been built and will be unavailable before your 'alleged' withdrawal forecasts and the fact we already have a number of Chinook Mk3 airframes which you have decided not to support and are right now in the process of de-modding prior to them being re-modded!!",
