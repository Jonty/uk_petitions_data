            "background": "Since only a tiny fraction of the population attends church services each Sunday, it no longer makes sense to restrict trading for religious reasons. The demand for longer trading hours on Sunday is clear - and many larger shops respond to this demand by opening early for \"browsing\" before they are allowed to start selling goods. From personal experience, being unable to buy milk on a Sunday evening is highly inconvenient and the reasons behind it are now obsolete.",
