        "background": "Since the smoking ban has come into force many pubs and hotels are closing. Many people are losing their livelihood all thanks to this ban. If the pub/hotel has the facility then why not have a smoking room? People go to these places to socialsie but thanks to this ban it has stopped many people going out. However it has been noticed that politicians are allowed to smoke in certain places. It should not be one rule for one and another for others.",
