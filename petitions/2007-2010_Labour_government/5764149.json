If there is an accident its perfectly normal for major roads to be closed for 4-5 hours while the relevant departments crawl into life and get the roads cleared.  Someone should be held accountable for this.  If the government had to pay out some sort of compensation to affected motorists then maybe we'd see accidents cleared and roads reopened more quickly.",
