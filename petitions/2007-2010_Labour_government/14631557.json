Withdrawing from the latest African Nations Cup after 3 members of their squad were shot and killed whilst traveling to the games.\n\nThis is a total farce and should not be allowed.\n\nEurope should stand by Togo and allow them to at least to be allowed to participate in the qualifiers for the 2012 European Championships.\n\nWhat better message can Europe send to Togo that we stand by them and welcome them to play football with us.\n\nSport unites.",
