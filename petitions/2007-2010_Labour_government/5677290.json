            "background": "Nelson Mandela was convicted of terrorist offences in South Africa in 1964 and sentenced to life prisonment. At a time when the western world is engaged in a War against Terrorism, and our troops are being killed daily in the fight against international terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is highly offensive in the extreme that a bust \"honouring\" this terrorist\nleader should be allowed to remain in London. The Prime Minister should use his influence to have it removed\nimmediately and replaced by a memorial honouring the victims of international terrorism and those who risk their lives combating this evil.",
