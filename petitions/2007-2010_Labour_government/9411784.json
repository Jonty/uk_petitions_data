            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Council is considering plans for 'traffic calming'  along Redcar Lane, (ie. pinch points, electronic signs).  see:- http://www.redcar-cleveland.gov.uk/PressRel.nsf/Published/B82F28F9F1EAAC0E802573DE002FF18E?OpenDocument\n\nSpeed activated signs are an excellent idea. But, they need to look at innovative solutions rather than punitive tactics. Redcar Lane has had, 6,6,7,8,6 accidents over 5 yrs: remarkable considering the inc. in pop. on the Mickledales. \n\nThis will shift traffic elsewhere. Next year we will no doubt 'need' the same on Kirkleatham Lane, then West Dyke Rd the year after and so on. In 10 yrs Redcar will be impassable, how did we let it happen? Already:-\n\n\u00b7 Redcar Lane \u2013 parts 40mph to 30mph \n\u00b7 Greenstones Rd \u2013 pinch points  \n\u00b7 Plantation Rd \u2013 60 to 30 + pinch points\n\u00b7 Redcar Rd \u2013 60 to 30\n\u00b7 Coast Rd (Green Lane to Marske) 60 to 40\n\u00b7 Esplanade \u2013 rumble, speed cushions, speed bumps\n\u00b7 Lord St. \u2013 traffic light central\n\u00b7 Over 30 other roads affected by pinch points and speed bumps.",
