        "background": "In current financial climate MPs should NOT be given a \u00a310,000 pay rise whilst the public suffer.  The electorate struggle to survive and do not get huge pay rises, MP\u2019s should NOT be given this huge pay rise, when they have abused our trust over their expenses. Pay rises should be decided by an independent body which consists of at least 50% ordinary people as its taxpayers money. \n\nThe expenses that MPs have claimed, it is a disgrace  that the expenses published have been blackout in parts and is a cover up. Especially when MPs are required by law to publish their addresses on election.  It is we the public to whom MPs are supposed to be our representatives should be accountable to us and all information should be published as it\u2019s our money that\u2019s being paid to them.  We call on the Prim minister to dismiss those that have decided to cover up parts of the files, and to publish in full all expenses",
