            "background": "It is difficult to determine exactly how many units of alcohol are in a bottle of wine for example.  By amending the labelling to show per glass/half bottle/full bottle it might be easier to establish proximity to maximum units prior to consumption.  Additionally, if calorific intake were also shown in this way it is likely to reduce/prevent excessive consumption.",
