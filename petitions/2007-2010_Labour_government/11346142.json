Noise from a Mosquito would almost certainly also be actionable as a civil common law nuisance. The government says it has 'no plans to ban the device', but such a ban would be superfluous anyway as they are already illegal.\n\n\"This should be banned. My daughter cannot do her full paper round as the sound is excruciating. She gets actual pain from this. This must be a criminal offence!\"\n\nElaine Kimber, Milton Keynes, UK\n\nI for one agree with these comments whole heartedly and this is why i emplore you to sign this petition and rid the streets of these discriminating and demonising devices.",
