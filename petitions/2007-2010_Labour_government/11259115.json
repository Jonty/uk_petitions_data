            "background": "Following the acquittal by jury, of six Greenpeace protesters in September 2008, of charges of Criminal Damage following a demonstration at Kingsnorth power station in Kent, the attorney general is attempting to force Judges to deal with such accusations more harshly. \n\nThis runs against global opinion: the result of the jury trial in question attracted praise from The New York Times as 'one of the ideas of the year'. This was a result of the jury's conclusion that, following evidence from NASA Climate scientist Jim Hansen amongst others, the defence of 'lawful excuse' was justifiable as it was intended to prevent greater damage to property from the imminent threat of global warming.\n\nThe attorney general is attempting to reverse a jury's decision, and undermine further the right to lawful and legitimate protest in this country. Please sign this petition to try to prevent this happening.",
