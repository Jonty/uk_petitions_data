            "background": "It has been suggested that the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) which celebrates the sacrifice of those who flew during the 2nd World War, will be cut in the next round of defence cuts.  This will be a travesty if it goes ahead.  The BBMF costs a mere \u00a33m a year, less than 0.1% of the defence budget. It is a great delight for all who see their displays, and the memory of 'The Few' will be lost.  Please vote to ensure that the BBMF is not closed.",
