        "background": "We are asking the Prime Minister agree his Government will look into and stop disabled discrimination and wrongful or illegal taking of Tax and Vat duties off disabled people, who are exempt from paying tax and vat duties on good's and service's for their disabilities, but provider's of these good's and service's for disabled people's own disabilities, have and are wrongfully and illegally charging tax and vat duties to disabled people who are legally exempt. We also ask the Government to agree to actually issue disabled people who are entitled to Disability Tax and Vat Duties Exemption, with a new type of Disability Tax and Vat Duties Exemption Card, with a personal Disability Tax and Vat Duties Exemption number on it etc.  Which when buying good's and service's for their disability, they just present to a provider of good's and service's for their disabilities, this card instead of paying tax and vat duties, which would stop this type of disabled discrimination and wrongful taking of tax and vat duties from disabled people who are exempt.",
