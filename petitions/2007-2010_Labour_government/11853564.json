            "background": "Over recent months cedit card companies have vastly increased interest rates on a risk assesment basis. Where this interest rate nears 30% APR the minimum repayment barely covers the monthly interest.\n\nCredit ratings for individuals maybe fair or poor,loans are required at low interest rates if the population has any hope to combat this recession.  Loans are not available to clear significant borrowings. Therefore despite large monthly repayments the outstanding debt is not reduced. Therefore no disposable income is created to stimulate the economy.\n\nThe bank could directly clear the credit account and close it.Cards destroyed. Credit ratings to be marked to indicate caution on any new card issued until 50%of the loan is cleared.\nThis could work in a similar way to a voluntary arrangement with creditors without the stigma of bankruptcy or risking ones home.",
