            "background": "Bates the Hatters.  A shop for Londoners and some lucky tourists.  The site on which it sits is part of plans by the crown commissioners to redevelop the historic Jermyn Street, famed for its quality, independent mens outfitters. \nThe commissioners have these businesses now on short lessees.  They intend expelling them for three years and there is no promise of rent levels or lease length upon return.  No small business could stand that. \nBates can never make vast profits but (like the crown itself) it adds to the colour, the history and the fun of London; a proper affordable men's hat shop.\n If the Crown Commissioners can't defend that then they have no right owning and managing these huge swathes of land in London",
