        "background": "I feel that mobile speed cameras should be banned in britain. I feel that i am in the majority with my view, and feel that there are enough fixed cameras in dangerous sites. Mobile speed cameras goes against the governments policy of not making revenue from motorists, as ofcourse they are hidden away away from the eye. \nThe RAC has a statistic that 2/3 of all drivers in britain do not obey the 30mph speed limit, so why are these mobile speed cameras there to punish the majority? It must be perfectly safe if the majority of all drivers do it?\n\nThese mobile speed vans often operate at ridicilous hours, when the road in question is not even dangerous, and hide away so that the motorist can not see it. How is this not there just to generate revenue?\n\nThis money that will be saved by not having mobile speed van should be shifted to catching the real criminals out there, the ones who drive without insurance and tax. So there should be an increase of ANPR vans.",
