        "action": "Allow the NHS to manufacture it's own basic pharmaceutical drugs",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is to enable the NHS to manufacture and sell it's own pharmaceutical drugs eg. Penicillin. Much of the NHS budget is provisioned for drugs, the NHS should be enabled to manufacture its own Pharmaceuticals and to sell them openly to the british public.  This would help bolster the NHS budget which is currently suffering considerably because of well meaning decisions that have cost more than was expected (eg. centralisation - a good idea which could work out with the right budget). Excess stock could be given or sold to the third world at a discount price - thus providing a drastic decrease in public spending and a massive political plus for the party implementing. This is an obvious win-win policy. Please give it your serious consideration and vote according to your feelings on the matter - bear in mind that if properly implemented, this policy alone could turn the NHS around in a couple of years and allow us to keep all of our emergency facilities open.",
