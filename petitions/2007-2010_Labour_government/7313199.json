            "background": "I propose that real ale is taxed at a lower rate to lager and imported beers as different socio-economic factors apply.\n\nIt is part of the UK's history and culture and is often enjoyed by tourists as such.\n\nIt is not part of the 'night-time' economy and the culture of alcohol abuse which absorbs police and nhs resources.\n\nReducing duty would have little impact on the bottom line but at the same time be a very popular gesture by government to people out here who have massive mortgages, high petrol and food bills...and would like a nice pint of real ale at the end of a long working week.",
