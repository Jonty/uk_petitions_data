        "background": "The abandoned/failed tests that have occurred in Geneva with the beam collider have proved that the scientists involved do not know what they are doing. They are risking the future existance of the planet with these tests. I do not recall a vote on wether the tests should be carried out by the public/population of the planet. As they did not ask the permission to do these tests I suggest they stop. Is it more important for the individuals involved to win a Nobel prize or the contination of life on this planet?",
