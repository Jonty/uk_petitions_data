They are risking the future existance of the planet with these tests. I do not recall a vote on wether the tests should be carried out by the public/population of the planet. As they did not ask the permission to do these tests I suggest they stop. Is it more important for the individuals involved to win a Nobel prize or the contination of life on this planet?",
