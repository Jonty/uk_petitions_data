Those times have now passed, however unions have continued to grow in size and power meaning that we, the British public, are regularly held to ransom as unions pursue extortionate and unreasonable demands (e.g. large pay rises in a recession when inflation is dropping and unemployment is approaching 10%).\n\nIt is essential that parliament legislates to limit union powers before they do any further damage to the British economy, and before they kill any more industries as they did with the once thriving automotive sector.",
