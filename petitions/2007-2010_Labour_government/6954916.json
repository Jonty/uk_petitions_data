            "background": "We the undersigned call for realistic, affordable and achievable proposals to ensure that all health care premises are clean and reduce the possibility of infection to the minimum reasonably possible.  The prime ministers recent statement that all hospitals are to be \u201cdeep cleaned\u201d is unrealistic, impractical and is a waste of tax payers\u2019 money.  The Prime Minister knows that this is nothing more than a gimmick.  It is neither practical nor cost effective.  Such ridiculous statements mislead the public and offend hard working professionals.  Whilst it might create the illusion of a Government that is talking tough and taking action it is in real terms meaningless.  This view is supported by anyone who understands the challenge that is faced.  No one can argue with the need for cleanliness in all healthcare premises or understate the terrible effect that infection has on those who suffer the consequences.  But please be honest and practical; stop the rhetoric, look at the research, listen to the right people and act responsibly. Then hold those who fail their duty accountable.",
