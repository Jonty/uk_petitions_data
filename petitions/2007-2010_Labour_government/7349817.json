            "background": "The British Home Nations Championship was the oldest tournament of its kind. The last time a Home Nations Championship was held was back in 1984 when Northern Ireland won the tournament on goal difference with a team including Martin O\u2019Neill and Norman Whiteside.  Over the previous 100 years, England won the event on 54 occasions which was 13 more times than Scotland.\n\nThe British people are all disappointed that every one of the Home Nations has failed to qualify for Euro 2008.  The F.A is expected to lose in excess of \u00a315 Million in lost revenue.\n\nTo maintain the outstanding momentum of British football fever, passion & patriotism, we, the British Public, ask for the support of the British Government to apply suitable & necessary pressure & guidance towards the F.A in order to stage such a tournament in Summer, 2008.\n\nAlthough it is a matter for the F.A to decide; with the backing of a large proportion of the British Public & The British Government, we all hope the F.A will consider our request.",
