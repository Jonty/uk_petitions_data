        "background": "EHLERS DANLOS is a syndrome for which there is no known treatment. So there is no cure. It is an inherited disorder of collagen. The skin bruises easily and any wounds are difficult to heal leaving paper-thin scar tissue. The joints become loose and frequently dislocate leaving the sufferer in unbearable pain. Internal bleeding also occurs. I should like money put towards research into this debilitating disease.",
