            "background": "We would like the government to end the current drive towards creating a multi-cultural Britain.  The current uncontrolled immigration policy is unacceptable as it waters down the British way of life and does nothing to integrate immigrants into the 'British' society, instead leads to ghettoism and reduces the standard of life of the existing citizens.  The Government should have a controlled immigration policy and a set of laws that require everyone to work towards retaining the essence of 'Britishness' that we wish to retain.  Foreign faiths and cultures should be accepted within a framework of British rules and not allowed to overpower or undermine the essential way of life in the UK.",
