        "background": "It has come to our attention that the University of East London, Docklands campus have lowered the residential internet connection, in reducing the bandwidth.\n\nThey have sent out an email on Tuesday 27th November 2007 to all students stating this and said it will be temporary.\n\nThe issue students are all facing, is that because of a minority of people who are abusing the facilities, the majority who are living on campus, are suffering.\n\nStudents cannot view the UEL Direct portal properly, which gives them access to vital information and when contacting the relevant IT support team, they are told the internet will be slow for the whole year.\n\nThey urge for some support in this serious matter, as know one is acknowledging the problem students are facing.",
