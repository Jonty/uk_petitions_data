            "background": "Existing homeowners who have they mortgage wih Northern Rock where by the bank advanced them 125% LTV should be passed over to the Goverment in order to ensure fair treatment of those customers.  The interest could then be charged at the current Bank of England rate which will ensure quick replayment of mortages.  Then Northern Rock should then have to repay the taxpayers money direct to the Goverment or face closure, which is how the Northern Rock customers are being treated.\nThe burdon on the taxpayer would be less, the well being of the customers who are being punished for being forced to stay with the Goverment bank, and utimatley nly heading to far harder times that the rest f homeowners.  This is not treating customers fairly when the SVR i way above the industia average, the excuse of convincing Northern Rock customers to go else where is no longer valid, the current customer are stuck with them. Stop making  these customers a number, these customers are tax payers too.",
