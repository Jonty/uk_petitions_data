        "action": "Completely abolish the tolls on both the Severn bridges",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Although the second Severn crossing is owned by a private company, apparently the money levied by the tolls on this bridge has outweighed the total cost of building it.  So why are we still being charged?  Moreover, why should we be charged to cross any bridge that provides such vital access to Wales/England not only to businesses but also to those with family and social ties?  The bridges are roads like any other, and we do not get charged to use them.  We also do not get charged for crossing from England into Scotland, so why from England into Wales?  This is effectively punishing those with aforementioned family ties/business links and is especially unfair to those who are on low incomes or even now struggling on middle incomes.  These unfair tolls have to go, and never be reinstated.",
