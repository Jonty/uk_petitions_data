            "background": "Many motorists seem to think they can choose their own personal speed limits and that they can make their own decisions about road safety. They ignore pedestrians unable to cross roads, the increased noise pollution, air pollution and general unpleasantness they create when speeding along urban and rural roads. They ignore children unable to walk by themselves, to play out and to travel independently. They ignore the elderly and disabled who are unable to cross roads. The law is blatantly broken with impunity everyday by many motorists. Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear and everything to gain by having the law enforced. Many motorists are also parents, pedestrians and have the capacity to think of others.",
