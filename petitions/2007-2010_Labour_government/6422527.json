The people of Britain have had enough of sneering thugs getting away with callous acts of assault, vandalism, cruelty, and a whole plethora of crimes. Even when caught and dealt with by the courts the punishments received are no deterrent to committing crime\u2019s again in the future, and usually no more than an insult to the victim. \nIt\u2019s time to wipe the callous smirking grins off of these thugs\u2019 faces once and for all, and for the British public to have the protection of a punishment that really would deter criminals, The Birch.",
