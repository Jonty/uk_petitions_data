            "background": "Harvey Parry is a 22 month old body who surprised his doctors by recovering from meningitis, which he contracted a week after he first started to walk. However, for poor Harvey he had to have both his legs and a part of his right hand amputated to survive. Shockingly he cannot get prosthetic legs he desperately needs on the NHS, so his parents will have to pay for them expensively privately. The NHS claims to have stocks of prosthetic legs for adults and older children only. This is a serious case of the NHS failing those who are most in need of the services we, the tax paying public, fund. This cannot be allowed to continue. This little boy should be given the chance to walk again, the NHS must pay for the prosthetic legs.",
