        "background": "In order to allow  Gypsy/Travellers gain accommodation that is culturally acceptable. . Many do not travel for an economic purpose as required by the current definition (as interpreted by the courts) but have known no other life that that of living in caravans Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers have a recognised cultural aversion to bricks and mortar accommodation. It causes great sadness and real hurt that, despite the new Gypsy and Traveller planning circular (ODPM 01/2006) Those genuine families are deemed not to be gypsies for the purposes of planning law and have to endure many year of expense and duress to gain planning permission on their own land.\nIt would aid the goal of CLG to increase the present provision within the next 5 years  \nTo ensure the accommodation needs of all members of the ethnic minorities composed of Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers were recognised within and met by the planning system. This would also comply with the respect for the way of life of these traditional minorities that the European Court of Human Rights has held Article 8 of European Convention on Human Rights implies (Chapman v United Kingdom)",
