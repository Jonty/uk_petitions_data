            "background": "The BBC was once a British institution, producing high-quality output as a public service broadcsater.\n\nHowever, it has now become institutionally biased and is therefore not representative of those licence fee payers who fund it.\n\nIt also shows a complete disregard for money, spending as if money 'grows on trees'.\n\nUnless the BBC can produce unbiased output, taxpayers should not be forced to fund the extravagances of the BBC.\n\nThe BBC must survive by means of market forces to ensure it becomes more neutral and show that it can be financially responsible; this means privatising the BBC.",
