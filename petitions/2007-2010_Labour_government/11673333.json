            "background": "The young people of Denbighshire deserve the choice of where they receive their further education.  Presently the students of Blessed Edward Jones and Rhyl High School have the choice or remaining in their schools or going to college.  Denbighshire County Council is proposing the closure of both 6th Forms therefore taking away this choice. \nSchool 6th Forms offer students the opportunity to receive their education in a known supported, caring environment. By removing the 6th Forms many young people will not go on to gain further qualifications because they do not wish to attend a college.  6th Forms are essential to ensure that all young people have the opportunity to achieve, to succeed and to fulfil their potential.",
