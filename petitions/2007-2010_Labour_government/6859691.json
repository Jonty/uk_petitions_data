            "action": "Publicly recognise the importance of the Royal Navy to the UK\u2019s interests by pledging to stop further short or long term force and capability reductions throughout the Fleet and increase defence spending to a level commensurate to the current and future threats to UK security",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Reports are again circulating about cuts to the Navy.  In a time of mounting instability, increasing competition for resources and countries like China rapidly re-arming, the threats to our security are on the rise.  The UK is still one of the world's largest economies with global interests reliant on sea-borne trade, demanding mobile, hard-hitting forces to respond to threats to the trade networks that are the basis of our prosperity.  The Royal Navy protects this trade and the RFA provides the mobility and support for the Army and RAF to provide their punch worldwide.  The above facts may not be high on the agenda now but precedent shows our Navy remains out of mind until needed at the last minute (WWII, Falklands etc).  The recent petition to allow the Red Arrows to fly at the 2012 Olympics has over 150,000 signatures.  This petition is a far more crucial issue, so please show your support by signing and forwarding this petition to tell the PM and our part-time Defence Secretary that any cuts threaten the long term security of the UK for minimal short-term benefit.  A 1.5% (below inflation) increase is not enough.",
