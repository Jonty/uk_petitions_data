I would like the govt to do the same for the SATs for 7 year olds (KS1) and 11 year olds (KS2).\nI have seen children leaving school crying their eyes out as their teachers kept on stressing that the SATs are the most important tests you will ever take. No they are not! GCSEs and beyond are considered important.\n\nPlus kids spend 3 months preparing for them and brings morale to an all time low.",
