            "background": "It it my opinion that no party leader should be allowed to stand as Prime Minister for more than two terms as they have in America. I feel that any leader who has stood for longer than two terms has lost their association of their original objectives and link with the public. Also, it may prevent any party getting dogged down with misalligned ideology and keep up to speed with what the public is currently thinking. Who knows it may also reduce voter apathy. I hope you will share my feelings and will sign this petition and see if we can make a difference.",
