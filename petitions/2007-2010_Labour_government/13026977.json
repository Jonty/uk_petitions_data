        "background": "Gorleston pier car park is not only important as parking access for seafront visitors but a place where the elderly and disabled can park in a pleasant location overlooking the sea and take a short walk along the pier for river and more sea views   The given reason for closing the car park is because the surface is uneven.  This is due to neglect over a period of time and only partly true because the small area which has been used until recently is in excellent condition.\nThe area is in a conservation area and part of Gorleston heritage and the resorts appeal to visitors.\nThe only use for this area for many years has been as a carpark, otherewise it would be an untidy barren area in the wrong place.  The cost to the Port Authority or Borough Council to improve the whole area for parking would be minimal compared to some other expenditures.",
