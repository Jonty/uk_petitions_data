Why should taxpayers pay for a life sentence of the guilty when they took baby Peter's life and gave him 18 months of torture.  Rehabilitation will not solve this problem.  Children need to be protected.  Where is your protection for them?  It seems you are protecting the perpetators.",

            "background": "My petition is to keep children safe.  Safe from paedophiles and murderers.  Children are our future and we should nourish them and not allow those who prey on them to survive at the taxpayers expense.  These criminals give no thought to the young and defenceless.  Indeed, they only use those weaker than themselves for their own sadistic and sexual benefit.  I implore you Prime Minister to re-think your answer.  You are only condoning their outrageous and horrific behaviour.",
