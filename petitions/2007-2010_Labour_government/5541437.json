        "background": "The Scottish Executive pays the tuition fees of Scottish students at Scottish universities.  European Union law requires that they also pay the fees of EU students from outside the UK studying at Scottish universities.  However, students from other parts of the United Kingdom are required to pay.  Although a German student can study in Edinburgh without paying tuition fees, a Welsh student must pay.  This is just one example of the injustices created by the devolution settlement.  Whilst we undersigned recognise the devolved authorities' right to subsidise public services differently from other parts of the UK, it is not fair that they should discriminate between people from different parts of the UK and EU in the provision and pricing of major public services.",
