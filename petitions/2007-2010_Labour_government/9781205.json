            "background": "If a parent pays for child maintenance prior to Tax an N.I. the parent with care would receive the same amount of money but it would not cripple the absent parent when they also have responsibilities. This would be more like paying for child-care before tax, i.e. the current legislation. This would encourage more absent parents to pay, some of which have not paid for years. This in turn would take some of the pressures off the CSA tracking them down and chasing payment.",
