            "background": "Review the use of Indirect taxation. 1. fuel tax, this impacts on rural communities and the low paid and is a large factor in food price increases. In some areas it is also leading to an increase in crime.\n2. council tax, this has increased year on year due to reduced goverment funding and increases in police costs. Again, this impacts on the low paid and on the retired in our society. \nIn summary indirect taxation impacts most on those who can least afford to pay.",
