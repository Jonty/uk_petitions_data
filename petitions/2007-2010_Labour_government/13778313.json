            "background": "Recruitment agencies, particulary in accountancy recruitment, use phrases like \"newly qualified\" \"recently qualified\" \"3 to 4 year's PQE\" to target a specific age group (in this case 25 to 38 years old).  Having challenged this practice in the employment tribunals, I have been obliged to pay costs of \u00a310,000.00 to a major PLC who uses these pharses in advertising on their website and also \u00a34800.00 to smaller recruiter.  In fact I may have to pay up to \u00a3140,000.00 more to other agencies (from my part-time income).  Employment judges accept that these phrases are discriminatory.  The Equality Commission should have responsibility for challenging these advertisements but so far they have either failed to act or claimed that they do not have the power to act against advertisements that discriminate on grounds of age, when this practice has been brought to their attention.  In fact,a European Court case called \"Belgian Equality Commission v Firma Freyn\" clarified that they do indeed, have the power to act against any discriminatory advertisements and it is imperative that they do act to stem this waste of highly qualified talent who are denied access to the jobs market.",
