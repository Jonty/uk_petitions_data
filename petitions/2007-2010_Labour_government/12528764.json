She has fallen pregnant whilst she has been in prison. \n\nIt is axiomatic that the rule of law is non-existent in Laos, and that they have breached international laws in relation to torture and foreign prisoners. \n\nI ask the PM and those within the Foreign Office to act judiciously and promptly in assisting her and her family.",
