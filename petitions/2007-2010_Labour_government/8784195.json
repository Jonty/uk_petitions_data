People who are on a section of the Mental Health Act are detained against their will and at the moment smoke outside but this will stop in july. How unfair is this as the majoriry of patients are there through no fault of their own as opposed to prisoners.The people who make these uninformed decisions don't have to put up with the patients, some of whom kick off when they have NO cigs.Please think again as this could also be detrimental to their recovery.",
