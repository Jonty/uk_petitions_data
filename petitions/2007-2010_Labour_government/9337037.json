        "background": "Petrol and Diesel have risen by more than 20% in less than 8 months! This is far higher than inflation and interest rates and with road tax going up too is making it too expensive to go to work (even on public transport). We know we pay a stupid amount of tax in this country and we accept it. But 20% in less than 8 months is ridiculous. Why should we pay more for our fuel than most other countries?",
