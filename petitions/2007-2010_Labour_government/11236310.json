I have today received several junk texts, costing me \u00a313.50 in total.  I have not asked for these texts, and keep texting STOP to these, costing me more money, only to be sent more texts, costing more money, saying you are off the list.  This is NOT fair on the poor individuals who receive these texts.  The phone companies dont stop them, or do anything to stop them.  Its time to ban them, or make them ALL free.",
