            "background": "This petition is designed to encourage use of public transport in urban areas by students studying in comprehensive schools around the UK. The suggestion is to allow students to use buses in urban areas to travel free of charge.\n\nThis would reduce the number of cars on the roads which is fast becoming a significant issue in the battle against climate change. Also present is the point that public transport encourages independance within young people radiating to other areas later in life.",
