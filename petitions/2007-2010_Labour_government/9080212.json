        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With modern cars able to drive effortlessly at 80mph. A raising of the limits to this would be a good move as I drive over 30K miles a year and have seen so many accidents being caused by drivers suddenly slowing for speed cameras. Just raising the limit is not enough as a tougher penalty system for those found doing excess of the limit would also be called for, i.e more points awarded and a higher fine, also if banned compulsory resiting of driving test. along with this the speed limit in urban areas should be reduced to 20mph with the same  penalties applying. This would ease motorway bottlenecks at known camera sites as most of the cars on the motorway tend to travel at an average of 75 - 85 mph.",
