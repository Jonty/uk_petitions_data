            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To encourage people to aspire, yet suffocate greed, tax should be levelled on all income, bonuses, golden hand-shakes and pensions at the rate of 60% for the above inclusive incomes above \u00a3100,000, with an increase of 5% tax for each \u00a350,000 step above the aforesaid, to \u00a3450,000 p.a., when the final increase would be 99% tax for incomes above \u00a3500,000. \nThis enables people to strive, but ego-trip incomes will actually cost such people in financial terms. The public would be less outraged by ridiculous incomes, pensions, bonuses and \u2018handshakes\u2019 if they knew the bulk of it would go back into the public purse.\nThis needs to be agreed across all countries of the world, so that very high earners don't play one country off against another.\nThis should also be applied in retrospect to the last 15 years, as well as to future earnings.",
