        "background": "These plastic bin liners much like single use plastic carrier bags are a threat to the environment and are totally unnecessary. They are only used for hygiene purposes. It is very easy to wash out the unlined bins after use. This is what happened in the days before plastic. \n\nTo prevent bins becoming messy, all that is necessary to do is to compost any food waste and to ensure that there is as little food waste as possible in the first place by not over ordering at the shops eg buying one and getting one free and then throwing away the unused food.\n\nIf you must line your bins then you can now buy paper liners or you can make your own liners from newspaper, but paper is better recycled.",
