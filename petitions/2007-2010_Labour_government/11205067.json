            "background": "Hi there,\nI think genetically modified crops are extremely dangerous to the Earth and could have disastrous consequences for human health.I am asking that the prime minister look at the evidence at hand with regards to GMO and that he must make every effort to ensure that GMO's do not ever become part of the food supply in the UK.I think a far better idea would be for the prime minister to further fund and expand the ORGANIC farming industry and allow this to be the UK's main,long term permanent souce for food \nThanks for reading!!",
