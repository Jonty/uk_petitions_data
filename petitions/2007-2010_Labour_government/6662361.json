            "background": "The moral issue here is that preventative action must be taken against companies, individuals and organisations that seek to exploit the fundamental concepts of Religion in order to make money. Sign the petition if you believe that Religion should be decommercialised and unintrusive in mainstream media. This is to say that no religion can lobby via media outsources for public funding including the dismissal of all forms of media adverts. This is strictly to include preventative action against the broadcasting of \"Religious\" healers who would profit from such advertising, the ideology of religious cults and general profiteering from organised Religions.",
