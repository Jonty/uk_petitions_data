        "background": "Petitions are invariably rejected and not published on this site when any existing petition covers the same subject, even if the existing petition is eccentric, badly worded, badly argued or puts forward a different policy.  This has happened (for example) over a petition to remove bishops from the House of Lords and is currently happening over the planned state visit of the pope. This prevents members of the public raising legitimate issues in sensible ways and negates the purpose of the site.  The staff concerned, who currently rarely even reply to protests about the rejection of petitions, should exercise flexibility and good sense over such petitions in future.",
