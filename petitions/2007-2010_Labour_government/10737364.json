            "background": "On 6th September 2008 the England national football team played their first qualifying match for the 2012 World Cup. They were away to Andorra. TV rights for this match were owned by Setanta. Unlike previous international matches, no highlights were shown on free-to-view terrestrial TV channels meaning that the only way to see the game was to subscribe to Setanta or invest in one of their delivery systems. Football is England's national sport and everyone in England should have the right to see the national team play. The Scots should have similar rights to see the Scottish team play. The Welsh should be able to see the Welsh team play and the Northern Irish should be able to see the Northern Irish team play.",
