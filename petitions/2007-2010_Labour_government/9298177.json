        "action": "Stop giving Banks money to bail them out if they dont pass on interest rate cuts.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why should the government give banks any money to help to with the \"credit crunch\" which they themselves helped to create the problem and then refuse to pass on interest rate cuts to their customers, the money they will be given will be from the tax payers that they refuse to help by reducing the interest rates on current mortgages.\n\n  We the tax payers may potentialy lose out on the tax we have paid if house prices continue to drop, and if the banks dont pass on the interest cuts we are losing out even more, while bank fat cats get richer.\n\nI have no doubt that the credit crunch will also affect the outcome of the test case involving banks and the office of fair trading, in the banks favour which will again leave the hard working people worse off, again treated badly as we are only the little men and have as much say as a mute in these matters.",
