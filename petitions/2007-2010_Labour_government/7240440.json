These include courses leading to registation as a:\n\nDoctor, dentist, chiropodist, podiatrist, dietician, occupational therapist, orthoptist, physiotherapist, prosthetist, orthotist, radiographer, audiologist, speech and language therapist, dental hygienist, dental therapist, nurse, midwife, and operating department practitioner.\n\nWe believe that funding should also be provided to students studying courses that lead to registration as a Paramedic. Currently there is no funding for these students, who have to pay their own tuition fees and are not eligible for NHS student bursaries.",
