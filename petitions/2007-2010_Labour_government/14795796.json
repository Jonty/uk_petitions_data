Only to be told I would get \u00a364 a week, this is to cover a mortgage, bills, food, travel and expense of finding a job and getting to interviews. Great thanks very helpful! I was told everyone gets this now so they don't get cosy on the dole for the first three months. Cosy I will probably starve to death and lose my house then you will have to pay even more to house me? I am not a scrounger I want a job but there are hardly any and I have never claimed a penny in my life. I was also told my liefstyle choices were my problem if I wanted to maintain them! I am so glad I have paid for everything for all my life only to turn to the government for help and to be treated like a dosser!",
