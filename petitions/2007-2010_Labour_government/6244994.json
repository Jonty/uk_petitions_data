        "action": "Reduce the amount of articulated vehicles on the British highways and ultimately phase out road freight altogether in favour of rail/canal freight.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Long and short haul lorry freight causes a great deal of damage to our highways infrastructure. The majority of motorway accidents are caused by lorries. They cause congestion when they amble alongside each other on motorways, and not to mention the amount of pollution they discharge. It is in the intersts of the country and the environment to promote rail or canal freight by extending both of the aforementioned infrastructures, and gradually phase out non-essential (ie emergency services, military and such like) highway transportation.\nThank you for reading.",
