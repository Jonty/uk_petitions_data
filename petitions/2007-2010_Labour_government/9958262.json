            "background": "When civil servants and politicians are giving away taxpayer pounds to compensate individuals for their or other taxpayer funded unlawful activities then the amount awarded should NOT be kept secret.  When the individuals who are acting in such a manner as to cause these cases to come up start paying for their activities out of their own pocket, then they can keep the amounts awarded secret. Until that day arrives the taxpayer has a basic human right to know what his or her taxes are being used to pay for.",
