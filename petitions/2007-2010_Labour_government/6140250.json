Think of the money which can be used on better things and how happy people would be.\nIf the bible is so holy we can respect and love our neighbour for and not spend money is military warfare most of which is never going to be used anyway.\nMany people share this opinion so respect this and we all need a helping hand.\nMilitary might save it for the necessaties, true we do need some defence but not waste on nuclear weaapons and star wars.\nMy message is not knew, others have complained.\nPlease join forces make the world leaders make the world into more humble place to live without the use of weapons. We would all feel much better.",
