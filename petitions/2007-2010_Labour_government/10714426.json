This was one of the most barbaric petitions I've read on this site in almost 2 years of logging on to it; using nuclear weapons would have an ABSOLUTELY APPALLING effect on the citizens of any \"rogue country\" in which this happened and even if it was possible (which I doubt) to restrict their use to the leaders of any \"rogue country\" this would still be a barbaric and totally disproportionate response (whatever the country had done; short of attacking us with nuclear weapons).  In any case what does the creator of this petition think would be the reaction of any country seeing these weapons winging their way to it?  Obviously to send some OUR way!",
