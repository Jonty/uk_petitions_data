            "background": "The French government are withdrawing health care cover for thousands of EU expats living in France.  Most if not all British ex-pats are issued with a Form E106 by DWP when they leave the UK on a permanent basis.  Assuming that these people have paid National Insurance contributions all their working lives why can HM Government not extend those forms E106 until the holder reaches State Retirement Age at which point the French healthcare system will once again cover them?  After all, when they leave the UK they are automatically expelled from the NHS and so are not being a drain on UK resources and would satisfy the French regime at the same time.  Simple solution for a traumatic problem for thousands of ex-pats surely?",
