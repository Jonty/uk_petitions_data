            "background": "Most of Europe's Legal drinking age is 16 so why do we have to be different? France for instance, you never here of any trouble there but in America where its 21 theres more shootings and crime in general as people turn to drugs instead as anyone can get those, drugs are a big thing with under age people as they cannot go out and walk the streets and because they cant get served for alcohol they choose anfetamines and ecstacy for fun. Under age drinking is a novelty once you become legal to buy alcohol you dont see the point where as when your under 18 you want to get as drunk as possible! Therefore i believe that the legal drinking age should be lowered to 16.",
