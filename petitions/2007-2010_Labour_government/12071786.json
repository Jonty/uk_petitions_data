The government will never make the tough decisions to reduce car usage so it simply chooses to milk the motorist although they provide us with no alternatives. Charging motorists more without the choices we need will not change our behaviour until it fundamentally changes its transportation policy. Furthermore the parlous state of the economy, coupled with the weakness of the pound against the dollar means we the British Motorist cannot afford the increase and will not just lie back and watch our hard earned taxes frittered away by incompetent government ministers.",
