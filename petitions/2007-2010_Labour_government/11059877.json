Now, internet technology has made it possible for each member of the electorate to represent himself / herself. \n\nEach voter should elect his MP, by intenet, and change his MP at any time, by internet (doing away with the need for General Elections).\n\nEach MP should be able to cast not one vote but a number of votes equal to the number of voters that he represents less the number \u00b4his /her\u00b4 voters that have chosen to vote for themselves (on a particular issue).\n\nMost voters would choose, most of the time, not to vote directly but to let their MP cast their vote for them. Shortly before a vote is taken the MP should declare (on his web-site) how he intends to vote and why. Voters need only to vote for themselves if they disagree with their MPs decision.",
