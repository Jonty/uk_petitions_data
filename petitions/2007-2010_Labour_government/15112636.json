We have a democratic right to overturn authority held be Trade Unions over Corporates like British Airways when it is for the greater good of the UK. In this instance some 7500 people are affecting circa 1 million people directly and many more indirectly. This therefore has a negative effect on the economy and individual tax payers. We herby request a review of Trade Unions power and responsibility in situations like these in order to put an end to this situation, avoid future similar disruption and restore faith in employment law and corporate infrastructure/responsibility.",
