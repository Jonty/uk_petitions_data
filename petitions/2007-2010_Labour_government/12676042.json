            "background": "Any income that is sacrificed ceases to be salary and so is not subject to either income tax or National Insurance charges. \n\nAt present, the only options for salary sacrifice are;\n* Childcare vouchers\n* Workplace parking \n* Cyle to work schemes\n\nIn the current economic climate, it is unlikely that many commuters will be awarded a pay rise that covers the totally unfair and unrealistic fare increases that rail companies insist on levying so I propose that season ticket loans offered by employers can be paid for via salary sacrifice. \n\nWith fares increasing year on year, it will not be long before it becomes to expensive and commuters have no option but to give up on public transport altogether and revert back to driving to work. This would not only be disastrous to the environment but cause chaos on motorways and in city centres.",
