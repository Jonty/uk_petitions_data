        "background": "The charity For Dementia, provides a vital service called \"Admiral Nurses\" who are specialist dementia nurses, working within the NHS, providing advice and support to carers of people with dementia. Unfortunately there are not enough Admiral Nurses in the country. Supporting people living with dementia is a national priority, as set out in the National Dementia Strategy. \nAs Patron of For Dementia, John Suchet says, \u201cHaving access to an Admiral Nurse is currently a postcode lottery. How can that possibly be right? Every dementia carer should have access to an Admiral Nurse.\u201d  The number of people living with dementia is forecast to double within a generation.\nBy 2025 there will be over 1 million people living with dementia in the UK. I urge you to provide more Admiral Nurses now.",
