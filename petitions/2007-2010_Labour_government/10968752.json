            "background": "The recent focus on the City has been a reminder that the UK is still hugely London-centric.  London is a truly great city, perhaps the greatest in the world, but it is not this country\u2019s only asset and we need to focus much more strongly on our other cities and regions.  Recent years have seen huge sums of money invested in regional development but it has been spent in a largely uncoordinated way.  \n \nWe need a small group of people in each city and region, who can lobby in Westminster, direct Government spending on a local level and be accountable for it.  Mercifully, we do not need to appoint a fresh band of bureaucrats, we can entrust the job to the MPs for the given city or region.  \n \nThey should supervise the local activities and spending of Government departments and quangos and they can be held accountable for their actions or lack of actions.  They should champion their city/region in Westminster, throughout the country and, why not, around the world.",
