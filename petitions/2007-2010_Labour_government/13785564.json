        "action": "Introduce a law which makes a parent responsible for inciting a child to break the law",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There are some parents who either actively encourage or allow their children to break the law. I feel that more should be done to protect the greater community by fining or imprisoning these parents. In the most serious cases then the child should be taken into care and the parent/s should be sent to prison. We seem to be living in an increasingly lawless society where children are allowed to or encouraged to do petty crimes while their parents look on knowing that they can hide behind the law. The rights of the wider, law abiding community, are ignored. Stricter, enforceable laws are required to bring harmony to communities. \nI would be grateful for support with this petition",
