            "background": "Creditors generally will not commence bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor if he has no assets therefore making oneself bankrupt becomes the final option once one is insolvent however, those who reach a stage of petitioning their own BR are rarely in a position to find the fees required to submit documentation to the court.\nCourt fees can be reduced on a means tested basis but fees payable to the Official Receiver have to be paid in full in advance. This forces people already in dire financial circumstances to either borrow money they are unlikely to be able to repay or remain in a no-mans land of spiraling debt. \nIt is suggested that the OR fees also be means tested or eliminated for those petitioning their own BR to prevent further hardship and cost to the nation when assistance is subsequently needed if health, housing and employment related problems arise, all of which commonly accompany this process. \nPlease enable these people to return to being contributors to our society.",
