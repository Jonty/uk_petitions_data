        "background": "As one who works in Council Tax for a local authority I see that it is harder and harder to collect the tax. Not one of our top 300 debtors is English and it is their culture not to pay. They change the format of their names to evade payment or being traced. Now we all know everyone has to pay VAT so why not increase the rate to compensate for the loss of Council Tax Income and then it would be fairer to everyone because everybody would have to pay. There would be savings made on salaries,offices and equipment required to collect this tax.Savings on Council Tax Rebates and it would be much cheaper to collect. The less people receiving this would inturn cut down the very very high number of benefit fraud cases that are kept quiet from the taxpayers. You know this makes economic sense and could be an election winner for the party that comes clean and states Council Tax does not work just like Poll Tax didn't.",
