England rugby sides have worn red roses ever since with patriotic pride and on occasions like the Rugby World Cup in 2003 they have heaped honour on this Emblem.  In 1986, the Labour Party also chose the red rose, during their rebranding under Neil Kinnock and Peter Mandelson their then director of communications. Political parties should not be allowed to use the National Emblem. The Labour Party have not proven themselves worthy to use our National badge of honour. We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister and the his Party to choose a more appropriate logo such as the nettle that they have so assiduously failed to grasp.",
