            "background": "There were a few cases where respectively overweight children suffered strokes and other fatal injuries after running the bleep test in their school. The bleep test should be banned in the U.K.! Stick to good ol' fashioned aerobic exercises such as running, jogging but also Sports in schools. Basically all school children don\u2019t enjoy the bleep test and if you are unfamiliar with the test, it is a test of fitness.\n\nOne has to run from Point A to Point B which is 20m away. An audio tape bleeps and when that occurs, you are supposed to be at the other Point. If you fail to be there 3 times, the test is over for you. There are different levels and how frequently it bleeps is increased. \n\nThis is a gruelling, unneeded, idiotic test which is used to torture all children. The idea off banning the bleep test has been though of in America and is banned in some schools over there. We Britons should ban it and save the children. We don't want them to be put off by fitness! \n\nI rest my case!\n\nAnonymous",
