            "background": "its about time that the none nhs payers, pay out of their own pockets for treatment and stop bleeding the nhs dry. those who have been paying into it for many, many years are now being refused treatment. it should now be that, for a patient to receive treatment they should have contributed for at least 2 years before any medication or treatment is given. those coming into england are having it far too easy. we have to pay health insurance when we leave the country, even if for its just a fews day, also have to have medicals which we have to pay cash for as some doctors will not do. interpreters are needed for many patients and ends ups costing the nhs thounds. if the patient needs one they should pay for it out of their pocket is this country going to have a nhs in 10 years time. i dont think so.",
