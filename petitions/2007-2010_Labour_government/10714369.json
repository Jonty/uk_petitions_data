            "background": "Manchester United have signed Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham in a deal worth \u00a330.75m. \n\nThe deal sees Fraizer Campbell going the other way on a season long loan. \n\nSpurs also announced they will not pursue their official complaint to the Premier League which accused United of pursuing 27-year-old Berbatov. \n\nWho do United think they are? They have bullied Spurs into a corner and it shouldn't be allowed. The guy was having a medical before Spurs agreed a deal with United. They moaned to high heaven when Ronaldo was tapped up and reported Real Madrid, why should they be any different! Sign this petition to get United charged",
