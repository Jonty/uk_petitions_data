            "background": "We, the undersigned would like the UK justice system changed to be more similar to the past and abroad. In the bygone days, people who stole lost their fingers/hands/arms respectively. It put people off stealing. Now, people get a slap on the wrist & a tag to wear which has been proven is a failing system. People who murder should be sentenced to death. Baby P's killers are facing a maximum of 14 years, when they all deserve the death penalty or life imprisonment. We request that a life sentence is exactly that...LIFE. Criminals who face release from jail should not be permitted to have their identities changed to \"protect them\", nor should the be protected in prison. They did the crime, they deserve the aftermath. The UK needs to start getting tough, and that is what we are asking of you!",
