            "background": "The government is preparing to reduce the national speed limit on country roads to 50 mph enfored by average speed cameras that can track cars for several miles. We believe this is totally unnecessary and is being carried out in in the alleged name of 'road safety'.\n\nIn fact, it is just another attack on sensible motorcyclists and motorists. There is plenty of legislation already available to prosecute irresponsible drivers. This will be yet another money spinner for central and national government and a further attempt to suck the joy out of driving in this country. \n\nSign this petition and support our  campaign .
