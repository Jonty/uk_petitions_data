            "background": "The Legal Services Commission\u2019s (\u201cLSC\u201d) consultation paper detailing its proposals for the auction of contracts at lowest prices (so called \"best value tendering\") will drive many firms out of business; the quality of service provided by the survivors will decline further and the legitimacy of the criminal justice system will be undermined.  It has been a great strength of the Legal Aid system that client\u2019s have had highly valued relationships with solicitors' firms.  They are often \"socially excluded\", powerless and in very troubled circumstances.  Defence solicitors' engagement with them in resolving problems and achieving best outcomes has both a high personal value but also a positive social value in delivering \"rights\" and justice.",
