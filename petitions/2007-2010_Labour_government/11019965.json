        "background": "Human rights breaches in Sri-Lanka are terrible. Maids are sent in foreign exchange from Sri-Lanka & abused and raped in Saudi Arabia.The SL Government sends them & turns a blind eye. Tamils are persecuted and civilians cannot live. After 20 years of war nothing is done by the powerful countries. There is bombing and killing in peace or war, and civilians are stuck in the middle. This is not about taking sides this is about bringing peace to a war torn place. A blind eye has been turned on injustice for too long now. The world cannot just sit back and do nothing. I want the prime minister to join with other countries and stop all these injustices. I want the governments of the world including the British one to work with human rights groups such as Amnesty International to take action against the killing, crime, persecution and maltreatment of maids from SL, in Saudi Arabia. I want him to unite with all countries in putting pressure on the SL government to bring peace and prosperity to Sri-Lanka. I want those who have committed crimes to be prosecuted at Human Rights courts and appropriate investigations to be made. After 20 years of suffering now is the time to act.",
