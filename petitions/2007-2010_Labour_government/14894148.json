            "background": "The 2001 Census showed that over 390,000 people in England and Wales claimed to be of the Jedi faith, also known as Jediism.\n\nThe Church of Jediism has now established more than 5 Chapters worldwide with real people with a real belief in the Force attending them.\n\nA few months ago, Daniel Jones was banned from a Tesco supermarket for wearing a hood - a religious requirement - which would not have been challenged if he was a woman wearing a veil.\n\nThis is just one case of discrimination against new-age religions such as the Church of the SubGenius, Pastafarianism and Jediism.\n\nBy incorporating these religions into the Religious and Racial Hatred Bill, discrimination can be prevented and Jedi throughout Britain can feel protected and have faith in their government.",
