            "background": "The CAA is currently attempting to introduce mandatory Mode S transponders for all aircraft (including gliders and other light aircraft).  \nThe concerns are that the proposals:\nUnreasonably and arbitrarily reduce the freedoms enjoyed by many air sports for no discernible safety benefit;\nWill force individual pilots and clubs to spend significant amounts of money that they most can neither afford nor, given current low levels of safety risk, need to spend;\nIgnore evidence that that there are other, more practical ways in which the CAA can achieve some of the outcomes without resorting to disproportionate regulatory measures that are of little or no practical value. \nThis is the second consultation on this subject. In 2006, the CAA received thousands of responses objecting to their initial proposals. \n\nTheir latest proposals are a major threat to the future of many pilots and flying clubs in this country and represent a totally disproportionate approach to an air safety issue that the CAA has not been able to demonstrate exists. The CAA\u2019s plans need to be halted again until they can provide reasoned argument and factual evidence to back up their proposals.",
