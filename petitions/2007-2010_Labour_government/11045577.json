        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is to make sure all mortgage borrowing is classed as nonrecourse. A nonrecourse debt applies to a loan secured on collateral, usually a home. As the borrower is not responsible for market conditions, i.e. the value of the properties going up or down, they should not be responsible for  the outstanding funds if the sale price of the property is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan balance and arrears payments if the property is re-possessed. This will ensure Lenders are more conservative in their lending practices as they cannot pursue borrowers for \"outstanding\" balances.",
