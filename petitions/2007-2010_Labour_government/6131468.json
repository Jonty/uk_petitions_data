            "background": "Primarily the biggest fear of any such collation of information is not the use of it but the illegal and not conscential use of such information.\n\nHowever imagine any one seeking to pass a car test would require a dna sample, any immigrant whether economic or for asylum reasons, any one seeking medical maintenance etc etc in fact everyone should.\n\nThe civil rights will claim it's an infringement of your civil liberties but imagine how many lawful residents rights would be restored as undoubtedly the crime rate would fall isubstantially, if you have ever been a victim of crime you can see these benefits.\n\nYou already have blood tests in your life, medical attention, offer your details to all banks, finance houses etc so believe it or not you have been seen many many times over in your life time.If some agency had wanted your dna/personal results they may have them already\n\nGet over the paranoia of big brother and the endless results of a dna database can only affect the average majority an a positive way",
