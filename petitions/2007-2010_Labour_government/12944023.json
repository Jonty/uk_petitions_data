            "background": "Every person in the UK & around the world knows without question that our armed forces are the most professional & best trained there are. Similarly everyone knows that the government's 2.5% reduction in VAT was ineffectual & did nothing to stimulate the economy.  We all know nothing in life is for free, so I want VAT to return to 17.5% on the guarantee that every extra penny of revenue is spent on equipment for our armed forces.  It is shameful that members of our armed forces have buy extra equipment out of their pocket prior to deployment just to achieve parity with other nations armed forces! Where are the helicopters, where is the body armour? Either equip our guys properly or pull them out!",
