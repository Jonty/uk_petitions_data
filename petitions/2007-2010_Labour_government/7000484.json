As he has pensions and owns his own home,he would have to sell his home to pay for a care home, wheras an individual who has lived on the state all their lives and has saved nothing and lives in council accomodation would be cared for in a care home for nothing. This is a totally unfair system. Even People coming into this country would be housed and given free care in their old age, why?",
