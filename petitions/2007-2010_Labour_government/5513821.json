            "background": "I would like to see the government cap the level at which European mobile phone companies can charge customer\u2019s whilst using a mobile phone abroad. Currently there is new European legislation coming into effect which caps the level of charges.\nTelecoms ministers from the EU have agreed in principle that calls within the European Union should not cost more than 30p per minute back to your home country when roaming. There is nothing in place to protect consumers from being overcharged by their mobile phone operators outside of Europe. Currently mobile operators charge upwards of \u00a31.30 for a call lasting from 1 second. The actual cost involved for the mobile phone operator is negligible. In the USA for example T mobile operates here and in Europe so why should they charge excessively when the call is on the same network?\nMost of the mobile phone companies are overcharging, so I would like to put forward this petition for a rate cap to be introduced.",
