            "background": "The case today of British tourists believed to be among the injured in a coach crash in Egypt which killed at least nine people and injured 28 early on Thursday, highlights how vulnerable travellers are, including those who work for EU sponsored aid projects. Out of their own environment and speaking a different language, time and again, the media highlights how these factors contribute to Britons being the victims of crime. If travel companies and aid agencies etc are going to advertise on the free market for Britons to go to their lands, ALL governments should have a set system to ensure travellers' safety and insure against mishaps. Please encourage EU and international police forces to become more involved in the protection of foreign nationals.",
