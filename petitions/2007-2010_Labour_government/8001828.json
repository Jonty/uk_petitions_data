            "background": "The recent presidential election in Kenya has caused much suffering for the people of Kenya, and the current stance of the Kenyan government threatens democracy in itself. There is substantial evidence that the opposition party was on their way to winning the election, before President Kibaki unofficially swore himself back into power. A coalition government will only undermine the possibility of genuine democracy in one of Africa's most promising nations. If the British Prime Minister is truly an advocate of democracy then he will publically advise\nPresident Kibaki to allow for a comletely new election, since a re-tally would be pointless as votes may have been tampered with even more. This election would be strictly observed by neutral, outside observers.",
