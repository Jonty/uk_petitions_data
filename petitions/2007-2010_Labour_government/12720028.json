            "background": "Along with Guantanamo Bay and Abu Graib, Bagram in Afghanistan has been used by the USA, our supposed allies, to detain and torture to death detainees in horrendous conditions that are in contravention of the Geneva convention.\n\nBagram contains over 600 prisoners who are packed into this jail. Many are held for years and all without charge and indefinitely. They have virtually no access to lawyers, journalists and human rights groups are barred. Earlier this year the Obama Administration opposed in court an attempt by some held there to challenge their detention.\n\nIn addition to the murder of civilians in the battlefield, this is a further heinous blight on the Afghanistanis miserable lives that undermines any notion of moral superiority of the USA and UK over the Taleban.\n\nIt is time to end this evil abomination now.",
