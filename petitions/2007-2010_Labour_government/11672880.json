        "background": "England is at the bottom of the table for Bank Holidays in Europe. We only get 8, but countries like Spain and Portugal get 12-14 days off - even the workaholic Americans get 13 bank holidays!\n\nAnd why is Northern Ireland given a day off on St. Patrick's Day, but England is not allowed to celebrate St Georges Day?\n\nIt's simply not fair and needs to change.\n\nThere is a growing demand for a bank holiday in England on St. George's Day - England's National Day.\n\nThis would be a great opportunity for all the English - regardless of colour or religion - to recognise what binds us together.\n\nWe have the richest culture and heritage in the world, lets have a day to recognise the fact.",
