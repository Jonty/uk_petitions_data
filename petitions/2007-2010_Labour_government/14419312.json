            "background": "After a divorce, men are usually left with very little assets. If these men then have a substantial part in the ongoing care and funding of their children the CSA should not be allowed to hound them to the point where they can no longer afford to live or provide for their retirement. The CSA do not allow for hardly any child related costs incurred by the non resident parent in their calculations, and because of this they should not be made to pay 2 or 3 times over just to make the mother richer. Men should also be allowed to share the tax credits and benefits in the same proportion as their percentage of child care to allow them the human right of living a normal family life and to adhere to the equality laws.",
