            "background": "We are continually shocked when cases like James Bulger, and more recently the Edlington case, hit the headlines.  IF there is any hope, it must be on early intervention BEFORE these children resort to extreme violence and murder.  These days we hear of cases where children are left with parents who ARE NOT capable of controlling their children.  These are the cases where intervention should occur.  After all many of these problem children are known to the authorities LONG before they commit serious crime.  The signs are there! We believe these cases require EARLY INTERVENTION by the authorities in removal of the children from their parents where parent co-operation with the authorities is not forthcoming.",
