I can either tick Scottish, Irish,Welsh,British,Indian,or Any other Country BUT cant tick ENGLISH so I have to alter the questions and then answer. We are told we can`t be Great Britain anymore (we arn`t Great ),so we can`t be British. If the Irish Scottish Welsh are not British ,neither are we.the union flag can have everyones nationality on . People registered in UK or GB as born here should all be British or English, Welsh, Irish & Scottish and those that immigrate here and set allegiance to us should also be registered same. We are not racist BUT ARE A PROUD NATION . John",
