            "background": "I am making the suggestion that Britain is in need of a space agency. I believe Britain is far behind countries such as Russia, the US, and China. \nMy suggestion is not that our space agency is to be a multi-billion pound project. But it is to make a contribution in areas such as research and development. At present I see no need to invest in expensive space shuttles. The British Space Agency would work in co- operation with NASA and related organisations which have greater resources.",
