            "background": "I am sure we have had enough of these left wing do gooders. In recent light of the organisation trying to ban the Mosquito device in order to deter young people from congregating outside shops & places of business. I wonder if Liberty director, Shami Chakrabarti, has had to deal with months of abuse by the ''little darlings'' she is trying to protect and says the device is ''a disproportionate interference with an individual's right to a private life''. So what about the rights of the poor people that have to put up with the rabble & abuse! I rest my case. The county is going down the pan at the moment and we do not need organisations like this interfering.",
