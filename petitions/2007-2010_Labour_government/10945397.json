        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Before the cost of diesel and petrol broke the \u00a31 a liter barrier there was very little difference in the cost. But as soon as the \u00a31 a liter barrier was broken the cost of diesel increased by a large margin and even now there is about 10 pence per liter difference. The vehicle duty on diesel is lower because the co emissions are lower so therefore the effect on the environment is less harmful, the government should encourage the use of diesel vehicles by lowering the duty on diesel so that the cost of petrol and diesel are the same.",
