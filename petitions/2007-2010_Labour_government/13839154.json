            "background": "Codex Alimentairus is a law designed to hand over the control of natural remedies to the pharmaceutical giants.  It is essential that people have access to health giving natural remedies, without the interference of large pharmecutical companies whose main objectives are making money over people's general health and well being.  If they succeed we will not be able to buy vitamins or health/nutritional supplements in the UK without a doctor's prescription - they will be banned from 31st December 2009, essentially taking away our rights to make choices concerning our own health.",
