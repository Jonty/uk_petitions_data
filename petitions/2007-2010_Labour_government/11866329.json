        "background": "At a time of much public apathy towards our armed services it has fell upon Ross Kemp and his crew to bring the battlefields of Afghanistan to our living rooms. Through his brave and selfless dedication he has shown the true professionalism and sheer bravery of our armed forces and is no doubt showing the UK a different story to that shown on mainstream news coverage. Also showing the distress and trauma of the families left behind in the UK. He doesn't have to be there but he is putting himself in the line of bullets and bombs to bring it to us.",
