            "background": "On Christmas Eve 2007 Orissa in India, which is mainly Hindu and has a tiny Christian minority, erupted in violence. 19 churches were destroyed in attacks aimed at the small Christian community. Hindu groups accuse Christian missionaries of forcing tribal people and low-caste Hindus to convert to Christianity. Some say that attacks against Christians have increased \"significantly\" since the Hindu Nationalist BPJ party came to power in 1998. But Christian leaders believe religious hatred lies behind many cases, including the murder in January 1999 of an Australian missionary and his sons. We need the Prime Minister to put pressure on the Government of Orissa to do something about violence towards the Christian community there.",
