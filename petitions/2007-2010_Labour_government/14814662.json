            "background": "In 1996, a paedophile named Thomas Hamilton murdered sixteen children and a teacher with two handguns at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland. He was in possession of a licence for the weapons used, despite a number of disqualifying offences. Despite the facts in this case pointing towards incompetence on the part of the police officials who granted the licence, a backlash against gun owners occurred, resulting in what can only be called a heavy-handed approach: all handguns above .22 caliber were banned.\n\nIn 1997, due to pressure from groups like the Gun Control Network, .22 handguns were banned without a legitimate reason or purpose.\n\nThe simple and undisputable fact is that the gun owners were innocent, yet were considered \u201cguilty by association\u201d. The ban on .22 pistols was both unnecessary and irresponsible.\n\nWe the undersigned ask the Prime Minister do the right thing in this case, and take steps in Parliament to repeal this ban.",
