What we are asking for is that every person convicted of any criminal offence is given a set of conditions the will help prevent them committing any offence.  These should not be restricted to just prohibitive conditions as is currently the case with asbos but should include additional conditions designed to to help a person with their employability, reducing there addictions, or managing their behaviour.\n\nBreach of a condition should be punishable by imprisonment.\n\nby way of an example a person convicted of residential burglary could be banned from certain areas, banned from entering any garden, or path leading to a home without prior agreement from the owner. not to carry crowbars screw drivers etc other than in his own home.  \nTo attend a drug treatment centre, to take up some form of education. To take up work in either a paid or voluntary capacity.",
