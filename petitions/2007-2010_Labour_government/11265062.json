        "background": "Stark warnings in James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia theory highlights one fact: the effects of carbon emission are now irreversible, it is therefore futile to even attempt to repair something if mankind has gone well beyond the tipping point, as we so clearly have. Consequently, humanity must now prepare for the ultimate showdown: surviving Earth's lands, airs and waters. Unfortunately, our limbs have yet to evolve naturally to tackle these frontiers, so until then, every effort must be made to ensure this generation, the next, and all those who arrive thereafter, are equipped and armed to survive nature\u2019s wrath; schools should be given the tools and training to dispense these skills to every student so that they are given opportunity to save themselves when the time comes, currently these activities are regarded as leisurely pursuits or sports, but due to high costs and the exclusive nature of these activities not everybody is able to partake, weigh this up against the real cost \u2013 lives dying \u2013  and money must not be a hindrance, no expense ought to be spared in preserving the lives of today's children so that they can become tomorrow's people.",
