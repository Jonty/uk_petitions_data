Google Street View, in our opinion, is NOT an invasion of privacy, but is in fact of great benefit to the population of the UK. \n\nWe strongly believe that Google are taking a very responsible attitude to privacy concerns in the way that they are dealing with a very small minority of complaints, which don't, in any way, reflect the enjoyment and usefulness that the program provides to many thousands of happy and satisfied users. Don't give the scaremongers their way !",
