            "background": "It was only within the last month that london firefighters prevented london from burning, a block of flats fire in south london and a recent video recording studio in soho, both requiring up to 150 firefighers each and being paid low amount of money for risking their lives unlike a  premiership player on \u00a3130,000 a week!, the other day a firefighter sadly lost his life to the job. Support my views that something should be done to give a firefighter more job satisfaction compared to footballers earning thousands every week. Thank you.",
