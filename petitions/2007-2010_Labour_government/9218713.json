        "background": "There has been an increase in sales of pre-mixed high caffeine drinks in recent years such as Red Bull. Working in a supermarket, I notice children aged 11-16 regularly buying 1 litre bottles of own brand caffeine drinks for consumption that evening \u2013 I have asked them if that is their intention. \n\nThe RDA of caffeine consumption for an adult isn\u2019t specified by the NHS, however pregnant women are recommended to consume less than 300mg a day.\n\nFor reference, a cup of coffee contains 61-70 mg, 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg, 500ml can of Relentless about 160mg, and 1 litre of own brand \u2018energy\u2019 drink 300mg.\n\nIn general, these drinks contain around 30-32mg per 100ml.\n\nI believe the children do not realise how dangerous this drug can be in such high quantities, as such I call upon Mr Brown to impose an age restriction of 16 years in order to govern this problem. After all, sales of most other drugs are age restricted (tobacco, alcohol, paracetamol etc).\n\nThanks for your time, I hope you agree.",
