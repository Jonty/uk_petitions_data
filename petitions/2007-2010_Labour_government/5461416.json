        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Recently internet providers have been advertising faster speeds for the internet, although this may seem like a good thing for the people in southern England, many people in the North of England, particularly the people who live in towns and villages, are subject to relatively low internet speeds as opposed to the better quality of speed down south. Internet speeds in Yorkshire for example outside cities rarely exceed 3 megabytes, whilst in such locations as London, internet connections in domestic households reach up to 24 megabytes!, We are not asking for such high speeds, however we do urge the government to implement a course of action to upgrade the internet speeds in the north of England up to an average of 8 or 10 megabytes for domestic use in and outside of cities. If such a course of action is taken, it would not only help people gain faster access to the internet, but it would also help schools and businesses in many of the overlooked areas of northern England.",
