            "background": "GRABS - Getting Reconstruction After Breast Surgery - is sponsored by Take a Break magazine. A new report reveals a quarter of health trusts don't offer women the chance to have their breasts rebuilt immediately. This flies in the face of guidance issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. An important opportunity is lost to help patients overcome the psychological hurdles which come in the wake of a mastectomy. We believe this postcode lottery is unjust and should be ended.",
