These inquiries often extend beyond the UK and may be delayed by International constraints. The government has a duty to protect the law abiding citizens of this country, and put the interests and safety of the majority of its citizens ahead of those suspected of planning or preparing to destroy them. The government should listen to the voice of the Security Forces and take account of their experience when undertaking complex investigations into often unique criminal acts or conspiracies. The government should resist the objections from those persons who seek to undermine the security of the UK and destabilise areas of society for political and social gain.",
