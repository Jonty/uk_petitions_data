Cold disabled people need the money way more than a wealthy working possibly fit, 60 year old, stop letting valuble disabled people risk dying of cold, they too need lifting out of poverty, as not all on DLA have spare money when the mobility part is used on mobility and the care is used to pay for carers.. then focus on other vulnerable groups needs",

            "background": "Thousands of under 60's, mid & high rate DLA claimants do or nearly do freeze or starve to death every year, cause they can't afford to heat their homes as their disability requires them to, or they cut back on food or carers coming in, so they can keep warm, so the quality of diet is reduced, so become vulnerable to bugs and disease, requiring hospitalisation, thereby blocking beds for other needy people & costing NHS more too. Many DLA claimants have conditions or physical limitations, that mean they can't regulate their own body temperature, needing to heat there homes all seasons. Stop giving money to employed 60+er's who earn enough money.\nGiving all disabled (any age) with minimum high rate care DLA (no/low savings) & least well off 70+'s (not earning) Top rate, then Mid rate DLA & over 66's not working the next and so on down including other needy groups.",
