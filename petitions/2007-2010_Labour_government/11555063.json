            "background": "Many traffic light systems incorporate technology that triggers the lights to change by detecting ferrous or metallic objects such as cars. Bicycles (and even motorbikes) are usually not detected if the sensitivity is set low, but also because increasing numbers of bikes sold worldwide are made of substances such as aluminium and carbon.\nWe believe it is not acceptable for road safety to rely on systems which do not work properly for a certain proportion of legal road users. Cyclists are often left with no option but to proceed through red lights. Wherever possible authorities should give preference to technological solutions which can detect bikes, such as microwave vehicle detectors.",
