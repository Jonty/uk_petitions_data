        "background": "Baroness Margaret Hilda Thatcher is deserving of a state funeral. \n\nVictory in the Falklands War in 1982 was her greatest triumph and saw Mrs Thatcher win a landslide victory in the 1983 general election. In 1984, she narrowly defied death when the IRA planted a bomb at the Conservative party conference in Brighton.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Mrs Thatcher cultivated a close political and personal relationship with US president Ronald Reagan, and earned the nickname the 'Iron Lady' by the Soviets.\n\nMrs Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister was the longest since that of Lord Salisbury and was the longest continuous period in office since Lord Liverpool in the early 19th century. She was the first woman to lead a major political party in the UK, and the first of only three women to have held any of the four great offices of state.",
