            "background": "Current laws do not allow British citizens from claiming child benefit for a British Child when they are abroad.  \n\nThis, coupled with the UK immigration requirement that foreign nationals married to British Citizens must be able to live without access to public funds including Child Support, causes families to split up, often for long periods of time in order for the parent to support their children.  This can seriously effect the child-parent relationship and the child's English Language development.\n\nPlease support this petition so British Children with caring families do not have to live in poverty.\n\nIf any Charitable Organizations would like to support my family please contact me at \n\nstuart.k.r.anderson@gmail.com\n\nThis petition is only for one month due to the urgency of the situation.",
