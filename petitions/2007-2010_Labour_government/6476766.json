        "background": "Following the development of the Northern Rock crisis the Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with the Chancellor Alistair Darling, have declared that they will 100% guarantee all bank deposits. Prior to this declaration, such deposits, like all investments, involved a small degree of risk involved in giving money to banks. This risked encouraged savers to seek secure and trustworthy banks though they were free to do the opposite if they so pleased, and live with the consequences of their actions as adults ought to.\n\nMr. Brown's recent knee-jerk reaction has changed all that and removed the risk from bank deposits at great cost. Mr. Brown should  either reverse this ridiculous decision or be consistent and guarantee all risks of all kinds, including bets and other types of gambling.",
