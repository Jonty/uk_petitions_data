We don't mind paying taxes but a minimum of FOUR just to drive?\nIf the price of crude falls why does petrol at the pumps go up? Lastly... WHY is there a massive difference in fuel prices up and down the country, even when in any one town the difference could be 5p! This is nonsense and their should be a set price for the country or at least for regions. \"Where there is a need there is GRRED\"",
