            "background": "Banbury in Oxfordshire is now a large town which is growing in size. Currently we have no provision for dialysis within the town. The need for a satellite dialysis center is growing with the size of the town expanding. Currently the nearest provision for dialysis is around 30 miles away, patients are required to attend on average 3 times a week.The 30 mile trip can take up to an hour one way on a normal day.A satellite dialysis unit would save patients time,also would save on transport costs to both nhs and the patient.",
