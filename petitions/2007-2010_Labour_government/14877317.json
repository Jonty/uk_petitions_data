        "background": "When a mother divorces her child/children's father, she may currently change her own surname back to her maiden name via deedpoll, however the children's name remains the same as father's surname if that was what was chosen at birth due to marriage.  If the mother is the main custodian of the child/children following divorce and the father only has access rights, the child's name should be allowed to be changed at the mother's sole discretion. \n\nThe father would not lose any parental responsibility, but the mother shouldn't have to go to court to have her children share her surname without being forced to keep her married name.",
