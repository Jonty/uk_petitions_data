        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In breaking the 46 year precedent of providing airtime for appeals for aid by the Disasters Emergencies Committee the BBC has claimed that it wishes to avoid accusations of bias and it does not believe that the aid will reach those who need it. This extraordianry decision ignores not only the desperate need for aid, but also the combined wisdom of major charities and the UK government. A clear case can be made that the BBC is indeed biased in this case and has potentially caved into pressure from Israel. As a public service broadcaster with a remit of impartiality, the reasons for the corporation's decision should be reviewed.",
