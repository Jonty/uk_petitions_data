            "background": "Stansted Airport is situated in rural Essex where land prices are relatively low. However it now costs a minimum of \u00a32 for 15 minutes simply to meet someone at Stansted Airport - but if you accidentally go over this limit the charge leaps to \u00a35 for 30 minutes or \u00a310 for an hour! I think this is nothing but extortionate and is particularly unfair on the elderly or disabled who need longer to get to and from the main terminal area - and may also be in violation of the Disability Discrimination Act.",
