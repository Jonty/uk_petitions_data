            "background": "Under the current system, students in HE who do not take out a maintenance loan still have it counted in their income assessment for free NHS prescriptions. This system is unfair, as those students who choose not to get into debt, but also need help with NHS prescription costs are left in a void. The only practical solution is to raise the current standard of '16,17,18 and in full time education' to all students in Further/Higher Education.",
