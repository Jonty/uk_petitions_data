            "background": "Small businesses have been greatly affected by the economic downturn, both owners and employees.  We feel that the government should make more effort to help this sector of the economy and not allow the banking sector to continue to pay salaries and bonuses of the level they have been doing without helping small businesses.\nThe government should dictate that for every pound paid as a bonus to banking employees, an equivalent amount is made available as grants to help small businesses.\n\u00a3100,000 given to a small business will create more jobs, more security and have a greater impact on bringing the economy out of recession than \u00a3100,000 given to a banking executive.  Therefore, every time a bonus pool is paid out, and equivalent amount is put in a fund to be given to small businesses.\nThe government need to ensure that these are not grants that are impossible to access but that certain cut offs are in place to ensure that no further bonuses are issued until equivalent grants have been assigned, and paid.\nAll grants issued should be listed online for public access.",
