        "background": "From information I have seen, only 34 beds are \"DEDICATED\" to Service personnel from all military services. This is the Army, RN, RAF, Marines and all the other equally important areas.\nThis is a national disgrace !!\nOn average 25 servicemen and women are returned back to the UK (Selly Oak) for serious medical treatment per month !!\nThis can not be allowed to continue, poor service for those that do as they are told, without question, whilst we sit here comfortable and allow our Government to underfund, under-protect and dismiss those that return injured.\nI used to be in the services and glad I am out, but I do think and care about those that are still serving !!!",
