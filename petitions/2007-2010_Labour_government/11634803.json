            "background": "The BBC's refusal to broadcast an appeal for humanitarian aid produced by the Disasters Emergency Committee is not a protection of its impartiality; providing humanitarian aid is a neutral act. Providing humanitarian aid does not involve taking sides; it is to recognise that people in Gaza are in need and to care for those needs. It is not necessary to provision blame in order to recognise suffering. The suffering is indeed caused but as the civilians who will receive this aid were purportedly not meant to be targets of Israeli aggression it is frankly bizarre to suggest that by providing aid to civilians you are supporting an militantly anti-Israeli Gazan faction. If the Israelis are declaring that civilians are not targets of their aggression then providing aid to civilians is not a biased act.",
