        "background": "Every day, thousands of animals are traded and exploited over the internet.  Free household pets are exploited by unscrupulus gangs and often resold, used as a breeding machine or baited for dog fighting. \n\nBreeders and breeding sites are free to trade as they please and with no-one to answer to they easily avoid paying taxes.  Our schools and hospitals suffer as a direct result of them defrauding the system.\n\nThis is abuse of animals and our society as a whole.  We and the animals are being cheated by these people.\n\nOur society is unaware of what really happens to these animals and volume of tax payers money that is lost.  It is beyond comprehension.  \n\n\nWe have to unite to make the abuse stop or create legislation to reduce animal suffering and make people accountable for their actions.",
