Any presence they have now is not enough. By ensuring that there is a consistent presence, we believe would lower crime levels, and possibly detour anti social behaviour, for the following reasons, first by keeping these offenders in check. Having a police presence really adds a good deal to the community spirit as it provides the public with the chance to communicate with someone in a position of responsibility directly, rather than going through bureacratic channels which can be daunting to some people.Remember these bobbies would acquire a lot of local knowledege; which would assist them in their work a great deal.So lets bring our bobbies back!",
