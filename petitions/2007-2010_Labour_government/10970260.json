This is clearly an embarrassment for the government and shows that speed cameras are all about revenue.\n\nThe government is obviously not going to stop the use of all speed cameras because they simply make too much money. However we would like the government to be honest about their use.\n\nWe would also like the government to use statistics based on a national average rather than for a specific area. This will stop the government using \"best case scenario\" statistics to support speed cameras.",
