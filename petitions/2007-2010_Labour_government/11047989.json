        "background": "The government should cease providing those on benefits with cash. A token system should be introduced whereby they can exchanged for food and drink only at supermarkets/shops. It should not be possible to purchase alcohol or tobacco with them. There is no issue of pride, these people are living of the benefits that we give them, they should be grateful.\nThe people of this country are fed up with reading about people who earn tens of thousands of pounds a year for simply staying home and 'popping' kids out.",
