            "background": "For the Prime Minister Mr Gordon Brown to do as he promised and help all children with dyslexia. Every parent that you talk to with a child who has dyslexia is up against the same problem, getting the school to assess them fully which never happens and the parent then has to pay for a private assessment, and the actions that the school provide which is IEP's and a little extra help. This does not help a child with dyslexia because the teachers are not trained to do so. Any child with dyslexia should be provided with the help and specialised care that they need to keep them where they should be within the school academically. They should not be pushed aside with the slower learning children and made to feel inadequate. Parents should not have to fight to get their children the help they should get.",
