        "background": "I would like Harrogate Borough Council to have an improved recycling scheme where tax will not be raised. Harrogate Borough Council is one of the worst council's at recycling in the country. I would like to see more facilities being made for the council and more being done to prevent landfill space being overcome. Once we have run out of landfill space what do we do then? Recycling means alot to me as we are now at the stage where our resourses are low and I would be extremely grateful if you were to do something at improving my local council's recycling scheme.",
