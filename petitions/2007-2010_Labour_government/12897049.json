        "background": "In the unlikely event of a trident missile malfunctioning or exploding, Scotland, not England would suffer.  Most Scottish MPs voted against Trident, likely because they were all to go to Scotland.  The missiles have their uses as a deterrent, so if the English MPs want them, I suggest keeping them in the Thames, or having one in England, one in Scotland, one in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland.",
