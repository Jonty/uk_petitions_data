        "background": "There should be tougher actions and sentences for knife crime, as i was attacked at the begining of the year and had to have surgery i think it is very important that the attacker should be sentenced. My attacker got remanded and got let off only with a 3 year community service order, they also told a lie and said they had a drink problem, but if they had a drink problem they people in the prison would have noticed something in their behaviour as they was kept in remand for nearlly 6 months. It is also a very two faced subject as there is posters and notices in police stations sayin any person found with posesstion of a knife will have a chance of getting sent down for 4years and people that have been caught using a knife and arrested they can get more than 4years, So how come my attacker got let off? and they are also a parent of two young children",
