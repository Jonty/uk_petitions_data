            "background": "At present, any UK citizen who happens to be male and lives abroad can claim a dependence allowance for his female wife be they foreign or not, this amount is in excess of 50 pounds per week. Having said this, If you happen to be a (Female) pensioner and in receipt of a UK pension and wish to claim for your Husband, there is no facility to do so. It is claimed, this is in clear violation of sexual equality, morals, and ethics of the UK government and EU policy, this needs to be addressed and placed on a level playing field, in order that both male and females are on a fair and equal footing.",
