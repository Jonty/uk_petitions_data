            "background": "When developers submit plans for housing developments and fail to submit detailed plans and comply with conditions the Council planning department should not allow construction to commence.  If no detail is given as to what a finished development will be lke ie. changing land levels and causing flooding, then persons affected don't have a chance to protect their properties.  What is the point in placing the onus on the developer and not checking they have complied and waiting to see if a problem arises.  Then once properties are sold passing the onus onto the purchaser.  Houses should not be allowed to be sold if conditions which apply in the initial stage of construction are not enforced or checked.  No point in shutting the stable door once the horse has bolted.",
