Here in Shetland the diesel now costs \u00a31.42 a litre. People can't afford to get to work. We are flying off the island to Dublin - this involves 3 flights because our flight booked back in October was cancelled. We face \u00a3120 fuel surcharge just to fly to Dublin for my daughter's wedding. It is now \u00a3520 to get from Shetland to Dublin. Food prices have rocketed with average loaf of bread \u00a31 and a lettuce \u00a31. The emphasise is on healthy eating but now fruit and veggies are rocketing out of the price of people. \n\nCrime - we moved here because of the crime on the mainland - there needs to be a zero tolerance approach - and strict immigration on the E8",
