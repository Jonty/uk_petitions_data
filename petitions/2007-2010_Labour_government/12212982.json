        "background": "Although I believe that some MP's should receive a good salary, you have that.  To then take liberties at the expense of the common people, you and your MP's should be ashamed of yourselves.  As our lives are being ripped apart by redundancies and reduced hours of work, you seem to believe it is ok to take even more!!!  You agree a public sector payrise but then think yourselves above that and increase yours. well YOU work for US!!\nMPs are paid an annual salary of \u00a363,291 and receive allowances for the costs of running an office.\nIn 2007 - the last year for which figures are available - claims ranged from the lowest of \u00a344,551 to the highest of \u00a3185,421. On average, each MP claimed \u00a3135,600.\n\n\u00a325-a-day \"subsistence allowance\", for food, coffees and other items on days of parliamentary business, is a joke, \n \nPay real secretaries a proper wage for your administration not your families more than they are worth.  We deserve an apology",
