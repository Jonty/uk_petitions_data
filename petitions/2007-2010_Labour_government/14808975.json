            "background": "Amendment 70 to the Report Stage of the Children Schools and Families Bill - which will be debated on Tuesday - allows religious considerations in faith schools to override the principle that PSHE lessons should be:\n\naccurate;\n\nbalanced;\n\nrespectful of diversity;\n\npromote equality;\n\nreflect a reasonable range of religious and cultural perspectives;\n\nand be appropriate to the ages of the pupils concerned and to their religious and cultural backgrounds.\n\nWe believe that these principles are entirely appropriate for all state funded schools and there is no reason why the religious character of a school should enable it to give inaccurate, unbalanced or one-sided PSHE.",
