Why are they trying to stop other countries building nukes, we have them as do france,india and oh yes america has them, and by the way america is the ONLY country to have actually used them in conflict so who are they to talk. If other countries insist on women walking behind carrying pots on their heads who are we to tell them not to, its none of our business. No wonder so many people are angry with us. Lets get on with sorting our own country and keep our noses out of others and stop being so self rightious.",
