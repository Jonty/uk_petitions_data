Understanding that Israel seeks to live in peace side by side with her Palestinian neighbours, this petition calls upon the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to express support for Israel at this time to do what is necessary in fighting a Taliban-like regime that hides behind Palestinian civilians in order to attack Israeli civilians and indoctrinates its people to hate. Such a regime threatens Israel in the same way the 7/7 bombers and Al-Qaeda threaten the UK.",
