        "background": "Having worked in various roles on housing estates in Greater Manchester over the last 6 years, I am appalled that the same offenders repeatedly receive very short or no custodial sentencing. This leaves them free to destroy the work and lives of the vast majority of decent people living there. I believe that judges are too out of touch.Judges should be made to spend time experiencing the lives of victims and talking to people about what action they need to be taken. Give communities a long break from these offenders.",
