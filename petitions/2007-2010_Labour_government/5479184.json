            "background": "Portugal is prepared to invite President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to a summit of European and African leaders in Lisbon this year despite an EU travel ban and sanctions against the 83-year-old dictator and figures in his regime. This petition calls for Gordon Brown t refuse to send ANY UK government representative to this summit if Mugabe is allowed to flout the EU travel ban and attend this summit. To be present at the same table as this murderous tyrant is an insult to the victims of his repression, a gross discouragement to those fighting for democracy in Zimbabwe, and a clear sign to dictators and tyrants everywhere that both the UK and the EU are hypocritical when they speak of supporting human rights and supporting good governance in Africa. Gordon Brown, in one of his first act as PM, should send the clearest signal that the UK deplores Mugabe's regime and its policies and WILL NOT accept a breech of the EU travel ban to allow this dictator to attend any EU/ASU summit.",
