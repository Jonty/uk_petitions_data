            "background": "We would like to see the down sizing of the LEZ from the M25 ring to the North / South circular road ring. The zone has had very little effect in reducing emissions in out lying areas of London apart from restricting the way business operate.  The main emission problem is in stationary traffic in central London, not in free flowing traffic outside the N/S circular road.",
