            "background": "I recently learnt that it was on October the 10th 1947 that I was put on the'SS Ormonde'and sent off to Australia.Along with my peers, we were told that we were orphaned.None were!We were unaware of our ages,and I personally had no idea of my birthday.Nor was I sure of whether I was born in England or Scotland.I have also learnt very recently of two more disturbing events of that time;on the 22nd of June 1948 the'Empire Windrush'docked in Tilbury with 492 Jamaican immigrants aboard, presumably with their kids and also, that child immigration continued to Australia until 1967.This newly found information borders on the egregious:It would be without doubt, that children born here,and which this country illegally sent away and placed into the hands of the since proven paedophilic slave driving institutions of Castledare,Clontarf and Bindoon Boys Towns,would have silently glided past Asian immigrants bound for England,whilst they were edging through the Suez Canal.These incoming immigrants were with their children\nhappily priming them for an education that we were deprived of.I  \nrequest an apology to all those that suffered through this abomination.
