Many of us will have to rely more on the state. Our homes will be at risk because we cannot afford our mortgages. Marriages/relationships will be placed under enormous pressure, potentially leading to break downs. As a final \u2018smack in the face\u2019 to the Government\u2019s own policy for reducing child poverty, this would actually be placing children in poverty. \nOur partners & children have contributed not just in paying taxes over the years, but whilst performing under constant pressure, helped create a Civil Service to be proud of, along with delivering much needed services to the public; & collecting revenues to pay for these services. \nHow are they rewarded?\nIronically dealt with under the umbrella of \u2018VFM & Fairness\u2019 , which equates to a cheaper way to get rid of jobs.",
