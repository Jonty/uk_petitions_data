            "background": "There is an increasing number of groups and think tanks making an interminable list of demands and calls for new legislation aimed at appeasing or promoting a pet religion,lifestyle, sexual orientation,ethnic group, etc. The common theme appears to be that these groups feel that they merit special treatment or protection. The only real use of a petition system like this one is to make interests and rights groups irrelevant. So why do they still exist to make their demands?",
