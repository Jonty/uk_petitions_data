            "background": "Not all Mums are career women but that doesn't mean we don't play a vital role in society. \nIf Mums were encouraged to stay at home to raise their children in a loving and stable environment I don't think there would be as many undisciplined, uncontrollable and disrepectful young people out there on our streets. \nToo many women finish work at the last minute when pregnant and can't wait to palm the baby off on sitters/or Grandparents so they can get back to their work. \nWe have all heard stories of small children calling the Nanny \"Mummy\" because they spend so long with her. But where is the sense in going back to work then having to pay some other person to look after the child you brought into the world? \nIt could be because the women don't really want children but feel pressured by Husbands/Family/Society or because they want them but feel they cant afford to give up work. \nI'm sorry but if you cant afford to give up work and look after your OWN children, then you shouldn't be having them.",
