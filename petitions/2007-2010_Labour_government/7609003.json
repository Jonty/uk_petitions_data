        "action": "retain and, if necessary, strengthen the 2006 Equality Act",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Apparently this Act makes it a criminal offence to discriminate on various grounds such as race, religion, or sexual orientation when providing goods or services.  I can see no reason whatever why people should ever have been able to discriminate on such grounds; if any individual is prejudiced against any or all of these groups he/she is entitled to avoid people in these groups as far as possible but NOT to refuse to provide goods or services to any member of these groups.    \n\nThis Act, quite rightly, is an extension of anti-discrimination legislation and reinforces the ideal that no one should suffer as a result of his/her ethnicity, religion (as long as the tenets of any religion are not imposed on non-practioners), or sexuality.  Anyone who opposes it should be prepared to be personally affected by having goods/services refused to HIM/HER by members of the groups specified.  I repeat my request for the 2006 Act to be retained and strengthened (to include, possibly, gender, age, and (dis)ability issues).",
