            "background": "Many residential streets are being used by to park commercial vehicles overnight and at weekends causing nuisance, noise and showing a complete lack of consideration for others. Many streets were not designed for such vehicles presenting obstacles to other vehicles and endanger pedestrians. Residential streets become commercial vehicle parks, impacting the outlook and quality of living enjoyed by neighbours.\n\nThe same is true of offices and factories with inadequate parking facilities at their premises and their employees just park their vehicles all day in the surrounding streets without any concerns as to the problems it causes local residents. Employees/owners taking vehicles home should be made to recognise the increasing social impact it has on our environment.\n\nThe residential street should be given back to the residents, so they may enjoy reasonable access to their properties and an expectation of a quality of life commensurate with living in a residential street.",
