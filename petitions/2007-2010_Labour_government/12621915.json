        "background": "I propose the government to abolish the second homes allowance, and instead build a Halls of Residence for the MPs.\n\nThe Halls of Residence needent be a \"shabby\" affair, because if the second homes allowance for one year was instead used to build a Halls of Residence, there will be a substantial amount of money availiable for building and furnishing. \n\nThis would reduce the amount of outgoings for the treasury (the RNLI built a \"halls of residence\" at their college and saved a fortune) and free up money for the government to spend in other areas.",
