            "background": "The government has removed the seperate sciences from the syllabus and introduced a simpler general science paper . Questions from a sample paper are on a multiple choice basis. The basic paper includes question such as the use of an X ray to discover if a footballer has broken his leg, sprained a muscle, has low blood pressure or a high heart rate. This is for the basic paper paper. The additional paper which is harder has multiple choice questions such as Which one of the features are not a car safety feature: a crumple zone, large wheels, seat belts or an air bag. Firstly, Bring back the seperate science papers of physics, chemistry and biology? Secondly, Make them straight questions rather than in an easier multiple choice format.",
