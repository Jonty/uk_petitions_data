            "background": "HMS Victory, went down in a storm near the Channel Islands between France and Britain in 1744 with her 1,150 crew. Admiral John Balchin was leading his fleet home from a mission in Portugal when the vessel became caught in a violent storm.\n\nOn the February 1st divers from US-based Odyssey Marine Exploration announced they believe they have found the remains of the Victory.\n\nIt is believed that Odyssey have already raised some 16 cannons from the seabed, and are currently searching for a reported 100,000 gold coin treasure trove. \n\nThis petition is aimed at applying pressure on the MOD, and the Department for Culture to ensure that Odyssey cease looting the historic site, and ensure that any recovered items are not commercialised. Any recovered items should be used on a non-commercial basis and are accessible to all through the UK museum network.\n\nOdyssey is a commercial business who capitalise recovered items from wrecks by selling them to the public, or replicating them as souvenirs.",
