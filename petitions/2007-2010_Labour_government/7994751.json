        "action": "Raise the minimum required standards for chickens raised for meat production, to that of RSPCA certified freedom food",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The aim here is to raise the standards in broiler houses. RSPCA freedom food, still isnt free range, but far better than the conditions in standard UK broiler houses. We ask the government to make it the law, so all chickens raised for meat, are done so, meeting the standards of RSPCA freedom food. With less birds per square metre, mental stimulation, brighter lights, a longer dark period and using breeds which do not grow at abnormal rates",
