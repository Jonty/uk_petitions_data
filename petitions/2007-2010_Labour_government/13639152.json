            "background": "An independent inquiry concluded that Miss Smith broke the rules when claiming that a room in her sister\u2019s house was her \"main home\" \u2014 a move that enabled her to charge the taxpayer \u00a3116,000 for expenses at her family house in Redditch, West Midlands.\n\nHowever, despite agreeing that Miss Smith had broken the rules, the committee on standards and privileges \u2014 to which Mr Lyon reports \u2014 simply asked her to apologise. She will not have to repay any money!\n\nBy nominating the four-bedroom detached house where her husband and sons lived as her second residence, Miss Smith was able to claim many of the costs of running a busy family home \u2014 including the proverbial kitchen sink.\nDuring the installation of a new bathroom, she even claimed for the cost of an 88p plug, while her more expensive charges included a \u00a3460 dining room table, a \u00a31,000 antique fireplace, including a separate bill for the coal to burn in it, and an entertainment centre including DVD players, two Samsung widescreen televisions and two digital set-top boxes costing more than \u00a31,100.\n\nIf you think Jacqui Smith should repay the \u00a3116,000 she claimed incorrectly please sign this Petition.",
