            "background": "\"Trick or Treat\" is really an American tradition and is basically making demands with menaces (aka blackmail). Not only is it worrying for people, especially for those  on their own, but it is wasting a huge amount of Police resources (it is apparently their busiest night of the year!!). \n\nIt should be an offence to make such demands from anyone not willingly taking part. \n\nAnyone joining in should indicate this by putting a pumpkin (or similar indication) in the window . Anyone else should not be disturbed. \n\nThis would allow those who wish to join in to have their fun whilst preventing those who do not from suffering threats and in some cases criminal damage.",
