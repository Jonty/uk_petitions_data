        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This bill denies children the right to a Mother and a Father; these are essential to a normal and healthy upbringing, neither single nor homosexual parents can provide this.\n\nIt also allows for the genocide of unborn children up until the age of 24 weeks of pregnancy. Babies have survived after being born younger than this. The murder of children can\u2019t be justified, Human Life must begin at conception so abortion is murder. No woman has the right to murder.\n\nThis horrific piece of legislation also allows the creation of Hybrid Embryos. This is not moral even atheists generally see this as bad but for the majority who are religious it is even worse. \n\nThe Bill also calls for the creation of 'saviour siblings', this would result in unwanted babies being born only for spare parts.\n\nThis Bill is a travesty.\n\nIf the Human Fertilisation And Embryology Bill has received Royal Assent before this petition has finished then this petition petitions the Prime Minister to repeal it.",
