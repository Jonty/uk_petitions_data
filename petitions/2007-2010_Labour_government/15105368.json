            "background": "Aged 15, I am sick and tired of entering a shop and made to feel negatively about my body image because of the way clothes are presented in stores. Yes I know they are trying to make their products look as best as possible I feel it has negative effects on today\u2019s youth and women in general. The average dress size in the UK is size 16, whilst most stores use sizes much smaller to display their garments. Too much attention has been focused on the size of the catwalk, now I think its time to turn attention to sizes in our local stores. Mannequin sizes can be blamed for anorexia, bulimia and binge eating, which can cause not only health (e.g. infertility) and physiological effects but also costs the NHS. Association estimates that the direct cost of treating a patient receiving 12 weeks of NHS treatment is approximately \u00a325,000. Why should women be made to feel inadequate? They shouldn\u2019t- no longer should women be made to feel as outcasts, just because that is what society expects.",
