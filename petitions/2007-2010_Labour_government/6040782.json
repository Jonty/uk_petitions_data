            "background": "The requirement is often place upon developers to include a % proportion of affordable homes within new developments.  However, it is so often the case that these homes are built last, and on occasion not at all.  More often than not, the bit of the plot designated for the 'affordable' homes is left fallow in favour of the developer moving its workforce to a new site where it is able to construct full cost housing, only returning to the affordable plot when there is nothing more 'profitable' to occupy the workforce's time (if at all).",
