            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Along the A228 towards Thamesport, Grain, in Kent there is a serious issue of safety. There are excessive amounts of cargo lorries travelling along this route 24/7, many of which are foreign drivers who have less knowledge, causing problems. Many lorry drivers, foreign and British, take compromising decisions while travelling putting peoples lives at risk. This is not just speed related as there are average speed cameras lining most of the route. At present there have been 46 casualties including 6 deaths and a further 6 people seriously injured, according to the medway council website, over a 3 year period. As the A228 is the only access road to the ajoing villages, many parents and children on their way to work and school are at a higher risk as this is the most busiest time on the roads. Safety along this route can be obtained by transfering all cargo onto the exsisting railway towards Thamesport. This railway already transports cargo to Thamesport so this solution should be best.",
