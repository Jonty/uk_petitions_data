We love gay people and are aware that their lifestyle has led the NHS to prohibit some of them to donate blood, because of the health risks involved.  We cringe at the society that this legislation is helping to create - a society of people being branded as criminals for honestly following the dictates of their conscience.  Is this really just and fair?",
