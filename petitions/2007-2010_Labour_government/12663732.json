            "background": "You can buy a 2-3 grammes of Super-Skunk for \u00a310 or a gramme of Cocaine for \u00a330-50 (dependent on purity and connections).  This formula defies Adam Smith view of open markets.  I bought a box of sugar puffs for \u00a31 at 450 grammes, if I were to translate that into Super-Skunk, the value would be \u00a31,500 (approx).  Therefore, the twin attack (police-crim)on society is engineered, and thus a dereliction of duty, but also an affront to a humanity and decency(a clear contravention of economics/humanity or society).  So the simple & logical solution is to bring such manners into the public sector, regulated and thus surpressing the price of described commodities as the legislation is effectively (willingly) supporting a destruction of a wholesome social values, furthermore, like in Amsterdam, where such decrimilisation has occurred, the purchase of described commodities where made by tourists, accounting for 90-95% of the market.  The truth is, a gramme of Super-Skunk, can be grown for the price of Carrots, but the Government seems to enjoy exploiting the publics ignorance which is an affront to Lord Shaftesbury, Wilberforce and many other libertarians.
