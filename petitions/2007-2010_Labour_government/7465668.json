        "action": "expand the role of the Gangmasters' Licensing Authority beyond the fresh produce sector to protect workers from exploitation by labour providers in the hospitality, manufacturing, care and construction sectors of the economy and to increase resources allocated to the GLA for its inspectorate to support this expansion.",

        "background": "We were most concerned when we heard that the GLA's remit at present only covers the agricultural sector and that they have no remit to work in other sectors. Many migrant workers in the U.K. endure a \"combination of extreme low pay, very poor living conditions and long working hours\" (Von Hugel Institute, Feb 2007) Widening the scope of the GLA to more sectors of the economy is esential to defend their rights.",
