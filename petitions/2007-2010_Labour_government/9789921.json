The Islamophobes seem to have free access to a range of avenue to attack Muslims at every turn.\n\nWe, the undersigned, request the Prime Minister, to ensure that 'Free Speech' does not become a prelude to 'Free Hate' and 'Free Violence'. A truly FREE civilised society protects all it's members. A freedom to hate does not form any part it. This type of material is no different to anti-Semitic and Holocaust Denial materials and such should be subject to stringest criminal sanctions.",
