The crossing is too close to the roundabout and vehicles parked on the pavement obstruct good views of pedestrians trying to cross. This is particularly an issue for children and the elderly.\n\nThe other particularly dangerous point en route is Wattleton Road which has 3 schools located on it - Butlers Court Primary, The Beaconsfield School and Beaconsfield High School. There is no safe crossing.",
