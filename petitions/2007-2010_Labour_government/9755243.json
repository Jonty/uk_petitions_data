If there are more than 2 candidates then the First Past The Post voting system can often produce an unfair result that does not reflect the wishes of the majority of electors in an electorate.\n\nThe preferential voting system enables a single transferable vote and the votes of the least popular candidates are allocated until one candidate has more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nThis will enable the wishes of the majority of the electors in that electorate to prevail and produce a fairer result in elections than the current system allows.",
