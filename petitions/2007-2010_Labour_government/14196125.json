        "background": "The Health Secretary said of the plans:\n\n\u201cFor the NHS to become truly great, it must become more preventative and people-centred \u2026 This means top quality care is our goal and patient safety our top priority. This is right for our times. Quality care is not always about spending more money, but about spending it in the right places. Moving care from hospitals into homes and communities is better for patients and more efficient.\u201d\n\nThis was the thinking behind \"care in the community\" for mental health, and it has lead to more expence, and worse services for people in that area.  We the undersigned ask that the government doesn' make the same mistake again, and drop the current plans entirely.",
