            "background": "We the undersigned believe that the proposed extension of the Marina will have a serious and adverse effect on the environment and wild life of Glasson Basin.\n\n      The increase in the moorings as proposed from 200 to 400 will effectively block a substantial portion of the Basin and will have a negative impact on the amenity of the area.\n\n      We consider that the number of moorings should be significantly reduced and that the company should apply for planning permission for the whole of the development, on and off the water, so that due consideration can be given to the environment and infrastructure of this conservation area.",
