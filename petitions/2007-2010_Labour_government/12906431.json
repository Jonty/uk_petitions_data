Because my illness is not on the list of illnesses that is recognised as being 'exempt' from prescription charges, I am still eligible to pay full prescription charges.  Can somebody please tell me how this is fair?  Surely, if we all have the same NHS Service, we should all either pay the same charges or, not pay at all!!  Come on England, catch up with the rest of the United Kingdom!!",
