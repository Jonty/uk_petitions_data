            "background": "Why does the government insist on punishing drivers for the cars they drive when we could cut global warming down more effectively in other areas? \n\n-Stop importing bottled water from abroad and use our own.\n\n-Livestock produces a much larger share of more harmful greenhouse gases. It generates 65 percent of human-related nitrous oxide, which has 296 times the Global Warming Potential of CO2.\n\n-Diesel trains in rural Britain are more polluting than 4x4 vehicles. D. Alexander said: \u201cIf ten or fewer people travel in a train, it would be less environmentally damaging to give them each a Land Rover Freelander and tell them to drive\u201d \n\n-Burning wood for fuel is better for the environment than recycling it.\n\n-Someone who installs a \u201cgreen\u201d lightbulb undoes a year\u2019s worth of energy-saving by buying two bags of imported veg, as so much carbon is wasted flying the food to Britain \n\n-Trees, regarded as shields against global warming because they absorb carbon, were found to be major producers of methane, a much more harmful greenhouse gas.",
