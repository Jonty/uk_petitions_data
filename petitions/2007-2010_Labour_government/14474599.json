            "background": "Piercing guns are inappropriate for all body piercings due to the fact that:\n\n- They can not be properly sterilised in an autoclave because they are plastic, which means skin and blood particles are passed on from one piercee to the next increasing the risk of contracting hepititis B & C, compared to needles which are thrown away after every client.\n\n- The guns are more painful because they use the blunt earring to force through the body. This is traumatic to the piercee and crushes/damages tissue. The butterfly fastening on the earring is pushed next to the ear so there is no room for the wound to heal and swell. Needles are razor sharp and room is made to ensure space is made for swelling and to ensure proper healing.\n\n- People who use guns have had little to no training. Professional body piercers have had years, studying the anatomy, placement and first aid to ensure the piercee is safe.\n\nThose that are unaware of the negative effects of piercing guns suffer, no one should have to suffer anymore!",
