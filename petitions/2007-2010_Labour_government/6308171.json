            "background": "This is a petition to ban the sale and ownership of guns within this country. The reason for this petition is too many people are dying from guns on the streets of Britain. Their is no need for guns ownership as a gun is designed and manufactored for the sole purpose of taking life and in our modern country why do we need guns on the street. So sign this petition if you are sick of seeing those who have not had a full life being gunned down before it has begun.",
