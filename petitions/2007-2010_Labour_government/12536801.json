            "background": "Samantha Orobator is a twenty year old British national currently facing drug charges in Laos.  She was arrested nine months ago on 6 August 2008.\n\nSince then she has been held in the notoriously abusive prison Phonthong where she became pregnant in early December. There are reports from the prison of abuse and several deaths, including that of a British national last year.  Conditions in the prison are harsh and the diet is dangerously inadequate. \n\nHer trial may be imminent, however she has not been granted access to a lawyer. The US State Department recently reported that it was unlikely that a trial such as Samantha\u2019s will be fair, and stated that \u201cjudges usually decided guilt or innocence in advance, basing their decisions on the result of police or the prosecutor's investigation reports.\u201d\n\nIt is therefore vital that the Prime Minister personally take all the actions necessary to ensure that Samantha is returned to the UK immediately.",
