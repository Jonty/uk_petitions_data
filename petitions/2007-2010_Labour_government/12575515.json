        "background": "The whole fiasco of MPs' allowances and expenses claims have left the electorate totally disenchanted with the current political system. The level of abuse leaves MPs facing police investigation and possible prosecution. \n\nLeaders of all three main political parties may have apologised for the whole fiasco.  However, the speaker of the House blamed the media rather than the greed of MPs.  The electorate can only go to their MPs' surgery to voice their distaste about the whole fiasco. No constituency has sacked or deselected its MP yet, although mny MPs will be \"punished\" at the ballot box.\n\nTherefore, I call on the prime minister to do the \"right honourable\" thing and call an immediate  general election.",
