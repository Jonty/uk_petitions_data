            "background": "Adoption of a contributions based financial support policy for the unemployed.  There are far too many people already living in or coming to this country that are relying on the financial support of the government (aka the British taxpayer).  People need to be encouraged to actively seek work.  Many will not because they can live quite comfortably off various government payouts (and any other income).  I suggest that an individual\u2019s period of contributions is considered before handouts are made.  Those of us that have managed to hold down a job for most of our adult lives should be offered most financial assistance instead of being penalised.  We are expected to dip into our savings and support ourselves when we have been responsible for supporting others for much of our lives.  Surely we should expect at least the same level of support offered to those that are not interested in working.  Perhaps we would not have to rely on immigrants talking low paid jobs.  Everyone can better themselves if they are willing to make the effort, but too many just can\u2019t be bothered.",
