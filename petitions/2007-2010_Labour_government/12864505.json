        "background": "Members of the Public and Commercial Services Union working for English Heritage have been presented with a pay offer that will introduce:\n\nRegional pay ranges and market and performance pay.      \n\nThe proposals form part of a three year deal and will have a devastating impact on staff in the lower bands and in Visitor Operations, as the proposals will affect future pension entitlement and annual pay increases.\n\nWhile English Heritage management plan to reduce our members\u2019 salaries, they are looking to reward other staff in the\norganisation with large pay rises.\n\nOur members provide vital support to specialist staff and are essential to attracting visitors, educating school children and promoting the organisation and its work on the hundreds of sites across the country.\n\nSupport our campaign for fair pay for a fair day\u2019s work at English Heritage.\n\nFor more information contact Catherine Craig, PCS negotiations officer on 020 7801 2764.",
