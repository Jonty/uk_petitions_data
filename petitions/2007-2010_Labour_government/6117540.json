        "background": "We welcome the global leadership the British government has given in promoting the importance of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nHowever, we believe this effort is undermined by the continuing existence of domestic commercial flights within the British Isles.\n\nWe therefore call upon the government to:\n\n* End quickly all flights covered by high-speed rail services, such as London to Manchester.\n* Tax highly all domestic commercial flights, to reduce uptake.\n* Invest further in the improvement of high-speed public rail, road and sea services, including sleeper services.\n* Consider incentives that can be provided for businesses and individuals to use alternative public transport methods.\n* Commission a study into the emissions associated with domestic commercial flights, including transport access to airports, comparing them to other forms of travel.\n* With the above being carried out, begin a phased reduction in the number of domestic commercial flights, with an aim eventually to end them.",
