            "background": "I am writing to ask you make homelessness an issue for the Government.  Homeless people\u2019s benefits could increase if they had a permanent address and I realise that this would be an off-putting reason for the government to provide housing, but would it not be possible to provide shelters (something a little more private than the old doss-houses, maybe with separate lockable cubicles), where you can make that level of accommodation some sort of proviso for not paying the full benefit, but which will provide a permanent address for those seeking work?  It would get people off the streets, where there are drug and prostitution based sub-cultures thriving. \n \nWe are supposed to be a civilised country and yet people are made homeless by repossession of housing and teenagers needing to leave home due to abusive situations.  There is nowhere for them to go and many end up on the streets of London.  The benefit laws not allowing 16 year olds to receive full benefits and designed to keep them at home have put these children into an impossible situation.  Is it not time that it was addressed by the government and funding provided?",
