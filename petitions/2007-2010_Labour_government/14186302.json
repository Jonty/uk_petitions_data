Mr. Jiang spoke openly about Mr. Gao, not allowing him to be forgotten\u2014but Attorney Gao\u2019s own voice continues to be silenced.\n\nAccording to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., Gao Zhisheng was allegedly tried in the Chinese courts, convicted of \u201ccrimes against the State,\u201d and released on parole in early August, 2009. There is no public record of these events. A phone call to his brother, Gao Zhiyi, in August confirmed Gao Zhisheng to be alive-but our latest report from inside sources indicates he is still being held and tortured severely. His whereabouts are still unknown.",
