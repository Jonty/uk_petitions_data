        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sole Street Station has been suggested to close. Sole Street is a small 'hamlet' sized area and is in a very secluded area between Cobham (kent) and Meopham. The only transport in and out of Sole Street is one bus that is rarely seen (arriva 416) and the train station. South Eastern have already reduced the amount of trains stopping at Sole Street to a maximum of one an hour, and at some points of the day none at all. The next nearest Train Station is in Meopham, which is 1.4miles away and would take a 27minute walk along a road which is dangerous(as its a main road) and for a large portion without a footpath. There is a Facebook Group currently in action against the closure of Sole Street and is proof that Sole Street Station is used by many, as if you dont have a car you are forever stuck in Sole Street! I have also spoken to a local estate agent who said this would also de-value the houses in Sole Street. We cannot let this happen to our little village.\n\nKindest Regards",
