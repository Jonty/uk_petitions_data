The extra profit goes into these businesses, not to the performer or venue, who has received the original price for the ticket with handling costs. \nA ticket should cost its Face Value. Any resale should be due to inconvenience of the original purchaser, i.e. they can no longer attend. \nThe exploitation of fans must cease.",
