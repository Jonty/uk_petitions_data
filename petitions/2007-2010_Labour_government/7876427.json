        "background": "On the 28th March, 1942, hundreds of British Commandos raided the German controlled French town of Saint-Nazaire. Their primary objective was to disable the dry dock housing the German battleship, the Tirpitz. Over 150 Commandos died that night, but all objectives were achieved and 5 VCs were awarded.\n\nDespite the brilliant courage and selfless sacrifice these men gave to their country - in an action that denied the Tirpitz an Atlantic base and was, therefore, pivotal in the Battle of the Atlantic - there is just one memorial to them, on the harbourside at Falmouth. \n\nThese heroes deserve a greater memorial to them, and their sacrifice. We therefore ask the Prime Minister to recognise the astonishing achievement of the Commandos, and commission another memorial to commemmorate what happened that night in 1942.",
