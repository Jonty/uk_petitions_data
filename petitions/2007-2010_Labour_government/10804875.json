            "background": "The best way to help first-time buyers afford a home is simply to allow house prices to fall to affordable levels. Stop meddling in the housing market with tax payers' money. Forget the shared-equity schemes and stamp-duty holidays. Stop trying to prop up house prices for short-term political gain. House prices have been rising at unsustainable rates for several years and a correction must be allowed to happen. Your economic mis-management let house prices spiral out of control. Stop meddling and let the housing market re-balance.",
