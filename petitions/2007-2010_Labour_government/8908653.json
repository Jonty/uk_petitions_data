Before this budget I was an avid Labour fan but now I think Labour has seen dark days. This budget hits us citizens that like to go out and party after working harder hours than any other European nation and leaves the people that keep their money out of the country unscathed. Enough is enough. Alastair Darling needs to stop running the country's finances and NOW! If need be make him Minister for Small Cupboards in Parliament.",
