            "action": "use his powers of intervention to review the decision by the Government's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) that the National Star College (one of the country's leading specialist providers for some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged severely disabled young people) should not be included amongst the college capital projects going forward to the next stage of funding by the LSC and that the Prime Minister should seek alternative ways of providing Government funding to honour the 50% funding pledge made by the LSC and enable the National Star College's partly completed development to progress to completion.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Given the government's commitment to social justice and equality for disabled people, the National Star College truly believed that it would have been treated as an exceptional case in the decisions that followed the crisis in the LSC\u2019s over commitment of capital funding. As a national specialist provider the college was unlikely to score highly against criteria that largely favoured general FE colleges in deprived areas with regeneration programmes and high numbers of students. As a small independent Charity, fundraised gifts and pledges had been secured towards the project, on the basis of 50% LSC/Government support. Over \u00a32m of this is now at risk. The first two phases of the project had been completed with LSC support. Now, the future of the College, the project and the opportunities for young people with increasingly severe and complex disabilities are seriously in jeopardy unless the Prime Minister intervenes to review the funding that has been withdrawn.",
