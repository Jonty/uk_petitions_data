            "background": "Being given the option of paying by standing order as opposed to direct debit gives the consumer more control over their finances. It enables a payment to be delayed by a day or so if funds are pending. It will help avoid unnecessary bank charges and will prevent companies from randomly accessing accounts as and when they feel like it as although not legal nothing is stopping them. See my other petition regarding that!",
