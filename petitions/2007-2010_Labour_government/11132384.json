            "background": "The banks and credit card companies who make enormous profits with the money we give them have been bailed out at our expense. Now some private companies are asking for the same. We the public are being robbed every which way we turn. If the politicians really care about us they would wipe our debts clean, bail us out. While banks and bankers make millions the majority of us are struggling to pay for the basic things in life such as food, housing, fuel etc. This is patently unjust. We want help from the people who are supposed to represent us.",
