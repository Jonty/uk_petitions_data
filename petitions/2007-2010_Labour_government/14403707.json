            "background": "To often car drivers and the like complain that no one else pays this magical \"road tax\" which doesn't exist, and that they pay for the upkeep of the roads.\n\nSadly, this isn't the case. VED is paid for emissions monitoring and vehicles with low emissions <100g/kg pay \u00a30.\n\nRoads are built and maintained from general taxation which includes VAT and Council tax among others... even if you don't drive or use the roads... you are paying for them.\n\nNot even fuel duty covers the cost.\n\nIt is unfair, and as such I petition for a rise in taxation for the motorist to make them pay more fairly for what they use.",
