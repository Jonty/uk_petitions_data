            "background": "The OCR exam board have introduced the teaching of the creationism myth into the GCSE Biology science classroom. Where it could be misinterpreted as a equal theory to the theory of Evolution, as given forth by Charles Darwin. \nWe say that this is something that should be left to Religious Studies and Religious Education only. Controversy and understanding can still be taught without it being included in the Biology syllabus. \nCreationism is not a science, and should not be taught in a science subject, regardless of the intension behind it.",
