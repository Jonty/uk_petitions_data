            "background": "In recent years there has been an unacceptable rise in assaults on teachers, children using the most foul and profane languages to adults and a general breakdown in respect, coupled with something approaching terror in any adult asked to do something about it for fear of being sued or arrested.\nThe reason for this is that in an overly liberal era, there are simply no consequences severe enough to act as a deterrent to either trouble-makers, or those who follow them.\nThe old regulations regarding corporal punishment in schools were far too arbitrary and allowed individual authorities far too much leeway in how they administered it.\nWe therefore petition the government to re-introduce this practice, but with a set of central regulations that strictly govern the application of any punishments meted out to prevent abuse of children whilst regaining some of the lost order which is now crippling schools with disruption, severely affecting those who do actually want to learn.",
