I want to help you because I beleive myself to be a Labour supporter and would rather you were praised for these measures than those snobs on the oppposite bench from you. I want nothing from this but the satisfaction that I have helped my country and Government I trust in. If you are interested in my help, please send a letter of recognition to jh5393@hotmail.co.uk. If you read this Prime Minister, then believe me when I say that I really want to help you. If at all possible, I would rather remain anonymous.\n\nYours Sincierly \n\nA.N.Other",
