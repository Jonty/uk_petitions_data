There are plenty of horrific examples of surveillance gone wrong in Europe's modern history.\n\nTerrorists may attack the open society, but only governments can abolish it.\n\nThe routine surveillance of all internet traffic (even if full content is not kept) is a step too far, and allowing anything other than courts to be allowed access to this database is wrong in a truly free society. We ask the PM to scrap all such plans, and to protect, rather than abolish, our freedom.",
