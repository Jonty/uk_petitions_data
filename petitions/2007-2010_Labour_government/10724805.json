        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Too many gay children are growing up not understanding why they feel different to other children. Why should children be taught about safe heterosexual sex and STI's but not be told about safe homosexual sex and the STI's involved in that?\nNot only this, but homophobic bullying in schools is mostly due to lack of understanding from the bully. If children were taught that homosexuality is not wrong and is natural, then gay children/teenagers would feel less scared of being judged and there could be a significant drop in suicides, self harming and depression in the gay community.\n\nWhat I am suggesting is one mandatory lesson, along with normal sex-ed, at some point during secondary school focusing on homosexuals and homosexual sex and protection. Just one lesson can make a world of difference to a bullied teenager.\n\nThere could also be a specialist or group available around the school to give advice and support to those who need it.\n\nHomophobia is still strong in Britain today and the best way to prevent it is to explain it to children/teenagers when they are at a younger age.\n\nThank you",
