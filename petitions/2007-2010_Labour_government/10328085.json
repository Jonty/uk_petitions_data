He was just 14 and is the youngest WW2 casualty.\n\nI have just discovered that there were 513 more young boys between the ages of 14 and 16 who also lost their lives during WW2 serving with the fourth service THE MERCHANT NAVY.  \n\nWe owe the Merchant Navy a debt of gratitued that has never been properly honoured.  \n\nWe could start to redress this by the Government funding the Memorial to Raymond Steed and all the other young boys who gave their lives.",
