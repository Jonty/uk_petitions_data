            "background": "As part of the cuts proposed by Warwickshire Fire and Rescue in Sept 09 7 retained fire stations are due to be closed. This move will be ratified by the Warwickshire County Council unless it is opposed. Warwick Fire Station is the symbol of a great public service worth defending which saves thousands of lives from days of the great fire in Warwick. The county council cannot justify its closure. If the closure goes through a big hole will be left to be covered by further afield fire stations including maybe some over border fire stations.",
