            "background": "the enforcement of manditory testing proposed in the envioment bill would be both unfair and racist against scottish stalkers we feel that the current legislation where voluntary testing or mentoring of newcomers to this activity is sufficient and has proved so over the years,manditory testing will force many recreational stalkers to give up this activity and will cause an explosion of deer numbers around certain areas that are currently being controlled by these recreational stalkers this will increase the risk of road accidents and fatalities involving deer in these areas.",
