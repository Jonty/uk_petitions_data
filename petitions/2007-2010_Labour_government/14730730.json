            "background": "At present, unlike many countries, it is not illegal for doctors to falsify medical records, whatever the mechanism . The simplest being permanent and selective deletion of notes from the primary record. This opens the door to gross breaches in trust, and makes seeking justice and or explanations difficult. It also permits doctors to compromise the care of patients who are still living, at worst resulting in distress, disability, death, or false diagnoses. There is a pressing need for more sanctions. I have analysed my own notes before and after a complaint to assess what happens. There was evidence of systematic adulteration across 3 systems. It concerns me that it appears this behaviour is routine, and collusion is rife.",
