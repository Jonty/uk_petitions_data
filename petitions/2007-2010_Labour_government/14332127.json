These are old, infirm, retired Fire Fighters and their families who have risked their lives to serve their communities. The Fire Fighters Charity offered them sheltered accommodation in Littlehampton. Now these retirement homes they expected to live out their lives in are being taken away. This is by the very organisation they placed their trust in and they themselves have helped to raise money for.",
