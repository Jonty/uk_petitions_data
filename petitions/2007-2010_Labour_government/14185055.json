            "background": "Having reported a driver going out of her way to run a red light this week, and been told that the Police can't be everywhere or deal with every little issue, it seems to me that there is a problem with traffic law enforcement of resourcing. Given that with so many other sectors of public endeavour this has been met through some Public/Private partnership thing, I'd therefore like to propose that infractions of some elements of traffic law be sold off (much like water, power, rail etc) and made available for the private sector to monitor and issue enforcement penalties on, just as parking was some years ago allowed to be taken away from the Police by local councils and passed to operators like NCP. We could soon see speed camera operators finding by a process of natural selection the \"richest\" spots for detecting speeding motorists leading to a rapid increase in compliance with traffic law and a dramatic decrease in the death and injury rate, indeed a reduction in the damage to the national wealth that traffic \"accidents\" cause.",
