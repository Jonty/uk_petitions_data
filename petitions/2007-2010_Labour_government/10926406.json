            "background": "Credit Default Swaps (CDS)\n\n\tThe banking system is currently under threat because banks have sold CDS to speculators who have gambled against them without having any legitimate interest to hedge.\n\tUnder British law, contracts of insurance are null and void against a claimant who has no insurable interest to protect. (The historical reason was to prevent criminals insuring the life of a stranger and then murdering him to collect on the policy. Compare a CDS on the credit of a weak bank followed by ruthless short selling to force it into administration.)\n\tThe law has been careful not to define a \u201ccontract of insurance\u201d. I submit that a CDS is in substance such a contract and void against a speculator.\n\n\n\tBanks selling CDS were allowed to take the premiums due into their profits before money changed hands without making any provision for future claims. Bonuses were calculated on these bogus profits.\n\tI submit that such artificial accounting did not show a true and fair view of the reality and that both the directors and auditors should be held liable.",
