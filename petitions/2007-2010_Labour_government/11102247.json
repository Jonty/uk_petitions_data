Every punch, every slap; all that poor boy wanted was to be protected and loved. It brings me to tears when I think of the pain he went through when they pulled his fingernails out and finally murdered him. Look into his eyes and think of what they did and tell me that leaving them to rot in prison is far too good for them. These so called human beings are not fit to be in society. I have always sat on the fence whenever the topic of capital punishment has arisen, but this case has shocked me to the pit of my stomach. That is why I am petitioning the Prime Minister to consider what they did and many others before them and bring this discussion to the public's attention. A prison sentance in this case does not come anywhere near fitting the crime.",
