        "background": "i.e. cars should give adequate space to motorcycles; likewise motorcycles to bicycles; likewise all road users to pedestrians.\n\nCurrently, on our overcrowded town roads, trucks & car drivers sometimes feel the need to squeeze into the safe space which motorcyclists & cyclists have sensibly given themselves.\n\nWe need to strongly thwart this practice, of bullying more vulnerable road users, to encourage these greener forms of travel. This law would adversely only affect less competent drivers.",
