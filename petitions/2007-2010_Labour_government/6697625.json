            "background": "RAF Tangmere was a Royal Air Force station famous for its role in the Battle of Britain, located about 3 miles north east of Chichester in West Sussex. American RAF pilot Billy Fiske died at Tangmere and was the first American aviator to die during World War II.\nIt is today the site for Tangmere Military Aviation Museum that, in its collection, has a replica Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane as well as many original aircraft. Bus number 55 runs from Chichester bus station to the museum throughout the day, included Sundays.\nI would like to see the site re-opened for Civil Flying.\n\nThis would be very popular with aviation enthusiasts all over the country and would bring in lots of tourists to the area.",
