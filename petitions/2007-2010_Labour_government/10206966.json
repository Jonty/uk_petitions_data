        "action": "instruct the Department for Work and Pensions to base annual rises in pensions and benefits on AVERAGE increases in inflation rather than the September inflation rate",

        "background": "These rises take effect in April and claimants are advised of the new rates in February.  Both months are a long   way from September and I don't understand why the inflation rate in THAT SPECIFIC month was chosen as a bench-mark for the rises.  It seems to me that it would be a lot fairer, as well as making far more sense, to base these rises on the average inflation rate increase over the period of a year from either September (the current month) or April (the month when the increases take effect).",
