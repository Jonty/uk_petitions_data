VAT is a tax on goods and services NOT a tax on goods, services and OTHER TAXES.  By switching it around it would be\n\npetrol 34.67p\nVAT 6.06p\nDuty 50.35p which totals 91.08p which is an immediate cut of almost 9p per litre.\n\nVAT must not be applied on top of tax. It is wrong, it is stealing, and my guess is maybe against the law!\n\nSign now.. we aren't asking for an unrealistic ban of duty. We are asking to be treated fairly and transparently",
