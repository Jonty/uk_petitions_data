Some people of certain professions simply get paid too much for example footballers! The Army starts you off on \u00a315,000 a year after training! I know about Government cutbacks but \u00a315,000 is taking the Mick! I am asking for the Government to increase the pay of serving soldiers and to give the injured soldiers better care and support.",
