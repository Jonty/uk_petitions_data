        "background": "Over the last 20 years teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases in teenagers has been on the increase.\n\nIs it me, or is it just coincidence that this coincides almost perfectly with the introduction of Sex Education to Teenagers in the mid 80s when I was at school.\n\nTeaching our kids at an even earlier age is a recipe for disaster, instead we should assess what we are already doing wrong and consider how to fix that, not make it worse by doing it even earlier !!!",
