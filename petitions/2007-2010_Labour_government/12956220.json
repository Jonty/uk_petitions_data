            "background": "One of Mary's objections to the court's legitimacy was that its procedure was that of a treason trial.\nShe was not allowed a lawyer, she was not able to call any witnesses, and she was not allowed to use notes or examine any documents in the course of conducting her own defense.\nMary said ' I knew not Babington. I never received any letters from him, nor\nwrote any to him. I never plotted the destruction of the Queen. If you want to\nprove it, then produce my letters signed by my own hand.\nCouncil replied ' But we have evidence of letters between you and Babington'.\nMary told him ' If so, why do you not produce them? I have a right to demand to see the originals and the copies side by side. \n\n\nShe pointed out sharply to the court that her secretaries had not been called as witnesses and so could not be cross-examined.\n\nShe was forced to defend herself without being allowed to subject any of the documents exhibited against her to legal or forensic scrutiny.",
