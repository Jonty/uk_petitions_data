            "background": "Hospitals face a dangerous new superbug threat in the form of a drug-resistant microbe that clings to catheters and ventilation tubes.\n\nDoctors studying the genetic code of the bug, commonly known as Steno, are worried about its ability to shrug off antibiotics.\n\nAround 1,000 cases of blood poisoning caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are reported in the UK each year. Of these, almost a third are fatal.\n\nAlthough Steno infections are still relatively uncommon, they are on the increase, say experts. Highly resistant strains of the bug are at least as hard to treat as MRSA and Clostridium difficile (C.diff). The bacterium flourishes in moist environments such as around taps and shower heads. The petitioner is calling for guidelines, not press releases and information on treatment guidelines to prevent scare - mongering.",
