        "background": "Durham County Council, in a cost cutting exercise hitting the most vulnerable members of our community have put care homes under threat of closure. Elderly want to stay in their own homes but the existing residents have given up their homes and the care home is their home and security. They site the need for on-suite bathrooms but surely this would present a health hazard to residents who rely on their carers for every need. Wallpaper and carpets do not provide care the expertise of well qualified and loving staff do that. Moving residents to the private sector will move them away from relatives who themselves are old and unable to travel distances leading to loneliness for our Mums and Dads. A consultation period has begun but already the council are asking staff if they will accept redundancy where is the democracy in that. A Fairer future for all may be the Governments slogan but it is not our County Councils. If we do not stand up for the vulnerable in our community \u2013 WHO WILL?",
