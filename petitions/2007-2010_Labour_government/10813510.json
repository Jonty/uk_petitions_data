            "background": "Mr Patch is one of the last remaining symbols of that great generation who bore such suffering. As he and the last other handful of veterans appear to have rejected a state funeral, a Knighthood for Mr Patch would be a suitable way to honour his and his comrades.\nSuch recognition would also honour the self sacrifice of men like Mr Patch and provide a role model for current and future generations",
