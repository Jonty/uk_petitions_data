            "background": "school holidays do not fit in with the average british workers holiday entitlement.\n\nI cannot see it being workable for all parents to be given the right to not go to work on school holidays so the only option I can see is that the schools reduce their holiday entitlement to be in line with everyone else.\n\nThis would mean that workers can arrange holidays to spend time with all the family unit, rather than one family member a week for their children sitting in a house watching daytime tv. \n\nAnother benefit would be that the education of our children would be spread out over a longer period rather squeezing it into a nine month period giving the slower learning children in society a chance to be educated rather than give up when they fall behind everyone else and cant catch up, and decide to truant and hang around on street corners instead.",
