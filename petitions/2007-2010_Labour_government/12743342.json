            "background": "There has been news recently that the Welsh Assembly Government is to introduce an average speed camera system near the Newport area, after there are roadworks.\n\nThis approach is flawed, discriminatory and a waste of public money and time (unless the fines repay the costs which is unlikely.)\n\nFirstly, the \"SPECS\" as they are called are placed not on all lanes, allowing drivers to dodge them by changing lanes. They also only record drivers numberplates using ANPR technology from the front, meaning motorcyclists cannot be caught.\n\nThey are dangerous, as drivers will be doing several other things apart from driving properly.\nFor example, they will be constantly checking their speedometers, doing other activities such as using their mobile phones to \"reduce their average speed\". These are surely creating more danger?\nWhat about people tailgating to avoid being picked up on these cameras?\n\nWe need variable speed on the motorway for obvious reasons, such as letting people onto the motorway from slip roads.\n\nWith all the economics problems and the stress and strain drivers have to go through every day, these cameras are just another weight on the public's minds.",
