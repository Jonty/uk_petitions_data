We are saying no to paying more council tax in lincolnshire to fund lincolnshire police.\n\nCouncil tax in Lincolnshire is set to rise after the police authority voted for a massive hike in its share of the county's bill in a bid to solve a funding crisis. \n\nAt a meeting today, members voted to put the authority's share of the precept up by 78.9 per cent. \n\nThis would mean around an extra \u00a32 per week or around \u00a3104 per year for Band D householders. \n\nThis is hardly fair in a low pay county like lincolnshire, when the average wage is the nmw. \n\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to stop lincolnshire county council putting the tax up to fund the police.",
