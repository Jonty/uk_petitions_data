            "background": "I think that we should be able to choose your options in year 7 instead of year 10 so we can prepare more and as we have done some learning about other subjects other than science english p.e and maths and if we do not want to do them for gcse there isn't any point us doing them for three years before as we are learning things we don't think we need. This way it would be a lot easier for children to get higher grades in there gcse's because they have been doing a lot more learning about the subject. It could also help childrens behaviour as they would be learning things they want to learn and think they will use later on in life.",
