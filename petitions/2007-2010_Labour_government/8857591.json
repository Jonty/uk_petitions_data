            "background": "It has been reported in the Times newspaper that Lord Goldsmith is proposing that children swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen to \"strengthen children\u2019s understanding of what it means to be British\".\n\nThe existence of the Queen and her family has no bearing on British identity. None of us chose to be born in 'her' country and become a subject. Children do not have the experience and knowledge to understand the implications of swearing an oath to the Monarch. This would need to be an informed decision made as an adult. The idea of swearing an oath to a non-unelected and unaccountable hereditary institution seems archaic in a modern democratic country where the Royal Family is increasingly insignificant to people's daily lives. This demonstrates yet again that Lord Goldsmith is completely out of touch with the British people.",
