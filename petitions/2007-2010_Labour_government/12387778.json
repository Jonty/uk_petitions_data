        "background": "Pensioners pay the same amount in Council Tax as they would pay if they were still working even although they have, in most cases, a much lower income. They, along with other householders of modest means, pay a greater percentage of their income in Council Tax than high earners. A tax on income, rather than on the size of a home, would be fairer.",
