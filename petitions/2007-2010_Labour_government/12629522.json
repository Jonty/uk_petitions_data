        "background": "There has been an unprecidented loss of trust by the public in the elected representatives. The impoverished people of the UK deserve to chose the path the country must now take in order for them to be properly represented. Working people are tired of paying for the extravagance of the privileged and for the maintainance of the lazy,sponging, criminal element of our society. As the source of the money recently squandered we demand to be heard in order to prevent the downfall of democracy. An election must now be called.",
