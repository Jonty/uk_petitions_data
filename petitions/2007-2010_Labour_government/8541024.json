        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I am asking for the job age to be lowered from 16 (for part time job), for many reasons which could benefit our country. For instance, it gives the younger population a chance to work and earn disposible income, which can then be spent in various places. Creating a better income for companies due to higher customers (may even be lower shoplifting levels due to people being able to afford the items). Letting younger people get jobs may even solve getting people off the streets and hanging around. Giving them something constructive to do with their time. Many people whom I know would like to see the job age lowered. If the job age many years ago was low, why not now.I hope that you may take this into consideration.",
