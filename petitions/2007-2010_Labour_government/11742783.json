            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Any employee in the railway industry (from HR representative to train driver) is subject to a very strict drugs and alcohol testing policy to ensure all employees are 'fit to work' within an industry upon which the public rely. This is quite correct and a legal requirement under Transport and Works Act 1992. There are also legal duties on employers to have procedures in place so this does not happen.\nThere is no such similar procedure for the banking sector in which there is anecdotally a huge number of drug users in the City of London, amongst young financiers with the money and desire to use drugs. In addition, within the NHS, there is no similar policy. I think it is disgraceful that both of these services upon which the public rely to secure their financial and physical health are not covered by any similar legislation.\nThe government must act to eliminate this tacit tolerance of drug and alcohol abuse in industries into which we entrust our personal & corporate wealth and our wellbeing at times of great need.\nIf the government is serious about the tackling the problem of drugs and the problem of binge drinking, this can only be seen as a constructive first step.",
