        "background": "The government should implement after an initial 6 month period the  paying of JSA/Social Security/Income support Benefits in food vouchers (and a free bus and train pass off-peak to enable attending interviews) that could only be spent in a government owned supermarket/shop (the money would then go back to the government directly) which sold local produce(to help local economy) meat/veg/fruit only  (no cigarettes or alcohol) This would help the obese problem in the UK and would help boost healthy diet's - saving NHS costs on cancer(smoking)/obesity(fatty foods)/alcoholism). If this was implemented it would encourage people on JSA/Social Security Benefits to seek work for the non essential luxuries of life and stamp out complacency in  affected areas.",
