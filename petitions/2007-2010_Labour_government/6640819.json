        "background": "The October amendment to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 was passed as a statutory instrument, and therefore did not go through the democratic process of Parliament. \nThe infringements on the civil liberties of the people of Great Britain that come with this amendment far outweigh the security benefits it will bring.\nThe decision not to hand over a personal cryptographic key is an individual right and should not be a criminal offence.\nThe list of 795 public bodies which now have access to our personal information is a ridiculously excessive one, where many bodies are included which bring no benefit to the people. Ample medical records are already available to the emergency services already, more is not required.",
