            "background": "Church maintained and funded schools are part-funded by the taxes of non-church-goers; therefore we should not be discriminated against applying for school places when a church school is also our local school.\n\nChildren have a right to access good quality education and a freedom of choice in whether or not to adopt a religion, regardless of the faith of their parents. To insist parents must attend church on a regular basis is to discriminate against the undecided child, based purely on the beliefs of their parents.\n\nBy allowing church schools to insist on church attendance as a criterion for admittance is divisive on the part of the government; encouraging parents to falsely adopt religion and morally corrupting good people who\u2019s only agenda is to obtain a decent education for their child.",
