Our tax money is going to others so their standard of living can be brought to the same standard as us without having to climb up the career ladder. The government send out a bad signal in relation to receiving working tax credits as it seems to be the more you earn the less you get back. For example someone who works full time with a good wage receives approx \u00a310 per week and someone who works 16 hours a week on minimum wage receives approx \u00a3150 per week. What is the point of working more hours and making more money when others just get it handed to them freely? I am sick of paying for other peoples luxuries.",
