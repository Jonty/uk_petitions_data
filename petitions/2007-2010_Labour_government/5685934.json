        "background": "Many years after a successful and otherwise settled personal injuty claim resulting from civil or criminal action has been settled, the victim may undergo additional significant unanticipated suffering and loss as a direct or indirect result which could not have been anticipated previously. With both an extended working life and lifespan an inability to easily and simply obtain an assessment and further approapriate compensation (where warranted) is a further victimisation of an already injured party.\n\nThe victim should have a means of redress in a simple, straight-forward and independent assessment for further damages subject to common-sense Terms and Conditions to stop unwarranted or trivial claims.\n\ne.g. As a result of someone else's negligence, should someone lose their house to fund care in their later years where the only reason care is needed is because of their injuries?",
