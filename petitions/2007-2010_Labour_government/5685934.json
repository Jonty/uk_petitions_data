With both an extended working life and lifespan an inability to easily and simply obtain an assessment and further approapriate compensation (where warranted) is a further victimisation of an already injured party.\n\nThe victim should have a means of redress in a simple, straight-forward and independent assessment for further damages subject to common-sense Terms and Conditions to stop unwarranted or trivial claims.\n\ne.g. As a result of someone else's negligence, should someone lose their house to fund care in their later years where the only reason care is needed is because of their injuries?",
