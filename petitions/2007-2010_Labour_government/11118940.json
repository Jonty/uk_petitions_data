            "background": "As football is our national sport; and plays a significant role in English culture. I believe that it should be our right to watch our national games free of charge on Terrestrial Television. I think that it is ridiculous that some families are unable to watch our football idols of England play the famous sport just because it is not on Terrestrial Television. Doing this would benefit our whole nation by bringing it together through our heroes who are from all over England.",
