        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Given the England football team's appalling performances under Steve McClaren's tenure, and failure to emerge as qualifiers for the said competition, I urge the BBC to maintain its commitment to hiring sports pundits who possess knowledge on the subject that they proclaim to offer opinions on. The petitioners acknowledge that sports commentary is a subjective art, and that on the odd occasion a represetantive jester is needed to lighten the dark clouds of English football, but we say that the recruitment of the manager responsible for our premature exit from EURO 2008, sends society mixed messages about the concepts of 'merit' and 'reward'.",
