            "background": "Limits on the paid portrayal of antisocial behaviour are not cencorship, especially when paid for by the broadcasting licence fee.\nFor example:- While deaths on Britains roads continue to decimate the youth of our nation many voyeurs such as Jeremy Clarkson has been allowed to use our 'public service broadcasting network'to glamorize driving at illegally high speeds.\nWhile the world stands on the brink of environmental meltdown due largely to the profligate use of the internal combustion toxic waste generator we call the car, Clarkson has been granted the right to publicly extol its virtues at the licence payers expense. This smacks of irresponsible government and weakness in the face of lobbying by the motor industry.",
