        "background": "the use by government departments of 0845 telephone numbers that give long lists of messages then tell you to call back later and cut you off. This is particularly bad when the callers are the unemployed and disabled with very limited funds. Why do people have to phone call centres miles away when they have a government office nearby. Decentralise these centres or reinstate 0800 numbers and allow people to hang on for an answer.",
