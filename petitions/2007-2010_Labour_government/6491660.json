            "background": "These tests do NOT measure whether or not the individual is LYING; they measure such manifestations of stress as sweaty palms etc.  It's obvious to me that the stress of simply being accused (possibly ESPECIALLY if one is innocent and afraid of not being believed) could cause similar manifestations.  Another point is that certain conditions, such as hyper-thyroid, can themselves cause sufferers to have sweaty palms; this is obviously another point in the unreliability of lie detector tests.",
