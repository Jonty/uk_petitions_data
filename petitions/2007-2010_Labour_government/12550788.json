            "background": "The Gurkhas have served alongside and later in the British Army bravely and loyally for almost 200 years. They are among the best and now more than ever we need them. We are taking in men from all over the world, from the commonwealth, but very few of these men offer the same degree of loyalty and professionalism that we have enjoyed from the Gurkhas. Many young men of Nepal take their own lives if rejected by the Gurkha recruitment team, such is their devotion to serving in the British Army. The number of Victoria Crosses awarded to Gurkha soldiers since its inception gives testimony to their bravery and professionalism.\n\nAny British serviceman, past or present will confirm the feeling of comfort and confidence that the presence of the Gurkhas around you brings, when going into action.\n\nWe need the soldiers we have and more, so let us keep the best. British military tradition is the key to armed forces moral and efficiency and the Gurkha Tradition is second to none.",
