        "background": "It's simple really, in light of the current economic situation we think it's about time the government stepped in to help the people, small businesses and anyone else who is finding survival a struggle right now. We bailed out the banks recently and are paying for it in a number of ways. We need to see the banks lending again. If this does not happen then we are in trouble. Since the banks aren't doing this out of their own concern for the welfare of the economy we think it's time Mr Brown stepped in to stop this financial triage.",
