            "background": "Energy suppliers may protest that they are not responsible for the weather; of course this is true but neither are consumers.  I understand that these suppliers are already making quite, if not very, big profits; how much more will this be the case when they receive payment for the bills which include the current period of extreme weather!  I feel it is only fair that they contribute to the cost of this: by either reducing their bills or a windfall tax (which could be used to increase and extend either the Winter Fuel Payment and/or Cold Weather Payments).",
