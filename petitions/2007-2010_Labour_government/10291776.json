            "background": "You, your ministers, and your foreign office website make much of seeking to help diminish human suffering and human rights abuses in the world, which is highly laudable. However, deporting back to Zimbabwe 11,000 refugees who fled Zimbabwe to escape persecution, at a time when at least 109 opposition supporters have been murdered, and many more beaten, burnt, tortured, raped, and been made homeless does not appear to comply with your government's admirable  aspirations. I therefore petition you to please reconsider and then cancel this proposed deportation.",
