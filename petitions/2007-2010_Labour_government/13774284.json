            "background": "Honourable Prime minister\n\n\n       26th October 2009\n\nDear Sir\n\nI was shocked when I began to realise the implications of the new bank charges.\n\n\nMy business account has an ovedraft facility of \u00a310,000, which is and\nrelied on for running my small business. I am always using this and average \u00a35-10,000 at all times.  Currently this will cost under \u00a3200 pa\nWith the new fees that will be \u00a3730, g and if i should go over my limit, this can be much more. Not much help to a small business.\n\nMy wife has a \u00a3100facility.  If she uses this, say \u00a320 at the beginning of the month,by the time she receives her statement she will have clocked up a charge of \u00a340...... 200% in a month.\n\nMy daughter also has a \u00a3100 overdraft facility.  If she went over the limit, by \u00a320, without noticing at the start of the month,  she will be fined \u00a3200 an amount she will not be able to pay. By the end of the year this will have risen to nearly \u00a32,000.\nIf this is not a loan shark tell me what is.\n\nClever people these bankers......    No Not clever...evil. wicked people\nThese new \u2018FEES\u2019 are greed gone mad.  Can Government allow this?\n\nOn behalf of all decent people who struggle to make ends meet,\nPLEASE do not allow this new charge.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n\nB Scott",
