        "background": "A large proportion of the working population will have criminal records. They are discriminated against by this act, which stops ex-offenders being employed and therefore failing to rehabilitate them. In particular the time limits for convictions to be spent, should be reviewed. Allow those that have only one conviction, to be spent and allow them to gain employment more easily, whilst protecting the general population from those that are more dangerous. Also employers should be forced to employ a suitable applicant, if the conviction is not related to the vacancy; and if that person is not successful to keep a record of those not employed and the reasons why so it can be checked by HM Government officials during audit reviews etc.",
