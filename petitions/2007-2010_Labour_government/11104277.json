            "background": "Too many suspected 'child abuse' offenders are skipping bail and absconding the country prior to their court hearings ( or during court cases - which happened to me when I was a victim attending court). This is happening numerous times and delays court cases, sentencing; delays the suspect from serving his/her sentence and causes greater stress for all victims. It is also very costly to find the culprits to return them to britain for closure.",
