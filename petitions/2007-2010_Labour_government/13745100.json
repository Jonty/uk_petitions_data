            "background": "Up to 15 per cent of the population in the UK suffer from headache disorders and in the wider population headache is an almost universal experience.\nHeadaches and migraines are under- diagnosed and inadequately treated in the UK and that quality of life implications are not appreciated.\nWe are concerned that there is a lack of research and adequate provision of training and services.\nwe fall behind our European partners in this area of medical research funding. There is a huge need for this funding; the loss to the economy through absenteeism caused by headache is enormous and more than justifies serious funding consideration by the government.",
