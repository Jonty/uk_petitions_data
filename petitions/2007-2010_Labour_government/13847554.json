            "background": "Plans by the European Union to \u201charmonise\u201d consumer law will short-change them by removing that right and weakening safeguards. \nMinisters have vowed to fight the Consumer Rights Directive but the UK Government has no power to stop the change if it is backed by the majority of\u00a0 European Union states. \u201cThe Government has vowed to fight Brussels to retain this right but they have no power to stop it from becoming law if it wins the backing of the majority of other member states. \u201cWorse still, new EU rules mean the UK Government cannot continue to offer British consumers extra safeguards if it wants to.  \n\nThis is an article from Daily Express http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/137380\nWe need to protect our rights. Please sign the petition, we need to say no to EU and finally say no to them telling us what to do, they have told us what light bulbs to use, how our fruit and veg should look and now they wish to ban our consumer rights.",
