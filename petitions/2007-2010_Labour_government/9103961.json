The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to address this - we live in a global community but some\nnations do not appear to fulfil their commitments to international conventions ! Please use Prime Ministerial diplomatic pressures to reduce the occurrence of kidnaps, assaults and crimes committed against British nationals overseas because until you do, despots and civilians in war torn regions will continue to think that this criminal behaviour is acceptable - and then what chance have we as a global community of ensuring the peaceful conditions in which harmonious international diplomacy, economic prosperity and development can flourish ? Don't let them get away with this, Gordon !",
