            "background": "Bring back national ownership of our vital infrastructure. Return the profit to that nation, developing research in British universities, providing grants to students and creating positive jobs in the field of science and engineering. We need clean technology.  We need to get the great minds of our youth out of call centres selling mobile phones to pensioners and in productive study.\nEvery person in this nation, every business is unnecessarily lining the pockets of fat cat directors for a utility at the very core of our infrastructure. The free market system does not work on this level we are all suffering and the regulators are either inept or corrupt or both.\n\nWe have a rich history of invention and tecnological advancemnet, of academic prowess in these fields. We should be a world leader in reality not just policy.",
