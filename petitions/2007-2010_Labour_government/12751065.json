            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At a time when it has now been widely recognised that the legislative role of the House of Commons has diminished - the first step to restoring a dynamic role should be to repeal obsolete law. We do not want a statute book which is ever enlarging. That would result in a loss of emphasis on good and necessary law. Additionally - current statute has led to a proliferation of 'quangos' ie bodies which one must join to be able to trade. This is an unjustifiable restriction on trade. Limited scope for such bodies exists - but they have now become an end in themselves and the cost of membership of them is inevitably passed on to the end user (householders). Perhaps even more concerning is that there is generally low awareness of such law which can therefore be broken without the awareness of the individual in such breach. This brings all law into disrepute and even more worrying is the possibility of such breach being used by a tyranical regime or even an over zealous police force in curtailing civil liberty.",
