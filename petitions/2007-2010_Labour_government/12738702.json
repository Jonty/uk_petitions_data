One of the areas affected by this is the village of Roberttown where upto 2330 houses are proposed and around 300 acres of of commercial development. \n\nThis development is to be carried out on green belt land and would destroy the geen belt views around the village for as far as the eye can see.\n\nThe Infrastructure within the village and surrounding area is in no way able to cope with such radical development. This development is proposed to be carried out over the next 15 years. A committee of local residents has now been formed and we ask for your support in the fight against the LDF simply by signing our petition here!",
