            "background": "Without doubt our government is not taking this desease seriously, there is insufficient funding for research and there is insufficient treatment being provided.\nThe current system is to monitor Patients but provide no medical assistance until such time as their mental state is below determined level, by this point there is little helping them, it is a medically confirmed fact that early diagnosis and treatment is a huge advantage.\nFailing to provide funding in both areas will ultimately mean unecassary suffering for both patient and carer and a place a larger burden on the tax payer as carers will be needed for support earlier and longer.",
