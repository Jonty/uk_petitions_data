Those taking this decision\nneed to be reminded that Britain is carrying the greatest European burden of military, political and welfare aid in many parts of the world. I and many\nothers are proud of the Red Arrows' flying expertise and their demonstration of exellence of our aircraft industry.  I trust this decision can be reversed to allow them to perform.",
