            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The proposal to charge householders by the weight of rubbish in their bins is extremely unfair, is likely to lead to an increase in fly tipping, and will be costly to administer. \n\nIt is unfair because it can only be applied to households which have a separate bin, so it cannot be levied on people who live in flats and such which have communal bins. Therefore it is in effect an extra tax on people who live in houses. \n\nIt will result in unscrupulous people dumping their rubbish in other people's bins, or fly tipping it, in order to avoid paying. Householders will have to find ways of protecting their bins from misuse, and there will be an increase of rubbish in the countryside.\n\nIt will cost a fortune to administer, because it will require the weight of contents in each bin to be recorded, invoices to be issued, and payments pursued, and councils will have to pay staff to do all this, as well as paying for the requisite technology.",
