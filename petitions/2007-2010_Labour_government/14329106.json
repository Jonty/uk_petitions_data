            "background": "Currently, cold weather payments are made only for continuous 7-day periods of sub-zero weather.  We petition the P.M. to change the rules so that if the 7-day-averaged night-time temperature over any period of 7 days is below zero, then payments will be made for that period and any subsequent contiguous period even if less than 7 days.\nWe further petition that each postal area in the U.K. should have its own official weather station so as to enhance the accuracy of data gathering for the purpose of deciding to make, or not make, cold weather payments.\nWe further petition that postal areas which have not received payments and which are served by distant weather stations should be re-assessed for recent and future payment periods.",
