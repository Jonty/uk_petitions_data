        "background": "Many different authoritative sources now acknowledge that the new EU 'treaty' is, in fact, substantially the same as the proposed EU constitution rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2006. Signing up to the new EU treaty involves the United Kingdom giving up  massive powers and control over its own domestic and international affairs to newly established authorities in Brussels; furthermore this process would be irrevocable and irreversible. Whilst signing up to the treaty may bring certain benefits for member states and possibly also the UK, this process must not take place without the EXPLICIT CONSENT of the British electorate, as expressed through a clearly defined and transparent national referendum.",
