            "background": "From the wise leader of men Baz;\n\nI propose that we add a new day in between Friday and Saturday which shall be called Paeday.\n\nWe still work the same 5 days a week but we have a 3 day weekend starting on Paeday and ending on Sunday.\n\nThe year would still have 365 days so we would need to get rid of 2 months so I propose deleting January & Febuary, which are both cold months anyway and most prople are broke.\n\nSo immediately after December we would be into March and the summer is only 3 months away while we have paddy's day just 17 days into the new years.\n\nSadly Valentines day would have to be scraped but it was only a Hallmark commercialism day anyway. Unfortunately for people like me with a Birthday in January this also wold have to be scrapped but can live with that if I get my Paeday.",
