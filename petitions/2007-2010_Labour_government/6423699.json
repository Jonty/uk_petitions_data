We now have guns, knives and even suicide bombers in our midst. \n\nWe see homeless and begging in our streets, while the newcomers are given instant housing.  \n\nYou are allowing \u2018out of place\u2019 mosques to be built everywhere, and have even \u2018sneakily\u2019 allowed Sharia Law to happen in some parts of the country. Please stop appeasing to the Muslim minority, and ignoring the majority of 'indigenous' Brits. \n\nWe are deeply sad and depressed to see this once great country being destroyed, and it\u2018s all down to this PC Government that have allowed this to happen.",
