            "background": "The loch lomond national park contains the the only inland lake left in the united kingdom where the popular pastime of powered boating and watersports can be enjoyed. The conditions of use in recent years has been severely restricted by the park authority which has resulted in a notable reduction in accidents, however the recent proposal to increase the restrictions (thankfully refused) would have severly limited the use of the water for these enjoyable and healthy pastimes. To prevent a repeat of the Lake Windremere debacle the governement should interject now and prevent the national park authority making any further restriction on speed limits or areas of useage of the water.",
