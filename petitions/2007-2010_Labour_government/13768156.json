            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "An amnesty for all illegal migrants would have three main benefits.  1. increase in government National Insurance and Income Tax incomes, meaning more money for nurses and teachers. 2. migrants would be protected from gangmasters and unfair pay deductions. 3. Employers would have hard working and dedicted employees. Migrants would be counted and would be traceable through employers income tax details.\nIncorporating migrants into the workforce would increase the portion of people that are of working age (16-64) and this would pay for the increase in the number of pensioners that will be experienced in the coming years. The economic benefits of a potential amnesty are very clear.  \nThe alternative option to remove the migrants would be costly, protracted and ultimately refute because the migrants would simply return after deportation.  Migrants work hard and want to make a contribution to the country that they are working in.  An amnesty would be in the best interests of HM Treasury, the migrants and their employers.",
