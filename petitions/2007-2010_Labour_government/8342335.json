            "background": "Religion is based on faith, and by definition it expects its adherents to believe the unbelievable. While there is good evidence that much religious doctrine is itself directly harmful, irrational thinking also opens minds to many other unsubstantiated ideas, and discourages people from seeking evidence for claims. This can have appalling consequences, and the invasion of Iraq is one example. The Church of England became established because a philandering king wanted a divorce. It is a modern anachronism. If the Church has value, it should be strong enough to stand on its own.",
