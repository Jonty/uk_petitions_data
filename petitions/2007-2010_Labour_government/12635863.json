            "background": "I think that Children and young people entering care need better support and structure. Most children and young people get placed in homes which are unsuitable for their needs which need to be met, most of these needs are, social, physical, emotional, cognitive and cultural. Children need to know that people want them and need to feel love and security in every environment they enter. Children and young people get placed in care for a number of reasons these include physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental abuse and other types of abuse, it may be because of neglect, they may not have parents, they may also have had a traumatic experience which may cause them to act out of character in which their parents may not be able to cope, either way every child and young person deserves a good start in life.",
