            "background": "We, my friends and I, have reaserched about our idea and belive it too be a valid point.\nIn wokingham we have one small skatepark, which our local council wish too shut because of complaints from nearby houses.\nWe have thought about this fully for a while and gatherd our points. There is an unused warehouse in the local area, in an industrial estate and there are no other houses near by and only one other warehouse.\nThis idea will make money and employ local people. Unfortunatly it will cost a large amount of money too build, but will gain all of the expences back and most likely more.\nThis will take youths off the streets cutting anti-social behavior and crime.\nThank you for reading our petition, please sign and help us enjoy our hobby again.",
