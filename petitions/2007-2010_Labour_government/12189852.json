In response to a recent news report regarding an expenses claim, Ms Smith said in a statement: \"I am sorry that in claiming for my internet connection, I mistakenly claimed for a television package alongside it. As soon as the matter was brought to my attention, I took immediate steps to contact the relevant parliamentary authorities and rectify the situation. All money claimed for the television package will be paid back in full.\" THIS IS BLATANT THEFT OF PUBLIC MONEY.  Ms Smith is not fit to hold public office, and should be held to account for this offence. We therefore  Request that Ms Smith is immediately sacked, and that she is reported to the police for theft.",
