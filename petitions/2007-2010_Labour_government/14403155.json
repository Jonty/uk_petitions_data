            "background": "Dear Mr Brown,\n\nYou should allow Southeastern Railways to provide Deal in Kent with fast trains.\n\nWe have been shamefully left out of the high speed network that has recently opened in Kent.\n\nThe rolling stock shoots through our station at 70 mph on route from the depot to the present starting point of the new service in Dover.\n\nIt would cost nothing to stop the trains at Deal station and Southeastern Railways says it would like to run a service to Deal because it would be profitable for them - yet your government won\u2019t let them.\n\nThis is an administrative mess on the part of your government which you can put right at no significant cost.",
