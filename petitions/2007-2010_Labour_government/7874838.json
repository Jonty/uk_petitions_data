This is not an acceptable way to treat consumers who require to make arrangements to travel to departue airports, take leave from work, take travel vaccinations and medication and arrange an alterntive holiday.  In a situation such as this, when the Foreign & Commonwealth Office advise against travel, holidays departing in next 14 days should be cancelled to give consumers fair notice.",
