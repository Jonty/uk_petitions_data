            "background": "Currently Ryanair has no e-mail address for disgruntled customers to make complaints to, or indeed an e-mail address for general enquiries.  All that is currently available are premium rate phone lines and fax machine numbers.  This is not good enough.  All other airlines have e-mail addresses, and I believe Ryanair should be duty-bound to have one also.  Ryanair boasts on its website that it is the Number 1 airline for low customer complaints.  I'd like to ask them just why they think that might be?  Is it due to their wonderful customer service?  Doubtful.  I would imagine it is more likely because customers wishing to complain are unable to do so.  At current all this petition is asking for is for Ryanair to have a customer service e-mail address, although one would hope that they'd pull their socks up over a number of other things (hidden charges, etc).\n\nThank You",
