            "background": "From the Telegraph Online:\n\"The policy emerged yesterday when the Home Office announced that police in London would have \"real time\" access to the capital's congestion charge data.\nMinisters said the move was a response to the terrorism threat.\n\nThe Home Office inadvertently released internal discussion papers that showed it intends to expand the scheme nationwide. Officials are drafting legislation giving police access to all data used to enforce charging.\"\n\nThis policy directly contradicts the response recently given by the elected Prime Minister Tony Blair to the 'traveltax' petition signed by 1.7 million people, which stated \"this is not about imposing \"stealth taxes\" or introducing \"Big Brother\" surveillance\".\nThe new plans sound perilously close to surveillance.",
