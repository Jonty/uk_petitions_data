        "background": "Unsolicited advertising and sales calls to homes are a constant nuisance, an invasion of privacy and a waste of valuable time. Requests to operators to remove private telephone numbers from their lists are repeatedly ignored, and residents are harassed daily in their own homes by unscrupulous corporations wishing to make sales. Such unsolicited calls should be outlawed, with an emphasis placed on potential customers approaching the company for a service, and not the other way round.",
