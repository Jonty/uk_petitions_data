        "background": "The Queen gave the Aga the title in 1957 as a new religious leader - but  circumstances have changed since 1957.  New religious leaders these days don't get the 'HH' style eg the new Pope Benedict has not been given the 'HH' style by the Queen. The logic in 1957 for the Queen giving the Aga the HH style was that many of the Aga's Ismaili followers were also the Queen's subjects. But many catholics are also the Queen's subjects - so Pope Benedict should be given the HH style (according to the dated 1957 logic). As it is dated logic - and unfair to other religious leaders- the sensible thing is for the Queen to take away the HH title she gave the Aga in 1957, thus making it fair all round by according each religious leader the same importance.",
