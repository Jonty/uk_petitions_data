Elected Officials in the UK do not and therefore can remain in office. \n\nTherefore, MPs who recently disgraced themselves in the expenses scandal will not step down until the next General Election. \n\nBy giving the people the chance to petition a 'no confidence' motion in their MP, (with a certain number of signatures required - so this doesn't happen every day), the MP would be forced to resign.\n\nThis would be applied across all levels of Government and therefore to all elected officials.",
