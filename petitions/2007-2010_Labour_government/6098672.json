        "background": "More and more people recently are being subjected to blatant harrassment by individuals working as \"Street Canvassers\" or \"Street Charity Workers\".\n\nThe type of behaviour reported includes:\n\nDeliberately walking in front of the intended \"target\", \nMaking lewd and/or offensive remarks in an attempt to gain a persons attention, \nInterrupting private conversations, \nfollowing members of the public until they stop, \nNot accepting \"no\" for an answer and continuing to follow and intimidate (or even bully) people, \nApproaching people in areas such as the beach or sitting outside bars/pubs - these are surely areas where people don't expect to be approached in this way?\n\nWe are not suggesting that charities or companies should not be allowed to use \"Street Canvassers\" for fundraising purposes.  However, far too often, the tactics employed by such individuals is utterly unacceptable and must be punishable to the full extent of the law.",
