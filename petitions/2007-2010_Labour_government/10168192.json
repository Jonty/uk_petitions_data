            "background": "For many centuries the North has suffered at the hands of a London centralised government. So it is petitioned that England, from the soutern borders of Lincolnshire, Rutland, Leicestershire, Staffordshire, West Midlands, Shropshire northwards to the current border with Scotland, and westward to the current border with Wales so that we would have better control of local affairs, that has for many years been neglected by the sucessive parliaments of the UK and England.\n\nThis will allow us to properly control the whole area, and more carefully dedicate funding to education, policing, health-care, millitary, corrections and all other services that have been woefully underfunded thanks to Whitehall not seeing the 'North' as a matter of any importance.\n\nSo sign up to help us on our way to a brighter Northern future with no more unwated, unnecessary interference from London.",
