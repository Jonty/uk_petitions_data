On countless times I have seen people without young children parking in parent and child parking spaces, I think it should be made illegal to park in these places as it is for people to park in disabled spaces.\n\nThis is not a requirement to *provide* such spaces, but simply to enforce such spaces where they are already provided. It would be no more difficult to police than existing disabled spaces: see a car in a parental space without child seats and take the appropriate enforcement action.",
