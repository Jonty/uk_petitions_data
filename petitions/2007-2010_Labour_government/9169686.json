            "background": "The increase in cars in the UK is making it increasingly difficult for pedestrians to get around. Badly parked cars obstructing pavements are a growing problem making it difficult to get past with shopping, pushchairs, wheelchairs, children on bikes and sometimes even just a single person walking. At present this is only an offence if the cars are parked on yellow lines. This is not acceptable, pavements are for people not cars and it has become clear that people are too inconsiderate these days to do this out of common courtesy. They will do something about it if they are in danger of being fined.",
