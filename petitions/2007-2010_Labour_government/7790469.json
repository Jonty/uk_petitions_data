            "background": "The police breathalyzer is merely a time saving tool for the police services and does little to ascertain the test subjects ability to drive.  Many drivers are freely on the road in worse states due to sleep deprivation than those convicted of drink driving offences.  A proper test of reflexes and cognitive ability would be better suited in this case.  Drink driving legislation is there to stop dangerous, due to drink, drivers from being a menace on our roads and should not hinder the lives of individuals.",
