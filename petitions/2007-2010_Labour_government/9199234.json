        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We believe that the recent changes to the tax system confirmed by the Chancellor will further disadvantage many people already struggling on low incomes. The withdrawal of the 10 pence tax band whilst reducing the standard rate of income tax from 22 pence down to 20 pence is a regressive and harmful measure that will effect approximately five million people. This change will result in some of the poorest people paying proportionately more in tax than the better off. \n\nWe therefore call upon the Government to take the necessary measures to develop a fair and progresive tax system. The first step in this transition should be to maintain the current 10 pence tax band for the low paid.",
