Now it will take legal action against Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) - the body which decided that it was not eligible to get its money back. The cash - most of it donated by patients and their families - was lost when the Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander (KSF) bank collapsed. The bank held the highest possible safety rating and offered the best interest rates when The Christie was advised to invest there. The lost cash was earmarked to pay for two new satellite radiotherapy centres in Salford and Oldham. Bosses have juggled their finances to fund these schemes but say they will now be unable to pay for planned cancer research projects including one with the University of Manchester. Hospital bosses are also trying to recover a further \u00a31m of public funding through the bank's administrators.",

We should have added that NHS North West announced on 9 June 2009 that it would give the Christie \u00a36.5 million to replace the money it had lost in the collapse of Kaupthing, Singer and Friedlander (KSF); and, in view of this, the Christie immediately announced that it would withdraw legal proceedings against the FSCS\u2019s decision. The Government remains delighted that NHS North West made this decision to support the high quality services at the Christie.\n\nMore: http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page22930",
