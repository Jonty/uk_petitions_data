            "background": "This petition has been started because of the pitiful sentences imposed on two thugs who deliberately caused such horrific injuries to a horse called Maggie, that she had to be put to sleep.  \n\nOne got 5 months in a Young Offenders Institute, and 180 hours of Community Service, the other one got a 12 month Community Order, and 180 hours Community service, charges against a third person were dropped.  \n\nThese people tried filming the attack on a mobile phone and laughed as they attacked a gentle, loving horse.\n\nMaggie had been with her owner since the horse was 18 months old, she was cruelly attacked and killed at the age of 19.  \n\nPlease sign this petition to get the sentences of those who commit these atrocities increased, and to be tried at Crown court, not Magistrates courts",
