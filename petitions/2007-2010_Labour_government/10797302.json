            "background": "As a district nurse I see patients with a cancer diagnosis on a daily basis.  Often these are younger people who are unable to work due to their diagnosis, are receiving treatment and are on sick pay.  At present they have to pay for the full cost of prescriptions for any medication relating to their disease ,eg analgesia for pain relief, anti-emetics for nausea etc, and for any dressings for a surgical or fungating wound.  This causes undue stress and often financial pressure on these patients who are already trying to come to terms with a difficult diagnosis of cancer.  I urge you to join with me in this petition to allow free prescriptions for all patients with cancer.",
