Muslim Leader's are trading in the same paper that buy's Israeli weapons which kill's Palestinians.\n\nWe call on all Muslim country's to stop selling Oil in dollar's and it to be brought in another currency i.e. gold or the Euro which is not controlled by America and it's supporters of war against the Muslim's in Palestine. if the leader's of the Arab World hear this call and switch their money trading in the Mid-east to another form over night the American Dollar will be worthless.\n\nWe the under signed ask all Muslim's and non Muslim's to reject another round of peace talk's controlled by Israel and America and make the USA $ Dollar worthless like their false claims for justice and peace for Muslim's in Palestine",
