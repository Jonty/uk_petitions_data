            "background": "The probation service is being centralised, meaning that people have to travel a distance to reach offices and this limits access to those using the service. This means that the appropriate support is not being given to people when released which results in some cases re-offending.\n\nAlso, offers that are made to prisoners about the help and support they will receive when released are not upheld by the service or local authority. These issues affect at the community level and more should be done to resolve them at the community level, such as supported living schemes, job share/mentoring and fast track aprentishships.",
