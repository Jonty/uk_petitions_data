            "background": "The conduct of MPs concerning their expenses has eroded the public's confidence in their political representatives. The only way to regain confidence is to publish all MPs expenses, dissolve parliament and hold another general election. This will allow the electorate to decide who deserves to be returned to public office. Trust, confidence, meaningful accountability and censure for misconduct, are all essential elements if a democracy is to flourish and not become atrophied.",
