This constant barrage of media aimed at lazy people is getting quite frankly annoying and what is worse is the fit all way it is being done by government and surprisingly the BMA.  The opinion at the moment is \"If your not fat your healthy\" which is of course absolute rubbish as my constantly reducing weight can testify to.",
