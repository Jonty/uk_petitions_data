        "background": "Having just watched the Panorama program on kids fighting and the fights being captured on video, I was appalled by the apparent lack of concern shown by the upload websites owners.  If these were proper films they would have been censored and would not have made the screen. Surely the same laws should apply to these upload sites especially when there is no way to protect children from watching the uploaded videos.  I believe the prime minister should introduce Regulations to prevent this unnecessary violence from being used by these companies, and to clarify the law relating to taking and uploading the videos in the first place.",
