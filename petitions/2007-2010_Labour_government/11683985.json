            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Transfer of credit card balances to low or zero rates of interest are now more difficult or impossible to obtain. When these deals expire, high rates of interest are imposed making it difficult to reduce balances in the current climate. Banks should be required to convert, on surrender of the card, any balance to a loan at a  low rate of interest for a term that suits the customers circumstances.  Banks have encouraged high levels of credit card debt by these low rate deals and the practice of increasing limits without checking the customers ability to sustain these levels of debt. All the help in this crisis is going to those that demonstrated the Corporate Greed that caused it. There should be some help for the responsible individuals who wish to take control of their finances. This measure would reduce credit card debt and make the current debts more managable. The reduction of high interest payments would increase disposable income at this crutial time and help to stimulate the economy.",
