            "background": "Sir David Eady has repeatedly defined terms beyond conventional usage and ignored adumbrations of such terms by defendents in the original documents upon which libel cases were founded. \n\nThe latest example is over the term \"bogus\" in the case of the BCA versus Simon Singh where, contrary to both conventional usage and to Singh's explanation in the original Guardian article he define it as to mean \"deliberate and targeted dishonest\".\n\nIt should not be up to any judge to define terms beyond any possible charitable and conventional usage and, if allowed to continue, is a serious threat to that cherished British value of freedom of speech.",
