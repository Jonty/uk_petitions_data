        "background": "Capital punishment should be brought back for Murder.  There have been recent cases of children being murdered by parents and/or carers and the news items are so distressing that it's difficult to watch.  Adults who do this to children do not deserve the protection afforded under any Human Rights legislation. A jail term is no longer a deterrant and we should consider the death penalty where guilt can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.",
