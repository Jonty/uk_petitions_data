Christine Ohurugu a cheat for winning a medal for herself not for anybody else?\n\nPoliticians, businessman and other \"friends\" of the government for lining their own pockets. And z-list celebrities for who knows what.\n\nLets bring back the honour to our awards system. Give deserving people...real heroes...charitable people and selfless people these honours so that a Knighthood can once again be an honour to be truly proud of.\n\nWar Heroes and the brave men and women of our armed forces...ordinary people who give their time to their community and expect nothing in return.True greats ( Unlike Nick Faldo ) such as Murray Walker and John Mcguinness who are ordinary people with extraordinary lives.\n\nEnough of this Government love in.I'm sure Her majesty would agree there are far more deserving people.",
