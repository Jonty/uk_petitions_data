            "background": "All car parking should be free. The founding principle of NHS healthcare is that it is free at the point of delivery. Car parking fees makes this principle unachievable. It is time to reverse this wrong. In some areas of the country, particularly rural areas, it is necessary to drive to hospitals owing to poor or non-existent public transport. We either need a public transport network that reaches everyone or free parking for those whom public transport does not reach.",
