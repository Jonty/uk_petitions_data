            "background": "A fair and logical system would set the tax rates as a linear function, discretized into bands 20gCO2/km wide. The tax due for the band is that for the *highest* value that falls within it. \n\nThe linear portion should reflect the energy security and climate change impacts of the emissions, at a modest rate of e.g. GBP 0.50/(gCO2/km). Vehicles that emit no CO2 at all are not subject to this linear portion.\n\nThe constant coefficient should be 0.5% of the vehicle's original MSRP, reflecting the fact that those who can afford expensive cars should also make a greater contribution to society.\n\nExample A: car with MSRP of GBP 10000, emitting 101-120gCO2/km. Annual road tax: GBP 110\n\nExample B: car with MSRP of GBP 50000, emitting 221-240gCO2/km. Annual road tax: GBP 370\n\nExample C: car with MSRP of GBP 100000, emitting 341-360gCO2/km. Annual road tax: GBP 680\n\nExample: Ford Mondeo 2.0l\nMSRP: GBP 18000\nEmissions: 187gCO2/km\nAnnual road tax: GBP 190\n\nThis system also has the advantage of further penalising those who choose to buy the most polluting vehicles (current highest is over 420gCO2/km.  The highest current band is simply \"greater than 255gCO2/km\")",
