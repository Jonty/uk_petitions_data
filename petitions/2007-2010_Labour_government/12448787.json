            "background": "In light of increasing obesity levels in children, part of the governments initiative is to encourage more physical activity from an early age. Rightly so. Play areas for children, however, are often substandard and in some cases down right dangerous. If the Government could provide local councils with a specific budget for improving or providing new play areas it would be investing in the health of our children and will have longer term benefits.",
