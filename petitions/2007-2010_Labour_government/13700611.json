            "background": "School support staff (usually women, often carers, who cannot take other jobs because of caring) are underpaid, and undervalued. \nOften well-educated, skilled, dedicated and hard working, they are still paid UTTERLY PITIFUL wages. Wages and conditions vary across the UK.\n\nThey were told pay and conditions were under review, and the very varied conditions across the UK were to be rationalised, but what has happened? Nothing. We feel let down and forgotton.\n\nNow we have a recession, which is not our fault, but where does this leave a cause that was hardly progressing anywhere in any case?\n\nMPs huff and puff about thier lot - tell them to try living on our poverty wages.\n\nI urge the Government to do the right thing at long long last and lift us out of a life of constant juggling finances, scrimping and saving, and debt. and feeling exploited because we are often mothers / carers who need the hours.",
