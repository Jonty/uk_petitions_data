            "background": "Carer's Allowance, whilst a pitifully low amount, is officially a TAXABLE income which suggests the government consider it to be earned income since it requires an individual to perform a specific role for a minimum amount of hours per week.  \n\nDespite this, the government blatantly contradicts its own definition, by refusing to acknowledge that a fulltime Carer should be entitled to Working Tax Credits.  \n\nDoes the government acknowledge that this is disgracefully prejudice against Carers, who perform their 'job' for far below minimum wage? \n\nMillions of Carers and their families live significantly below the official poverty line.  \n\nRemove this prejudice by either allowing recognition for Working Tax Credits, or paying at least the minimum hourly wage rate.",
