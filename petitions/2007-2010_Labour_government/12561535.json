        "background": "It is frustrating to drivers of many years who are memebers of the commonwealth who also drive on the left and have similar rules to the Uk for driving. Coming from Jamaica we are frustrated to know that we must prepare for a theory exam and further to that sit a practical driving test, after driving for many years. It has beed brought to our attention that the switching over is merely a signing of an agreement between the two countries, and then memebers of the public will be able to switch their Drivers Licence without the stressfulness.",
