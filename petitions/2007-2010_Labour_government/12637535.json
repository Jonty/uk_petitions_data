            "background": "The expenses scandal has broken the bond between governor's and the governed.  Trust in British political life has been irreparably damaged by the morally bankrupt claims of scores of MP's on the expenses system.  Parliament has lost moral authority to govern this country and this is something only a general election can go some way to remedying.  David Cameron, the leader of the opposition, has called for action from the British people to pressurize Gordon Brown to call an election, and this petition reflects this call to that effect.",
