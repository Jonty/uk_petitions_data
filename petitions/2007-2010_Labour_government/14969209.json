            "background": "Three years is the current minimum sentence for burglars convicted of a third offense.  Burglars targeting residential property terrorise people right across the Country.  It is horrendous thinking of many people, such as the elderly, living in fear of this happening to them, never mind the victims of this crime.\n\nSome of these criminals go on burglary sprees for years undetected, if we are lucky enough to catch them we have to ensure that they are punished severely to significantly deter both others and themselves.\n\nThis is not one of those crimes where most extenuating circumstances should be taken into account.  It is a crime which can easily \"go wrong\" and end up with real injurys or even death.  Burglars should be locked up for a really long time no matter what their reasons, and no matter how many times they've done it.\n\nAnd it should be much more than 3 years.\n\nI'm not suggesting zero tolerance to all crimes, but crimes like this are undisputably zero tolerance crimes.  Who knows what happened the last time, and what will happen the next time they commit this horrible act.",
