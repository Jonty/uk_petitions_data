            "action": "abolish the use of eviction by social landlords, against tenants living in poverty",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Eviction is a barbaric process that serves only to obscure and extenuate defficiencies within the current welfare system. Preventing the use of this extreme against individuals living within an accepted definition of poverty will encourage public services to acknowledge and address the wide variety of issues that contribute towards poverty. It will also serve to ensure that such defined households are not subjected to the added burden of court and furniture removal costs. It will prevent the wastful depreciation of household goods they cannot reuse/store, and will abolish the financial burden and un-necessary excess of re-purchasing household items they were previously forced to dispose of. This action will serve to provide the British public with a sense of safety and security concurrent with meeting one of their basic needs, a secure base from which to grow and develop. This action will also send a clear message that the public services that are designed to meet the needs of every individual indiscriminately take their duties seriously, consequently instilling confidence in this governments ability to promote and sustain the values of the British community.",
