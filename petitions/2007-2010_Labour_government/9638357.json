Many times these sites have problems getting permission to sell the music they would like to as they are controlled by the record companies and distributors.\n\nFor the sake of both those running the sites and the purchasers, make it perfectly legal for these sites to sell any music they wish. They can even buy CDs and decode the music themselves into mp3 or wma or AAC format as they choose, as long as they label correctly what they are selling and pass on the royalties to the appropriate music authority to distribute (possibly the PRS).",
