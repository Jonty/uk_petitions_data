            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "ice cream vendors are in close contact with children in many unsupervised areas.\noutside schools,and any street or play area ,park etc.\nthere needs to be a criminal check on them as a occupation as is with many other occupations that come into close contact with children. This will make the likelyhood of members of the community who are vulnerable children being the main ones a lot safer.\na taxi cab driver and public service vehicle driver have to undergo these checks ,also teachers,assistants and other workers in schools and in contact with children.\nSo why should this not be the case for ice cream vendors there are a lot of people who will disagree and not see the point behind it but that is only because there has not been many reports of children being placed under risk due to the vendors not being criminaly screened.\ndo we haveto wait till this happens before we act and do something which is quite a simple thing to do as has been done with many other occupations its time for this to happen.",
