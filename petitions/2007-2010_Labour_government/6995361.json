There is nothing stopping this man from committing another crime but maybe next time it could be murder. It is time to shut the stable door before the horse has bolted not after. This sentence is unjust and appalling, what has happened to our justice system? When a person gets a prison sentence for none payment of Council Tax but not for grievous bodily harm, something is drastically wrong. This case should go to appeal and an adequate sentence, which insures that Steve Gordon can never ever attack a member of the public again, should be given!",
