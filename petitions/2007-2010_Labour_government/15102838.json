            "background": "The expenses system is in a mire. Proposals to increase MPs pay is not acceptable; an MP could skimp on accommodation to pocket the money with no accountability, get poor quality rest and lower their performance in the House. Government provided flats eradicate the accommodation expenses problem and ensures MPs enjoy a reasonable standard of accommodation and facilities while in London. It might also provide better value for voters money than hotels, while also taking the load of administering accommodation off the MPs staff.\n\nAs leader of Government, the Prime Minister should be seen to bring this petition to parliament for the good of this country, for the betterment of public expenditure and for the image of politics in this country; which uses the money of the population, to govern for the population.",
