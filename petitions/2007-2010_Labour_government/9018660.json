This can be stopped by people being better educated when they take their driving test on how to treat cyclists and pass them. My second point is that football si our countrys sport and we cant even get into euro 2008 and we have it on public tv Match fo the Day while cycling which we are supposedly going ot do so well in at the 2012 olympics is never seen on public TV. Hope you read this thankyou cycling maniac Tom CAnning",
