            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This requests that the government consider passing legislation, so that, when a property is on the letting market with an advertised rate per week under a 12 month (or greater) contract and the landlord wishes to let this property to current university students that he or she should be forced by law to offer a 9 month contract at the same advertised 12 month rate to the student tenants. Rent for the extra three summer months which almost all students are forced to pay in their ultimate and pan-ultimate years is most often equal to a terms worth of student financial support. I, and those who sign this petition believe this to be not only an unfair burden on students but also is a gross misspend of public money at a time of significant economic turmoil. We feel the government would do well to implement this simple regulation which will save a significant amount of public money and student debt.",
