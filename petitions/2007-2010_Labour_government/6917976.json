            "background": "Greater Manchester as not exsisted for over 20 years. It was created without the knowledge or permission of the people it of that part of Lancashire and cheshire. Very few people took any notice of this new county then and even less now, including Royal Mail. I for one take exception in being called a Mancunian as i am and always will be a Lancastrian. It's about time books like the AtoZ and other such publications produce accurate maps which shows that these 'metropolitan counties' have been removed. The Government say that they are for administration purposes only, why?, just remove them.",
