        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Traffic congestion along Great Ormond Street is a nightmare. It is a busy road with parking allowed on both sides. In peak periods traffic comes to a standstill as large and small vehicles try to pass each other when there is no room. This causes particular problems for ambulances trying to access the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, whether they are picking up or dropping off patients. Making Great Ormond Street one way would greatly ease the traffic congestion and reduce delays during patient transfers.",
