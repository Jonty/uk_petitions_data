            "background": "There are numerous instances across London where the road is in a severe state of disrepair/subsidence/breakup to the extent that in themselves they require slow, careful negotiation, yet the only road works by the councils in question are to install further lumps on the road. I propose that councils should repair such roads to the surfacing standards lavished on the unnecessary shellgrip colourised bus stops( for instance) before using up council tax payers' money on meaningless 'safety' measures, and that the issue of  whether a particular road should be repaired before having humps put in should be by polling the people who live on the road in question.",
