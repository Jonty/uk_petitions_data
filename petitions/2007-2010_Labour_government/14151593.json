            "background": "Uncounted numbers of people with Sickle Cell Aneamia,\n    Thalassemia and Lupus are being disciminated against in\n    employment and training in the UK . Misunderstood and labelled\n    as lazy or lacking in commitment they are sacked or thrown off\n    training courses. The struggle to get Disability Living\n    Allowance or challenge discriminating employers is an\n    additional hurdle that many sufferers cannot face. Many already\n    live with NHS services who do not have the skills,knowledge or\n    competencies to treat their conditions effectively.  All of these\n    conditions require the focus of  national strategies, competency\n    frameworks and performance indicators to quality assure the\n    treatment they receive.  They also need to be recognised as\n    having a disability from the point of diagnosis not after years\n    of suffering.  Please lend your support to the 'Human Rights at Diagnosis' campaign.",
