            "background": "We were a major influence in the Industrial Revolution; yet look at us today - we manufacture so little! All things British are gone!  We are at the mercy of foreign countries for supply of so many goods today.  Big business's are moving their manufacturing to \"cheaper\" countries that promise bigger profits to the company less reliability less quality for you the customer.  Time for British Big/Small Business to invest in Britain and NOT foreign countries that produce sub standard goods, Government must make this happen with incentives and rewards. IT IS TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT WORKS \u2013 MAKE IT MORE INVITING FOR BRITAIN TO MANUFACTURE IN BRITAIN \u2013 OFFER INCENTIVES \u2013 DESIGN  A PLAN THAT MAKES BRITAIN WHAT SHE WAS BEFORE \u2013 A GIANT IN INDUSTRY \u2013 use your heads and come up with a plan of action! MAKE THIS A PRIORITY!   The government needs to make a stand for Britain and bring her back from the wilderness of non manufacturing and get her productive again.  Prime Minister Brown - do something now of great import, leave your mark on Britain.  ENCOURAGE BRITISH MANUFACTURING MAKE IT HAPPEN.",
