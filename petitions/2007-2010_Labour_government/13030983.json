            "background": "In 1974 my country was taken by an illegal invasion which the whole world witnessed.  \nThe UK holds bases in Cyprus and acknowledges that the Turks invaded our beautiful island murdering thousands of my fellow cypriots.\nWhy were you so quick to wade into the Iraq conflict when there were so many other issues which needed to be dealt with, which you have chosen to turn a blind eye to?  Is it because we do not have oil?! You hold great power as a ledaer of a powerful nation but yet you do not have the courage to do what is morally correct.  How would you feel if tomorrow I decided that I wanted half of the UK and was going to invade and take it by force? This issue will not go away and neither will I or my fellow patriots!  \nWe just want the right to go back to our homes and live a peaceful life.  No doubt you will not respond or read this but your continuous silence and lack of acknowledgement of a government only confirms what a spineless governement you really are.  Please do not take it personally as your predecessors are equally as spineless.\n\nYours with disappointment,\nDino Ippocratous.",
