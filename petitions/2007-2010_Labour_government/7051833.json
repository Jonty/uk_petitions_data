            "background": "The war in Afghanistan is unlikely to be won militarily if the local population are dependent upon drug traffickers for their livelihoods / or having their crops destroyed by the US military.\n\nWe advocate a policy whereby the opium crop is purchased at market rates from the farmers and then destroyed.\n\nThe Afghan farmers maintain their livelihoods, the drug traffickers and warlords (including Al Qaeda & Taliban) are removed from the equation and the opium will not reach the streets of our cities. \n\nThis petition is designed to start a debate. Afghanistan \u201cdrug\u201d policy should not be a political \"no-go\" area - especially when the stakes are so high. The cost of military operations is far in excess of the cost of a \"buy and burn\" policy which would result in the placating of Afghanistan\u2019s farmers, the removal of a source of terror funding and simultaneously \u201cremoving\u201d drugs at source.\n\nThe maintenance of the existing NATO policy of \"turning a blind eye\" to opium crops should not be maintained because the trade still leaves the farmers dependent upon the drug traffickers and warlords for their livelihoods and therefore funds criminal activity and terror.",
