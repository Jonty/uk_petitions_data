            "background": "The Blood Service currently bans homosexual men from giving blood and is the only company that are allowed to promote a homophobic policy. They also prevent any male who has had sex with another man i.e. bisexual men from giving blood. This is done by completing a questionnaire before you give blood but when asked if you are a gay male, what is to stop gay men lying and giving blood anyway? It is a useless hurdle in the process and one that is damaging to equality and it should not be legal. All blood is screened anyway therefore, there is no need to exclude anyone",
