        "background": "It has occurred to me that the government has missed a trick! Newcastle still promote the defunct Northern Rock which we own. Hence we must own the rights to the sponsorship deal at Newcastle. As an alternative to currently promoting the bank we should be promoting government initiatives. For example 'Say no to Knifes' or 'Don't Drink and Drive\u2019 through the festive period. Not only are the government getting exposure to one of the largest diverse audiences nationwide, they are getting it for free as it is already a sunk cost.\nAs an add on a number of other clubs will have available space (West Brom, West Ham and possibly even Manchester United if AIG fold.)\n\nSo lets get behind this petition and lets face it - it would be pretty funny.",
