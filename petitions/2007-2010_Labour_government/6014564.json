            "background": "Citizens can use the NHS for any other health problem, as envisoned during the setting-up of the NHS. However, the situation is now that only non-taxpayers (i.e. those on benefits or very low incomes) can be sure of free dental treatment and even those citizens lucky enough to find an NHS dentist are finding that charges are manipulated (for example a clean being split into top and bottom teeth to allow for 2 separate charges) or certain treatments such as root fillings not being provided by their dentists at all. This seems a terribly unfair situation in that those who fund the NHS (i.e. taxpayers) are prevented by the shortage of NHS dentists from being able to receive free or affordable dental treatment. It is all the more unjust in that it is the taxpayer who funds the training of dentists through the NHS only for this anomaly to ensure that many of them have to pay again for their own treatment, whilst continuing to pay for the free treatment of non-taxpayers.",
