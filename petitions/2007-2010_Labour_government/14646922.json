            "background": "The current scheme for judging who qualifies for EMA is frankly unfair. Just because a household income is above a certain limit (\u00a330,810) does not mean that your parents can afford to provide all the equipment you need whilst at college. As EMA is granted to a student based on the household income, when the next learning year begins the EMA payments can still be based on the previous year regardless of whether the household income has increased. This means, your parents could recieve lots more money, but you still get the payments. This is not fair on those of us who dont recieve EMA. It should either be granted to all of us or none of us.",
