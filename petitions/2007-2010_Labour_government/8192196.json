            "background": "The visual intrusion of overhead wires and poles (landlines) in the UK (either in residential areas or countryside)is dissapointing for UK citizens and is ofter commented by foreign visitors as backward. New telecom lines should be placed underground as a matter of course. \n \nThe main ethos behind this petition is that telegraph poles and overhead lines/wires are visually ugly. We therefore urge this government to take the lead and take UK communications infrastructure into the 21st century.",
