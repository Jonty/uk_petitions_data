As the plaque  says:-\u201cThis hall was built in grateful memory of those from Knighton and the neighbourhood who laid down their lives in the Great War 1914-1918\u201d. \nThroughout the week it provides much needed space for a variety of artistic, recreational and educational events, such as Yoga and Martial Arts, Badminton and Dance classes, and at weekends the locals gather for an evening\u2019s entertainment, local music and talks.\nOriginally built for the community after WW1, it remains unclear how at some point it became the property of the Nottingham CofE Parish. At a later Parish boundary change, it was handed over the Leicester CofE Parish. \nThe local community are concerned that the church wishes to demolish the hall, and sell the land for housing. We argue the hall has been of great use to the wider community, as was intended, and should remain standing, and in use.",
