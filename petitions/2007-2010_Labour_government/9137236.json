They are then sent back after a few weeks break to a conflict zone.  This ploy is simply to extract the tax from them.  This treacherous government shakes the hands of fighting soldiers and makes political capital from the public announcement that they would be exempt paying tax on their wages, only to take their money from their pocket with the other hand.",
