            "background": "i feel it is wrong that 16 year olds get ID to buy much needed two stroke oil for their scooters, however we can not buy it because we have to be 18 years of age. At 16 we are able to ride 50cc motorbikes with a provisional licence and a CBT pass, however i can not buy two stroke oil as it is a poison and i myt drink it 'Apparently'.. this is just out of order and the law should be changed quickly.",
