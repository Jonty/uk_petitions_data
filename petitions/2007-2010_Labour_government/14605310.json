These are serious mental illnesses that have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness and affect 1.6 million people in the UK.\n\nIncreasing awareness and knowledge of eating disorders in primary care will mean people will suffer less from their eating disorder, with fewer people requiring intensive, long-term treatments that are both distressing for sufferers and their families, and expensive for the NHS.",
