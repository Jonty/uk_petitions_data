        "background": "Currently, HGV lorry drivers cannot transport goods if they are learner drivers, bus drivers cannot carry passengers if they are learner drivers, but pizza delivery motorcyclists all have 'L' plates on their motorcycles.\nFrom general observation, it is clear that pizza delivery motorcyclists have a lack of road sense and bike sense. They are some of the worse road users around, and lack consideration for other road users. A law should be passed forcing all motorcyclists to have a full motorbike license before being permitted to use a motorcycle commercially or for financial gain. This law should apply to all forms of commercial motorcycle use, and not just pizza delivery motorcycles.",
