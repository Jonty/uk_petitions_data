We should locate and deport all illegal immigrants, send asylum seekers back whence they came and be brave enough to say that this is for the benefit of the country.  This is an English-speaking nation with traditions and cultures that are not the same as those of other countries and we must not allow the arguments of Political Correctness and Human Rights to destroy our heritage.\n\nI believe that the acceptance of this petition and the adoption of the policy that it supports would give the public what it wants and would facilitate, as a minimum, the following benefits:\n\n\u2022Reduce the influx of undesirable aliens\n\n\u2022Reduce spread of disease and infection\n\n\u2022Reduce erosion of the nation's identity\n\n\u2022Reduce the threat of terrorism\n\n\u2022Reduce the housing shortage\n\n\u2022Reduce the prison population\n\n\u2022Reduce hospital waiting lists\n\n\u2022Reduce congestion on roads\n\n\u2022Reduce welfare expenditure \n\n\u2022Reduce school class sizes \n\n\u2022Reduce driving accidents\n\n\u2022Reduce unemployment\n\n\u2022Reduce crime rate\n\n\u2022Reduce taxes",
