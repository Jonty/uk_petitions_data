        "background": "There in no point for English Lit at all. The only requirement you need is to be competent in reading and writing. Researching stories such as shakespeare will provide nothing that is actually needed in the big wide world. The same goes for poetry. The only way Eng Lit can actually help you in future life is if you want to be a proffesional story writer or poet. It should be scrapped as its wasting time that could be better used to teach core subjects.",
