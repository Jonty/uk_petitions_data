        "background": "The BBC is supposed to be a public-broadcaster, meaning they should serve the public with high quality programming which we pay for with our licence fees. Recently the BBC has spent millions on sporting rights which as a non-sports fan I find wasteful. They should not be trying to compete with commercial channels for ratings but offering licence payers high quality programmes.",
