            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "People with Asperger syndrome have a greater than average intellectual ability, and are capable of obtaining a high level of skills and qualifications in technical subjects such as science, engineering, and IT. However, they have extreme difficulty in obtaining and holding down jobs in the private sector because of a perceived lack of social skills, a requirement for certain people skills that only neurotypical people have, or problems with body language and diplomatic answers in interviews.\n\nAs a result, over half of adults with Asperger syndrome with a high level of skills and qualifications are either unemployed, or seriously underemployed in an unskilled dead end job.\n\nTrying to persuade private sector companies to employ more people with Asperger syndrome verges on futile because corporate bosses see no business case for employing them.\n\nI therefore propose that the government creates more public sector jobs for highly skilled people with Asperger syndrome in universities, hospitals, research labs, and the civil service.",
