            "background": "The British Airports Authority have  come under fire from general public and corporations alike for it's perceived failings in matters of airport security.\n\nIt is now proposed to use BAA as consultants for security at London 2012 Olympics\n\nPoor staffing levels, poor training, security 'officers' originating from EU countries that don't provide Criminal Records check, are but some of the accusations.\n\nIn addition to government mandated checks, BAA add to these by imposing checks that are arguably pointless. \n\nThe BAA high level management appear to be immune to the un-necessary trouble and grief that thousands of air travellers are subjected to every day. \n\nThere is every reason to suppose that if BAA 'security consultants' advise on the 'rules' for the 2012 Olympics, similar heartache will ensue.\n\nThe time to pass security in Beijing was reportedly 4 minutes. Will any security regime on which BAA advise manage to achieve anything similar, or can we look forward to watching the Olympic Games from a large TV screen whilst stood in a 3 hour queue at the Olympic Stadium turnstile?",
