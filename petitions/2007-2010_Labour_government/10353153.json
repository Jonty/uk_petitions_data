            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We living in rural areas are paying more for fuel than across the rest of Britain. We have no public transport and it is impossible to live without a car. We have to drive to get to a supermarket, we have to drive to buy new clothes & we have to drive to visit a hospital. We have no choice in the matter, it is a necessity.\nWe signed below are calling for the price of fuel in cities to be increased to susidise the rural parts of Britain. This would also help combat the polution situation & discourage those that have alternative means of transport to actually use it and not their cars.",
