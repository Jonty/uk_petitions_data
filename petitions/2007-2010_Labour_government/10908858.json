        "background": "When someone claiming tax credits submits a change of circumstances there is a delay of approx. 4 weeks in altering the claim, leading to payments continuing to be made. The HMRC will then claw back 4 weeks of full payments, even when the actual overpayment made is far less. The HMRC should either immediately alter the payments made, on notification,via computer, thus preventing any over payments or only claim back that small amount of money to which the claimant wasn't entitled and not full weekly amounts, as this causes hundreds of pounds to be owed instead of the few pounds really owed.This causes people to be in unnecessary debt.",
