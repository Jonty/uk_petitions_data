            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many people coming to the end of their mortgage scheme with Northern Rock are faced with a 3% or more hike in their interest rate which can increase their monthly payments by up to 60%. Due to falling house prices and subsequent lack of equity they are falling into arrears and facing reposession due to government directives. This is a ridiculous situation, which penalises people unable to move away from Northern Rock, at a time when the government is proclaiming its new measures to help people in difficult circumstances. Surely charity or even just fairness should begin at home and these people should be moved onto a rate similar to that available from other mortgage lenders as a remortgage (for example 1% above base rate). The government is saying they wish to reduce the Northern Rock mortgage book, but these people are unable to find mortgages elsewhere and, even if they wished to, cannot sell their home in this current market. At the same time Northern Rock is advertising for new business through mortgage brokers. How fair is this?",
