            "background": "There is a clear answer as to what should be done about oil and that is for all stockmarkets to make it so that 70% of the money people invest in shares in oil has to be paid up front and also that they should have to buy 100 shares minimum as its the smaller investors that are driving up the price of oil. If the smaller investors were to invest that money into shares in banks instead then maybe banks can start giving out loans again to help people out of credit card debts etc. The same would happen if they regulated utility shares like gas and electric like that also. The world governments could make that law over investors easily.",
