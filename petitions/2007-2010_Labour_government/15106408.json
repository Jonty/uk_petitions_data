        "background": "Unite's recent decision to hold another strike at British Airways is unjustified and selfish. The union is destroying the airline and ruining the lives of British people trying to travel to friends, family, relatives or for business and pleasure. It is quite clear that BA does not have the demand it used to as a result of the recent recession and as such it must reduce pay and reduce its workforce numbers in order to survive. However the government will not step in to sort this problem out as Unite has provided Labour with \u00a311 million of funding and is one of the biggest contributors. Therefore in order to maintain impartiality, the Government must not receive donations from unions such as Unite or any other unions, so that it can run the country for the majority of its population and not just the union minority.",
