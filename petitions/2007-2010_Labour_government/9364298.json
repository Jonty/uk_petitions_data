            "background": "Following yet another murder of a Goth at the hands of brutal thugs - only the latest of uncountable other similar offences against those who follow 'alternative culture' - we believe that the law must be changed to protect such people. Goths are routinely targeted by street gangs out of fear and ignorance. They are treated as a visible easy target and subjected to many antisocial and violent offences. This cannot be tolerated any longer. Mr Blair answered a previous petition stating that this was difficult to legislate, as culture is not intrinsic to the individual. We feel this is incorrect as alternative culture is often connected to a persons religion, lifestyle, beliefs, and even sense of identity. Additionally, the frequency of offences against Goths should afford them the status of a victimised minority.",
