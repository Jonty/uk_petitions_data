        "background": "I am sure that Gordon Brown, being an economics pundit, knows that imposing sanctions on a third world country like Zimbabwe, (under the guise of denouncing ZANU PF),is nothing but cruel and callous.  Imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe and villifying Mugabe is not the way to help Zimbabwe.  Instead of being pigheaded and promulgating how Gordon Brown will not negotiate with Mugabe, and avoiding any encounter with him, why does he not try to discuss the situation in Zimbabwe with Mugabe.  I bet if Zimbabwe had oil, Gordon Brown and George Bush would have been the first people to try to find a solution to the situation in Zimbabwe.  The general public have forgotten why the British government is so quick to find fault/villify Mugabe.  The British government just wants to cover up the fact that this whole situation with the farms and white Zimbabweans, etc, which lead to the situation in Zimbabwe, was started by the British and USA not keeping to their word about the Lancaster House Agreement.  I am sure if Gordon Brown and the USA would own up to the fact that they are the cause of the sad and disgraceful situation in Zimbabwe, negotiations would be possible and everything would turn out okay.",
