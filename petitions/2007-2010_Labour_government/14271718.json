The inclusion of the pay TV service Sky as one of the broadcasters showing the debate between the party leaders is not inclusive. It does not entitle people who choose to use free TV services such as Freeview and Freesat to watch. This is entirely inappropriate and steps should be taken to either show this on a free-to-air channel or repeat the broadcast on a free-to-air channel soon after original transmission.\n\nThe two other debates will be held on free-to-air TV. All three debates should be treated the same.",
