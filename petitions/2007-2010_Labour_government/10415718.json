            "background": "The current maximum loan is \u00a34625. The sudden increase in the cost of living has affected students as well. Bills are becoming more expensive, the cost of food is rising, rent is going up and those students running cars are being crippled by the price of petrol. We propose that students be giving an extra 3.8% (the governments current rate of inflation)this year to cover these costs. This would amount to \u00a3175.75 for someone outside London recieving a maximum loan and an extra \u00a3246.05 for someone living in London on a maximum loan. We propose this extra 3.8% be paid this year as a grant know as the \"Student Allowance\". Such grants should be considered at future times when the economic future of students looks bleak.",
