        "background": "We believe that Royal Mail hs worked best for hundreds of years as the property of the Crown than it could as a privatised company. If Royal Mail is privatised it would most, like most other privatised utilities, in the hands of foreign companies who don't care about the quality of service in Great Britian, who would make cut-backs damaging to the postal service in Great Britain and who would destroy Royal Mail's centuries old iconic image and traditions.\n\nThere is another petition at the moment which asks for parts of the Royal Mail not to be sold off to foreign companies, however that's all it asks, it does not ask that Royal Mail not be privaties at all, like this one does.\n\nEven if Royal Mail doesn't end up in foreign hands it will end up in the hands of people who care only about profits, not about service or the centuries of traditions surronding Royal Mail, who would no doubt refashion Royal Mail like the time it's name was changed to \"Consignia.\"",
