Can you apply a yearly windfall oil tax and legislate so excess profits by all oil companies are taxed in the same way as Palin taxes them in Alaska then share out all the winfall taxes equally among each UK citizen, again same as they do in Alaska. Do not keep the windfall tax, share it all out so we can all afford fuel bills in winter and no one will die of hypothermia. Charity begins at home.",
