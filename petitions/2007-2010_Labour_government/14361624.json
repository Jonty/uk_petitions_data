            "background": "The extreme pornography section of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 should be restricted so that it may only include real life images so that it can not be applied to fictional representations such as artwork or writing. Leaving such representations open to the use of this law creates a legal minefield where anyone in possession of comic books, literature, artwork etc. involving acts of violence is liable to be prosecuted. It also restricts the creative rights of artists and authors to create depictions of fictional violence.",
