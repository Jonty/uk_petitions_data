            "background": "On 1st October 2007, Post Office Ltd. announced the proposed closure of the Post Office branch in Rippingale Village Stores, to be replaced by an \u2018outreach\u2019 service, operating for a maximum of 13 hours per week. \n\nWe believe that the customer income data used in the decision-making process does not reflect the substantial increase in trade since refurbishment in 2006.\n\n\u2022 The Post Office service is now widely used by the residents of Rippingale and surrounding villages for domestic and business purposes, including \u2018mail order\u2019 companies.  \n\n\u2022 Rippingale has a large elderly population who rely on the Post Office for essential services\n\n\u2022 Very limited bus services make it impossible for those without transport to reach another Post Office.  \n\n\u2022 An \u2018Outreach\u2019 service will not serve the needs of our community. \n\nThe loss of a full-time Post Office counter will severely harm the viability of the shop and may well lead to its closure. It would also lead to an enormous increase in the number of car journeys, contrary to the Government\u2019s policies on global warming.",
