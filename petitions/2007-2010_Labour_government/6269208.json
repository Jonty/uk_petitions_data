            "background": "I am trying to make contact with a government minister re the following:-\nNHS. Casualty depts is being overrun because parents put kids in the car and rush to hospital when they should have a first aid kit at home and deal with it. Secondly because of the mass of immigrants.\nNext, and connected, parents of today no longer know how to be parents expecting the government to solve everything that they should be doing. The government is also feeding this and needs to stop, step back and rethink, otherwise it is feeding a never ending chain.",
