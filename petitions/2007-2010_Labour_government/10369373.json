            "background": "The M4 in London has 3 lanes in each direction, with the exception of the elevated section in West London which only has 2 lanes. This bottleneck creates immense congestion, which could be significantly improved by adding a 3rd lane to the M4 for use as a slip road between J2 and the western end of the elevated section. The cost & disruption of doing this could be minimised by also moving J2 west to where the M4 splits from the A4, so only the elevated section over a non-built-up area need be widened.",
