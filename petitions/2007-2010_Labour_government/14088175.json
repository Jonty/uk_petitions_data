        "action": "introduce new legislation to offer more protection to landlords from bad tenants.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The legal rights between landlords and tenants urgently needs to be reviewed and revised in Parliament to reflect what is currently happening in the letting market. Landlords need more protection against BAD TENANTS! The current legislation needs to be revised to reflect the growing concerns facing landlords when a tenant decides not to pay the rent. Bad tenants are taking advantage of this legislation and abusing their rights. They know that the law provides more protection for them against eviction when they do not pay the rent, so abuse this system. Therefore we need the law to be revised. Landlords need more protection besides the lengthly process of applying for an eviction order. This period is too long. Eviction orders do not deter bad tenants, it just allows them time to continue to live there rent free, whilst destroying the property before moving on. Where are the legislations protecting LANDLORDS against \u201cROGUE TENANTS\u201d? The number of \u201crogue tenants\u201d are getting away scot-free, escaping prosecution and vanishing to another area, property, causing more travesty and devastation along the way!",
