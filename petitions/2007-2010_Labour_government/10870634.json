            "background": "Why should UK citizens be penalised for so called green taxes, when our EU partners do not? On a return to Spain for example, the green tax leaving the UK is DOUBLE the amount of green tax charged from the EU. Most travellers have no alternative but to fly by so called cheap airlines, as homes and families live or work in Europe. Make a consistent EU charge applicable to all UK originating airfares, and give the lower paid people of Britain the chance to travel at reasonable cost - both to pocket and to the environment! After all it's impossible to police the polution between Britain and the EU! Sheer lunacy!",
