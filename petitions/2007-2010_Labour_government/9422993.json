Thats right, they work for us not the other way round. We should say if they deserve our tax money to spend on their homes and making unjust laws that have no relevence in modern society. How can we let them make cannabis a class B again when a celebrity heroin junkie can get out of prison in 20 days? They are a joke of a government and must be stopped",
