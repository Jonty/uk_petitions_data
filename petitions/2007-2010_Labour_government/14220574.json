I was redirected to a porn site, and no way to contact the 'genuine' site\nand I have no way for recompense.\nWhat would have happened if it downloaded underage porn onto my pc?\nthe internet has criminals, theives, so what is the PM/govt going to do about this? the public is vulnerable.\nWhilst he can't ban it, I recognise his limits, it does need addressing and fast.\nPerhaps the web should be banned alogether as it can be so dangerous, undermining, unpolicable, and subterfuge, with nigh on untracable companies taking your money unhindered",
