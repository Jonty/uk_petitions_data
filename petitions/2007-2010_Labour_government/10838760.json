        "background": "At present re-enactors must apply for a full shot gun certificate in order to posess the types of black powder muskets used for blank firing during re enactment displays for the public without ever having any intention of purchasing any other type of shot gun. We propose that a new type of firearms licence be introduced to allow re enactors to posess black powder weapons for re-enactment and living history displays that would be easier to obtain and yet would still be safe in regards to people posessing shot guns.",
