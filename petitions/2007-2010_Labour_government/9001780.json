        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Aside from the Tax Burden, we all know the price of fuel (petrol, diesel, gas, electricity) in this country is ridiculous. I believe this is not helped by the apparent profiteering behaviour of the retailers. For example, I recently witnessed one petrol station change prices THREE times in one day, all increases. Obviously this fuel came from the same tanker delivery, so how can these increases be justified? Quite simply, they can't! It\u2019s profiteering, nothing more, and the knock-on effects are pushing other prices upwards as well. I therefore call on the Government to consider Regulation of all fuel prices to stop the energy companies from raking in obscene profits and potentially crippling our economy. Something MUST be done to stop this and it must be done before the economic damage becomes irreversible.",
