            "background": "It currently costs up to 50p per minute to call a patient in Hospital, and up to 40p per minute for the patient to make calls outside.  Mobile phones are banned on the grounds that they affect the medical equipment... this was deemed to be untrue by the Health Minister Andy Burnham in 2007, and an NHS regulator.\n\nMost people would struggle to afford these charges, and the rises have been consistently above inflation.  Patients have no alternative choices due to the monopoly currently held by the service providers, which is deeply unfair.\n\nThis unfair monopoly needs to stop.  Patients should have the right to use their own phones if they so choose.",
