            "background": "In the current market many household electrical goods are not made to last.  These products - kettles, toasters, printers etc are thrown away rather than repaired, because companies do not provide any spare parts - or if they do, it is more expensive to repair the item, than to buy a new one. I am calling for government to demand that manufacturers produce quality items that can be repaired at a reasonable cost in case of breakdown.\nThis throw away culture is not sustainable.",
