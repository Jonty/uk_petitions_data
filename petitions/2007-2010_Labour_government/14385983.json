Too many times people that use force to protect their loved ones and their families are subjected to a force from the law and justice system that is not representative of public opinion. \n\nWe need to be protected by the law, not criminalised for the act of protection regardless of how much force is used. \n\nWhen someone enters into a criminal act they lose the right to protection, as the victims the innocents should be afforded more protection.\n\nWe ask this government to look at the whole judicial system and the way cases are dealt with and if need be change the law in favour of victims and not criminals.",
