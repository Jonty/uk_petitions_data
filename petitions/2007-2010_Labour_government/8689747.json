            "background": "The whole point of bus lanes in cities is to make traveling by buses (public transport) quicker and therefore a more attractive option. If more people used buses, there would be fewer cars on the road and less pollution and congestion. Taxis are NOT public transport. They are the most wasteful form of private transport because a large proportion of their journeys are made without a passenger aboard and are therefore entirely pointless. Make taxis wait in the jams with the rest of the private cars and stop them enjoying undeserved special privileges.",
