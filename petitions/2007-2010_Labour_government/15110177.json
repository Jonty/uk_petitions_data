            "background": "With direct journey times of up to four hours between Newcastle and London by rail, the East Coast mainline is in need of improvement. Many commuters travel from Newcastle to London by aeroplane, meaning a high volume of flights is required daily. A high-speed rail link would encourage commuters to consider travelling by rail, thereby significantly reducing carbon emissions and helping to lead to a greener Britain. This high-speed rail link could also potentially be extended to reach Edinburgh in future, providing a convenient and modern link between two capital cities. Plans for a high-speed rail link connecting the North East to London could provide a major benefit to thousands of commuters daily as well as more long-term benefits to the UK's transport infrastructure as a whole.",
