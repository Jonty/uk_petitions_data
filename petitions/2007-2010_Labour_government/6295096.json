            "background": "We urge the Government to restrict the ability of nurses to prescibe non-OTC medicines in the NHS. \nNHS nurses can, after 26 days of training, prescribe a wide variety of prescription only medicines, including drugs to treat serious heart and lung conditions and antibiotics.\n\nIn contrast, doctors train for a minimum of 5 years, studying not just clinical pharmacology but allied subjects like physiology and biochemistry, which are essential to understand the risks and benefits of prescribing medicines.\n\nThere is concern that this practice, designed to speed up patient access to drugs puts patient safety at risk, a concern we share.\n\nWe do not oppose nurse prescribing per se, but advocate restricted nurse prescribing, of OTC medicines like paracetamol and ibuprofen only.\n\nWe agree with the Government that patient access to medicines should not be delayed. We suggest an expansion of fully-qualified GPs and specialist hospital doctors who can safely and appropriately prescribe complex drug regimens.",
