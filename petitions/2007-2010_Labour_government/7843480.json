This person was not even an illegal immigrant, she was here ligitimately and outstayed her original visa.  Why, in the circumstances of her illness, this original visa was extended until she was well enough to return to her homeland is bureaucracy gone mad and we advocate a reversal of the decision to deport her to end her suffering and before she dies.",
