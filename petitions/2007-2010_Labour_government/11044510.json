            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are over 500,000 children being privately educated in the U.K. (Figures from the Independent Schools Council, 30.4.08).  They relieve the taxpayer of a burden of nearly \u00a33 billion and parents already pay twice, by passing a place on a state school.  For these children and their parents, there is no accountability - a state of affairs which is totally unacceptable and undemocratic.\nWe need an Ombudsman or appeal committee for parents and teachers to apply to if they've failed to reach a satisfactory reply from the Headteacher and Governing Body.\nAlso the system of publising annual League Tables needs abolishing, because they are divisive and encourage schools to exclude children on purely educational grounds.  They are even deemed by some headmasters as being 'a cancer on the face of education'.",
