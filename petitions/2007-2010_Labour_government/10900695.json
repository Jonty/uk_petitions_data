            "background": "The customer service provided by BT is to put it mildly, appalling. Calls to the so called Customer Service line will take an enormous amount of time to connect and then after explaining your problem the call will then be transferred to another team after a 20 minute wait (minimum) to enable you to explain yourself again to another faceless minion of BT and eventually be either transferred yet again to a department of very apologetic people who promise that a manager or engineer will call you back within an hour but never do, or as is a more regular occurrence, cut you off completely leading you to pound your phone against your skull in frustration.  BT employees should be taking ownership of problems from the first call all the way to the resolution of every problem rather than passing the buck at the first opportunity.",
