            "background": "I believe it should be allowed to cycle on the pavement. I beleive this for a number of reasons, the primary one being safety. I find it extremely dangerous to cycle in the road, because of the immediate dangers of collisions with vehicles. It is, essentially, as dangerous as pedestrians walking in the road. Also, many motorists immensly dislike cyclists in the road because They slow the cars down. The majority of cyclists I see are, dispite the fact of it being illegal, ride on the pavement, where they fell safe. I am sure all cyclists will take care in avoiding collisions with pedestrians.",
