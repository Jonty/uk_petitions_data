At the moment, in school you are only taught about slavery. I propose we start teaching about all aspects of black culture, from our achievement, education, our battles, our successes and all that makes our race great so that we can face racism head on and show we are no different from any other race. I'm not saying we should rid of all other history studies, just add black history to our children and our future childrens education schemes.",
