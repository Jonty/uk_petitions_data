            "background": "I & millions of hard working individuals in Britain have passed thier Driving Tests to qualify to drive Lorries & Buses.\n\nA new EU Directive has been introduced requiring all new & current licence holders to take further annual training to maintain their qualification / right to drive in thier vehicle catergories.\n\nThis is going to add a minimum of \u00a32000 per year to My Company Overheads (and this based on only 4 drivers in my business). How dare EU Commissioners / politicians dictate to us what we can & cant drive on our Roads.\n\nI guess this will take a few people off the dole queues to become CPC Trainers, but even more people will join the dole queues through Companies going under due to yet more overheads.\n\nIs this really going to be implemented Europe Wide ?\n\nIf this is in the name of \"Health & Safety\", why dont the 26 million car drivers in this Country do the same annual training ? \n\nSomthing to do with Votes perhaps  & alot of them .....?\n\nCome on fellow Britains ! Lets finally show the Eurocrats that We are fed up with thier continuous Red Tape & Regulations.",
