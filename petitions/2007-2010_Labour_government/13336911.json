        "background": "I am disgusted by the way the BNP is allowed to run. The party should be banned for inciting hate, violence, prejudice, and denying the Holocaust, to name but a few. No matter what the BNP says or how they try to justify themseleves, they are racist. They are British Nazis. Something must be done to stop them before we have a repeat of Hitler and Nazi Germany. This is a hate party; they cannot be allowed to spout twisted visions. The government does nothing to stop them and it sickens me; something must be done.",
