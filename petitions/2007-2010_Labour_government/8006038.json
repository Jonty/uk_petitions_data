            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The consequences of the punitive actions of the Israeli government have been disastrous. Hospitals in Gaza have no electricity to run any of their machinery including life support machines and dialysis machines, thus condemning the patients to death. The spread of infection and disease will escalate from the inability to sterilize equipment and keeping the deceased refrigerated until burial. Food supplies are fust running out, as well as clean water.  Furthermore, the temperature there is at -3\u00b0C, with no heating all the civilians including new born babies can do is freeze in their homes. Air strikes continue to kill and injure many more. \n\nWe are concerned that this poverty, impoverishment and violence is not a result of a natural disaster, but of political decisions on the part of a government close to ours.\n\nWe urge our Government to act immediately to bring an end to the bloodshed and suffering, which threatens yet further escalation of violence in the region, by putting pressure on the Israeli government to end this aggression and lift the embargo imposed on Gaza.",
