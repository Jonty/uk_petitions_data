            "background": "Cyclist's safety is being jeopardised when motorists and motorcyclists repeatedly stop on the box area reserved for bicycles at traffic lights in London and around the UK.  We do not want to breathe their exhaust fumes too.  The Highway Code clearly states this that this is against the law but there has to be a much bigger fine to make an impact. It needs to be strictly enforced to encourage more cyclists to feel safe on the roads.",
