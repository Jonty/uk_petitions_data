            "background": "One of the reasons that there is so much underage drinking in britain is because the age limit for drinking is high enough that it causes teenagers to rebel against it, leading to them experimenting illegally with it. However, if like in holland the UK lowered the drinking age to 16 there would be less problem with it. For one it would mean that teenagers were not drinking on the street and would go to civilised places such as pubs to drink. Holland doesn't seem to have a problem, so why should the UK if the law changed?",
