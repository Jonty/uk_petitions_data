        "background": "Housing is a basic economic necessity that has become completely unaffordable for the vast majority of first time buyers.\n\nThe only beneficiaries of these high prices are banks who make massive profits on the interest payments of extremely large loans and the tiny minority of people who sell up and move either to a cheaper area of the UK or another country with less ridiculous property prices.\n \nLike all markets, demand-supply rules apply so it is necessary for the government to build large amounts of good quality housing and to increase disincentives for those who buy-to-rent.",
