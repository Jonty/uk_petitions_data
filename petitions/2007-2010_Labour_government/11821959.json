        "background": "A modern photo-voltaic (PV or solar) system, in combination with a small wind turbine, could easily provide the power to run a small to medium house, especially a ground/air source heat pump for heating purposes.\n\nAny excess energy created can be sold back to the energy companies or stored in battery systems for low light/wind operation.\n\nThese measures would reduce emissions, reduce bills (low income houses would benefit greatly) and reduce britains dependency on imported energy (gas, oil etc.).\n\nWhilst i care about the environment and my part in protecting it, i cannot afford the costs involved in installing these systems into my house.\n\nThe costs of these systems can be offset in construction costs for new build developments, reducing the need for government grants for retro-fitting the technologies mentioned.",
