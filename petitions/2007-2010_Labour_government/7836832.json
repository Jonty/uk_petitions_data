            "background": "This petition aims to reduce the speed limit from 70 to 50mph on the A15 duel carriageway between the villages of Glinton and Werrington in Peterborough. This is as a result of two serious incidents.  \n\nIn Dec 07 a vehicle travelling at over 100mph hit the roundabout, flew through the air and crashed through the wall of a first floor flat. This resulted in the drivers\u2019 death, injures to his 9 year old son and left the flat uninhabitable. Six weeks (Jan 08) later a second car left the roundabout and collides with a house in Danish Court. The driver escaped with injuries to her legs. \n\nTo prevent further fatalities and injuries the following measures are proposed:\nReduction in the speed limit from 70 to 50mph. Bringing this section of road inline with others like it on the A15 through Peterborough. \nRumble strips on the approach to the roundabout.\nA safety camera to maintain and enforce this new limit.\nArmco barriers adjacent Danish Court.",
