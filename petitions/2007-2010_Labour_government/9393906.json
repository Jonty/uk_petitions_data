            "background": "The Doncaster Branch of CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) has received disturbing information concerning a proposed redevelopment in the St Sepulchre Gate West area of the town, which could pose a direct threat to the Corner Pin public house (and also the Horse and Jockey across the road). \nIt would seem that Doncaster Council cannot contemplate the (admittedly much needed) regeneration of this part of town without seeing a need to demolish these valuable community pubs in order to make way for new development. We understand that the plans for the site of the Corner Pin involve the demolition of the pub, landscaping the site, and then planting a tree!!\nThe Corner Pin and the Horse & Jockey are historic and irreplaceable public houses, with the former having twice been voted Doncaster CAMRA Pub of the Season and also Branch Pub of the Year 2008. These public houses, each with their own distinct character and architecture, have been part of community life in Doncaster for many years and both would be sadly missed.\nThis is not a time for complacency; please help beat the bulldozer by signing this petition and registering your opposition to Doncaster Council's proposals.",
