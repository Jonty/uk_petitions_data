            "background": "Currently the law states that a person must have a GSCE grade C or above in English and Mathematics to do any A levels. This means that I myself have to resit my English and Mathematics GCSE just so that I can take A level ICT and Science. I literally cannot find any logic in this rule.\n\nI suggest that the rules should be changed so that a GCSE grade C or above will be needed only in the subject you wish to study and just a pass in English and mathematics.",
