        "background": "He introduced Rock 'n' Roll to this country and has given his service to the theatre, film and music for the past 51 years. At the age of 71 he is still packing the theatres. He has never deserted his country and stays true to Britain. He doesn't plaster his face all over TV and so tends to be overlooked. He goes about his business, giving to charity quietly and without fuss. His services to the entertainment industry deserve a Knighthood.",
