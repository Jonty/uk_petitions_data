These are, after all the principles that our troops are risking their lives to uphold. I also hope that we can take the opportunity to show Britain in it's best light and line the streets to pay our respects to the 100,000s of people of all races who have died in these wars, not to scream abuse at Islam 4 UK and give our enemies propoganda to use against us. It is possible to be against the war but still be 100% behind our brave troops.",
