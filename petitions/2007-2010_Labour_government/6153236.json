            "background": "The idea that residents must pay to park near their homes in controlled parking zones is little more than a revenue generating scam.\n\nControlled parking zones result in fewer parking spaces. Parking across drives is not allowed & smaller spaces (for smaller 'green' cars) are automatically excluded.\n\nFurthermore, local authorities use CPZ schemes as revenue generators by issuing only limited visiting permits (at a time) and uneccessarily strict rules. For instance cars parked slightly outside of marked bays can be given penalties.",
