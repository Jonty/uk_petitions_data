            "background": "UK citizens under the age of 13 are not typically able to earn money.  There is no need or sense in targeting advertising at these children.\n\nAdvertising targeted at children is intended to bring about a desire for consumption, a belief that money can buy happiness; and can only add pressure on adults and society.  All of these are not values or factors that we need or want to promote, and our children are the next society.  This step would be cheap and easy, incremental and long-term, would harm few and help many.",
