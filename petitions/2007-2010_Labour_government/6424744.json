        "background": "Religious people of every faith contribute to British society every day through work, paying taxes, and contributing to the country's social and cultural life. We ask for the right to continue to practice our faith freely, including the right to educate our children in accordance with our beliefs, free from the unfortunate prejudice and bigotry of some UK citizens who would prefer to use the government to not only deny us access to public funds in our schools (we pay taxes too!) but to go further in using the state to curtail the practice of our faith. We respect the right of every citizen to educate their children in line with their beliefs, as there is no such thing as a 'value-free' education, and ask for the same courtesy to be extended to us.",
