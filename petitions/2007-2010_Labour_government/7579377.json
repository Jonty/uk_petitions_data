            "background": "Hundreds of feral cats living at the site of the future Olympic Park in London could be in danger of starving as their food sources have been eliminated, being crushed by heavy machinery or being buried under rubble.\nSince most feral cats flee and hide when humans approach, it's impossible to ensure that buildings are clear of cats before demolition begins.\n\nThe Celia Hammond Animal Trust (CHAT) has already rescued 157 cats and kittens. CHAT need to be able to access the site to trap and safely remove the remaining cats. The trappers are requesting permission to access the road outside the site to set up feeding stations and traps. Preventing these cats from being rescued is essentially a death sentence for these animals.\n\nCHAT needs to be allowed adequate time to rescue these cats, including time to set up feeding stations to acclimate the cats to being fed in certain areas as a prelude to trapping, as well as time to monitor nursing cats in order to locate and remove litters of kittens hidden in dangerous areas.",
