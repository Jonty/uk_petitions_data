            "background": "In the interest of Democracy and to counter voter apathy, the Government should introduce the option for voters to actively 'Abstain' from an election, which should be considered as a vote of 'No Confidence' in all Political parties and individuals on said Ballot Papers. In the event of a majority active abstention vote a Hung Parliament should declared, and a proportionally Hung Parliament to the percentage of any active abstention votes cast.\n\nRather than merely allowing 'Spoiled' Ballot Papers to be discounted and largely ignored, we feel that by adding this form of official protest vote option to future Ballot Papers, it will make Parliament more accountable to disgruntled voters, who will become more engaged in Politics. As well as allow the Government to appear less complacent about voter Apathy and low voter turnout in the United kingdom.",
