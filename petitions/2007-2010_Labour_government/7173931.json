        "action": "review, urgently, the framework for licensing Houses of Multiple Occupation (HMOs), and to issue local authorities with central guidelines on cost and structure. Action is needed to restore landlords' confidence in HMO property investment, which the market needs to tackle the current shortage of affordable housing.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The HMO licensing scheme was launched in July 2006, however no clear guidelines on cost or structure of these licences were issued to local authorities. A recent survey of 60 local authorities across the UK reveals landlords face licence fees ranging from \u00a380 to \u00a31,100 per year and that at least 11 different licence structures have emerged already, leading 43% of landlords who would normally consider buying an HMO property to actively avoid them, with a further 6% having sold HMO stock.",
