            "background": "The three main parties are all guilty of not challenging the erosion of UK democracy, witness the silence over there being  28 unelected peers in government positions. Increasingly Gordon Brown acts unilaterally and on the hoof without planning. Most recently there was no parliamentary debate on the bank bail out despite using taxpayers' money.  He refuses to even impose limits on how banks spend our funds.  Given this government's love affair with the US,  why does it not copy its policy on bailing out banks and imposing salary/bonus limits ?  Congress and the House of Representatives have just spent a week debating the proposed bail out.  THAT IS DEMOCRACY.",
