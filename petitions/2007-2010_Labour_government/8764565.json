            "background": "\"The beaver is a keystone species whose reintroduction can bring benefits to the countryside including improving the ecology of wetland habitats and associated birds, insets fish, reducing downstream flooding and improving water quality.\"\n\nThe re-establishment of a complex ecological balance in an environment blighted by years of sustained abuse, overdevelopment and exploitation isn't an easy step. The reality is that ever since humans hunted the beaver to the point of extinction around 400 years ago, there has been a major gap in the ecosystem. \n\nThe knock-on effect on other species is thought to be considerable. Environmental campaigners and research experts have long argued that these \"river engineers\" who build lodges, dams, canals and pools attract a host of wildlife, such as kingfishers, fish and dragonflies. It's also believed that as well as creating a range of new wildlife habitats, damming has a significant impact on water quality throughout the river system. Sediments are slowed down and pollutants are oxidised when water seeping through the dam from the pond is aerated.",
