        "background": "In an age where the threats of terrorism and serious crime exists, we need to ensure that native British Citizens protection and well being comes first.\n\nTo do this we would ensure that the individual involved would not face the death penalty or abuse in country which forms the other half of their previous dual nationality, but would ensure that they would not enter Britain either.\n\nThis act will send out a strong message to want to be criminals of dual nationality, that we will not be intimidated by their acts of violence and or criminality, and in addition to this, this would send a clear message to political groups who wish to use the retention of these individuals within Britain to acquire power and additional votes, that this kind of conduct is not acceptable, especially in the interests of the British people.",
