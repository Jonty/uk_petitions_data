Artists such as Rihanna, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Hinder and many others are influencing children in the wrong way.  \n\nSuch as on Jo Frosts program, a 13 year old girl dressing like a hooker to get boys attention, its disgusting! \n\nBan all of this music from being aired in the united kingdom on radio and video, and accessed on-line.\n\nIn the 80s a song with the lyrics \"make me wanna come\" was banned from being aired.  Now you have people rapping about shooting each other, taking drugs and having sex for fun and you do not ban it, it is disgusting.\n\nSign up and help get this banned!",
