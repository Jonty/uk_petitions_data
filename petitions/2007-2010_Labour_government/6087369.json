        "background": "Let us realise what is truly happening. The British government are preparing the UK for total inclusion into the United States of Europe(EU Constitution with no referendum), whether we like it or not.\n\nThis will mean the break up of the UK as we know it, and each country will be dealt with on a separate basis, just like Texas, Maine etc. in the USA. This is as inevitable as the coming of the Euro to replace the Pound in democratic Britain.\n\nSo why must the people of England put up with and subsidise the bitter and ungrateful Scots, as they no longer consider themselves British (the flying of the Union Flag). I would like to see total independence for Scotland, a truly separate nation with its own health service, education and military etc. sooner rather than later and let the English get on without Scottish MP\u2019s controlling us.",
