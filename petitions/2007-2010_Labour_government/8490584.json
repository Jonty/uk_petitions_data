            "action": "take note of the work of the present Scottish government and the likelihood that the Scottish nation may soon wish to leave the United Kingdom, and to instruct his government and the central civil service to make orderly and fair arrangements for the dissolution of the Union Government, its replacement by separate Governments for England and the other home nations, the equitable sharing of the UK\u2019s publicly owned assets and its liabilities between the four home nations, and the preparation by all government departments and ministries of policies adapted to the long term freedom and prosperity of an Independent England.",

            "background": "English visitors to Scotland will see the resurgence of Scottish pride in their nation as the Scottish government represents their national identity and adopts policies that clearly are to the benefit of the Scottish people.   The Scottish civil service in turn is managing very competently the implementation of these policies.  While all the political parties represented in the Scottish Parliament accept that devolution is a process and not a destination, and all are in favour of more competences being transferred from Westminster and Whitehall to Edinburgh.  \n\nIt is time that the Union government accepted the now seemingly inevitable dissolution of the UK, and made the comprehensive and detailed plans for its demise and the revival of independent states for the four home nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThere is a great deal of work required to be done if an orderly transition is to be made from the UK to the four independent home nations.  The petitioner asks the Prime Minister to issue the necessary directives to his government and to the civil service now.",
