            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Newspaper investigations have revealed that ACPO, the Association of Chief Police Officers, is run as a monopoly private business with a trunover of \u00a318 million a year.  It is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act and judicial review as a private compnay, but it is clearly carrying out public functions - creating police policy on subjects as diverse as shoot to kill in terrorist situations and safer carparks. This is untenable in a democracy.  ACPO sets the policy, makes its members comply, and sets up businesses such as the ACPO Criminal Records Office to take advantage of the monopoly policy it creates - raking in significant profits in the process. This does not happen in any other Western Democracy, where police chiefs run private companies and it must stop in the UK.  ACPO should be banned from selling information from the Police National Computer to private individuals at a an enormous profit - \u00a369.40 for each PNC search. It is outrageous.",
