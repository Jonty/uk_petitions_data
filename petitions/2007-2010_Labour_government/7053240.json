            "background": "Living in a democracy we should be able to choose what services we want. We are allowed to choose where we bank, shop etc. Why are we forced to pay a license for something we may not want? I ask the government to scrap the television license and require the BBC to become a private company who can raise it's own money by either subscriptions or commercials. I choose to pay for Sky why am i paying for BBC channels twice! Scrap the license now!!!",
