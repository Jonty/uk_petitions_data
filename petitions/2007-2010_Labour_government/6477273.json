            "background": "I call for the power to be given to the police/army/security personnel and those citizens brave enough to combat the terrorists on our doorstep \u2013 Gang Culture.\n\nThey terrorize our streets 24/7, inflicting death and pain upon those who are innocent. The suffering of those victims that live, haunt them forever. The relatives of those victims that do not live, will be haunted forever.\n\nHow long are we the British public going to tolerate these atrocities, many of which occurring on a daily basis? How many fathers/husbands/sons/mothers/wives and daughters have to suffer or lose because of mindless and unprovoked attacks by gang members wielding lethal weapons freely and without mercy?\n\nWhen theses crimes are committed as part of a gang, it should be made part of every policeman and serving soldier's duty to eradicate this threat as they would when eliminating the Taliban or the IRA. But better than dealing with gangs after they strike, we should be dealing with them before this happens. There are many reasons today's youth aspires to be a gang member but it is not the purpose of this petition to discuss.  \n\nSign this petition if you want to help make our streets safe again for everyone.",
