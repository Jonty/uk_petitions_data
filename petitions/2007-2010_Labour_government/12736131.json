What right did he have to claim tax payers money for this mortgage when he is so wealthy. His behaviour is worse than almost all other MP's when you consider how rich he is. it is not about his entitlement to expenses, it is about his moral integrity. I could not have claimed expenses if I had his kind of wealth. I would not have slpet at night knowing I had done something so immoral. Why has no-one brought this up? He has managed to deflect attention from his immoral behaviour by acting so aggressively on the expenses issue, pointing the finger at everybody else. He needs to go.",
