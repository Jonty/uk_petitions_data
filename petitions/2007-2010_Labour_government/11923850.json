The case against the assailants, was dropped, allegedly through lack of evidence.  There has been no contact from the Detective Inspector involved in the case and the majority of evidence in favour of Steven, was not gathered.  Something has to be done about this, to give Steven, his family and close friends  the faith in the judicial system.",
