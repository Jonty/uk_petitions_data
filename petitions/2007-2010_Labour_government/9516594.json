        "background": "After the ITV programme, \"Tonight\", on Monday 19th May, documenting the current problem of mainly Polish people getting the jobs that British workers want and need. It seems overdue that something is done for the deserving people of Britain. This programme also showed that large companies would get government funding to relocate to areas with high unemployment rates. And yet these compaines still ignore the British workers and give a majority of the jobs to Polish people. A legislation needs to be put in place to give priority to these unemployed Britons. Afterall, that is the point of these companies relocating.",
