        "background": "The ban on conventional lightbulbs is in contradiction to disability rights and equality legislation and should therefore be rejected.\n\nWithin four years the EU intends to ban all conventional (non low energy) lightbulbs. While the carbon reduction agenda is to be applauded, the disappearance of such lightbulbs will have detrimental effects on the capabilities of people who have low vision (due to the unavailability of high wattage bulbs), and on the health of people who suffer from migraine, epilepsy and related conditions. The flicker rate of low energy bulbs is unacceptable to those with conditions triggered by variations in light frequency.",
