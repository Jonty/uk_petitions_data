            "background": "This partition is for the introduction of laws to force sellers of the vehicles to record the details of the buyer and the vehicle.  The buyer should be made to make a declaration that the vehicle will not be used anywhere but on private land.  Should the vehicle be found to have breached the declaration, either directly by the purchaser or other user, then the CPS should have the power to fine and prosecute both the rider and the owner of the vehicle.  Should the vehicle be sold on or passed to another party, under the proposed law, the buyer should have to register the vehicle and themselves either at a vehicle outlet or their local police station. Previous offenders should be added to a blacklist to prevent further purchase.  All vehicles involved in the breach should be confiscated and destroyed.  At the outset of the laws introduction, a short period of time should be given to existing vehicle owners to register them or face summary removal and destruction if caught.",
