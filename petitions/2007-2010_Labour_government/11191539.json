Both have security measures on them and important info such as DOB and a photo of the holder\n\nWhy should people need to pass their driving test in order to get their licence accepted in some places? People show ID to prove they are old enough to buy a drink, withdraw a certain amount of money etc - none of which doesn't involve driving!",
