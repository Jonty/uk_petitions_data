        "background": "The intensive farming of chickens has resulted in a practice which is abusive to the welfare of the birds. Battery farming should be phased out in favour of free-range methods. If a farmer kept cows in the condition chickens are kept in he would be liable for prosecution.\nSupermarket's and customer's concerns about the price of chicken should be not used as an excuse to allow abuse.",
