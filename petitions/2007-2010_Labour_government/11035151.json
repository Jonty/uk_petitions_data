            "background": "Stamp Duty placed on properties of a particular value creates unfairness to those of us who live in the south and more expensive areas. You can get a very large house in the north of 3 maybe 4 bedrooms whereas you could be struggling to buy a your first tiny 2 bedroomed cottage with no hall in the south for the same price. Please create a way to make this fair throughout the country.  We suggest that stamp duty should be placed on the number of rooms in a property rather than the value.  N.B. The recent Stamp duty \"holiday\" is of no help to those who live in the south where there are hardly any properties under \u00a3175,000.",
