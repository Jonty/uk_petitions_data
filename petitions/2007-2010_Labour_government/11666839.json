            "background": "Coal mining has been a historical and geographic feature of the UK's landscape for centuries . Fuelling the Industrial Revolution coal propelled the UK from being a small rural kingdom into a global and economic powerhouse. Coal shaped terrain and township, providing road, rail and canal systems that are still used today. The redundant sites, now transformed into beautiful country parks and woodland areas, should be recorded as heritage sites. This will insure that future generations will understand the cultural and geographical impact of coal on the UK's landscapes.",
