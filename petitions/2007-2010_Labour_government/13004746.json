            "background": "Whilst driving at night there are many motorists who choose to drive using only their parking lights. Whilst this is not illegal where road lighting exists, it presents a hazard to other road users who may have difficulty in seeing a poorly lit vehicle. By making it mandatory to use dipped beams at night on all roads I believe it would improve road safety.",
