        "action": "introduce political reform that abolishes the monarchy and the unelected House of Lords and allows the public to vote for both Houses of Parliament and the head of state. Furthermore, to introduce proportional representation and compulsory voting for all eligible citizens to make the UK a democracy for the first time in its history.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is clear that never in its history has this nation been a true democracy. We can not vote for our head of state, nor can we vote for the upper house. This leaves us with really very little say on how our country is run and who runs it. Also, if people want to be treated as citizens they must act as such, and so voting should be made compulsory as in some other countries such as Australia. Also, if we were to have proportional representation, then the system would also be a lot fairer. With the use of increasing technology and access to information, people could make more informed choices and could take part in referendums or even regional decision making like never before. Then we would have a democracy.",
