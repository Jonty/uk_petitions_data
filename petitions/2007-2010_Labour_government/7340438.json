In this instance the \u2018no blame\u2019 culture is simply not acceptable.\nThis unforgivable incident has potentially exposed the address details of all the 'At Risk' children in this country. \nFurthermore the government must guarantee compensation to those families that now have to relocate for the security of their children.",
