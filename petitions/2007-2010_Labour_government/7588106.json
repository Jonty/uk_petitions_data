I know many people who aren't Christian, but do celebrate it or are not offended by the festival. In my local supermarket, the Christmas aisles are full of Asians buying trees, cards, decorations etc. I also know of some that have the turkey and all of the trimmings as well. Who has spoilt the fun for the majority? The people who are behind these decisions have not done their homework.",
