            "background": "Currently the Westminster Parliamentary seats are not evenly distributed.  The constituencies in Scotland have a far smaller average electorate than in England.  This has led to vast over-representation of Scottish MPs and is an insult to our democracy.  Particularly now Scotland has its own parliament, it is time to bring equality for all citizens.  The Boundary Commission must be instructed that all constituencies must have the same electorate within 5% of each other.  This will be difficult but must be achieved if our democracy is to survive.",
