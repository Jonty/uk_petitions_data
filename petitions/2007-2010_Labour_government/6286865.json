            "background": "Everyday gangs of young people stalk the street and cause harm and intimidation to people young and old. As a young person myself I was attacked last night by a group of male youths. This gang mentality is ridiculous and has escalated greatly to the point it is not safe to walk around at night without fear of being attacked. Extra police, CCTV cameras on most streets and much stricter sentencing will act as a detterent for many people and reduce youth crime levels greatly. Sort out our problems before trying to sort out other peoples.",
