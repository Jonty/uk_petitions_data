            "background": "The beauty industry in this country has systematically destroyed the self-esteem of countless young women. The magazines, costemtics companys and toiletries manufactorers tell us that we are ugly, fat and less than women in order to sell us their products. We are asking for the government to regulate the beauty industry as to how they define \"beauty\". We no longer want to see impossible, airbrushed images of beauty paraded in front of our eyes. We no longer want a size 12 to be thought of as \"large\". We want adverts and articles which protray real, beautiful women and celebrate the diversity of beauty. We ask that the government step in and force the beauty industry to regulate themselves, or be regulated by an outside body.",
