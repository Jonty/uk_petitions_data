            "background": "Taper relief, when used properly, encourages entrepreneurship, investment, research and development and has a hugely positive effect on the British economy. It has been abused by a tiny minority (the private equity industry) to avoid paying higher rates of tax on income by treating 'carried interest' as a capital gain.\n\nThe government should target the abusers only, and not introduce a clumsy measure that adversely affects millions of small businesses who are using Capital Gains Tax taper relief inline with its intended purposes.",
