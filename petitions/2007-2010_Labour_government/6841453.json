        "action": "close the tax loophole abused by the private equity industry without penalising other sectors of the economy, such as small businesses and entrepreneurs, as would happen by the proposed blanket removal of CGT taper relief",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Taper relief, when used properly, encourages entrepreneurship, investment, research and development and has a hugely positive effect on the British economy. It has been abused by a tiny minority (the private equity industry) to avoid paying higher rates of tax on income by treating 'carried interest' as a capital gain.\n\nThe government should target the abusers only, and not introduce a clumsy measure that adversely affects millions of small businesses who are using Capital Gains Tax taper relief inline with its intended purposes.",
