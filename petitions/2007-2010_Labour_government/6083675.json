To encourage citizens to be more involved they would be offered a vote in how their taxes are spent, each year.\n\nVoters would be offered a choice of three spending levels for each government department (low, med, high) and the choice with the most votes would become the agreed budget for the forthcoming year. Special arrangements will exist for emergency spending and there will be a contingency provision in each budget for small overspends.",
