        "background": "Lincolnshire is the second largest county in the country but has the lowest government funding by \u00a311,000,000. This has caused a shortfall in this year's (2007) budget of \u00a37,000,000. This county has hundreds of towns and villages scattered all over and needs quality policing. Not increasing funding will mean a large council tax increase and a large cut to the police service.",
