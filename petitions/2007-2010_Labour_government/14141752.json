        "background": "seeing the way social services treat the young people in their care and being one myself something needs to be done and fast. The system continues to fail children who cannot speak for themselves like babies and todlers even teenagers it seems they never have their best interests with them, okay maybe some do well but out of everything i have seen form social services and they way they carry out their practise is dispicible and unthinkable, i could sit here all day and tell you all the things they have done wrong but there is no point in dwelling in the past when quite frankly we need to move on and change things for the future and we are only going to be able to do that if the government or the PM takes action now and stops the bad practice that has been goin on for many years, im not asking for a miracle but if this goes ahead it will create one\nThankyou for taking your time to read this \nAshleigh Gill 16",
