            "background": "Historic Birth, Death and Marriage Certificates must be purchased in England at a cost of \u00a37.00 each which is extremely expensive and often fruitless. The position is very different in Scotland where the General Register Office has made  copies of all register entries both searchable and downloadable from the internet - this saves time and money for customers and helps them ensure they get the certificate they need - it also significantly reduces the costs for the Government.",
