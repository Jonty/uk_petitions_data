        "background": "Every year we contribute to the funding of the Eurovision Song Contest - the only benefit of which is that we don't have to \"qualify\" via a semi-final.  We then have to watch a blatant political exercise of eastern european countries voting for their neighbours or political allies.  This is a total waste of our money and I don't see why our money should be used to fund this farce.",
