            "background": "Why are our children being given the choice to learn urdu or other non-EU languages??? This is not going to give them life skills to help with their life after school. It should kept in family homes not being out by the government and tax payers to fund this in school. \n\nIt's bad enough my children are having to eat HALAL meal for school dinners because they state its a need. Well thats not correct, if prayed over it's blessed. \n\nWhy should our english way and teaching be changed, why should we have to adapt for non-english people??? I would think that we went to a country that is of different religion and language and different laws, and said we want it the same as england, we would deported or worse, why is this allowed?????",
