            "background": "Private hospitals and medical providers do not provide the range of services that the NHS do. Patients who opt to use private medicine are transferred back to the NHS when the private hospital makes a mistake (e.g. intensive care is needed) or does not offer that service. As the patient has opted initially for private care it is unfair to expect the NHS to pick up their more expensive costs when things go wrong for private doctors. Private medicine as a result can be provided at costs that do not reflect the true risk. Patients under treatment outside the NHS should be charged to transfer back in on a scale equivalent to the level of additional care required.",
