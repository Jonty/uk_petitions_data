These formats are not an internationally recognised standard.  The Open Document Format is the only international recognised document format (ISO/IEC 26300:2006) and is supported on many platforms and software suites that do not, or cannot run Microsoft packages.  This would allow the dissemination of information and services to the fuller poulation rather than those who opt in to a single supplier option.",
