        "background": "Many recently introduced or announced taxes, such as the retrospective vehicle excise duty and other green taxes in the name of Global warming are unfair. If you want us to do things such as use public transport more, then why don't you give us a public transport service that we can use? I have no choice but to use the car, as there are NO buses during rush hours, and no buses at weekends. Places where there are buses, they are all very expensive, are not integrated with other modes of transport and give you a tour of the back roads of whatever city you happen to be in.\n\nWe can all see that you don't actually care about climate change, but your just using it as an excuse to make more money.",
