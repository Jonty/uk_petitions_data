            "background": "The congestion zone was initially introduced to cut \"congestion\"\n\nThere was a push from government for the people of London to leavetheir cars at home and use alternative transport such as motorcycles, push bikes and public transport.\n\nNow Westminster are penalising solo motorcycle owners by imposing a \u00a31.50 charge per day to use motorcycle bays.\n\nGovernment pushed us into a corner by imposing such high charges on car owners , driving us to find an alternative. This in essence cut London's congestion situation.\n\nMotorcycle bays should be FREE of Charge.\n\nWe understand that Westminster have created 1000 new bays for cyclists but this introduction is a benefit to the city as a whole, cutting congestion, easing some of the burden on public transport and giving small business owners a chance to survive in todays hard economic situation.\n\n\nPlease don't tax people who you have forced into a corner to cut congestion.\n\nPlease give small businesses a chance. Transport is key.\n\nWe all pay our Coulcil Tax\n\n\nI personally have a Westminster parking permit and now Westminster want to charge \u00a3150 per annum to park in motorcycle bays.",
