            "background": "My perants earn more than \u00a330,000 per year but still can not afford to give me \u00a330 per week. They can not afford for my sister to go on all of the trip she is offard to go on which her friend who rescive \u00a33o a week can afford to go on. I therefore think that the bracket should be extended. Your support for this issue would be apprciated and would benifit many people if this was changed. I think ema discriminates against against the middle people whose perants earn to much to get ema but not enough to be able to aford to give there children \u00a330 a week.",
