They can not afford for my sister to go on all of the trip she is offard to go on which her friend who rescive \u00a33o a week can afford to go on. I therefore think that the bracket should be extended. Your support for this issue would be apprciated and would benifit many people if this was changed. I think ema discriminates against against the middle people whose perants earn to much to get ema but not enough to be able to aford to give there children \u00a330 a week.",
