            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The government should enable all Schools in the UK to install renewable energy technologies (such as wind turbines, solar panels and geothermal) to educate the next generation on sustainability. \n\nRenewable energy technologies can be used as an educational tool in science lessons, whilst generating a useful output of energy for the school.  In the right location renewable energy can be an economic opportunity and reduce the school's energy bills.   It also reduces carbon dioxide emissions for years to come.  Schools currently do not have the capacity to invest in renewable energy and there are barriers such as planning permission.  \n\nTo support renewable energy the government could, for example, provide interest-free loans that can be paid back by the savings made.   The government should set the target of installing renewable energy in all UK schools as a priority; to enable a sustainable future for current and future generations.",
