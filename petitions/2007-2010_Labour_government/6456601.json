This is because I have always tried to work in the last 6years since I became disabled even if for only 1hour a week. Because I didn't want to rely on benefits I am now being penalised! \nI find this shocking and I know there are many more people out there in my situation. \nSo if you pay taxes and want them to go to someone deserving or you are in the same situation please sign this petition.",
