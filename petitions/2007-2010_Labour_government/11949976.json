        "background": "The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community (Community) has faced for decades hatred and persecution both at an institutional and individual level in Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan has not only declared Ahmadi Muslims as non-Muslims but have gone much further by failing to protect the human or civil rights of Ahmadi citizens.  \n\nIt is most unfortunate that the authorities actively encourage the hateful persecution of the Community and regularly invoke anti-Ahmadiyya legislation which prevents Ahmadi Muslims from living in peace.\n\nIt is clear, despite Pakistan claiming to be a secular and moderate country that it doesn\u2019t intend to prosecute the perpetrators of crimes against Ahmadi Muslims irrespective of the human cost and the scale of their suffering.\n\nWe call upon the Prime Minister to immediately intervene at the UN Security Council and demand that the Government of Pakistan removes anti-Ahmadiyya legislation in order to respect the human rights of Ahmadis and allows them to freely practice their religion without the fear of any form of discrimination. Furthermore, we call on the Foreign Office to actively and urgently engage in mediating an end to the blasphemy laws.",
