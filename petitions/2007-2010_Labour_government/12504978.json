I cant believe that you are actually going forward with this political suicide. Do not be seen to whitewash this. \n\nDeal with it as we expect of our Prime Minster. \n\nSurely you cant let this happen. I hope you are going to have firm words with the laos goverment. \n\nregards\n\nBernie McDonald\n\nJust a bricklayer from Aberdeen",
