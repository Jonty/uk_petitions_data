            "background": "Following the recent apalling situation with travel disruption during moderate snow storms I feel that Local Authorities and Businesses should re-prioritise snow clearing so that pedestrians get equal priority.  This could be achieved by compelling business premises to clear the footpaths outside of their buildings and deploying street sweepers and casual labour to, at least, clear safe pathways on all pavements.  This would save the NHS millions of pounds in treating ice related accident victims and enable many people to walk to work safely.",
