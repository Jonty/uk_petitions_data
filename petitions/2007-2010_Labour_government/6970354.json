            "background": "I am a football fan who has been amazed at the respect shown by rugby players to referees during the fantastic World Cup in France. Not being a close follower of rugby this has taken me by complete surprise, having been accustomed to the at times thuggish behaviour of some (not all of course)footballers AND EVEN MANAGERS (!!) when it comes to referees. This needs to be stopped. Footballers and Managers need to GROW UP AND TAKE DECISIONS ON THE CHIN LIKE MEN RATHER THAN ACTING LIKE MY 11 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER WHEN I TAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL BACK OFF HER. Surely a simple rule could be introduced so that only the Captain can discuss a decision with the Ref or linesman. Any dissent from others could be an instant red card.  Players other than the captain circling the referee like a lynch mob (we all know type of scene) would an instant red. Can the Prime Minister please raise this with the FA to ensure our footballers learn how to behave.",
