Royal Mail still delivers all letter post in this Country and it is being eroded by a Business practice  that would not be forced upon any other area of Business. Allow Royal Mail to compete on a level playing field by forcing its competitors to do their own work and share the burden of costs. The public can then make up their own minds about who provides the better service.",
