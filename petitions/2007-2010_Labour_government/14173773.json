        "background": "This petition was set up for our coursework task in citizenship, we are three 15-16 year olds. We believe that the current voting age is unfair to the younger generation as they cannot express their voice in what they think should be done. 16 is a mature age which permits many new decisions to be made about the future which includes: leaving school, getting a full time job, having sex, taking part in the National Lottery and should include voting for political matters.",
