        "background": "The excessive use of road transport is damaging the environment and our economy with rises in fuel and food prices.\nThe government must cut its spending on hyping the terror threat and spying on the UK population and instead spend this money and effort on providing public transport and rail links.\nUsing rail to transport goods would require goods yards and the investment in rolling stock. Transporting people on bus and train requires stations and vehicles. The new investments must use BRITISH companies (not Mercedes as in London) the government would also be able to stop pretending 15% of the country is disabled and reduce unemployment.\n\nThe actions are simple, move money from wasteful spending and spend it with British companies to provide public transport. This will save the planet.",
