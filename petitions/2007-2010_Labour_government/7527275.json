        "background": "The latest announcement by the Home Secretary on police pay for the second year running is disappointingly at odds with the support offered to police by Gordon Brown at the ACPO conference in June.  Jacqui Smith\u2019s announcement that she will ratify the decision of the Police Arbitration Tribunal but with effect from 1st December gives police officers an increase of just 1.9% - below inflation and a pay cut in real terms. This is not acceptable to Police Officers, nor is it acceptable to members of the public who wish to see our emergency services rewarded with a remuneration package which reflects the dangerous and difficult role they undertake in modern society.",
