            "background": "The momentous challenges facing the British Economy cannot be addressed by ad-hoc solutions, no matter how grotesquely large the amounts spent.  British voters have the right to hear considered, comprehensive recovery programs from all political parties and to elect the best leader for the difficult times ahead.  Huge sums of taxpayers money are being spent without any debate, committing us and our children to a legacy of debt.  To continue implementing massive change without a clear mandate undermines the very foundations of our democracy.",
