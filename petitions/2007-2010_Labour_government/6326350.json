            "background": "We believe that the current charging regulations are a danger to both individual and public health and are preventing vulnerable people living in the UK, including pregnant women, from accessing vital treatment.  These inhumane regulations not only damage people\u2019s health and violate their human rights, but result in increased and unnecessary costs to the NHS.\n\nFurther information is available from the National AIDS Trust.",
