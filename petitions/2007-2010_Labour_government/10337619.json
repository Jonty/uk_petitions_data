Shame on you Gordon Brown for even entertaining the idea!\n\nSome people must have very short memories. She told people to grab, grab, grab, look after number one and not to give a fig about anyone who was less fortunate. She destroyed our country and we're still reaping what she sowed. It's a very sad day indeed when a  Labour PM is  pushing forward plans to let her lie in state! She should pay for her own bloody funeral!",
