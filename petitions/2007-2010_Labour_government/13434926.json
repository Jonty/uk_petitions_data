            "background": "I would like to propose that horses are banned on public roads or are atleast forced to have insurance due to the fact that they are a danger to the public when they are spooked or scared.  They are then unpredictable and therefore unsafe on public roads.  Horses can cause major injury and destruction to people, animals and vehicles or property. However it is those that don't own these creatures that have to pay for the damages to be repaired on property and pay for vet bills as the horse is injured, even if it is not the motorists fault the horse has caused the damage.  This is why I would like to see a ban on horses using the public highways.  \nIf this is not possible, then why not make insurance compulsary for those that take horses on the road like motorists are forced to for vehicles.  This would then help protect those innocent motorists who have to pay out for an unfare circumstance or vice versa.  This is not a malicious stab at horses or those that ride them but I believe that it is genuinly unfare for horses to be ridden on roads, especially in a time where so many vehicles use the roads.  Surely this is an accident waiting to happen?",
