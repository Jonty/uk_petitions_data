            "background": "The problem of congestion in Broughton could be easily solved by adding a new motorway junction after M6 Junc 32, which would help expanding towns (e.g. Garstang) too by giving them a convenient exit. The current bypass plans will eventually exacerbate the problem by attracting more housing developments and traffic to the village and will spoil a lot of precious countryside.",
