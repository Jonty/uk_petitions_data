        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The introduction of increased Air Passenger Duty on 1st November 2009 should be abandoned and revoked.  It will further penalise British holidaymakers. Misleadingly, it is being portrayed by the Government as an environment tax, and yet it is targeted at ordinary travellers taking well-earned holidays, while those using private jets are not being taxed.There are ridiculous anomalies in the way this ill-thought out legislation is going to be calculated, with the distance being based on the capitol of the country visited and not the actual destination resulting in travel to Los Angeles for example, being taxed less than travel to a Caribbean country. At the very least if this tax is implemented, it will result in loss of business to British Airways with travellers opting to fly to local hubs eg. Paris or Amsterdam and then continuing long haul from there on Air France or K.L.M.\nThis is yet another blatant money raising tax with no environmental credibility.",
