            "background": "Currently the level of support someone receives is based on their parental income, it is first of bizarre that students as old as 24 are being judged on parents income but secondly, upon graduation those who have received a bursary will potentially be earning the same as those who received a loan yet wont have to pay anything back this seems strange as by this point your parents income is not relevant. I call for a set level of loan that everyone can take, any amount up to a maximum level as the current system is unfair.",
