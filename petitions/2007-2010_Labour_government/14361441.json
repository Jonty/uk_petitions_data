            "background": "Under the Government\u2019s housing policy, in Southern England, Bushwood Green development has proposed to concrete over the 800 acres of natural fields and woodland adjacent to the South Bedfordshire villages of Caddington and Slip End, previously classified as an area of outstanding natural beauty, and create an urban sprawl.\n\nThe development will destroy the greenbelt, cause chaos in the nearby towns and villages and create nightmare congestion as gridlocked roads will be unable to support the influx of additional traffic.\n\nFurther, this development will set a dangerous precedent allowing other developers to move in and wreck the local countryside environment without any concern for other greenbelt areas.\n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to take immediate action to reverse the Government's policy and stop the proposed Bushwood Green development which will otherwise destroy the 800 acres of the Parishes of Caddington and Slip End in Bedfordshire.",
