            "background": "Today i was horrified, hearing on the news that a bear was shot down due to the irresponsible behaviour of a mental handicaped man. This is discraceful that a endangered species of bear is shot dead due to its attack on the man. However, the bear only followed its natural instincts and i'm utterly appauled that the man would do such a horrible thing by jumping into the pen purposely. I think the man should recieve some form of punnishment or mental rehab sectioned for this dispicable behaviour. How is it fair that a man is allowed to do such a thing and end the life of a beautiful and endangered species.",
