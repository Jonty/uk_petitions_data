            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It has been over 50 years now we have known that tobacco smoking directly leads to cancer, it is the single biggest cause of cancer in the UK and causes all kinds of health problems in humans, however unlike other harmful drugs, it remains legally on sale throughout the country, why is this so? I suggest the sale and stocking of this substance to be made illegal and in turn save countless lives in the years to come. The health of the nation is more important than any economic matter. It is unacceptable for smoking to be legal anywhere in 21st century Britain when we have so much evidence suggesting it is deadly.",
