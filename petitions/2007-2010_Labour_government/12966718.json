These complaints are taking a long time to be resolved and it is taking even longer for upheld complaints to be paid out.\nIn some cases this is leading to debt and in worse cases repossessions.\nTo resolve this, quicker action is needed and all activities stopped on accounts affected eg. charges, interest and threat of repossesion, until the complaint has been resolved.\"",
