            "background": "Mr McCain, the only man to train a horse to win the grand national 3 times deserves to be awarded a knighthood for his services to national hunt racing.  Unlike the flat trainers whom appear to have vast amoutns of money to spend on horses and facilities and are middle to upper class people, \"Ginger\" is a working class man and started with poor class horses and trained behind a used car garage.  He has worked very hard.  He is also a man who is very amusing and has made a lot of people happy.  A lot of once a year punters would have won money on \"Gingers\" horses.  Please give Mr McCain the knighthood he deserves for services to horse racing",
