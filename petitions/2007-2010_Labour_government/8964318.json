What happened to the days when you pointed out your selection to the overly happy but slightly sinister shop keeper, who then duly plucked your selected penny sweets and placed them into a small white bag? In the days when penny sweets actually cost a penny (or 2p for such occasional specialities such as a drumstick lolly!). We feel 'Haribo' has taken over this industry using cruel and barbaric anti-competitive tactics and must be stopped!",
