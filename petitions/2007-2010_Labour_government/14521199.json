            "background": "My mom makes her payments on time every month but still incurs problems\n\nLast year the CSA took 2 direct debit payments out of her account in the same month leaving her bank account overdrawn & paying interest. The CSA would not refund the excess money. They said it would leave my little brother with no money, I don't see how they came to that conclusion as they had the payment which was due. My mom had to endure a long phone call, where she was spoken to like she was a bad mother for wanting the money which they wrongfully took back. Money she needed to look after me \n\nJanuary \u201810 she received a letter threatening court action as she was apparently in arrears. She was not\n\nHaving a letter threatening court action is distressing & it\u2019s horrible seeing my mom have continuous problems with the CSA when she\u2019s abided by its regulations. It\u2019s more annoying when I see petitions asking to increase CSA powers to claim money off parents not making their payments & seeing news articles where a parent endlessly gets away with not making payments \n\nThis is not right.
