            "background": "Some may argue that competition enhances technological advance - but the largely public sector telecommunications industry has traditionally been very well supervised by govt., probably because it is catering for public tastes. \n\nTelevision has kept to five channels -\nunlike the internet.\n\nI fear that the quality of internet provision is deteriorating at the expense of quantity - the petitioner is calling on the British govt, to not necessarily curtail the number or type of sites of this phenomenally expanding educational and business resource, but limit the number of providers (eg google, AOL). The idea of my petition is to encourage accountability for what is published in an international forum and facilitate the ease with which the www can be policed.",
