            "background": "The government is planning to introduce legislation which would cut off internet users who 'illegally' download music and films. This is being made under pressure from the music and film industry with claims such as:\n- Internet piracy supports organized crime & terrorism \nThere is no evidence to suggest that since there is little to no money to be made from internet piracy\n- Lies of lost earnings\nThe figures published are all based on assumptions, there is no independent research, only that of the industry\n- Stealing from artists\nMusicians make very little money from album sales; they make money from concerts and merchandise. Internet piracy gets artists more exposure and so is more likely to increase artists\u2019 profit.\nThis law could force ISPs such as BT to spy on users internet activity. This could mean penalties just for watching copyrighted material on sites such as YouTube.\nFor more about internet piracy watch the documentary \"steal this film\u201d\nProtect your privacy \u2013 demand net neutrality",
