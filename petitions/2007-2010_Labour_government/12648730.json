        "background": "The Windsor line was built in 1918 by men returning from World War 1 trained in building tunnels & trenches.  It stretches from Westminster where there's a platform reached by a set of locked walkways in the main station & by foot tunnel from under the House of Lords.\n\nNext stop is the private Buckingham Palace station, then Imperial, a station only reachable from the basement of Imperial College London, before ending at High Street Kensington.\n\nOff the main platform of Imperial Station there's a side corridor with several cells.  Several of these cells are inhabited - and the sign on the door to this corridor warns those who enter to \"observe ESP precautions\". Nearby, on several hooks, hang about 20 lead-lined helmets of different sizes with lead-glass goggles - part of the \"ESP precautions\".\n\nThe UK is keeping 5 people with ESP talents prisoner in a secret branch of the Underground below one of London's finest scientific colleges.  \n\nWhy?  What are they working on? Who are they working for?",
