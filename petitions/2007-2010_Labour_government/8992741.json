This is particularly pertinent to the treatment of Gurkhas who retired before 1997 and their protest at Parliament on Wednesday 19th March 2008. The fact that these heroes of the British Army  are not allowed to stay in this country after serving it with such loyalty, dedication and distinction, whilst criminals and other undesirables are allowed to stay, is a National Disgrace and should be rectified immediately.",
