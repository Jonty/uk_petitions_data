            "background": "Since 1948, Britain has supported the principle that state pensions, health care, education and other public services are best provided by society as whole. This is now under threat.\n\n\u2022 The state pension is totally inadequate, leaving at least 1 in 4 older people to live in poverty\n\u2022 7m households have a child living in poverty and existing benefits provide a very limited safety net\n\u2022 Unemployment now stands at over 2m and workfare offers no solution\n\u2022 10m adults are disabled and face huge barriers to escaping financial hardship\n\u2022 The NHS is slowly being privatised behind a smokescreen of choice and competition, and patients are suffering as a result\n\u2022 Our public services are now facing massive cuts and further privatisation\n\nThe welfare state and public services are an essential part of any civilised society - pooling the risk across the population and providing support and services to us all.",
