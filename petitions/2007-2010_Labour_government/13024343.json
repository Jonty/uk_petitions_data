I call an immediate end to the social injustice brewing within this nation and to end the wealth gap in society by distributing wealth more fairly. This might be achieved by perhaps no longer being afraid of nationalisation and bringing an end to privatisation which is gradually tearing our society apart. I call upon you all to make a change.",
