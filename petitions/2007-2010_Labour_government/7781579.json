        "background": "Dear Sir,\n\nI feel very strongly about the Government making decisions about the poorest people in this country, and THREATENING to take away what little they have to live on with regards to the Benefit amendments.\n\nI feel that we should pursue a change in the Law of this country, so that the salary of MP\u2019s is decided by the people who employ them, NAMELY THE PUBLIC!  NO ONE should be in charge of their own pay rise!  As the Public employ MP\u2019s, we should have the ABSOLUTE power to decide what they are worth to us, by REFERENDUM!\n\nI intend to make this idea of mine as PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE by using the Internet, and invite people to give their support to this idea, and, if possible, to FORCE the Government to take this action to make them MORE ACCOUNTABLE to the Public who employ them!\n\nONE RULE FOR THEM, but entirely ANOTHER RULE FOR US ! ! !",
