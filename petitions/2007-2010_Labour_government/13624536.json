        "background": "This is an incredible act of selflessness by a 22 year old who is an example to us all.  Not only did he come forward and assist the police but he has now decided to give his \u00a310,000 reward the victim of the attack.  Too often we complain about our young people, this incredible act should be recognised by the awarding of an honour.\n\nLloyd Gardner, a 22 year old waiter from Devon, responded to a police appeal for assistance in identifying a man wanted in connection with a rape. The attacker was duly arrested and convicted of rape and causing grievous bodily harm.  Mr Gardner received a \u00a310,000 reward for providing the information with brought about the arrest of the offender.  \n\nThere is no doubt that most people, especially (we assume) a young person on a low income, would have kept the reward money and would rightly be entitled to do so.\n\nTo his great credit Mr Gardner has decided to donate his \u00a310,000 reward to the victim of the offence.  The victim suffered a fractured skull and brain damage in the attack and her injuries were so severe that she now uses a wheelchair.\n\nWe commend the actions of Lloyd Gardner and respectfully request that he receives suitable recognition for his galant actions.",
