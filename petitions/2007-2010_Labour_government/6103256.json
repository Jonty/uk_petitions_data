            "background": "Why is the legal drinking age so high in the Uk? Due to the legal age being so high it means more teenagers are ending up getting drunk in fields and public parks. If the drinking age was lowered then they would at least be able to go into bar's where they can be monitored. This would cut down drinking in public places and prevent the abuse of alcohol.",
