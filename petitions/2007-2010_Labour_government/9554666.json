            "background": "The price of petrol and diesel needs to be capped at \u00a31 per litre to combat inflation and the cost of food and other goods essential goods & services in the market. This can be achieved by controlling & severely punishing profiteering in the oil markets as well as reducing the level of duty raised on petroleum products & any excessive profits being made by the oil and distribution companies. If petrol in the USA costs no more than \u00a31.40 per gallon there is no excuse for it to over \u00a34 a gallon in the UK. Action now please.",
