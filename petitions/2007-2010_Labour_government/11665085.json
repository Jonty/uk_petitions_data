The skills that history provides such as the ability to investigate, research and work with information are only surpassed in importance by history's goal to inform pupils about who they are, where they (and everyone else) come from and how they fit into the world. It serves cross curricular themes of diversity, citizenship and, literacy as well as being an engaging and enjoyable subject (one that is incredibly popular with the public). Perhaps most importantly it can help pupils to develop into independent thinkers, who are able to make informed choices concerning issues like democracy, education, progress and tolerance.\n\nIf the government is serious about its' goal to develop independent, well informed citizens who make positive contributions to their community (and the country) we see no subject that serves this goal more than history.",
