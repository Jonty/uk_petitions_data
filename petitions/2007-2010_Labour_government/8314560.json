Surely this is an anomaly and one that could be put right by a simple amendment to the existing legislation. Why should any one group of workers be discriminated against at all? This loophole in the law can only be of benefit to unscrupulous employers who wish to replace experienced staff with the cheapest possible replacements to cut costs to the bone or maximise profits. Isn't the government supposed to be trying to encourage people to work longer so as not to be a drain on the economy? This discriminatory legislation is not going to help towards achieving that aim.",
