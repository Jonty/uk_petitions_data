            "background": "I am sure there are many others in a situation similar to myself. I am currently working part-time in central London whilst living in 'zone 3' (as it is too expensive in central London) and it costs me \u00a35.50 for a daily travel card or approximately \u00a328 for a weekly travel card to be able to get to and from my 20 hour a week job. With the rise in tax I am paying almost half of my earnings in tax and travel, meaning that my actual earnings will not cover my rent, bills and food, etc. Also I am not eligable for working tax credits as I am 'too young'.\nI therefore wish to be provided with a reduced rate of travel, beyond that of the 'savings' by using an oyster card.",
