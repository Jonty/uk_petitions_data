            "background": "The Prime Minister has said that the abolition of the 10% tax band will help pensioners and people with children; wrong.  In fact, the abolition of the 10% tax band will make these people even worse off financially than they are at present.\n\nThe only people who will actually benefit are those people who are in the higher paid tax brackets.\n\nWe, the people, demand that the 10% tax bracket is reintroduced with immediate effect; if the Government wishes to raise funds, suggest they start immediately with companies whereby the directors pay themselves minimum salaries and then take the rest in dividends - which are not taxed.",
