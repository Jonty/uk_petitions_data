Would the table be as it is if it wasn't for these rediculously biased decisions? It wouldn't happen in Spain as a bad decisions results in a few games suspended\n\nIt is time action replay cameras where used so the league table is decided on football and merit not these so called professional referees who runin games week in week out. \n\nPlease sign this petition",
