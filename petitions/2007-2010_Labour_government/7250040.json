            "background": "The oxford dictionary defines charity in the following ways:\n1. an organization set up to help those in need. \n2. the voluntary giving of money or other help to those in need. \nMany of Britain\u2019s charities receive some level of government funding; in some cases they are almost entirely reliant on this funding. There is a trend for these same groups to use this funding to lobby the same government to further their agenda, which invariably leads to funding increases for their cause. This is both unethical, immoral & circumvents the very meaning of charity, turning them into quangos-by-proxy. We the people hereby petition the government to abolish all funding to charities, to offset this saving against income taxation whilst reducing the tax burden on registered charities & their workers. \nThis is not a petition for greed or miserly gain but a wish to put the responsibility for charitable giving back in the hands of the people so they can judiciously choose whom to support.",
