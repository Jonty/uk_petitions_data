            "background": "Great Britain is in a unique position to stimulate the economy of our country at the stroke of a pen.\nAs we are not into the euro,we can quite easily restore the true value of the good old British Pound to 240 old pence.This would be a step forward rather than back and would help every body,especially those in dire financial straits.We should cap all prices at their present level and impose strict price control.It would encourage a lot more companies to become more competitive.Those who can remember the switch over from 240 old pence to 100 new pence will have bitter memories how we were tricked into a devaluation of a massive 140% overnight and the unscrupulous traders who went laughing all the way to their banks.Thank you.",
