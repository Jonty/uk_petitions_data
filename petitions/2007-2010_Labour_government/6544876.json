It is only with my dear puppies demise that I have found it suitable to write this as I want action taken. Everybody can do a lot of if's and but's, however, I truly believe my dog would still be alive today if the central reservervation in Postcode ST15 0DL (A34) was properly maintained. If the grass was cut more regularly then the driver who hit her may have had chance to see her and do what he/she could to avoid her. I am summising the pain caused due to a councils lack of caring about public endangerment. This part of the public highway is regularly used to cross over an otherwise treacherous and very busy road. All i'm asking is that no-one else has to deal with a loss of any sort due to councillors lack of care.",
