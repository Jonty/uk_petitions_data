        "action": "Introduce legislation so that all \"buy-to-let\" properties with mortgage arrears to nationalised banks are transferred to social housing landlords, a fair rent assessed and tenancies secured",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A high proportion of mortgage debt for the two banks which have recently been nationalised is from buy-to-let mortgages.  If a buy-to-let borrower falls into arrears, the property should be reposessed after the first missed or late payment, but transferred to a social housing landlord (local authority or housing association) and the rent reassessed as a fair rent. In addition, where more than 50% of the rent is paid by the tenant rather than from housing benefit, or in all cases if the tenant(s) receives DLA or Pension Tax Credit, the tenancy should be converted from assured shorthold to secured.",
