            "background": "In this country ocupational lung disease and asthma has over 1000 new case per year. The cost of inhalers for this accute problem can be prohibitive, in many instances the medication is not covered as a single item,generally the majority of persons who use inhalers have a minimum of 2 one blue and 1 brown some individuals have additional  medication and equipment\nThe cost for these items can be out of proportion to a standard prescription charge. 2 inhalers will set the patient back over \u00a314 and in total per year just this medication alone at a minimum of 4 uses per day, the cost will be over \u00a3100 add other items such as steroids etc the cost again is additional. I ask that these charges and the methodology for investigation asthma related be reviewed and ammended.",
