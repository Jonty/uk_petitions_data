At that stage, sentencing needs to be passed to a group of the people most badly affected by the actions of the criminal.  THAT would be justice, not the ideolog musings of people who live in a different world to the majority of the people in this coutry - Judges who are appointed for life and kept separate from us for their own protection!",
