            "background": "Many a guard will agree that security can be a dangerous line of work especially when dealing with drunks or drugged up people and all we are armed with is a radio , due to laws at present if we try to restrain a person we run the risk of being charged with assault, however in america they go as far as arming guards with guns ,they are armed equal to the police, i am suggesting that we are armed with less lethal means such as batons and pepper spray , and handcuffs to restrain those offenders who continue to pose a threat to staff and our own safety, in todays soceity it is not alot to ask as violent crime and knife crime is on the rise, give us the means to do are job safely and protect ourselves.",
