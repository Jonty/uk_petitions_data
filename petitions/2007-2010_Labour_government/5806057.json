            "background": "The Government, without any consultation with Patients, Doctors or other Healthcare Professionals, took it upon themselves to sign a 3 year contract with Mercury Healthcare, to provide a Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme.\nThis was done for purely Political and cost reasons, to reduce waiting lists and costs. \nNo thought was given during the entire process as to Patient Welfare, or circumstances.\nI am led to believe by the Professional I have discussed this with that up to 80% of the affected Patients are not happy about these new arrangements. In many cases, a patient now has to travel several times their previous journey distance (with increased costs and inconvenience)to reach an \"approved Centre\".\nWe request that the Government consider the Patient first and interfere in matters they are not qualified in.",
