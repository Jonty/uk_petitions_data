If the home information pack is not considered to be important, then a choice (remember that word) should be allowed, but if it is considered to be advantageous to the transaction then the parties involved should have that choice. Sellers could choose to offer one or buyers could choose to demand one and this would at least prove their popularity - or otherwise. \nThe energy assessment is of very little practical use as any intelligent buyer can determine whether a house has insulation or double glazing etc., and it is not houses that waste energy - it is the people who use - or misuse- it.",
