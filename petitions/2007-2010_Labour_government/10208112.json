            "background": "Members of the emergency services are there to protect the piblic. I have heard and seen several examples of members of the emergency services being attacked by members of the public. In particular i would like to see those people who attack fire and ambulance staff given custodial sentences.  Assaults against the police should also be taken more seriously but as the police often expect to come into contact with violent people i feel ambulance and fire brigade staff need more protection from the law.",
