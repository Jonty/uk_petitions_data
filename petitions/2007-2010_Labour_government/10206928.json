        "background": "pitbulls shouldnt be baned because the dog only turns out the way the owner has rared it. instead of punishing these dogs it should souly be the owner punished.\ni think that these intelligent animals should be legal as long as it has been looked into that the dogs arnt being used as weapons or fighting.\ni have seen a pitbull being bullied by a papillion for goodness sake.\ntheir is small tiny dogs out there that are nasty little fighters but because their small people over look it cos small dogs dont look fearful.\nis all to do with the way owners make them,its not the pitbulls fault.\nwould you put a troubled child down.. NO\nPEOPLE LOOK AT THE PARENTS FOR BLAME BECAUSE THE CHILD HAS EITHER HAD NO GUIDANCE OR NO DISAPLINE!!!!\nJUST BECAUSE A DOG ISNT HUMAN DOESNT MEAN THEY THINK MUCH DIFFERENTLY OR DONT HAVE FEELINGS.",
