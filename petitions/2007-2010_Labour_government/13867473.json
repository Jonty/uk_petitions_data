            "background": "On the 29/10/09 Lord Mandelson announced a plan to cut off internet access to people who are found to persistently share copyrighted files. This proposal assumes the users guilt without any kind of legal process and will therefore persecute anyone who shares a connection or who may have been a victim of hackers. Implementing these measures will also add up to \u00a324 to the bill of every internet user in the UK and will be easily avoided by the file sharers that it\u2019s supposed to target.  This proposal is expensive, ill thought out and completely fails to tackle the problem. We feel it should not be implemented.",
