            "background": "We find it extremely unfair that amongst all the gambling institutes , the Bingo Hall's are the only one's who have to pay a 20% profit tax on top of the VAT they also pay. This tax not only puts smaller Bingo  Hall's At risk (of closing) but also can put jobs at risk and it's removal will mean those who work in this environment will also get a better pay deal , especially in the smaller bingo halls.",
