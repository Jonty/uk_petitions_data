        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The cost of food in this country is completely back to front. Healthier foods should be in the lower price bracket. Junk food should be more expensive.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the government's goal to improve the diet and general health of children (and adults alike) is proving unsuccessful, despite billions of pounds being put into this scheme.\n\nBy making the junk foods less attractive by increaseing the price, more people will start buying healthy foods.\n\nThis will save the tax-payer billions in the long-term, as diet-related illnesses decrease and the general pulic become more healthy.\n \nMeanwhile, the extra revenue from the junk foods can be used by the government to educate families on healthy eating.",
