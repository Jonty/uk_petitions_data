The Government's announcement to reclassify cannabis as a class B drug - rejecting the advice of its own Advisory Council - is irrational and unnecessary. Cannabis use has fallen since the drug was downgraded from class B to a class C. Responsible users should not be threatened with a jail sentence. There is still time for MPs to listen to reason and reject this draconian move.",
