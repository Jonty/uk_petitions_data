        "background": "Amid the gloom of the economic crisis, consumer spending is stagnant and moods are low.\n\nThere is only one realistic way to catalyse an improvement in the UK's prosperity: bring Flight of the Conchords to the UK and allow 50,000 or so people to watch them play.\n\nAdditional capital will be injected into the economic system, and the resulting optimism and joy will surely create boundless opportunities for UK business, entrepreneurs and indeed everyone else.\n\nGordon Brown, you have the power to do this.\n\nForget recapitalising the banking system. Cut straight to the funny bone.\n\nGet New Zealand's second most popular folk parady duo to play us back into prosperity",
