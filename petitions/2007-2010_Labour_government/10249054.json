Keep Falmer High School as a state comprehensive run by education professionals and not a wealthy businessman with no educational background.  Allow the school to continue to improve and enable the staff to continue to do their jobs to a high standard under the leadership of the Head.  A ballot across the Brighton and Hove community would provide evidence that an academy is NOT actually wanted.",
