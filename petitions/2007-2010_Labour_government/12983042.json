        "background": "oldham civic hall is where people from oldham and the surrounding areas can go to donate blood i went for the 1st time (20.7.2009) when i parked in the civic hall car park i was surprised to find i had to pay to park there when i was only there to donate blood it was \u00a31.30 for 1 hour so i begrudgingly payed and entered the hall to give blood to find numerous angry people who had payed to park at the previous blood drive and had gone minutes over their parking time then returned to their cars to find parking tickets/fines. now seeing as you dont know how long you will be in there and cant exactly leave to pay for further parking while you are on a bed donating blood how can this be fair? surely if the NHS provide proof of donating (which they will) then we shouldn't be expected to pay to park while donating blood?",
