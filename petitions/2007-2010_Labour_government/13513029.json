            "background": "During the summer I had reason to travel to Switzerland and at the border crossing I had to pay 35 Euros for a Swiss vignette. This pass entitled myself and my family to unlimited use of the Swiss motorway system up to and including 31st january 2010. The only problem was,as a holidaymaker, I was there for only four days. Indeed I know friends that have have to pay for a vignette just to pass through Switzerland on the way to Italy. In the UK we do not charge any of our european friends to travel on public roads. The Swiss are not at present part of the EU thus I urge the prime minister Gordon Brown to introduce a charge on Swiss registered vehicles using British roads on the same lines as the amount they charge us.",
