            "background": "In 1998 maintenance grants for students were no longer made available. From then on, student loans were the only source of government funding to help students to live. This year (2007) has seen the reintroduction of maintenance grants on a means-tested basis. Students starting university in 2007 have been entitled to up to \u00a32,765 of tax-free money to help them through their first year. It will be rising to \u00a32,835 for the academic year beginning in 2008.\n\nThose who began university between 1998 and 2006 have missed out on the entitlement to this benefit and in many cases have been hit hard with huge student loan debts.\n\nThe aim of this petition is to gather enough students and graduates who would have been eligible for such grants and get them reimbursed.\n\nIf you agree that these circumstances are highly unfair, please sign and make others aware of this petition.",
