        "background": "South Cambridgeshire District Council recently decided that there would be no refuse collection during the Christmas period. As we already have a fortnightly collection of non-green waste, this meant that refuse was not collected for three weeks. This is plainly unacceptable in a modern society and a health hazard. I request that a fortnightly limit for non-green waste be imposed on all councils",
