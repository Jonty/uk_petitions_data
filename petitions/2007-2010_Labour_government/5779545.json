It is currently far too easy for criminals to evade detection as they leave the country, and nothing is done about immigration overstayers.\n\nPassport control/embarkation control should be brought back as a matter of priority to provide much clearer data on immigration to and emigration from the UK, and to provide a proper defence against criminals leaving the country and to prevent the abduction of children.",
