        "background": "At present the UK has no proper system of checking and counting people leaving the UK.  Much has been said about \"porous borders\", and quite rightly so.  It is currently far too easy for criminals to evade detection as they leave the country, and nothing is done about immigration overstayers.\n\nPassport control/embarkation control should be brought back as a matter of priority to provide much clearer data on immigration to and emigration from the UK, and to provide a proper defence against criminals leaving the country and to prevent the abduction of children.",
