Most special needs people only fail due to lack of adequate early interventions so how can we penalise an individual for a corrective responsibility? Which is a greater crime, their lack of social learnt behaviour or societal discrimination of their disabilities? \nPlease give us your vote for this petition, stop prejudiced treatment for people living with Behaviour Disorders, unlike other ailments they are sometimes less obvious to the next person and are quite high maintenance. Special needs people need support not incarceration.",
