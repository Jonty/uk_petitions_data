            "background": "With the recent attack on small businesses in the budget, rising taxations on ordinary members of the public, poor value for money in public services, waste of money in public services at record levels, losing the data in the post from HMRC, copying of Tory tax policies; it is apparent our current leaders do not have control, vision or direction.  Therefore I would like a free vote so MP's can truly reflect the wishes of the public and vote accordingly.  I feel strongly that to remain with the current situation will badly damage the UK PLC for decades to come and this needs to change for us and our childrens sake.",
