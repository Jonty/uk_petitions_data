        "background": "I do not believe that us tax payers should pay the higher proportion of transport fares whereas those whom are not working such as school children and the unemployed get fatter by taking the bus when they could walk. I would like to see travel free if the person is  attending an interview. children can ride free between 7-9 am and 15-1830 or while in uniform. youth Crime has increased with access to free transport. taxpayers have to wait for empty buses as everybody getting the free ride are occupying the seats while the taxpayers takes the whole burden.",
