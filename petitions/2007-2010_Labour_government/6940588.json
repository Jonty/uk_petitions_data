            "action": "consider Liverpool music impresario Mr. Alan Wills for award of an OBE or CBE.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition proposes Mr. Alan Wills, the Liverpool musician and businessman, to be considered for his honest, uncompromising services to the music industry. Also for the hope and motivation he has provided to many young artists from Liverpool who perhaps see music as their only true form of self-expression. This petition refers to Alan Wills' days as a member of the influential Mersey band Shack to more recent years for his unstinting promotion of high quality new musicians on the Liverpool scene, such as The Coral. Alan Wills has consistently helped real, genuinely-talented artists on a musical level rather than following the more commonly adopted fast-buck, manufactured approach and this kind of honesty in today's music business deserves greater recognition in the hope that others will be encouraged to follow his values and beliefs.",
