            "background": "I would like the goverment to consider re-opening a military hospital in the uk to treat all hm forces returning injured and all veterans that have health problems as it would be so much more beneficial to troops and veterans and ease a burden on the nhs, also veterans would feel looked after by the system and not isolated and forgotten. i myself am a female war pensioner and cannot get the right treatment i need for my ptsd condition combat stress will not help me, and i have had numerous operations and just feel that after putting my life on the line, the system of this country doesn't care, and that i don't exist. a military hospital would change that and i would feel that my country is looking after me and others that need the medical care whether serving or former serving troops",
