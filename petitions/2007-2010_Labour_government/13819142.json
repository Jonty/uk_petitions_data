        "background": "Currently when the chancellor increases fuel duty he does it as an amount i.e. 1p, 2p, 5p per liter across the board. This in effect doubles the percentage rate on LPG. \n\ne.g. Petrol is \u00a31/litre a duty rise of 5p is a 5% increase however LPG is 50p/litre making a 5p duty rise a 10% increase. This is penalizing those of use who have spent a great deal of money (up to \u00a32500) reducing our emissions by converting our cars to run on LPG.",
