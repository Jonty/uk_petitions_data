            "background": "We currently live in a country where living in a \"safe\" constituency means your vote is wasted and where true representation of the nation's views are not welcome.\n\nIn 1997 the government promised to give the people a referendum on electoral reform. In 1999 the Jenkins report suggested a reform to a more proportional representation (PR) based system, this was ignored. Recently the Electoral Reform Society produced a report that concluded a change to PR is needed. The latest report issued by the government fails to show that the current system is a stronger system than PR, and denounced many myths about such systems, i.e. that PR creates \"weak\" government or is too confusing.\n\nWe the people believe that this government is failing in its duty to best represent the people through the continuation of a system that allows parliament to hold disproportionate levels of seats, and should therefore hold a referendum for the general public to decide which system they would prefer to use to elect governments in to power.",
