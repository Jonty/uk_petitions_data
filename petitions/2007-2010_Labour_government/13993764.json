            "background": "The drivers aren't working voluntary overtime due to strike action taking place.  Many commuters and school children are having to find alternative travel routes which are consderably longer and less convenient, as well as being more expensive where you have to take an additional tube journey. \nThis is a disgraceful situation and First Capital Connect should not be relying on drivers working overtime to run peak time trains; they should be timetabled to drive those trains within their normal working hours.",
