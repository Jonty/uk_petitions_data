        "background": "Seals are sentient mammals that experience pain, distress, fear and other forms of suffering. \nBritain\u2019s  Common Seal population is in a catastrophic decline. There is no \u201chumane\u201d method of shooting seals whilst they are in the water and shooting from an unstable platform is \u201cinherently inhumane\u201d. \n\nShooting continues throughout the \u201cclose\u201d season and seal pups can take weeks to die following the death of their mother, stress and starvation is terrible. Scientific evidence shows that only a very small percentage of identifiable seals target fin fish farms, salmon netsmen\u2019s nets and salmon rivers, Non-lethal methods to prevent seals from damaging aquaculture interests exist; there is no need to shoot seals . There is no protection for preventing \u201charassment\u201d of seals even in protected areas and no requirement to report the number of seals shot.\n\nSpecies \u201cconfusion\u201d is common place when shooting; therefore protection should be given to both of Britain\u2019s resident seal species: Grey and Common Seals (Halicherus grypus and Phoca vitulina vitulina).",
