Despite claiming to be British he pays nothing into the treasury of this country because he has moved to Monaco.\n\nWhile the hard pressed British Taxpayer has no choice but to pay their taxes.  The mega rich can get away with not paying uk income tax by moving to a tax haven.\n\nWe believe that something should be done about this and that everyone who claims british citizenship should pay their part.  Those who don't should loose the right to British Citizenship.",
