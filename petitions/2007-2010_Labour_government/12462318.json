        "background": "In britain all you need to do if you don't want to pay any British Income Tax is go into tax exile.\n\nUnder UK law a person is \"tax resident\" if that person visits the country for 183 days or more in the tax year or for 91 days or more on average in any four consecutive tax years\n\nLewis Hamilton, the Formula 1 World Champion is a Tax Exile.  Despite claiming to be British he pays nothing into the treasury of this country because he has moved to Monaco.\n\nWhile the hard pressed British Taxpayer has no choice but to pay their taxes.  The mega rich can get away with not paying uk income tax by moving to a tax haven.\n\nWe believe that something should be done about this and that everyone who claims british citizenship should pay their part.  Those who don't should loose the right to British Citizenship.",
