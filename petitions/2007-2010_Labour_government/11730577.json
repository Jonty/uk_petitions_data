        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The District Council is currently seeking protected status of the park within its current boundary.However two planned urban developments, Churchfields & Monksmoor will completly surround the Country Park and are being built far to close to the park boundary. \nLocal sentiment is not being listened to and despite a current planning enquiry being in force over the proposed developments the feelings of local people are not being activley sought in regard to the proximity of the planned developments to the country park boundary. While this is not an petiton objecting to more housng it is an objection to planned development impinging on the country park. A protected non development corridor of at least one mile should be created around the country park which should be planted with trees to screen all development from view, the cost of which should be borne by the developers.",
