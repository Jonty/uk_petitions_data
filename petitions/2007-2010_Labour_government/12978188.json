            "background": "Vaccination should be a choice that each individual makes for himself. Some people react adversely to these vaccinations and end up getting ill with the disease that the vaccination was supposed to prevent. It would be a human rights violation to force these upon everyone.\nSome researchers argue that there are risks associated flu vaccines. Most vaccines are preserved not only with mercury but also with aluminium \u2013 heavy metals that scientists claim are harmful to nerves, glands, and brains \u2013 long-term. \nVaccine critics argue that it is contradictory to state that Swine Flu is new, quite unlike any flu virus seen before, while at the same time promoting millions of vaccine vials that were possibly manufactured months or years prior to any given outbreak. If a new strand of virus is \"new and different\u201d then older vaccines will probably be useless. Numerous Internet articles expose the debate about vaccine effectiveness as is shown when searching for terms such as \u201cvaccine risks.\u201d",
