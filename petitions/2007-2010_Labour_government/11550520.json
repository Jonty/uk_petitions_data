        "background": "78 year old Andy Miller dropped dead in Accrington town centre after being driven to a cash machine by a bailiff to pay a sixty pound fine just two weeks after being released released from hospital following a heart attack and stroke.  Bailiffs frequently use bullying tactics to intimidate people into paying government enforced fines and charges.  They should be accountable in court for the distress and, in this case death, that has been caused.  Perhaps a better option for government would be to collect fines through the National Insurance system rather than employing thugs to bully their citizens.",
