            "background": "Loss of life increases exponentially with speed,as do noise,operating costs and pollution.Millions more homes will be built adjacent to highways to meet demand,increasing damaging  stress/noise/pollution levels. Average journey times decrease with lower speed,due to a more uniform rate of flow.Reducing the National limit would make Britain's roads safer and healthier. Technology would need to enforce the limit to gain all the obvious benefits of such an innovation given that such a high proportion of drivers feel that they are above the law.Also required, is a complementary elimination of illegal vehicle exhaust  modifications which the MOT system does not address adequately, exacerbated by operators altering systems subsequent to obtaining an MOT certificate - most prevalent, but not exclusively,by motorcycles. A remarkable reduction of injuries and loss of life, together with life changing environmental improvements and operating and insuring cost and non-renewable energy consumption reductions,would be achieved by this measure, which would reduce average journey times contrary to the generally held misconception",
