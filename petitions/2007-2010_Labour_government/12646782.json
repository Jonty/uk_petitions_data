            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If there is the slightest modicum of respect for the taxpayer left inside the Palace of Westminster then he will not be handed a peerage. Mr Speaker Martin is NOT an honourable man, he is a liar and a cheat.  He actively attempted to pervert the course of justice by obtaining an injunction against release of MPs claims and allowances information AND USED TAXPAYERS MONEY TO DO IT.  He is the very last person we want/need in our upper house helping to decide what goes on in this country.  He has proved that he is incapable of being honest and has only one interest in his life - HIS OWN ENRICHMENT.  The people must not have this man foisted upon them as a peer.  He has failed.  He must NOT be rewarded.",
