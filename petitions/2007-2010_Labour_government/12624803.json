            "background": "The recent revelations surrounding MPs expenses has raised very serious questions about the conduct of our representatives.  To date some have resigned and offered to pay back monies others have just offered to pay back monies in the hope that they can then just walk away without any further retribution.  David Chaytor and  Elliot Morley are just two recent and obvious examples of people who should currently be being subjected to a police investigation for the consideration of prosecution.   Lets put this into context, supposed \"errors\" are in fact acts of stealing from the public purse.  In any other situation, for example, benefit fraud,  the individuals would be considered for prosecution and the government has spent a great deal of money advertising this fact.  Despite many ministers apparently acting within the law and the rules, many  would appear to be acting illegally and we demand that the full force of the law is used to investigate and prosecute those who have acted illegally.",
