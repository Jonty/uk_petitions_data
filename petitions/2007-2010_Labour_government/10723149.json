            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many studies have shown that the particulates from diesel fumes are one of the main contributors to increasing rates of asthma, especially in children.  Current policy focuses on CO2 emissions, which consequently makes the public think that diesels are less polluting overall than petrols.\n\nA landmark study in the USA journal Environmental Health Perspectives illustrated that the fine particulates found in diesel exhaust lead to the immune system alterations that causes asthma.\n\nAs well as causing asthma, it has been shown that air pollution from diesel traffic can worsen lung function in people with asthma.  It is also worth bearing in mind that asthma is one of the main causes of hospitalisation for children under 16.\n\nTherefore, this petition is an attempt to help protect the UK's children from one of the most chronic and fast growing illnesses currently in the UK, by discouraging people from choosing and driving diesel vehicles.",
