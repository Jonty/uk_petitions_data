            "background": "These days it has become something of a nightmare trying to get a taxi from one place to another, particularly in busier cities in the UK, as congestion on the roads is increasingly common. Whenever one makes a taxi journey, one has to hope and pray that there's no delay in ones journey, as the amount on the metre will continue to increase even at a standstill at lights or in traffic jams. I don't feel it necessary to charge one for excerpts of ones journey when the vehicle is not moving.",
