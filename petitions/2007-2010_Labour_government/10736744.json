Then it is only fair to take back the M.P,s free homes and put the revenue back into the care of pensioners.  LET THEM RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. Many have paid for this care through their years of PAYE and National insurance contributions. If they want second homes they have to pay for them out of their own money.",
