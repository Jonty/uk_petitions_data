These zones are an over reaction to the minute, but tragic, incidence of \"doorstep\" crime. The agencies involved, Trading Standards, Local Authority, Police, should spend their time catching the perpetrators of this crime not stopping honest people from providing a service to local communities. Once again this is an example of this governments inability to cure the disease and taking the lazy option of treating the symptons to the detriment of innocent people.",
