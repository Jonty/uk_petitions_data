            "background": "The narcotic drug Qat/Khat which is mainly used by the Ethiopian, Somali and Yemeni community; is a highly addictive drug which mirrors the effects of amphetamines.  Currently it is legal and some dealers are claiming to make up to \u00a340,000 a week.  Qat is also a huge driving force behind the war in the horn of Africa. Addicts become paranoid, lose touch with reality and time and often end up losing their jobs and their families as well; thus creating a strain on the UK benefits system. Medical studies suggest it rots the teeth and could lead to mouth cancers, blood pressure problems and heart attacks. Qat is a massive problem and should be banned immediately.",
