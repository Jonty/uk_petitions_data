        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Government have decided that it is in the interest of the people not to have a say, despite having earlier promising a referendum on Britain's place in Europe.\n\nThe Government's function is that of a mouthpiece for the people. Knowing the unpopular nature of, and strength of opinion against the Treaty, a motion was passed against a referendum on Wednesday, 5th March. \n\nThe treaty brings us as close as is possible to the next stage of a united states of Europe - the constitution.\n\nWhether or not you agree with the notion of a treaty for Europe, the petition is to test the real will of the people. I submit that it is patently wrong to mislead the people of Britain by the suggestion of a referendum for a constitution, but simply ignore the voice of the people with a matter of equal importance.\n\nThis is not a done deal. Ratification has not yet taken place and neither should it until such time as the people are permitted a rightful say.\n\nI have no political affiliation, I am simply angered by what I consider to have been a breach of trust on the part of the Government.\n\nPaul Nicholls.",
