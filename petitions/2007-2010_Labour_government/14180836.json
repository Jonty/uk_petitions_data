            "background": "This petition is to show how frustrated people are about the ignorance of people voting and campaigning against wind turbines on the Isle Of Wight because they are not aesthetically pleasing. We have to stop this 'Not in my back yard' mentality and show these people that it\u2019s not just the view out of their back garden that is at stake if we don\u2019t act. So by getting enough signatories to show there support I hope for direct Prime Ministerial support for wind turbines on, or offshore from, the Isle of Wight.",
