            "background": "The intention of this petition is to draw attention to the current difficulty facing tens of thousands of first time buyers who are unable to secure homes under current circumstances.\n\nHouses have been over-egged as investment opportunities, and it has been made too easy or appealing for this to happen. As a result, house prices have been artificially inflated, putting them out of reach of the typical first time buyer.\n\nThe younger generation are having to withhold buying, in cases well into their 30's, and in the mean time rent from the investors; making them richer.\n\nThis is a vicious circle that will get worse unchecked, with dire consequences.\n\nMost solutions mentioned thus far are not acceptable. E.g. relying on parents / family money or help, waiting until late 30's to buy etc...etc...\n\nHouse prices need to fall substantially, and property values need to be tracked with RPI, for there to be any chance of a sustainable future.",
