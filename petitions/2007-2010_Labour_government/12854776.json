They were not working for The Royal Mail when they fiddled the statistics because 'fiddling statistics' is not part of their contract of employment.  Therefore, any fines should be paid by them, PERSONALLY, and NOT by The Royal Mail as an entity.  This impunity from taking the consequences of your actions by directors, managers and civil servants MUST now be cut off at the roots.  The fines MUST NOT be paid by The Royal Mail.",
