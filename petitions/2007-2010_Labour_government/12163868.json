        "background": "As a Goverment you have eroded our rights to free speech, the ability to protest near our Parliament and created 'anti-terror' legislation - which is today being abused by both the police and local councils for their own ends which have nothing to do with preventing terrorism. New proposals are now being made to create a database to track and store all our communications and interactions. \nYou will be aware of this Governments appalling track record of delivering IT projects and securely keeping sensitive data. These two elements combined make this proposal both economically alarming and creates severe concern over the access and security of the data. This is nothing short of creating the pathway to a police state and as an electorate we insist that this waste of public funds is stopped and that your efforts are directed towards rectifying the economic threats that are reality. Please stop using Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt to promote these policies which will only serve to further erode our privacy and civil liberties.",
