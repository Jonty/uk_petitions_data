            "background": "RAF Detling was a station of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in World War I and the Royal Air Force (RAF) in World War II. Situated 600 feet above sea level, it is located near Detling, a village about three miles north-east of Maidstone, in Kent.\nRNAS Detling was used jointly by the Navy and Air Force between 1916 and 1919, and Fleet Air Arm aircraft also shared some facilities during the second World War. It was bombed by the Luftwaffe several times, with considerable loss of life. RAF Detling opened in 1939, was assigned to No 11 Group and closed in 1959.\nThe site of the airfield is now home to the annual Kent County Show, which takes place for three days every July, and a number of other shows and events.\nI would to see this historic site used for civil flying. It is a shame that there has been no civil flying from Detling since 1959 and I would like to see this change. It would be popular with aviation enthusiasts all over the country and would be a boost to the local area.",
