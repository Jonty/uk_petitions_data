            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Every year more than 50,000 galgos are brutally beaten, dragged behind cars, and hung. Tradition dictates that Galgos deemed too slow to hunt are hung from a low branch of a tree so that their hind feet touch the floor, prolonging their suffering. This dreadful end is but one more brutality after a life of starvation and abuse.We expect a European country like Spain to apply the animal protection laws in favour of the hunting hounds in Spain and we ask the authorities to insist on a control of the hunters, and the inhumane treatment and extermination of their dogs. We petition the UK government to apply pressure to the Spanish government to implement the existing animal welfare laws with respect to hunting galgos and podencos.",
