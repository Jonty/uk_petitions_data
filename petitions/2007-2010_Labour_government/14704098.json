        "background": "The new Independant Parliamentary Standards Authority is a body which will set, check and authorise 646 MPs' expense claims. The money required to set this body up is \u00a36.6 million. The price is down to the 80 staff which are apparently needed to run it along with the procurement of IT equipment. This is a scandalous waste of tax payers money and it needs to be stopped. Any private sector business could do the job for a fraction of the price so what's so different about Parliament?",
