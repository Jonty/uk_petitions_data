It would generally be nice if they could cease from being content to abdicate the responsibility of Government to the market and do something useful for a change.\n\nNo-one wants this to happen. The only ones who want this to happen are Kraft, and it can happen, because we are stupid enough to let it happen. We all know what will come next, we've seen it with everything else that has been sold off. When are you going to get it, or is it that you just don't care???",
