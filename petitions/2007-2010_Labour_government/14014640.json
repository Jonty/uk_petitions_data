Paul and Rachel Chandler, aged 59 and 55 and from Kent, were taken hostage by Somali gunmen on October 23 as they sailed their yacht in the Indian Ocean. Pirates have ransomed \u00a34.3m to release them. I understand the government doesn't mix with kinappers but please could you find/do some thing to help them.",
