            "background": "The M4 narrows from 3 lanes to just 2 in each direction for the London elevated section. This creates a severe bottleneck, exacerbated by the junction (J2) with the North Circular. The elevated section from J2 westwards should be widened to 3 lanes, with the new lane being a dedicated slip road. This would improve traffic flow, so making better (safer & more efficient) use of the road network around it.",
