        "action": "add a 3rd lane to the M4 London elevated section between J2 (North Circular) to westerly end of elevated section.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The M4 narrows from 3 lanes to just 2 in each direction for the London elevated section. This creates a severe bottleneck, exacerbated by the junction (J2) with the North Circular. The elevated section from J2 westwards should be widened to 3 lanes, with the new lane being a dedicated slip road. This would improve traffic flow, so making better (safer & more efficient) use of the road network around it.",
