            "background": "With light of the current economic crisis, it is imperative that the government does more to help those people who are self-employed and have to pay their own taxes.  The government/Inland Revenue does not seem to realise that for many people they cannot afford the additional \"payment on account\", which is the additional payments requested to partially cover the payments for the future (current) tax year).\n\nWhy does the Inland Revenue not allow people to only pay the tax for the tax-year they submitted their self-assessment for, but demand these additional payments which many cannot easily afford - especially in the current economic situation?\n\nTaxation should be fair and equal and should only take into account fully what has already been earned, and not what is predicted to be earned.",
