        "action": "call an immediate referendum of the taxpayers of this land and give them an opportunity to say whether or not they agree with their money being ploughed in to compensate bad decisions by bank executives and supporting investors who were greedy and put their money offshore for higher gain.",

        "background": "Banks are now in the position where it matters not how they perform, the taxpayer will pick up the tab.  No mention has been made of safeguarding against directors awarding themselves huge bonusses out of the taxpayer guarantee.  Investors who went offshore for higher gains are also being offered compensation.  Why are these greedy people not being asked to repay the high gains they got, before asking for taxpayer money to be handed out to them.  \nThe taxpayer MUST be given an opportunity to state they either do or do not support this position.  The government keeps spouting that these are unusual times.  The government should take the unusual step, therefore, of allowing the people who it will affect most the choice of putting a stop to it by giving them a legally binding referendum, immediately.",
