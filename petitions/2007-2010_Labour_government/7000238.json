Mr Chaudury lost the sight in one eye and his independence: he now lives in a care home as a result of the impact on his health of this vicious unprovoked attack. Mr Gordon on the other hand only received a 3 year supervision order requiring him to receive psychiatric help. This is not justice, does not protect the public and is a very poor deterrent.",
