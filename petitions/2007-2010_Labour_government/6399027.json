        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "i would like to see the dsa driving test withdrawn because its costing taxi firms money,taxi firms are losing drivers because they cant pass,and its not because they arent good drivers its because a great deal of drivers including myself have already passed my driving test and feel we shouldnt have to pass another.Over the years every driver develops there own way of driving and after many years of driving have to pay a sum of \u00a360.00 pounds to prove you can drive.What i recommend is once a year all drivers to be assesed and given instruction on what they need to brush up on if anything.Ive failed twice now at a cost of \u00a3120.00 pounds on what i feel are silly non dangerous mistakes and in doing so i cant continue driving a taxi which means my employer is now one driver down and for him to replace me the second driver has to endure this corrupt money making farse.Ive been driving safely for 15 years now and its costing me and many others a great deal of money.eventualy many will suffer,school contracts,airport runs,contract runs and the general public because i feel there is going to be a massive shortage of drivers.",
