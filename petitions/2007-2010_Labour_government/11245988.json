            "background": "This is an unfair tax and clearly not well thought out. It is an irresponsible reacton to people moving from cars to motorcycles as a cheaper and quicker and LESS congestive form of transport. The council obviously reacted to having to increase the number of spaces by charging which is counter productive to reducing the congestion in london. They should be promoting motorcycling not discouraging it.",
