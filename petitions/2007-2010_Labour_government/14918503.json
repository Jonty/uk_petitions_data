            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We call upon the government to abolish university fees to benefit the individual and society as a whole. This will make higher education possible for every student in the UK, making it equal and fair for everyone. Of course, universities need to be supported by some income or other but this will work out by helping people get the education they need to get a worthy job to pay the taxes which will keep the universities up. It will also benefit our society by contributing to more people working towards business, commerce and technology to improve our industries, businesses and country to develop faster and most importantly, improve our lives.",
