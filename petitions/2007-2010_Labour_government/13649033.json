            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The UK funeral market is estimated to be worth over \u00a31billion annually. \n\nShockingly costs have soared by 42 per cent over the last five years.\n\nHugely more than the rate of inflation, not in line with other industries and definitely not explicable by reasonable economic logic.\n\nThe \"total cost of dying\" is now topping \u00a37,000 according to a study by the market research firm Mintel (Telegraph, 08 Sep 2009). Costs often reach \u00a315,000.  \n\nThis results because the funeral industry is unregulated. It claims to be self-regulating through its own bodies.\n\nPeople who have just suffered a bereavement are particularly vulnerable, so it's vital that the funeral industry is properly and independently regulated.\n\nThe facts suggest self-regulation does NOT work.\n\nNothing has changed since Professor Woodroffe of Brunel University noted that self-regulation is not a good idea for this industry : \".....How on earth can anyone expect regulation processes set up by trade bodies to be impartial and fair? People are extremely vulnerable when they are arranging funerals for relatives or partners. Independent regulation is vital.\" Telegraph 2002.\n\nPlease sign this petition to help everyone.",
