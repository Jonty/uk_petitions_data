            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Proposals to use 'lie detector'-style technology on benefit claimants should be vehemently resisted. This technology is not infallible.  It will do more to prevent those who are deserving and vulnerable from claiming the support they need than it will to weed out the skilled and practised liars who can in any case fool the technology. As a claimant, if you think they think you are lying there may be a tendency to become nervous and defensive. It will stigmatise those who seek support when in need as potential liars and cheats and make the process of accessing the basic means of survival stressful and humiliating. Perhaps the technology should be re-directed at those engaged in creative accounting practices that enables them to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax.\n\nPlease sign this petition if you are against the increasingly abhorrent treatment of the vulnerable in need of support, object to this technology being used on benefit claimants and want to petition the PM not to introduce it.",
