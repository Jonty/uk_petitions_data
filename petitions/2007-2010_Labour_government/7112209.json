            "background": "The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has said that reforms were needed to ensure \"public confidence in assessments\". I agree with a review of subjects taught, some, like child abuse and child pornography are simply criminal acts, but in terms of assessment then why fix a system if it is not broken ? Nurse training curriculums are one example of how flux and influx (vocational training, project 2000, UKCC to NMC etc) has made it more difficult for students passing through the system to understand the requirements of exam boards and understnading the requirements of constantly changing professional regulatory bodies - worsening the stress of sitting exams, gaining professional status and making a transition from school to workplace. The aim of an educational system should be to promote a safe learning environment equipping with skills for life - not cause shock waves amongst it's recipients (parents and service providers !).Of course those who cannot come up with a better idea shouldn't criticise, so the UK govt may consider commissioning by a professional writer to design a leaflet that illustrates changes.",
