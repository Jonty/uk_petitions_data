            "background": "The closure of RAF Cottesmore is deplorable.  This will not only devastate a local community, but marks the very likely demise of the Harrier aircraft.  These actions are short-sighted and will severely lessen our defence capability.  Without strong defences to counter threats at the present time or in the future, the security of our nation is compromised.",
