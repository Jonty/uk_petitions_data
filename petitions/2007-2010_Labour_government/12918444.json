            "background": "As of the 4th July the N213 bus will no longer run in the night from Croydon through to Sutton. TFL have no alternative service for this part of the route and therefore there is no means of getting home if you live in these areas. \n\nThis will mean that all those people that regularly get the bus home will now have to look for alternative options- this will mean an increase in drink driving, unliscenced taxis and people attempting to walk home at night especially young women. This is inevitably a dangerous decision that TFL have made. \n\nNot only this, it will affect the local businesses of Croydon and the workers that will no longer have a way of getting home. The bus is also the only affordable option for many people.",
