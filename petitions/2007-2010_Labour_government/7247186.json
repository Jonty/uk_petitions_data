            "background": "Without a doubt, this man has changed many womens' lives. Not just those that he has personally worked with, but the rest of us that follow his work. In a time where women in the public eye are criticised for every wrinkle, lump and bump it is refreshing to find someone who truly wants to make people look and feel gorgeous whatever their size may be.\n\nWhile this may seem to be a shallow subject, the difference is not only skin deep. In boosting the confidence of women, he is allowing us to reclaim the idea of being acceptable as a whole person even if we do not conform to societies standard of appearance. The change in women can even go as far as saving their marriages or giving them the confidence to become who they really want to be.\n\nGok Wan is truly an angel in disguise and certainly deserves to be recognised for it. It is time we changed the message that encourages primary school children to diet and adult women to go under the knife to achieve something that is often unnecessary.",
