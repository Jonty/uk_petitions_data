            "background": "It is a disgrace that thousands upon thousands of elderly couples, one of whom is suffering from this insidious disease is being denied drugs that we know work. Case after case comes to light where the aged husband or wife is forced to care for their spouse with little and often no outside support. One recent case of many is no less than shocking a pensioner, the wife of a Alzheimer sufferer had a heart attack brought on by stress and exhaustion. She died on the spot by her husband due to the fact there was no one in the house other than her husband who could call an ambulance..He sat by distressed and confused.What a way to treat those who have worked all their lives and contributed into the pension funds that are now all but worthless.. Those same people who suffered the harships of the last war and who fought to keep this country free. What a way to thank them.\nThe same applies to those young people being denied cancer drugs who are being forced to sell their homes to pay for extra time and the hope of a cure.",
