        "background": "Jack Straw is running a totally pathetic and incompetent department. His department has allowed a convicted murderer to be moved to an 'open prison', and as a result the murderer has escaped. How would YOU feel if the murderer of your son, brother, father was to escape in such circumstances? The brother of Mr Thomas Cressman is understandably upset and outraged. You can read the full story on the BBC website.\n\nJane Andrews or ANY convicted murderer should be allowed to be held in an open prison. Nor allowed on shopping trips like Patricia Gillette was when she escaped a couple of weeks ago.\n\nClearly Jack Straw has shown he is not up to the job. And these are not the first instances of such incompetence.\n\nRESIGN OR SACK HIM NOW!",
