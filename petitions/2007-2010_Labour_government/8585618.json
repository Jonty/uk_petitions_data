            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "European Commissioner McCreevy proposes \nthat European legislation should be enacted to extend the term of copyright in sound recordings from its present 50 year term to 95 years. He claims this is to achieve parity between composers and performers. \n\nWe call upon the Prime Minster to vigorously oppose such a move on the following grounds.\n\nThe Gower's Review clearly and definitively made the case that extension to the copyright term for sound recordings is not justified on economic or moral grounds. \n\nGiven the clarity and strength of the arguments in the Gower's Review, the Prime Minister should show a lead in opposing the special interest lobby of recording companies who are pushing for this extension in Europe, having failed to convince the UK government of their case.",
