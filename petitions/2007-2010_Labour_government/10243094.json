Please recommend to TV companies, in respect of programmes like Crimewatch, that the BBC broadcasts a codicil explicitly stating that the faces of people depicted in these portrayals, are ONLY wanted in relation to an investigation of crime - i.e. an inquiry and make recommendations on slander. There is no place in a parliamentary democracy for witchhunts, fuelled by the media.",
