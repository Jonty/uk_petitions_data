            "background": "Even if the second hand smoke from shisha is harmful, we believe that including it in the smoking ban is removing the arabian and middle eastern culture from the british society. People enter shisha or hookah cafe's with their own will,they work there because they dont mind being in the presence of fellow smokers or they smoke themselves. Second hand smoking has been discovered to be more harmfull but then is the world also a public place. People that smoke while walking on roads also give out second hand smoke which can easily be inhaled in by others. So either remove shisha from the smoking ban or ban smoking totaly.",
