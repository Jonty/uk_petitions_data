It is wrong and discriminating that a fixed age should be put on the purchase of restricted products.\n\nMake it so that anyone who completes their sixth-form can legally buy alcohol. People age 17 and a half who have completed their full education are much less likely to overconsume alcohol than someone aged 18 who dropped out of school aged 16.",
