            "background": "Following the revelations this week detailing how the BBC Execs are abusing their position, our money and awarding themselves ridiculous salaries as well as wasting, for example, \u00a330,000,000 on flights and hotels I call for the Government to abolish the TV License and let the BBC fund itself. The TV Licence fee is currently compulsory and we are told year on year that it is essential for the BBC to continue to have this revenue in order to provide a quality channel? However, how does the BBC justify giving Jonathan Ross \u00a36,000,000 per year?   Just for Jonathan Ross's services takes over 43,000 people to buy a license each per year - this is just for ONE persons salary! \nHeadlines from Sunday paper 2nd November 2008 - \nTHE BBC was last night engulfed in a new scandal\u2014 over a staggering \u00a314.3 MILLION paid in salaries to management fatcats. \nFor \u00a314.3m we could employ 677 nurses, 695 teachers or 596 coppers.. but we get 50 money-grabbing BBC fat cats \nThe TV license is an out of date waste of hard working peoples money - it's time the BBC stood on it's own and funded itself - Sign to say no to TV licensing",
