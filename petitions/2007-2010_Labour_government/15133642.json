            "background": "Modern HGV vehicles have large blind spots around the vehicle making it impossible for the Driver to be aware of vehicles next to them.  Due to the mass of the vehicle, it is possible for them to hit vehicles and the driver to be unaware.  The addition of cameras and proximity alarms would solve this but needs to be compulsory to make it happen.",
