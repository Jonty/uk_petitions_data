            "background": "The high-risk investment banking arm of the state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland is planning to to hand out bonuses to staff again this year. These bonuses are to be even higher than those given at the peak of the financial boom of 2007 and over 60% higher than those paid last year. We, having bailed-out this bank with our money, demand that any money earmarked for such payments be used to pay back some of what they 'borrowed' so that fewer service cuts or job losses need to be made.",
