As for certain companies charging 177% this is an outrage (provident).\nWhen unexpected circumstances present themselves, it is the people who are already in trouble and cannot afford it who have no choice but to accept these rates, or those who are not financialy savvy enough to comprehend what they are letting themselves in for. \nOther European countries have operated interest rate caps of 20% (Germany) for the last 20 years succesfully with obvious benfits to the consumer.",
