            "background": "It is continually suggested that it is our education system, the government, and so on that is the cause of the increase in teenage pregnancies and minors taking part in underage sex. Surely the responsibility should be laid on the shoulders of those who legally have parental responsibility for that minor; this would be the parent/s, carer/s, guardian/s who have a legal and moral responsibility to care for a child until they reach the age of adulthood.\nThis petition proposes that the responsibility of these minors who have sexual intercourse, become pregnant or makes another pregnant should fall squarely on the shoulders of those who legally responsible for a minors welfare and upbringing.\n\nWe suggest the sentence\u2019s imposed are the same of a parent who neglects to send there child/children to school, or allows and encourages that child to commit anti social behaviour. \nShouldn\u2019t we as a society send a very clear message to parents who choose not to take responsibility for their own children\u2019s sexual activities or have a lack of control over these minors be punished for neglecting their duties as a parent?",
