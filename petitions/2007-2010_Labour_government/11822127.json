Commuters around Londer are getting longer and more frequent services where as commuters in and around Preston, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle and other places have to cram themselves into short, infrequent services.\n\nAlso, in London alone, there is close to \u00a330bn worth of new projexts being planned, but the rest of the country has do put up with \"make do and mend\" repairs.\n\nI'm asking the government to direct Network Rail and the DfT to spread the investments more fairly to benefit more passengers",
