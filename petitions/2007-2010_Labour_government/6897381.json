            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The majority of car owners rely on their vehicles as the only practical means of transport. Public transport is too expensive, particularly when 2 or more wish to travel together. It is absolutely ridiculous that fares are higher during peak periods, when the government are supposedly seeking to attract motorists away from the roads and onto public transport.  Much needs to be done to improve public transport services outside of London and the main cities. Trains and buses do not go where you want to go at a time you want to travel.\nOld age pensioners and students can obtain railcards, likewise those who travel within the London commuter belt. There is nothing on offer for the majority of the population and particularly for those who travel around the country. A National Rail Card offering substantial discounts is essential and should be introduced without further delay. Even better, a National Travel Card covering all forms of public transport should be considered. The government seem to have forgotten one of the primary requisits for a successful economy namely good  communications.\nI suggest going back to the legislation of The Cheap Trains Act of 1844 for inspiration.",
