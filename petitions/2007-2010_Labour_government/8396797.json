        "action": "cease post-mortems unless one was requested by the deceased before they died, the deceased\u2019s next of kin requests one after their death, or the deceased died because of suspected foul play.",

        "background": "The latest official data available (2003) states there were 534,600 deaths in that year, of which 210,700 (39.4%) were referred to the Coroner and of which 120,099 (57%) underwent a post-mortem.\n \nCeasing post-mortems as requested in this petition would not only save money because of the reduced number undertaken but would also allow more time to concentrate on the cases that really need investigation.  These continuing cases would still provide ample opportunities for research.\n\nImportantly, this reduction would also mean that the people who object because of personal or religious reasons will not be subject to a post-mortem purely because they died in an accident or without seeing a doctor within the previous two weeks.",
