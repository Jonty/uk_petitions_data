            "background": "At present, children are the only citizens in the UK who can legally be hit. Protection form corporal punishment (e.g. hitting) is every child's human right. \n\nCorporal punishment is still permitted in the home in the UK but it is prohibited in schools, childcare settings and in prisons. Children should be given the same protection from being hit as adults.\n\nResearch has shown that children who are often hit are likely to hit or bully other children, have relationship problems with their parents or become unbearable. Corporal punishment should also be banned in public places such as shops, leisure centres and restaurants.",
