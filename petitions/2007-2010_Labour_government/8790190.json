            "background": "A recent experiment was carried out on the Northern section of the M42, restricting vehicals over a certain size to the inside lane. The result from my observations, was that the flow of traffic greatly improved.\nWe have all been in the situation on major roads when lorries try to overtake and find that they haven't got enough power, subsequently causing the traffic behind to back up suddenly. Keeping them to the inside lane, prevents this type of local congestion and will make the roads safer.",
