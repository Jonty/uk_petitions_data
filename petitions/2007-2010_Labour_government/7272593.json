            "background": "I believe that not enough sports are played during break and luchtimes at secondary schools. Other that P.E once or twice a week some teenagers are getting away with no excersise. I would like to get schools to orginise more sporting activities at break and lunch times, that younge poeple can go to. I understand that not everone is good at sport, but everyone can learn to enjoy it. For exsample, the activities would never be very serious, but just somwhere to go and have a laugh with your friends running relay races or games of rounders e.t.c. Please understand that this is a serious matter that I would very much like to do something about. So please sign this petition to give children a better future!",
