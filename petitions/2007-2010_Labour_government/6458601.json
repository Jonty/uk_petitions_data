            "background": "Put into place systems and means testing to ensure Europeans can suppport themselves on entry into the UK. \nNon UK resident should be questioned before permitting entry into the UK. They should be able to verify that they can support themselves for at least 1 year -via a bank account showing available funds. Also that they are physically fit and have no illnesses. Other countries e.g Australia / USA /South Africa all have strict guidelines. Their systems are tried and tested and they really work for the best of the country and safeguard their culture and infrastructure too. We really need to re-assess this serious situation as our resources are being stretched to the limits due to an influx of foreign workers.\n\nThey recieve benefits and housing as they arrive homeless which is putting stress on funding and local amenities where they live.\n\nWhy not tag them so we know where they are in the UK at any time. Satellite tracking devices would be a good idea.",
