        "background": "Our City and Town centres are becoming increasingly congested due to the influx of car driving commuters and shoppers heading for the car parks. Ridding the centres of these car magnets will cure the congestion and free up the roads for the use of frequent well managed park and ride schemes with the car parks located at peripheral sites around the town. If there is nowhere to park your car, there is no reason to drive there.",
