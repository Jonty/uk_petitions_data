            "background": "A US court has been dealing with a legal battle between YouTube and Viacom. This relates to videos being placed into this medium for others users to view. However the ruling by the court to order YouTube to handover its logs from the site violates our rights because it will contain our personal data. A quote from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)says \"The body said the ruling was also potentially unlawful because the log data did contain personally identifiable data.\" \nThis goes against everything the Internet is about and allowing greedy media companies to do this simply opens up a \"can of worms\" for future generations who may lose out. This also is applicable to this site as the PM uses YouTube to address the people. This needs to be blocked by the UK government at all costs.",
