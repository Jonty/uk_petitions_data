Women who work or share accounts with their perpetrators are expected to meet the cost of seeking protection and justice. Many vulnerable women simply cannot afford to protect themselves against their perpetrators, leaving themselves open to further abuse/violence.  \n\nWe, the undersigned, demand the Prime Minister reviews the current policy on legal assistance, and provides a non-means tested guaranteed Legal Aid certificate, to enable ALL women victims of domestic violence/abuse to seek justice and legal protection, regardless of their income.",
