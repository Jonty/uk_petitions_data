        "background": "Whilst we understand and appreciate the need for certain laws and parity for all races and religions, it appears over zealous to ban some nursery rhymes, such as the Three Little Pigs, for fear they might offend Muslims.\nWe urge the Prime Minister to act to prevent instances like Becta's refusal to allow a digital reworking of a children's classic. We fear this will spark more trouble and actually could worsen race relations.",
