        "background": "Cycling is an easy and low-impact activity which can significantly improve individual fitness and which has the potential to have a major impact on public health. It can help to reduce the risk of a range of health problems, notably heart disease and cancer*. \n\nOne study found that people who cycle to work experienced a 39% lower rate of all-cause mortality compared to those who did not \u2013 even after adjustment for other risk factors, including leisure time physical activity*.\n\nLocal authorities should be taking a lead on promoting cycling, especially to their staff. One way in which they can do this is to implement a ride 2 work (tax exemption) scheme. The average saving on the price of a new bike to the employee is 43%, and the employer saves money too. We believe that the PM should force all local authorities to implement such a scheme within one year of this petition closing.\n\n* = adapted from Cavill, N. & Davis, A. (2007).
