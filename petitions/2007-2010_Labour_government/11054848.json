            "background": "Why is it our Boys & Girls are fighting for their country and yet they are expected to put up with dire accommodation. \n\nYou get what you're given when it comes to quarters, it doesn't matter if you have children or dogs or both, they'll put you where they want, you don't get a choice. When you march out, you get billled regardless of what state you leave your house in.\n\nWhere does this money go??? Back to the MoD? If so then why aren't they spending out on improving our accommodation?? Why are we expected to live in 1960's conditions, night storage heaters, old windows, tacky curtains and carpets, 20 year old bathroom suites, age old kitchen fittings with cupboard doors hanging off (apparently that's just wear and tear) and chicken wire fencing in our gardens?\n\nThe families of our Armed Forces live a lonely life, sometimes spending most of their years apart from their spouses so why are we expected to put up with crap housing?? \n\nA happy house = a happy soldier.\n\nYes we do pay reduced rates for our accommodation, you can see why! They wouldn't be able to get away with charging us more would they because it would be daylight robbery.",
