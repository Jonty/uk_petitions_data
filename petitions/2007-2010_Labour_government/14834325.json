            "background": "Immigration should be stopped outside of the EU. this country cannot cope with it, the people who are here, need to learn English and become English, instead we have ghettos just like the USA. \n\nJobs in England are scarce with over 3 million unemployed, that is the known figure there are many more. Like single mothers and the sick. \n\nSocial housing is given to immigrants as they come here with children, and people cannot afford mortgages. \n\nThe NHS is poor, being too overcrowded, add to that schools and the like. Plus this governement pays for orgainisations that help immigrants, we need organisations to help the English get back to work, and find an affordable home.",
