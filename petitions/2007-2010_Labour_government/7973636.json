            "background": "The Council are currently spending roughly \u00a3500,000 of taxpayers money looking at introducting a congestion charge into Norwich.  We believe this move would hit the elderly, families and disabled the hardest.  We also believe it to be unworkable in a City as small as Norwich.  We know it will be unpopular with residents who won't want to pay to drive into their own City.  Please join us in opposing this scheme.",
