It is about community being part of a body a family and we think that this misconception of the christian faith will put people in danger and at risk \n Zaman Mohammadi is an Afghani boy whos parents dissappeared  when he was about 13 he was coverted to Christianity through  listening to Christian radio. Was Baptised by Western Christian  Aid Workers sufferd stoning by his neighbours and the threat of  death by the police. He is a regular worship and practicing  memeber of Saint Luke's Wallsend. The only language he can \nread and write is English and to return him to Afghanistan at this time could put his life in danger. It has already caused him great mental anguish for which he is receiving medical help",
