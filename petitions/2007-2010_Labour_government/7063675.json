The soldiers, Seamen and Airmen get their basic pay based on an 8 hour day.  Based on a 24 hour per day pay scale, in the RAF only Sqn Ldr's (Senior Management) and above are paid UK minimum wage at roughly \u00a344,000+ per annum.  I suggest that at least whilst on an operational tour of 2 to 6 months that ALL members of the Armed Forces be paid 24 hours per day at Minimum Wage rates \u00a35.05 per hour.",
