My generation of people are having to, and no offence to any 25+ year old adult, pay for your mistakes. I don't want my future being jepordised being some companies are thinking more about money than lives. The effects of global warming are coming faster than any one ever predicted. have you seen the news about forest fires in grease, or high levels of monsoons in southern parts of Africa?\nOr even the floods here in England over in Glastonbury. Politics has become more about giving money to single parents rather than ensuring their kids get an ensured future. i need my future secured",
