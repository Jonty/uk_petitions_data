        "background": "Scoliosis is a condition of the spine which gives the sufferer the appearance of a hunchback and far more importantly, especially for this petition, makes it difficult and painful for them to lie on hard beds with no \"give\" for their backs.  Many treatments are sufficiently difficult and painful for those of us with straight backs; for people with scoliosis (like my husband) they become almost intolerable.",
