            "background": "The state (IE the people) have a share in everything the country owns.  More recently this has been banks also.  These state owned assets are controlled on behalf of the people by the government.  As residents of the United Kingdom we the undersigned feel that Gordon Brown and his cabinet need to put more pressure on the banks to lend.  The way forward is not \"bail outs\" or \"guarantees\" but use banks like Northern Rock to introduce more competitive products to compete with the other banks.  IE first time buyer mortgages and remortgages at lower rates etc.  All within affordability parameters, but at the same time as these products will be cheaper it will spur the big banks to fight for that business, thus creating competition.  We also feel we do not want to loose our industries like steel and manufacturing therefore it is important that the government creates loans for all types of businesses, big or small.  We also feel the government is currently not doing enough to create more job opportunities. Current unemployment figures are totally unacceptable and the government needs to strive to improve on this.",
