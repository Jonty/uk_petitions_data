In the 10p cut I was going to loose \u00a3131 per year the above package should give me \u00a3120 per year back.  Does the Labour Party think low paid earners are stupid because we are not. You have increased tax to anyone who earns up to \u00a340K per year, I get the same but only earn \u00a318300 per year with two jobs. You have not helped the low paid workers today.",
