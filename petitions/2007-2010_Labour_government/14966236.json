        "background": "There are near 20,000 British troops in Germany at this current time and I believe in this day and age, it is not necessary. It is costing the government billions each year to have them in there and our economy  simply cannot sustain that number any more. Also Germany is a respected and stable democracy so there is no reason to have our troops in there to keep it that way. Russia is also a stable and respected country so there is no reason to have a defence in Germany any more.",
