        "background": "At the moment the government taxes money twice, once when you earn it, and again when you spend it. Using smoke an mirrors, the government obscures the horrendous amount of money it actually takes by reducing income tax while creating hidden tax.\n\nAbolish all stealth taxes eg. VAT, alcohol tax, airline passenger duty, taxes on pension dividend income etc. \n\nThis process is not only confusing for people but also deceptive. The government should have to act with transparency by having 1 single tax.",
