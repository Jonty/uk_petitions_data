            "background": "Between 2000 and 2005, 106 teachers have died from asbestos related mesothelioma.  (HSE Statistics).\n\nIt is unacceptable that in 2009, such a high number of preventable deaths are occurring.\n\nIf the teachers are exposed to asbestos and are contracting a cruel and fatal illness then surely the children will also be exposed.\n\nThis is an issue, which can be easily corrected.  Legionnella is better controlled than asbestos which is surely wrong when every day we hear advertisements aimed at the construction industry to tell us just how dangerous asbestos is and how many are exposed and die every week.\n\nEach school has adequate time to remove asbestos during holidays it is a matter of finacing the programme which would create much needed work for the struggling construction industry.",
