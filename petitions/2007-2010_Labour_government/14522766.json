            "background": "I have notice over the years with the tribunal system that people with tribunal services say they are fair, instead they forget they got a list in front of them what meets rather than the disability the  person actually got and how it really affects they lives. As people assessing and judging don't know the pains and hardship the people are going through. The money on DLA and Incapacity is not enough if you got to buy a disable bed which cost more than a normal bed and so fourth. Disabled people have the right to tell tribunal off and to campaign against negligence within the benefit system like taking the job centre side all the time because they know which law to use to stop the appealing party getting what entitled to them. Gordon Brown will not permit this as this will show Tribunals are stopping people entitled for benefits, while the money goes towards labour campaign for the general elections and expenses.",
