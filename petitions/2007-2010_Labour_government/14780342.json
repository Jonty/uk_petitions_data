            "background": "There are currently no standard checks carried out on UK licence holders after the day of their driving test. A UK driver may have taken their test 40 years ago with perfect eyesight, and still be driving 40 years later without ever having it retested.\nThere are currently over 36,500,000 licence holders in the UK (based on 2009 DVLA figures) 1,317 of these are aged between 100 and 106. While all licence holders have a legal right to notify the DVLA of any changes to their health, there are no specific checks being done to maintain the standards required to pass the test.\nWith new style photocard licences requiring renewal every 10 years this gives us a perfect opportunity to ensure that standards are met. This should also be enforced by the compulsory updating of any paper licences currently held.",
