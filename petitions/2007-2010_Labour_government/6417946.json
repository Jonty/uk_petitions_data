            "action": "Amend taxation law and practice to allow the Chancellor of the Exchequer to impose variable tax rate(s) on income (income tax and corporation tax).",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Certain industries have customarily charged their customers a price based on a value not directly dependent on the income earner's efforts and which cannot be known at the time of agreement between provider and customer. While taxable entities in such industries pay tax at normal rates, the income base on which tax is paid may bear little or no relation to the efforts of the businesses concerned. Obvious examples are estate agencies in periods of house price inflation and asset managers basing their charges on a portfolio valuation. The customer can have no way of being able to fix the exact cost beforehand in such cases.\n\nThe intention is a) to allow the citizens of the country to benefit more fairly from asset inflation and b) to encourage more transparent competition in particular industries.\n\nThe Chancellor might in most years judge that the variation from the normal rate of income or corporation tax should be nil, but he/she would have a tool for encouraging transparency in pricing, which must in the long run be to the good of the economy. Thus the Chancellor might judge that such businesses be charged tax at, say, \"standard rate plus 2%\" in a particular tax year.",
