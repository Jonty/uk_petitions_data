We ask the PM to Openly State, that our heritage and traditions are based on the bible, and that no other religion can infringe, impede or replace our true Christian beliefs. People must understand, if you come to this country, Christianity is the religion we live by, not any other, if you want to imprint your religion on people, we suggest you go to a country that has a majority for that religion. This country is, and always will be based on the teachings of the bible.",
