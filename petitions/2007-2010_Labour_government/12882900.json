Gaming is one of the most popular past-times on the globe right now, and so I believe that there should be a area of the country (E.g a town or a village) where these gamers can come together and group as one.\n\nIf there was to be a gaming town or village, it should have an Internet exchance in the centre, in order for everybody to have a high speed Internet connection.\n\nThe likes of PC Gaming, Console Gaming, and other popular games such as WarHammer could come together and form an amazing community.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nLiam Withers",
