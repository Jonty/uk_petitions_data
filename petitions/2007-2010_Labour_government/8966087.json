If the couple are married, then few could argue that this ruling is adequate. \nHowever, is it fair for the deceased persons blood relatives, such as children & parents, to see their loved ones share of a property, go to their surviving partner, particularly if they were estranged from one another prior to death or if they had only been co-habiting for a short time?\nThere fore make Joint tenancy agreements   unavailable to non married couples in favour of the fairer 'Tenants in common' ruling.",
