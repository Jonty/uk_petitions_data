            "background": "Coventry is losing green space every single day, trees are being felled, hedges ripped out, wildlife (endangered species) all being destroyed for housing.  This is causing more flooding, the loss of bio-diversity, communities are being torn apart.  There is nowhere to go locally in a lot of areas.  You have to travel by car to enjoy a walk and wildlife.  This is all adding to car emissions and pollution.  This is not just happening in Coventry its all over England and we should all be working together to stop the destruction of our towns and cities before it is too late. Where are we all supposed to go in years to come when there is nothing left to enjoy.",
