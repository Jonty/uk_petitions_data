            "background": "It is clear that Britain has very little say in the decisionmaking process of the EU and that we are increasingly losingmuch of our national identity and traditions to Europeanfederalism.  This comes at a high cost to the UK taxpayer for increasinglylittle benefit. We need to tell our government that we want to leave the EU andtake control of our own political and economic destiny.  We have heard a lot of late about abuse of expenses proceduresby UK MEP's but this is likely to be the tip of the icebergwithin the EU. Already more and more of our large companies are foreign ownedand controlled and this is unlikely to lead to them beingmanaged for the benefit of UK citizens. It is bad enough tryingto hold UK politicians accountable for their actions, but howwill we even know where decisions affecting us are being madeif they are increasingly taken by faceless, self-interestedEuro bureaucrats?",
