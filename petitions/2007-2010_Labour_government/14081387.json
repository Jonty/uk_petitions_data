            "background": "UK libel law is currently facing criticism from across the legal and political spectrum.  Most recently lawyers at Carter Ruck tried to have restrictions - the so-called 'superinjunction' - placed on the reporting of a parliamentary debate concerning toxic dumping off the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by the raw materials company, Trafigura.  In the United States, state legislatures have enacted laws making English libel awards unenforceable in American courts.\n\nThat a nation such as the United States feels compelled to protect its citizens from English libel law is shaming to us all.  Reform is urgently required.",
