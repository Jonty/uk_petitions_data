            "background": "The lack of diversity in subjects relating to life beyond school is causing children to be un-appreciative of others, the impacts on their own lives, and the advantage that having independence can lead to. Making it compulsory for children to be taught subjects such as cooking/nutrition, the impact of drugs/alcohol/smoking both physically and mentally, sex education and respect for others, will mean that going into later life the children will be more appreciative of what they are to encounter beyond school education.",
