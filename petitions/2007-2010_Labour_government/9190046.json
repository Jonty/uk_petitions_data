You have made up massive amounts of taxes of late including emmissions on ROAD TAX. Why emmissions??? It's for use on roads and road building isn't itnot for pollution, after all it isn't polution tax... Airport tax and fuel tax are more that have come into force but other coutries aren't following suit. WHY?? Becasue these are subsidising tax cuts and funding of immigrants in this country.",
