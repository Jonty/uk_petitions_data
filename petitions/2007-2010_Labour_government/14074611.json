        "background": "Stop landlords discriminating against children. Landlords routinely specify no DSS, smokers, pets or children. Children are valuable and full members of society and need a secure home. The law should not allow private landlord to make providing this more difficult. Other minority groups are protected by anti discrimination legislation with regard to housing and children should be afforded the same rights.",
