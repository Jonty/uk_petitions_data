        "background": "We need to start building power infrastructure for the next generation that doesn't rely on carbon or nuclear based fuels.  Wind power is the most easily accessible alternative at the moment.  The government should make into law that wind turbines and wind farms can be built in any suitable location (provided that it is a sensible distance from any residence)where wind energy can be harvested at a reasonable cost.  \nLocal opposition to wind schemes so far have halted a lot of the wind farms in Britain being built meaning that at the rate we are going when gas, oil and coal become un-viable options we will have nothing to rely on to provide meaningful amounts of power to the country.",
