            "background": "The government / council should charge people who make unsubstantiated / unfounded minor complaints (such as a dog barking) at least \u00a375. This fee would be refunded if the complaint was found to be real. However, if the individual was found to have made the complaint up; the fee would be kept. This could save the taxpayer a substantial amount as the costs of investigating false complaints would be recovered such as admin and personnel costs. It would also be a deterrent to those making false complaints.",
