        "background": "Professor David Nutt was asked to resign his position as chair of the Independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, because Professor Nutt's views differ from government policy.  The home secretary became concerned that the discrepancy between Professor Nutt's views and his own would be 'confusing' to the public.\n\nScientists should be allowed to freely and publicly debate scientific issues without interference from government.  Potential public confusion should never be a reason to stifle debate.",
