            "background": "At present, UK military personnel are being disadvantaged by not being able to be part of the Cycle To Work Scheme. MOD personnel are actively encouraged to take part in this scheme but this does not cover military personnel. Military personnel are expected to keep up high levels of fitness and one way of doing so is by cycling. Many military Units have limited car parking spaces and Commanders are encouraging personnel to cycle to work. Active participation for military personnel within this Cycle To Work Scheme would enhance personal fitness, cut down on emmissions and reduce traffic activity.",
