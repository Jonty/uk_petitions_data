            "background": "East Leake Leisure Centre was built in 2003 under a PFI agreement with contractor McAlpine which agreed to run the facility at \u00a3352,000 a year. \n\nCarillion took over management in February 2008 and has asked for an extra \u00a3285,000 a year to run it. \n\nThe council are unhappy about giving Carilion the extra money and are now considering allowing them to \"mothball\" our leisure centre, at a cost to us (the council tax payers!) of \u00a3352,000 per annum for the next 19 years.\n\nThe leisure centre is the backbone of our community and plays a key role in keeping the 7,000 residents of East Leake fit and healthy. Many local schools use the facilities with their pupils every day, along with local organisations. \n\nThe closure of the leisure centre would be a huge loss to all the community, especially the children who enjoy the many fantastic activities there so much.",
