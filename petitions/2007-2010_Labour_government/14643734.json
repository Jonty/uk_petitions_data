            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This is based on two fundamental statements. Firstly it is not a human right to have children, it is a personal choice. Secondly world overpopulation has led to almost all major problems we are faced with today e.g.; Global Warming, Food and water shortages, Child Poverty. Therefore it is ethically and morally wrong for any government to encourage any citizen to have children with the promise that public financial funds be used to pay for them. This is a possibly world changing ideology that hands back complete responsibility to potential parents for their child's life. In my opinion it would be equally unfair to make this retrospective.",
