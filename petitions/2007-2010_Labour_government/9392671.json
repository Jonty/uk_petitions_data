            "background": "The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (HFEB) is due to pass\nthrough the House of Commons soon.\n\nThe media has said that Clause 14(4)(9) of the Bill would allow people\nto create \"designer deaf or disabled babies\", but it would not.  It\nwould let people create designer HEARING babies.\n\nThis is because if a couple who are going through IVF have a test to\nsee whether their embryos are deaf or hearing, if there is a mixture\nof deaf and hearing embryos, Clause 14(4)(9) would FORCE them to\nreject the deaf embryos.\n\nThis is clearly a form of EUGENICS.  Forcing parents to reject some\nembryos over others has no place in a democratic society.\n\nClause 14(4)(9) creates a situation whereby, in law, the life of a\nDeaf person becomes of lesser worth than that of a hearing person,\ndespite the Government's aim for a more equal society, through the new\nCommission for Equality and Human Rights.\n\nWe the undersigned therefore call on the Houses of Parliament to fully\ndrop Clause 14(4)(9) of the HFEB.",
