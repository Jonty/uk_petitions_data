        "background": "Get rid of the corrupt & crooked bbc & the tv licence, It is not fair, if u r poor & r on benefits or disabled yet u still have 2 find money for a tv licence & then all u get is harrassment all of the time, which in any other company would b ruled as totally ilegal. I am sick 2 death of this, y should I pay 4 tv channels I never watch, & what right has the bbc to tell me I can't watch any other channels. The bbc is greedy & needs 2b paid 4 by other means, not by the public who r being ripped off by the bbc 4 posh hotels & massive wages etc while we struggle 2 survive, if the bbc want 2 charge people charge people overseas 4 the world service & axe bbc news24 as it is a waste of money. I won't pay 4 totally biased tv that have religious crap on etc, These channels ra total waste of money. Also is time 4 the bbc 2 tell the complete truth about everything but they never will, this is totally out of order & has 2b brought into line.",
