            "background": "BT have been removing public call boxes and/or disconnecting them from many locations, and have also removed the ability to use coins in those that remain in service.\nThe cited reasons for this are typically \"everyone has mobiles\", \"everyone has landlines\" and \"everyone has credit cards\".  I have both a mobile and a credit card, but in many rural areas there is not sufficiently good mobile coverage to be able to rely on a mobile phone (or the phone battery could be flat).  Nor does everyone have a credit card, whereas most people have a few coins in their purse or pocket.  As for the landline, I have one of those too - but that's at home, which is exactly where I wouldn't be if trying to find a public call box because for one reason or another I couldn't use a mobile.  Also, the landline could be out of order, and I might want to use a public phone to report it.\nFor all these reasons, it would be better if public phones, with the ability to use coins, remain in service.",
