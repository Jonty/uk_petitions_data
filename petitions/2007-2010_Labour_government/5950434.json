        "background": "I consider myself to be a GOOD human being. I have worked hard since I left school, served my country for 22 years in the Army but now find myself having to break the law every day just to survive and try to enjoy a normal life.  Yep I break the law, I break the speed limit in my van every day just to get my job done to earn a wage and now, I smoke in the entrance way to my local club (closed on 3 sides) when it is raining. Please help me to be a law abiding citizen and wake up you politicians - it's hard out here.  The working man is finding it difficult to comply and we need you to listen before it gets too late.",
