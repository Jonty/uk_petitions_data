            "background": "There is massive disappointment at the decision of the LSC to only fund 13 college building programmes, despite the written assurances on 144. Rather than leave Mark Haysom to take the flak, a public inquiry would ensure that all the college Principals, staff and governors and the contracted builders of colleges would get to know the names of the LSC staff who lead to this collosal failure of the administration of public funds. We would then also know if these people were being given jobs in the Skills Funding Agency.",
