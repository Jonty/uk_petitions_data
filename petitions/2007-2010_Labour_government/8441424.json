        "background": "With the revelation that married couple Members of Parliament are entitled to claim all the allowances they would be entitled to as a single member of parliament this means that some members of parliament are being handed bucketsful of taxpayer pounds merely to place it into their future enrichment fund.  Using those allowances for anything other than the purposes for which they are issued is fraud and therefore they should all be liable to income tax on the sums involved.",
