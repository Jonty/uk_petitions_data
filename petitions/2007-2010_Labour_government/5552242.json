            "background": "Children in the care system end up with a really bad life. They often end up in drink, drugs and alcohol, and other sorts of anti social behaviour. Children and young people in the care system have to live with the bare minimum, most have all of their posesions in a plastic bag. \nThis needs to change. People in care have escaped all kinds of abuse, neglect, etc, and end up with a situation not much better.\nWe need to make a better life for them, they are the future of Britain.\nWe need to publicise this as much as possible, so people are aware of it. Money needs to be spent to make life better, less money spent on prisoners.",
