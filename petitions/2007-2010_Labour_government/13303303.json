        "background": "OAPs, in particular have suffered lately with interest rates on savings falling and no way to increase income to meet ever increasing stealth taxes. Borrowers have benefitted with reduced interest rates, whilst pensioners with savings have suffered a serious drop in disposable income. All current pensioners helped rebuild this country after WW2 to it's present greatness. Surely a little compassion in relation to taxes for British OAPs is justifiable, particularly when comparing British pensioners benefits against those of continental Europe.",
