            "background": "'People'. There is a 'grey area' in law that stops enforcement of the disgraceful, heartless and morally corrupt, who steal donations from outside charity shops. There are some who make a good living in depriving the needy of funds that help or change lives. Only people like you, who feel the same as i do can get the law changes that will allow the CPS and Police to act on this nationwide scourge, so i urge you in the name of the charity in which you support, be it a hospice, foreign aid, disabled etc to sign this petition. \nMany thanks, Jel.",
