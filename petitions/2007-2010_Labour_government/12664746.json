            "background": "This system will be used to allow the minimal members of parliament to govern based on the majority of submitted eligible counted votes.  This will eliminate the need for so many members of parliament, eliminating massive expenses along with the elimination of the potential for the remaining members to abuse their positions and the infliction of their sole opinions.  Thereby, passing the power to the people for a true and fair democracy where each and every voice of each and every legally registered citizen can finally be heard.  \n\n \n\nThe current form of government is simply outdated and clearly a stepping stone to an abuse of power, it is time to stop, take a look around, truly embrace the electronic age, and finally accept that we are the many who should no longer be represented by the few.",
