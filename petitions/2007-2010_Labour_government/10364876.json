            "background": "Too many pieces of equipment are disposed of every day by dental surgeries across the country. The department of health states that \"where instrments are difficult to clean, consideration should be given to replacing them with single use instruments where possible to do so\".\nOf course there are some things that cannot be reused, but the use of disposable 3 in 1 tips, aspirator tips and plastic tray liners is completely unecessary and irresponsible. All plastic tray liners and dsiposable aspirator and 3 in 1 tips should be outlawed and replaced with autoclavable versions and paper tray liners.",
