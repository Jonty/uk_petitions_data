            "background": "Considering that there is no Severn crossing between Gloucester and Chepstow, we think there should be another crossing the river between Lydney and Gloucester, as at present people from the forest of Dean you have to drive 50 miles to reach the opposite side of the river, also there is no alternative access to Gloucester, so having another link to the city and surrounding areas should ease congestion and reduce problems when disasters such as flooding and traffic accidents happen",
