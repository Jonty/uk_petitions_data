            "background": "The needs and rights of disabled parents are currently unrecognised by legislation, social care practice and benefit provision. The additional costs of raising children as a disabled parent is not accounted for with Disability Living Allowance or Child Tax Credits. Although the government suggests that disabled parents are supported by adult social services this is rarely the case in practice with little form of redress. Children's centres reguarly make specialist provision for disabled children and yet there is no provision or respite available for disabled parents.\n\nThe government needs to create robust guidelines and legislation that supports disabled parents on a financial and social care basis. The Children of disabled parents can no longer be expected to live in poverty and isolation in this hidden family underclass.",
