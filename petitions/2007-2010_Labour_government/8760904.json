They insist I have agreed by way of verbal contract to back their campaign when I most definately have not. All these people are, are bare faced liars who live in hope that when they threaten with legal action that really and truly they cant back up, that people will just pay up. They give real charities a bad name. It has to stop and it has to stop now.",
