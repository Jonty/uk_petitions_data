Please support the adoption of global sustainability standards for biofuels. These standards must ensure that biofuels do not undermine food security or cause more carbon emissions than they prevent. Some biofuels are good, others are a disaster--and our policies must tell the difference between the two.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHans",
