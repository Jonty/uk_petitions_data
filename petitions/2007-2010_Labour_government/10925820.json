            "background": "The connection from Grantown south to Broomhill and Aviemore is due to be opened in 2009. A restored Grantown-Forres line would complete the link from Forres to the mainline at Aviemore. It would bring employment to the area, ease road congestion and give the region's tourist trade and economy a much-needed boost!\n\nThe Forres-Grantown route is 99% intact and it would be relatively straightforward to relay the track.\n\nOn behalf of the all the communities between Forres and Aviemore who would benefit immeasurably from a restored rail service, I ask for the Forres-Grantown line to be re-opened.",
