        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why should the bus service be extended? 1)The limited amount of people using the bus (1-2 each trip) leads to a waste of     resources, as if the service was extended more people would be able to use the bus. 2) Young children have difficulty walking from school as there are so many hills to climb, whom cannot be carried or are too big to be put in pushchairs. 3) Commuters would benefit from taking the bus to-and-from the Addington  village tram stop in on the way to-and-from work. 4)Those with  physical disabilities would benefit from an extended bus service, where having to walk distances would cause pain.5)  Council tax payers deserve to \u2018make progress\u2019 with satisfactory  public transport provisions. There is a varied population of  residents living in Monks Hill, and it should NOT be mandatory  to have to drive a car, to be able to get about.6) Single females needing to get home via unlit \u2018Conker alley\u2019 from Gravel hill tram stop are targets to be attacked at night.",
