            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Judy Dyble was the original lead singer of UK electric folk legends Fairport Convention. She left the band after recording the first (and many say) best album, and has suffered from 40 years of unfair speculation over her leaving. She went on to form 2 other legendary and significant bands, and after 3 decades away, returns in 2009 with a contemporary album. Fairport manager at the time, Joe Boyd is organising a re-union gig for an early version of Fairport in July 2009, and ludicrously, has not included Dyble in the line up. This petition is to implore him to do the right, and proper thing, and re-instate Dyble to her proper position, as the original and definitive Fairport vocalist, if only for this one night.",
