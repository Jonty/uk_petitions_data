            "background": "The government should not stop patients collecting their medicines from their own GP dispensary. The current white paper reviewing dispensing arrangements could have a serious effect on dispensing practices in rural areas by preventing any practice dispensing if the main surgery is located within a mile of a chemist. This may make sense in an urban context, but once again the government appears ignorant of rural practicalities, in particular, the lack of public transport, especially for the most vulnerable members of the community. The loss of GP dispensing would be very disadvantageous to patients who live in villages, especially where there are branch surgeries. We wish the government to continue to allow patient choice in this matter.",
