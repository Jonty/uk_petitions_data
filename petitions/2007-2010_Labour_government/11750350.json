            "background": "The recent news reports have made it evident that the company concerned at the immingham oil refinery has clearly breached european law. They have discriminated against british workers by not allowing them to apply for the jobs on offer on british soil.It is abundantly clear that the company concerned took a view that they would only employ 'non british domiciles',and i further petion the UK Government to seek an injunction against this illegal practice.I have chosen the short name for the petition because this prime minister has failed to secure eu rights for the electorate.",
