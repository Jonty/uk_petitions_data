            "background": "Americas foreign policy mirrors Israels war crimes - disrespect for the UN,international law, human rights, torture, kidnap, (rendition) atrocities committed on civilians in Palestine and Iraq. Israel is an apartheid nation, violating 450 UN resolutions and starving, defenceless families held in the Gaza concentration camp. International pressure and the free press stop Gaza becoming an Israeli extermination camp. This petition calls on Prime Minister Brown to help create a global Marshall plan for Palestine, demand that Israel stop her invasion and withdraws her powerful army back inside Israels internationally recognised,  legal 1967 borders and gives immediate aid to the starving and sick in Gaza.",
