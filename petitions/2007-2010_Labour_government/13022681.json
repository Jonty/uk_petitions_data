        "background": "My daughter was involved in a road accident, Dec 4th 08 near our home, was hit by a car from behind her, overtaken & sideswiped. \n\nVarying statements of have reached the magistrates crt.\n\nPhotos of damage to the cars shows the discrepancies in statements. Legal cost of \u00a35k to fight the case is unaffordable.\n\nDue to health & finances we are close to losing our home & more. \n\nMy daughter has never dealt with a court case before but I am able as I have presented specifics in the past to legal groups. I have spent many hours preparing notes but the court have advised that I am not allowed to represent my daughter.\n\nThis is unfair to anyone who cannot afford a legal team & discriminates my abilities to that of a paid legal.\n\nBeing her father is irrelevent, it is about being able to present the facts clearly to illustrate the pattern of events for all to make a fair & final judgement.\n\nThe case is due in Glouc Mag-Crt, 17th Aug to discuss the statements etc, the main hearing is 11th Sept 09.\n\nShe is accused of driving without due care & attention, she was driving in the correct position & the leading vehicle.  \n\nPlease can you look at human rights on this point.\n\n\nGraham Jackson",
