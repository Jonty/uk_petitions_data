            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "AOL today reports \" The price of a first-class stamp is to increase by 2p to 36p from next April, while second-class stamps will go up by 3p to 27p, the Royal Mail has announced\". The postal organisation said stamp prices will still be among the lowest in Europe even after the increases come into effect. The justification for this action is that \"Stamped mail makes a loss of around 6p per letter or packet - a total of \u00a3178 million last year - and it will continue to be loss-making, said the Royal Mail\". The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to inquire how the exchequer could better facilitate cheap postage - surely the closure of post offices is saving money ? The UK government would do well to examine the proliferation of junk mail and the costs of printing, P  & P of innumerable catalogues being distributed - what a waste !! The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to examine how professionals, like myself, can be better supported financially to \ncover (albeit reduced) costs through speed mail and design a commercial policy that supports the public sector -do you think we are some kind of charity ???",
