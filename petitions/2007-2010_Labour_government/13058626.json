            "background": "Knives to a lot of the younger generation are necessary for there own 'protection'.  That is at least the way they see it. Remove the threat of knives, you should remove the need to carry them.  The easiest way to detect if people are carrying them would be to have RFID tags embeded within them.  The cost should be next to nothing and in no way should affect the look or handling of the knive.  Entrances to Pubs,clubs, shops, puplic places could have machines to detect these tags and sound a warning. The technology already exists. I believe this already happens to certain surgical implements and most shops themselves have the machines to pick up RFID tags when walking out of the shop with an unpaid Tv! It wouldnt happen overnight,but at least would be a step forward.",
