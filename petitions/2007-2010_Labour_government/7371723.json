            "background": "The British fishing industry is in crisis. Fish stocks are depleting. So the EU came up with the quota system, limiting the amount of fish caught to help levels recover. But as with all EU plans its a complete and utter faliure. British fishermen are forced to throw away millions of dead fish into the sea to meet the tonnage quota, meanwhile The EU grants France almost 79% of the Total Allowable Catch of Cod in the Channel, while British fishermen are left to fight over a mere 7%. The British fishing industry has to be saved.",
