        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We aim to have law taught as a compulsory subject to students in early secondary education. We believe that if young people are taught the basics of law at an early age the amount of crimes commited by youths would be reduced dramatically. At the moment, young people are currently forced to guess the laws and rely on rumors to tell them what is right and wrong within the law. If young people are taught law in school, not only would they know enough to think twice about commiting crimes, but they would also carry this knowledge through to adult life.",
