If it is reasonable to subject all claimants, including the sick and disabled, to lie detector tests in order to protect the public purse then it must be reasonable to use the same precautions against MPs.  Alternatively, lie detectors \u2013 whose reliability has been repeatedly challenged by academics - should cease to be used by the state on any citizens.",
