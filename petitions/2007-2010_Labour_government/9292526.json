        "background": "The Bank of England is intending to lend \u00a350 billion of taxpayers money to 'free up the mortgage market'.  This is money that could be used for education, health, security, and other vital services.  The planned use will do nothing to benefit the majority of the population, but appear to merely bolster the profits of already wealthy bankers and property investors.  As there has been no actual reduction in house prices, and any future reduction will benefit more people than it harms, there is no justification for this action.",
