            "background": "The people of Austria have put forward a similar petition in light of their recent poor performances in friendly matches building up to the Euro 2008 championship based in their home country and Switzerland. The idea being that they should prevent their team embarrassing themselves in front of the whole of Europe.\n\nGiven the England national teams recent disgraceful performance in the Euro qualifiers (losing at home to a Croatian team with nothing to play for, drawing at home to Macedonia) we feel that it is for the good of country to withdraw from the World Cup qualifiers, which start next year. The manor in which the national football team were unable to qualify for the Euros was a national embarrassment and shouldn't be allowed to be repeated.\n\nAs our friends in Austria would say, England zeigt Ruckgrat or England, stop being spineless",
