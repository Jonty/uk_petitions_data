            "background": "I have already suggested that there be an IPCO (Incompetent Parent Control Order) once, but it fell on deaf government ears, so now perhaps the government would like to listen as a result of yet more youngsters who are under the influence of parents who have little or no parenting skills. Two children have been detained on Friday the 22nd January 2010 due to parental failings. Do not let children suffer as a result of parents without skills, the government can make legislation other than Parenting Orders and ASBO\u2019s which are unfair to children, with an Incompetent Parent Control Order (IPCO) which will be aimed at making parents fully responsible and liable for their siblings.",
