            "background": "The EU \"E-Business Directive\" (Council Directive 2002/38/EC) came into effect on 1st July 2003.\n\nThis directive forces ANYONE (whether a member of the EU or not) to collect VAT on certain electronically (internet) delivered services  such as\n    *  supply of websites or web-hosting services\n    * downloaded software (including updates of software)\n    * downloaded images, text or information, including making databases available\n    * digitised books or other electronic publications\n    * downloaded music, films or games\n    * electronic auctions or\n    * internet service packages.\n\nNon member countries do not benefit from the VAT. The EU should also have no say in forcing whether a country should charge vat if they are not in the EU.\nThis is likely to result in many services being made unavailable to the EU, or a tit for tat reaction in which non member countries start forcing the EU to charge whatever fees they wish for sales to their non member country.\n\nThe EU should not be allowed to force how foreign business operates.",
