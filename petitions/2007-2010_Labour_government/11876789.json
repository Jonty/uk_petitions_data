        "background": "In my experience as a patient of the Mental Health System in recent years, large numbers of psychiatric patients are being detained in psychiatric secure units quite unnecessarily for months, if not years.  There are safeguards, but these safeguards are not working well enough.  This matter needs to be fully investigated and addressed.  The safeguards must be made to work satisfactorily.",
