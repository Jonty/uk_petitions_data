        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "After the recent revelations about the substantial losses made by banks and the Government having to bail out the losses made by the Banks in the UK, we feel that it is deplorable that the Senior Executives and Board Members of the Banks still receive Bonuses and Pension Payments that they should not be entitled to as they have been the cause of the failure of these Institutions to secure their Businesses.\n\nThe facts that are revealed almost daily in the media of failed Bank Bosses walking away with sums of money in excess of \u00a3500,000 from a business that has made substancial losses is a kick in the teeth to the general public who have placed their money and their trust in these organisations.\n\nIn most other companies failure to do a job properly would be met with dismisal and very little in the way of remuneration.\n\nWe apply to the Government to force these institutions to halt payments to any Senior Executive or Board Member of a failed Banking institution, whose Salary is above \u00a3100,00 per annum.",
