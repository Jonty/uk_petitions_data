            "background": "Recently the government have been targeting younger drivers, but the older drivers ALSO cause problems. The older generation think they know better than everyone else and this puts everyone at danger. They speed, overtake dangerously and have caused deaths by their reckless driving and they should not get away with it. Why should an elderly person with partial blindness be able to drive when everyone else cannot after 1 unit of alcohol? It isn\u2019t just the younger drivers causing accidents and many people will agree that older drivers put the public at risk because they think they know better than everyone else; taking risks many drivers wouldn\u2019t and end up endangering the public. The license should be re-tested at an earlier age of 55 as many 55+ drivers are causing danger to the public and themselves. It really isn\u2019t just the younger drivers that need targeting, the elderly need to be targeted too.",
