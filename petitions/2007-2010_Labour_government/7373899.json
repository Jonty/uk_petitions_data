            "background": "All too often single fathers whom are raising their children without the support of family or local authorities are being sexually discriminated against by local agencies, courts, authorities and public providers because the law on lone parents is not specific and insufficient information is available to support that there are good men out there raising their children quite well. The law must be updated, legislation must include fathers actively involved in the family role and give equal consideration in public assistance and general support.",
