This is clearly oustide of the proper use of the e-petitions website. A good way of ensuring that only genuine names are entered would be to force the entry of the signatory's electoral roll number and registered voting name at the submitted address when signing an e-petition. A person's name will only appear on an e-petition signatory list after it has been checked against the electoral roll and confirmed as genuine.",
