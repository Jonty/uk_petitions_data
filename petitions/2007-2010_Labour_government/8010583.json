Nothing will be done to apprehend the driver if the number plate can not be acknowledged by number plate recognition systems.\n\nForeign drivers buy their fuel abroad contribute nothing to the British economy, their knowledge of Britains roads is limited. They are recognised as a menace to British roads by every police force in the uk and yet the prosecution rates for these drivers are not available.\n\nInternational Licenses are not treated as inferior to British Licenses because it is accepted we must be multi-cultural and respect there are differences. These differences are costing lives we should not be accepting the differences but challenging why this has not been investigated.",
