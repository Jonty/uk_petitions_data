            "background": "The major part of the transport system in this country is buses, of these bus industries few if any are state owned. We ask the prime minister to create a national bus service that will encompass the whole of Britain. Espeically small vilage areas which have limited bus services. A prime example being Ireby in Cumbria. Three buses come a week to a small but largely senior population most of whom are lossing the ability to drive due to slower reactions. We believe that creating this bus service will:\n1) Cut down Carbon Dioxide emmissions\n2) Lower accident rates due to poor drivers on country roads.\n3) Allow students to travel in a reasonable amount of time from A to B.",
