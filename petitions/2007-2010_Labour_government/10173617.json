        "background": "Every Friday and Saturday night we have pandemonium caused outside our house by young people on their way home from town. They shout abuse, peppered with nasty expletives, and vandalize cars, and damage property.\nYoung children, working parents and elderly people are awoken and driven stir crazy, yet no tough measures are ever taken against this difficult section of our society.\nWe need to punish people who behave in this way and make sure it is tough enough to ensure they respect others and the law in the future.\nPeople constantly causing this kind of trouble should be imprisoned and made to undertake some kind of educational training dealing with the issue of how to fit into society and interact in a harmonious fashion with other people.\nThey should also be banned from drinking in public places, to include bars, nightclubs and restaurants until they have proved, over a significantly appropriate amount of time, that they are responsible enough to manage their behaviour when they have taken alcoholic drinks.\nI feel this is imperative as we have no proper system of dealing with this behaviour in our society and re-introducing respect for others.",
