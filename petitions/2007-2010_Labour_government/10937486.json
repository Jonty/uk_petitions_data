        "background": "it would be a much needed rethink if the government would Allow a pregnant wife or (already) mother the support of her non-eu husband OR to allow the NON-EU wife to be able to reside with her UK husband with children or if she is pregnant. although we should be allowed a right to family life regardless of children or not, when there is children involved things just get harder to cope with. Let us UK citizens enjoy our marriage to NON-EU citizens without the hurdle of applying for the pointless expensive spouse visa...2 years of marriage should be sufficient evidence to decide if the marriage is subsiding or not.",
