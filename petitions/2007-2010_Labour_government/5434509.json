            "background": "I  am concerned that a former British Leader, should get away with war crimes, 800 thousand people have lost their lives and 4 million been turned into refugees and a Country distroyed by crime and violence by Tony Blair, G Bush had nothing to do with his decision he was asked by Bush to keep out and he said he wants to be a major part of this crime and he should stand charges for his part in this heinous crime.  The fact that this War criminal now wants to be a peace envior seem the most disturbing of all. He wants a job for life peace is not in Tony Blair's interest as it would put him out of work, he is not interested in peace, if he was he would have called for a cease fire in the Lebanon war, which is another country in the Middle East he has had a hand in turning into a total mess.   Tony Blair is the Greatest desaster in British  Politics.",
