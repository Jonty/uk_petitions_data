            "background": "Student finance should be available to all students.  Students should not be discriminated against, for the purposes of student fee loans, due to \"excessive prior education\".\n\nWhile we understand the need to stop \"career\" students, it is unfair to disallow students a loan, because they have undertaken a higher education course in the past.  Sometimes over 15 years previously.\n\nThis will encourage more mature students to return to education, benefitting the economy and country as a whole.",
