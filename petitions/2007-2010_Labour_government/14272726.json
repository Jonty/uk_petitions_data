        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Persons who apply for jobs that require enhanced CRB disclosure will show up cautions for offences, that are sometimes irrelevant to the position in questions. The shortlisting officer may in this case refuse to shortlist or offer a position on these grounds. I believe with exception to cases of sexual/violence/against children - that all cautionable offences should be stepped down a year after their occurence if it is a first time offence, and the offender is deemed to be on the route to recovery. If the police were to retain the record on the Police National Computer it should still not be available to the CRB, or external agencies e.t.c. unless it is a crime of an extreme nature (outlined earlier). The undersigned also reccomend a reconsideration of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act to also to prevent discrimination of job candidates where the offence is not directly relevant to the position in question.",
