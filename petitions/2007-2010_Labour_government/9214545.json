            "background": "Isp virgin media's Ceo said recently that the company had begun plans to negotiate contracts with content providers to provide provide faster access to the networks and to relegate everyone else to a lower tier of speed. I believe that this is forcing people to pay twice for bandwidth. once by the consumer and once by the content provider. by doing this isp's may slow down smaller companies network access  and make sure only large multinationals have access to faster lanes. Network neutrality ensures that all data regardless of where it comes from it is treated the same. By doing this Isps will be violating the very principals that made the internet successful and such a fantastic platform for free and open discussion and commerce.",
