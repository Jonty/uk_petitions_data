            "background": "It is a disgrace that the biggest landowners and richest family in Britain come cap in hand for an increase in their annual allowance, when every other family in Britain is having to make cutbacks in the current economic climate. Their past record of abusing their status by taking helicopters to play golf , or visit girlfriends, shows their total disregard for prudence. They should be encouraged to fund any increases that they deem necessary by cutting down on foreign trips, or selling off some of their land and estates, or paintings, jewels or other possessions.",
