        "action": "reject the Royal Family's request for an increase in their annual funding, and urge them to cut back on their foreign trips, use of the RAF for golf trips etc., or otherwise to sell off some of their paintings, jewels or estates to fund their activities.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is a disgrace that the biggest landowners and richest family in Britain come cap in hand for an increase in their annual allowance, when every other family in Britain is having to make cutbacks in the current economic climate. Their past record of abusing their status by taking helicopters to play golf , or visit girlfriends, shows their total disregard for prudence. They should be encouraged to fund any increases that they deem necessary by cutting down on foreign trips, or selling off some of their land and estates, or paintings, jewels or other possessions.",
