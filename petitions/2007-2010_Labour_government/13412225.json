        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Stephen Timms, Labour's appointed Digital Britain minister has stated that he will push for 50p per month \"Broadband Tax\" to be levied against everyone with a \"fixed telephone line\".  This will form part of the Finance Bill due to be presented to parliment during November.  We object on the basis that we already pay our Telecoms Providers and Internet Service Providers for the privilege; as such they are responsible for competitively improving their networks.  Also that \"fixed telephone line\" could in future be expanded to mean any communications method that transmits voice conversations from a fixed point. And that this is another tax on our already overburdoned personal finances at a time when people need to save money.",
