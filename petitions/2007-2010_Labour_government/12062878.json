            "background": "As a person recently declared bankrupt and sticking within my budget which allows me to try save money for car maintenance and road tax and other essential expenses - I am stuck with nowhere to deposit this money except under the mattress. The reason - because a person who is bankrupt is not allowed to open a savings account because they fail the credit check! Why do you need credit checked to open a savings account? Even though I am bankrupt, it does not mean that I do not need to save money for essential expenses each month. There is no element of risk to a bank in opening a basic savings account for a bankrupt person, we get basic bank accounts so why not a basic savings account too?",
