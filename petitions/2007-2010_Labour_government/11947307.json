            "background": "We are creating this petition in order to stop the sale/distribution of fur in the UK. Fur farming is a cruel practice in which the animals involved suffer great deals of physical and psychological pain. Fur farming is banned in the UK yet fur is still being sold in stores such as Harrods. The practice has been recognised for its cruelty, we propose that we distance ourselves even further by making the sale of animal fur in the UK illegal.",
