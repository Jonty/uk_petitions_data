        "background": "Some bus companies' last buses to certain areas is 6:30pm. As more people are working outside the traditional 9-5, the buses do not run with some people's work hours. Plus people living in these areas cannot enjoy a night out without paying \u00a320+ for a taxi home. Also with more people working Sundays, the earliest bus can be 9am, which is too late for many Sunday workers. People who are looking for work are turning down jobs when they find out the working hours don't match their bus timetable hours. Moving home is a cost which some people cannot afford. Bus companies will make more money with this.",
