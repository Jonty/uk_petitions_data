            "background": "I am starting a campaign for parents who have had their children taken off them and deemed unfit, to be given every chance available to them (at the goverments cost) to prove they are fit and well. This includes any assessments both of parenting and mental/pyhsical health. This should be given no matter what the circumstances, or history. Every parent has the right to prove they can be a good parent and not to be told otherwise unless it can be proven without a single doubt.",
