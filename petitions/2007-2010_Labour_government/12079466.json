            "background": "I have taken students from all over the world, aged fron 8 years to adults,for the past few years,to live at my house while they study English at a language school, they stay from one week to six months, what shocked me was I did not need a CRB, nor anyone living at my address, as far as I know no one in the town has had to supply one. A single man with a Police record or child abuser would be able to have access to a child who is a long way from home and unable to speak English well. I rang Ed Balls dpt and was told that all host famalies must be CRB checked but both the British council and English uk say they do not, I was told it was down to the language schools?? I worry that this loophole will have been spotted by child abusers and surely all chilren should have the same protection when visiting this country, as ours have. I hope you will sign this as you are my last hope I have contacted everyone inc Jack Straw and got nowhere. Thank you.",
