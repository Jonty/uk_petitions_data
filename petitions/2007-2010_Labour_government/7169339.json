        "background": "how often do we hear of serious crimes such as murder, committed by mentally ill people who`s care in the community has not been followed up from hospital discharge. all too often. i write this petition to change the mental health act, for people who refuse their ongoing treatment (ie. taking medication) after being discharged from psychiatric hospital, living in the community. from 23 years of suffering mental health problems, i am grateful that my illness wasnt as severe as some cases, avoiding serious harm or death to myself or anyone else. however, there are alot of cases which, if the mental health act was toughened up for those serious cases who do not comply with their medication regeme, alot of the serious crimes could be avoided...preventing loss of life and much regret. im talking from experience and not from a text book. please sign this petition, it is for everyone to benefit.",
