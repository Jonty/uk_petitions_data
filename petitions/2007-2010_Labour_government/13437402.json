            "background": "Prime Minister Brown, after the demonstrations that followed elections in Iran, declared it is up to the people of Iran to determine who governs their country.\n\nOne of the objectives of our troops in Afghanistan was to enable free and fair elections to take place.\n\nIn Iraq we have been helping to introduce democratic elections.\n\nYet Prime Minister Brown has never been elected by the people to be our Prime Minister.\n\nBrown has refused a referendum on the Treaty Of Lisbon, to which his party committed in its manifesto.\n\nThere has been little parliamentary debate re the billions he has committed to salvage the country from his current mess. \n\nBrown is not a democratically elected Prime Minister; he is self-appointed dictator, consistently denying the people of Great Britain our right to elect our leader.\n \nWe the undersigned demand our democratic right for a free and immediate general election, so we can decide whom we believe to be the right man for the job to lead this once-great country.",
