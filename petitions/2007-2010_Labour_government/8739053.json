            "background": "The UK Government should urge the South African Government to stop the culling of Elephants in May this year, as this will encourage poaching, trophy hunting and exploitation and corruption through the sale of ivory. Legitimate culling is possible via contraception, culling will involve the whole slaughter of herds to \"stop the trauma of orphaned elephants\". This will harm general elephant health by reducing the gene pool.",
