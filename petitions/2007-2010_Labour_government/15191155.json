            "background": "This intensive 'farming' will involve up to 9000 cows living in sheds like battery hens and being milked three times a day.\nThe cows will only go outside for a short period or the year when they are not producing milk.\n\nConcerns for this system:\n- Animal cruelty - all farmed animals should have access to the sun and outdoors on a daily basis\n- Destruction of the local area - up to 60 lorry movements a day onto the local B road\n- Thousands of unwanted calves separated from their mothers very young and transported away at three weeks old\n- Damage to the UK dairy industry - other smaller producers who care for their animals and the environment being put out of business\n\nThis is a huge backwards step for british farming!!!  We would rather pay a little more for our milk and have it produced in an ethical way!",
