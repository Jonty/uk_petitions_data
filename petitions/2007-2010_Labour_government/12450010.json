            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In recent years a number of countries, including the USA and several EU Nations, have introduced special schools for educating LGBT youths who find life in normal state schools difficult.\n\nThe LGBT community in England has, as a vast majority, spoken against the introduction of this act, due to the way that it promotes the segregation, not just of gay/lesbian students from \"straight\" students, but of any child who appears to be different from their peers.\n\nThe LGBT community has fought for decades to be classed as a normal part of society, and to be accepted by heterosexuals as being normal human beings. To introduce LGBT schools would be an insult to the years of hard work that have gone into integrating the LGBT community, and would reverse the process entirely, once again victimising us.\n\nI ask you, if you have compassion and understanding, to sign this petition, and ensure that the rights LGBT people have fought for for years, are defended and upheld by the state in years to come.",
