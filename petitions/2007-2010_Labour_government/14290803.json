            "background": "In October 2009 A jury decided John Nichols,was partly responsible for TWO DEATHS because he could and should have prevented it.  \nNichols allowed fellow company director Mary Butres to drive  after they had shared a bottle of wine. \nShe later lost control of his Jaguar on the A1 at Great Ponton, at over 110mph in torrential rain. \nThe Jaguar smashed into  Mark Crompton, 20, and Jodie Brown, 19.Lincoln Crown Court heard. \nButres, of St Mary's Street, Stamford, Lincs, admitted two charges of causing death by dangerous driving as a result of the tragedy on May 12 2007. \nBut Nichols, denied the same offences. \nButres drove at more than twice the speed of other cars on the road. \nThe Jaguar's \"black box\" recorder,  revealed she was travelling far too quickly for the atrocious conditions. \nYet Nichols denied he should have realised her actions were endangering lives.\nThey were travelling at more than 110mph in atrocious conditions while a driver was over the limit.  \nNichols and Butres were both granted bail by Judge John Milmo QC but could be jailed when they are sentenced next month. \nAs of today 6th January 2010, three months later these people have still not been sentenced.",
