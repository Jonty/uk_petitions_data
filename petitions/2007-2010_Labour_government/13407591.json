        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It would be an excellent idea to create a central database for found pets in the uk.Thousands of pets are lost & found in the uk every year & a large percentage of these are either put to sleep needlessly or rehomed(often without the owner ever knowing they were in rescue & continuing to look for them for years after).A lot of this could be prevented & thus the numbers in rescue/pounds reduced if there was a database that everyone could access to find their pet-ie make both the finder's & the owners job's easier.Groups that already exist to help lost & found pets from all over the uk could liase & in theory no found pet need be \"missed\" by the owner looking for them & countless thousands of pounds would be saved needlessly feeding animals that could be \"safe at home\" with a little more help. The onus is currently on the owner to find the pet which could have strayed or been taken & dumped anywhere in the country, an impossible task to contact people who you dont even know exist. This could help everyone & i believe strongly should be considered as a useful tool to all concerned.",
