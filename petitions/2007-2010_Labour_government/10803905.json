            "background": "I petition you to remove two taxes from motorists by removing two of the following:\n\nAll tolls from roads and bridges in the UK.\n\nVehicle duty.\n\nFuel tax. \n\nIt's not acceptable to tax motorists with all three.\n\nWhen the first Severn Crossing was built, we were reassured that the tolls would be scrapped eventually, they never were.\n\nThe Second Severn Crossing costs more than five times to cross, than the cost of crossing of The Forth Bridge, which was \u00a31, only payable in one direction in 2007.\n\nOn another petition response the Government has justified the high cost due to it's only being applied in one direction. \n\nIt's not justifiable when you compare it to the Forth Bridge.\n\nIt is not justifiable to be taxed numerous times on our vehicles.",
