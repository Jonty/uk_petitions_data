        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "By granting tax credits to people the Government have acknowledged that you cannot live on a low wage.  Raise the lower tax allowance so no-one pays tax unless they earn more than \u00a312,000 then pay 20% on anything between \u00a312,000 and \u00a320,000. 25% on up to \u00a330,000 30% on anything up to \u00a340,000 and 50% on anything over \u00a340,000.  I would rather be a little worse off and earn my own money than have a little extra with the trouble of admin, mistakes etc. People should not be allowed to work just 16 hours per week and have a partner sat at home working nothing and be able to claim \u00a3600 per month for free.  An extreme case I know but it happens more the more people are aware they can do it!  Please support this and get the work ethic back to Britain.",
