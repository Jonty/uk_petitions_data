            "background": "I believe that the remuneration package of the highest paid in any organisation should be linked to that of the lowest paid employee. For example the highest paid member of an organisation (including all bonuses, pension benefits, perks etc) should not be allowed to earn 50 times more than the lowest paid employee (on a pro-rata basis) With this principal in place if an organisation does so well the person at the top of the pay ladder decides they are worth \u00a31m per annum the lowest paid person would earn a minimum of \u00a320k in the same year. This allows all the people who have contributed to the organisation's success to share, in a small way, equally in the rewards of that success",
