        "background": "I have just left secondary school and I believe that our education system is missing a crucial subject that should be made compulsory.\n\nWe used to teach our children things such as our national anthem and HM armed forces repatriation speech and many other countries still do. It's little things like that which I believe we are missing.\n\nThese can all be integrated into a subject that educates children on the history and heritage of themselves and their environment.\n\nI think that if this was done then children of all ages will have more respect for the elderly, more respect for the environment in which they live and they would have an educated view of their country, which hopefully they will be proud to grow up and live in.\n\nIf you feel the same way as I do, then please sign this petition.\n\nThanks",
