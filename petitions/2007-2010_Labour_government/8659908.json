        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We are the Oldham Catholic Schools Parents Association (OCSPA). This association has been created to cater for local people who wish to oppose the relocation of 2 Catholic Secondary Schools (Our Ladys and St. Augustine of Canterbury) to a town centre site, the Meridian Centre. \n\nWe are opposing the site of the new school but we are not opposing the integration of the 2 existing schools. We believe that siting the school in the centre of a very busy town could cause massive problems for both pupils and town centre workers and shoppers. Facilities for the pupils would be completely stripped down from what is currently provided at the 2 existing sites and transportation would be a logistical nightmare.\n\nThere is also the problem of providing supervision for the pupils during breaks and lunchtimes. The proposed site would have no playground/school yard and the pupils would have nothing to do except visit the town centre.\n\nThere is also the unanswered question of 6th Form provision.",
