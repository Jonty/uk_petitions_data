            "background": "Jacqui Smith has effectively deceived the police officers of England & Wales by moving the goalposts on their pay negotiations. She had jeapordised their future pay structure security and taken no account of the unique role that police officers do. She has lost the trust of the police at a time when the police are needed most. She has behaved in an underhand and deceitful way and cannot be trusted. Her position as a Minister is untenable.",
