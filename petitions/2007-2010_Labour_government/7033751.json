            "background": "The Cooling Towers in Sheffield are scheduled for demolition despite widespread opposition and support for their retention. These structures are of great importance as extremely signifficant local and national landmarks. They are important symbols of Sheffields heavy engineering history and are important as structures of historical and architectural merit being more aesthetically considered and individual than other structures of a later date. These two towers are literally the last of their kind in the country and possibly the world.",
