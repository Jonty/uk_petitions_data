        "action": "make taxation honest, straightforward, and ensure it is channelled to where the electorate were led to believe it will be used.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "All taxes that we pay  in this country are labelled according to what the tax is applied to.  The revenue collected by HMR&C ends up in a \"pool\" administered and contolled by HM Treasury. It is then spent by the government departments in a way that is obscure to the tax-payer and frequently in a way that is unacceptable. This petition demands that taxation becomes open, honest and major expenditure is subject to a democratic process that prevents governmental misuse. Examples of obscurity or  misuse are: 1) Most people in this country do not want our tax to be spent on killing and war. We are paying for this without our consent. This should  be stopped. 2) Petrol tax should  be used to make  our roads safer and our communications better- this  country is grinding to a halt with our tax being channelled to other purposes. 3) The TV licence fee is a tax by another name. The BBC is allowed to squander money according to it's whims and is not held accountable. This should stop.",
