            "background": "The West Northants Development Corporation (an unelected QUANGO) are to erect a structure to represent the culture of Northampton.  They propose a 130 foot needle which the shoemakers say does not represent their industry, but they are adamant we will have it despite vigorous protests and an intention by the Borough Council to demolish it once the WNDC is gone.  The majority of the people of Northampton do not want the structure but it is being forced upon us by an unelected body who have no feelings for this town.",
