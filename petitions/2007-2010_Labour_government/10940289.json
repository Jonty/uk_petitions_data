            "background": "In todays climate it is becoming ever more necessary to keep a keen eye on not only our carbon footprint but also our carbon tyreprint. In line with this, the Government taxes Company Car Drivers an extra amount over and above basic PAYE, based on the vehicles CO2 emissions and value. This has encouraged manufacturers to produce incredibly \"Green\" diesel models in comparison to only a few years ago,or risk losing the fleet market altogether. The government has recognised this diesel CO2 reduction by removing the Diesel supplement on VED it is therefore discriminatory to penalise company car drivers an extra 3% BIK tax just for driving a diesel car - many of which have no choice but to chose diesel due to its economical benefit over petrol. No other diesel driver is penalised personally in this way - private cars do not attract such a penalty.",
