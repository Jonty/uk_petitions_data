        "background": "When april 6th 2010 comes around get ready for more prejudice towards pensioners already struggling and new pensioners will get preference over old AGAIN. Anyone who does not have 44 years of qualifying service before April 6th 2010 will get a % worked out for his total pension on 44 years e.g.(29 years of 44)= 65% of full pension but after april 2010 anyone retiring gets the 29 years of service at a % of 30 years.(29 of 30)= 97% of full pension This could make a huge 28% difference if you have 29 years of service and retire on the day before the 6th april 2010. Let's not let them do this to us again.",
