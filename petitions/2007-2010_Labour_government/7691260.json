Anyone who does not have 44 years of qualifying service before April 6th 2010 will get a % worked out for his total pension on 44 years e.g.(29 years of 44)= 65% of full pension but after april 2010 anyone retiring gets the 29 years of service at a % of 30 years.(29 of 30)= 97% of full pension This could make a huge 28% difference if you have 29 years of service and retire on the day before the 6th april 2010. Let's not let them do this to us again.",
