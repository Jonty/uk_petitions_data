            "background": "There are a few simple and FREE steps the government can take to help free up our roads of congestion.\n\n1. STOP lorries overtaking each other on a hill when on the motorway. They are all capped at the same speed, all attempting to overtake does is make two lanes of the Motorway 56Mph and one 70Mph. On long hills this causes tailbacks of miles. There is no need.\n\n2. STOP Tractors and other slow moving agricultural vehicles from using main roads between 7am - 9am and then again between 3pm - 5pm. Also make it compulsory that they have to use country and quiet roads where available. \n\n3. If a driver of any vehicle is sitting well below the speed limit on a road where it would be quite adequate to be driving the limit they should pull over to let the other vehicles pass if:\na)There are more than 6 cars directly behind them and\nb)there are no cars directly in front of them and\nc)It is obvious they are the reason for the tailback.\n\nThese 3 steps will reduce traffic without any cost to the government or tax payer.",
