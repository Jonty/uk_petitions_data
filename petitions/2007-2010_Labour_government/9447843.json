Excellent with children; nickenamed the 'nanny dog' yet so many are killed under the 'dangeous dogs act 1991'. why? BAD OWNERS. no dog of any description is dangerous. the lack of care and nurturing makes them attack. people who are naive and just dont know how to properly care are to blame. but does anyone listen? NO. SAVE OUR BRITISH STAFFIES",
