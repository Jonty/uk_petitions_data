More than 90 per cent of the people who responded to the council's first consultation were against the development of Elms Field, and the council has received more than 900 letters of complaint.\n\nThe council are offering six development options; however there is NO option to retain the park as an open space. \n\nCouncillors are riding roughshod over the views of Wokingham residents and are showing a complete lack of regard for the people they represent.",
