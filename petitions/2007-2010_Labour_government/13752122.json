Thus lowering the returns of the individual investors. Whilst the FSA have, since June 2009 not allowed Endowment providers to pass the burden on to investors they did allow fines and charges on the policies sold-sold during 1970's up to June 2009, the vast majority. British law does not usually punish innocent people; this inaction has directly punished millions who were not at fault.\nThe lack of effective control of the financial investment industry allows the diversion of money from investment funds to the detriment of of the investor, it should be fraud, but does not seem to be. You must act.",
