            "background": "Every supermarket shows price decreases and marks sale items in very large, eye-catching ways, in an effort to entice buyers into buying things they don't need in quantities they could never use.\nHowever, if a price increases, the label does not have to indicate that it has done so.\nIf supermarkets were forced to mark price increases at least as prominently as they mark price drops, the prominence of price drop advertisements would necessarily shrink, as there simply is not sufficient space to label everything with 3 square feet of signage.",
