            "background": "Car Boot Markets are allowed to operate on'ONE'site only, upto 14 days per year without Planning Permission. When this has expired the Operaters simply 'move' to another site (the next field?) and continue operations again for 14 days and continue to be a 'Cause for Concern and to' local residents. This petition seeks to redress the balance in favour of local residents.\nI propose that 'car boot operations'or anything similar to are all licenced from the 'first' one by the Local Planning Authority and that no further 'licence' be granted to any Operater within 10 days and 7 mile radius (unless Ancient Market Rights are held etc) within any Council Fiscal Year.Human Rights Articles will be accounted to and for.\nThe above Proposal will apply to All Land that is defined as Greenbelt or Open Countryside\nThe above Proposal would allow 'Car Boot Sales' within properties described as 'Public or Civil Buildings' constructed of Brick or Wood ie Schools",
