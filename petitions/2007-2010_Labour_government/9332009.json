There was an old version of this petition which has now closed, but there were over 40,000 signatures but that's not enough so please please please sign this.  You have 1 year until the petition closes.  Once you've done it get ALL your friends to do it to!!!  Maybe this time we can get to over 100,000.  Clarkson really could make a great PM,  because of his enthusiasm and his fun personality.  Give him a chance everyone!!!",
