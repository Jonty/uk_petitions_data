            "background": "The National Health Service is permanently in crisis due to limitless pressure on its staff and funding. A large proportion of this burden would be eased if only those entitled to care (ie: legal UK residents) were provided with the full range of services at current prices. Even legal foreign residents and the unemployed have NI numbers, so there would be no unfair discrimination involved in this measure. It would prevent and deter health tourism, and would further raise revenue by virtue of healthcare charges levied against opportunists presenting at NHS facilities from overseas.",
