They may be forced to live on a pittance of \u00a365,000 a year plus free travel, cheap beer and food. How can we expect our elected representatives to pay for their own houses, cleaning and food? It is a disgrace that MP's should be forced to live like ordinary citizens; they are far to precious a resource for that. The Prime Minister should ensure that taxpayers continue to fork out the necessary cash so that all MP's can live in the style to which they have become accustomed.",
