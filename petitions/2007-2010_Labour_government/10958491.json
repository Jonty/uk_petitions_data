            "background": "In Year Two, at St. Saviour's Primary School, we have been learning about Mary Seacole. She was a very kind nurse who helped the soldiers in the Crimean War. Mary was very brave and strong when working on the battlefields. She never gave up even when people said 'No!' to her because she was black.\nWe believe that Mary Seacole is special because she was gentle, helpful, generous and strong hearted. We think that she is astonishing and deserves a statue in her honour. We feel that more people should know about Mary Seacole and that she should have a statue in an important place. We think that Trafalgar Square would be perfect!\n(Written by Year Two pupils at St. Saviour's CE Primary School, Shirland Road, Warwick Avenue, London W9 2JD)",
