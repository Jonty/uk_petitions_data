With no promotion to the games highest level what will clubs be playing for? A hollow victory in a pointless Grand Final? With nothing to aspire to the fans will become disillusioned with the game and make their feelings known the only way they can \u2013 through the turnstiles. Is your club as well supported as it was before \u201cSuper League\"?\n\nThose of us who are opposed to the franchise system need to come together to take action.",
