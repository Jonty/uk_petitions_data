            "background": "Greater London has a population of 7.5 million people and a land area of 1,579km2. The highest housing densities are achieved by the Chinese and currently run up to 6m people per square kilometre. So if the UK government followed the Chinese government's example, we could take an area about the size of Regents Park (4.3km2), somewhere on the outskirts of London, knock down all existing property, and rebuild homes for 25 million people which is 43% of the UK population. Such radical action would, of course, completely solve the UK housing crisis. In the long term it would also act to increase the UK's growth and competitiveness - which is increasingly threatened, within the global economy, by more radical and rational countries such as China.",
