            "background": "The current emphasis on pay restraint in the public sector is being undermined by the proposal of a 10% pay rise for MP's. Nurses, Police officers among other public workers are being insulted by the 'do as I say not as I do' attitude of greedy MP's. With generous allowances and pay they are already more than rewarded for what they do. As for the usual claim that we will lose MPs to higher paid private work, the main reason that most MPs get private sector employment is BECAUSE they are MPs not in spite of it. Lets have people who want to serve their county, not profit from it.",
