            "background": "With thousands of people currently unemployed, all potential employers should not be allowed to check your credit status as part of the vetting procedure. Most people have a bad credit rating due to past money problems sometimes through no fault of their own yet some employers insist on checking your credit file and do not hesitate to turn you down if they find something on file. I have applied for several job vacancies and have been turned down because of one CCJ and default, the work had nothing to do with any cash handling, in fact the work were just delivery driving, maybe if this credit checking issue was made illegal then i am sure more people would get a better chance to apply for that job",
