        "background": "National Policy Statements and a new Infrastructure Planning Commission have been announced, affecting planning for energy and waste disposal.  Given the recent Court judgement concerning negligence during demolition of Corby Steelworks, Policy Statements and the Commission itself will inevitably be attacked via Enquiries and Court actions by people who object to ANY development close to where THEY happen to live (NIMBYs - Not In My Back Yard) and / or affecting only a minority interest.  The Prime Minister must ensure that the long-term needs of the majority of the UK population are not impeded by actions of vociferous minorities, especially over planning and implementation of energy-related infrastructure. In particular, local organisations and pressure groups must not triumph over the needs of the majority, national economic imperatives and physical realities, and they must be prevented from scare-mongering and rabble-rousing intended mainly to frighten people rather than to identify and quantify risks and disbenefits.  Eg. condemning clean-burn Energy from Waste plants using the emissions performance of 'traditional' waste incinerators.",
