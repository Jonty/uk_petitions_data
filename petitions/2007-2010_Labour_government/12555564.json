            "background": "Many insurance companies are now charging excessive administration fees for carrying out simple changes to customer details after you've taken out a policy with them (eg: \u00a325 to update your address with a well-known female-oriented car insurer). As it is mandatory to keep your details up to date, you have no choice but to pay the fee.\n\nI think the Government should intervene to ensure that any fees charged are fair and equitable. The FSA regulates many of these companies but do not appear to have taken any action to make sure that customers are not being overcharged for simple, mandatory updates to their policies.",
