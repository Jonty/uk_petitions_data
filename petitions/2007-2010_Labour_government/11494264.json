The answer will tell them why we can't shop our way out of this depression for the simple reason we have nothing left with which to make purchases, we can only exist by cutting all our outgoings,\nmost money goes on Council Tax the rest on indirect tax and we have nothing left.\nWake up to the fact please !",
