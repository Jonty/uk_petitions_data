            "background": "I strongly believe as an existing taxi driver that the driving standards throughout the trade is below average.\nThe only requirement to enter the trade is a UK full license.\nIn the sole Interest of public safety I propose an Advanced test is a compulsory requirement for all drivers.\n( Private hire and Hackney carriage ).\nThis would hopefully give the passenger in these vehicles a better service standard and make every journey safer due to the enhanced skills of there driver.\nGenerally drivers at present have driven for a number of years and implanted poor driving habits into there daily driving routine making them a high risk factor and them-self becoming a hazard to road users,\npedestrians and more so there passengers.",
