            "background": "\"Opting out\" but paying considerable sums into the system. Unable to benefit  from the home protection scheme,  if  working whilst children were young. Generation lost unemployment/sickness benefits,paying MW rate thirty years plus. Present legistation  gives 60%  pension. Worse off than stay at home mothers from 1977. Many are  living near the poverty line-yet legistation allows stay at home mums more pension rights without any National insurance contributions.Government should recompense   women who \"lost out\" because of  change in womans working lives in  60s/70s/80s -but sidetracked into the old system. These woman did not know, that their pension was 60% and no serps pension.  There were millions of pounds collected from these women but those who paid no contributions have more pension rights! Please address this issue, these woman got trapped in situation,  they could \nnot accrue sufficient contributions  Soon Woman will only have to work 30years, (home protection much less) to get a full pension-again there is no equality there. this petition is to ask the Government to address it;s own pension scandal-Married Womans NI contributions.",
