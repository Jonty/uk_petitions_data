            "background": "There is a perception, fostered by the right-wing press (especially tabloids) that this Act favours criminals, \"illegal\" asylum seekers, etc to the detriment of law-abiding British people. In fact this Act applies to ANYONE who feels their rights have been violated but even if it DID favour the groups I have mentioned this shouldn't nullify it; to say an Act which guarantees certain rights should apply only to specified groups of people is to go down a VERY slippery slope in which increasing numbers of groups would become ineligible; maybe, eventually, even one to which YOU belong!  There is a postcard issued by the Peace movement quoting Pastor Niemoller about the Nazis: \"First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew\"; it goes on to say the same about various other groups and ends \"Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me\".",
