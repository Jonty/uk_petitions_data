            "background": "Current car tax and the newly passed car tax increases (based on higher polluting vehicles) appear unfair.\n\ne.g. a household that has a single 7 seater car to move their family around in now will pay generally 44% more as seen as not 'green', when in reality they would now purchase 2 cars (as it will be cheaper tax wise) and have them on the road at the same (adding to traffic, and producing much more pollition).\n\nThis petition is for the govenernment to means test the tax based on the number of people at the household (considering under 16s as key) vs. the number of vehicles at the property.\n\ni.e. if a household has 3 people and 3 cars - the tax should be increased due to more car sharing should be done.\n\nWhere-as is a household had a single car for 7 people then its tax should actually be lowered.\n\nThese taxes will be placed upon people have whave fleets of cars and mismatches of ratios of people to cars.\n\nThe government at not stage in the tax reform / review have considered houshold usage and occupency of vehicles (which is key if the criteria is to cut pollution) it has to be based per person as a key metric driver (i.e. Co2 KG divided by people using vehicle) = tax.",
