            "background": "Currently, there is no discouragement for operators, entrusted with managing fixed penalty legislation, to illegally issue these fixed penalties. This mainly applies to parking enforcement.\n\nThese fraudulently operating bodies or individuals can then use the police & the justice system and equally cavalier independent & privately operated bailiffs to further penalise sometimes innocent victims.\n\nReasonable Control & Management of these, privately run contracted out legislation enforcing services, has clearly failed. All such operators should be under complete government control and accountability.\n\nFor instances, it has clearly & repeatedly been demonstrated by investigative journalists & independently supported & recorded by individuals that parking penalty charges have been issued illegally & vehicle confication carried out illegally. There is, typically, no recourse for hapless victims with legal fees discouraging any justice.\n\nAdditionally, it should become illegal for corporate executives, and all other employees involved, to allow the illegal confiscation of vehicles or the incorrect issuing of parking tickets.",
