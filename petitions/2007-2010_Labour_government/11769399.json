The review should consider the travel and subsistence rules for Civil Servants; MPs\u2019 allowances should be broadly based upon the same principles, with the same level of limits.\n\nKey principles should be:\n\u2022 All claims must be itemised, then reviewed by an authorisation office with the power to accept or reject the claim\n\u2022 Claims for products or services should be directly related to costs incurred in undertaking their role as an MP within agreed limits\n\u2022 If there is evidence that the rules are being manipulated to maximise the claim for the financial gain of the MP, family or friends the authorisation office can override the rules and refuse or reduce the claim\n\u2022 MPs should not profit from the purchase or rental of second homes\n\nThe underlying principle should be whether or not a reasonable person would consider the claim appropriate and fair.",
