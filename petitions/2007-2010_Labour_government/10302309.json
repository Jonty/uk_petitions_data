            "background": "Over crowded prisons, lack of respect for law and order and the 'I love it in prison' attitude of criminals, we should reinstate the death penalty. Firstly we should Try them, Convict them and the imprison them for 10 yrs on Death Row. During that time they have the right to appeal, providing evidence of their innocence. If unable to prove their innocence or still admit the crime, they should be given a lethal injection. This would provide a good deterrent, reduce prison crowding and hopefully restore law and order",
