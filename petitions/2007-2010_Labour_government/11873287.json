            "background": "Wild animals' needs can ever be met in circuses and that confinement, constant transportation, abnormal social groups and inadequate winter quarters all cause suffering.\n\nThere is absolutely no similarity between the lives of wild elephants and those of these circus captives.\n\nWild elephants lead dynamic, socially-complex lives governed by their relationships with family members and the demands of finding and eating huge quantities of vegetation.\n\nBy contrast, circus elephants' emotional lives are sterile and their activity restricted by chains and pens, except for when required to perform tricks, which place unbearable strain on their joints and bodies.\n\nWe are calling for the urgent introduction of regulations under the Animal Welfare Act to prevent any other wild animals suffering this fate.\n\nPlease stop immediately all the performances that use animals at the Great British Circus and similar circus.",
