            "background": "I would like to propose that legal aid is abolished for divorce. Paying for the divorce would focus the minds of divorcing couples to be more civil with each other and put their children if they have any first. \n\nDoing this would encourage both parties to the mediation table. The parents would be more child centered and society would have less damaged children.\n\nThe government should also look at 50/50 automatic custody unless proved that either party is unsuitable to care for them",
