            "background": "This is a petition, in order to stop the exams that students have to face, because the pressure of failing is a serious issue, and affecting the youth of the population.\nWhat makes it worse, is that often exams become meaningless, GCSE's for example, do not provide any purpose, as universitites use A levels, and employers use universities.\nFurthermore an exam can surely not be good becasue, not only does the exam often have no practical use in reality, but also one cannot really be expected to condense a year of studying into an hour, the concept is quite absurd.",
