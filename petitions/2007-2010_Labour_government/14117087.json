        "background": "Gary McKinnan is a gentle, sensitive Scottish man who wouldn't hurt a fly.  He is facinated by UFOs and stumbled into classified areas of  U.S. military and NASA computers on a web search for more information about extra-terrestials.  Entry to many of the supposedly classified sites did not even require a password.  He faces ten serious charges of 'computer hacking'  and a seventy  year jail sentence in the USA.  Gary commited his so called 'crime' in Britain.  According to the UK justicial system Gary's trial should take place in a British Court.  Why are our politicians giving in to bullying demands from some U.S. officials to extradite Gary McKinnon to an American prison to await trial? It shows a ruthless lack of compassion for a vulnerable adult who intended no harm to anyone.   The terror of life in an American jail has been hanging over Gary's head for the better part of a decade.  If the UK allows the USA to capture Gary and take him from his home to await trial in an American jail, the UK may as well kiss goodbye to autonomy.  Saving Gary from extradition will protect  the independence of the British justicial system and our civil rights.",
