            "background": "The NHS is failing patients in deprived areas, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers found patients in poor areas had a greater number of psychological problems, more long-term illnesses and a wider variety of chronic health problems.\n\nConsultations in deprived areas were also shorter than in affluent ones, and doctors reported being under greater stress, especially after long sessions.\nAnd for patients with psychological problems in poor areas, seeing a doctor was less useful than for similar cases in better-off places. Given the above findings, the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to examine the findings of the petitioner's PhD research and ideas submitted online (nobody seems to be taking me seriously).",
