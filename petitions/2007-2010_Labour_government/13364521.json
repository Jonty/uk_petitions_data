            "background": "A hygienic facility for scholars to get a free drink of water should be required in schools. The main reason is to stop the use of toilet facilities (taps in hand wash basins) being the only supply of drinking water. They should not be expected to drink in the same room as urinals and toilets or to take their own drinks, or buy drinks, during school. Part of this requirement would be to investigate the content of the supplied water to determine its suitability as drinking water, and filtering of contaminants.",
