        "background": "Prosecutors (in particular) should not get away with \u2018hyping up\u2019 their case. They should ONLY present the hard evidence, and nothing else, and they should be penalised for \u2018going for the Oscar.\u2019 \u2018Point-scoring exercises' should be eradicated from British Courtrooms in the interests of justice.  There is a tendency for over-eager prosecutors to make suggestions and voice opinions in their opening speech which are not supported by evidence, to distort or misrepresent evidence in such a way that any rebuttal is bound to fail, and to make comments in their closing speech such as \"The Defendant needs to explain why these allegations would be made\" while knowing that what they have said is wrong in law; the defendant does NOT 'need' to prove his innocence! The prosecutor's words carry enormous weight with a jury, as there is an instinctive belief that the prosecutor and the Crown are 'working for justice' and the defence barrister is 'trying to protect his client'.",
