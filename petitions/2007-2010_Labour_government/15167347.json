            "background": "St Mary's, in Melton Mowbray, Leicesterhire is a stand alone, midwifery- led birth centre which has advocated and provided normal, low risk maternity care for many decades. Recently the postnatal ward was forced to close due to staff shortages, however many feel this is a precursor to the birth centre being closed as a whole for good. There are countless reasons as to why St. Mary's should not close, but fundamentally this is a place where normality is wholly promoted during the entire childbirth experience. It is also a fantastic environment for our midwives of the future to gain invaluable knowledge and confidence to support holistic, individualised, low risk care to women and their families.",
