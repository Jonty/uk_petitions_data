            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There is little or no free unrestricted car parking in Oxford, Headington, Summertown and Jericho. The Westgate multi-storey car parking is very expensive, even more so on a Saturday. Gloucester Green (underground) car park costs more than the Westgate. On street car parking is non-existant with most being Residents Only.\n\nI propose the following:\nCreate more unrestricted on-street car parking on the following areas:\nHeadington\nSummertown\nJericho\nThis can be achieved by removing Resident Only Bays and requiring new developments to include 1.5 off street parking spaces per \"bedroom\".\n\nIncrease amount of car parking spaces available by building a bigger multi-storey car park with the proposed Westgate development. Building under ground as well as upwards will increase capacity.\n\nBuild a multi-storey car park next to the Ice Rink.\n\nPrice of car parking in the car parks should be reduced to less than \u00a31.50 per hour after 10am on weekdays and 11am on weekends. Parking after 5:00pm should be free or cost neutral.\n\nBy increasing car parking capacity, it will make Oxford more attractive and convenient for visitors, workers and residents.",
