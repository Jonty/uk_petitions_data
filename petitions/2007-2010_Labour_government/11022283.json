Taxpayers foot the bill as these criminals are released from prison to live on benefits and are given free housing. They should be returned to their own countries to face the consequences of their actions. Their victim's families must feel very badly let down. The prime minister and his  government should come to their senses and repeal these ill thought out laws.",
