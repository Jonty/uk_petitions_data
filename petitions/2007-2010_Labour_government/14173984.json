            "background": "There are (approx) 500 known chromosomal abnormalities that display autistic behaviours. Each chromosomally abnormal (in this instance, read as \u2018dis-abled\u2019 as in \u2018cannot live without 24hr care for life) - each case is unique. Autism is an umbrella term. I\u2019ve seen children with ADHD diagnosed autistic, I\u2019ve seen children with Fragile X diagnosed autistic- the word \u2018autism\u2019 actually is identifying a set of behaviours, in my opinion it doesn\u2019t exist as a single disease and is being misdiagnosed by people cashing in on it, or for people wanting it as label for one reason or other- genetic medicine is improving exponentially, and soon \u2018white matter\u2019('Rain-Man') and genetic abnormalities can be detectable from emotional/nervous illness via fMri and mFish tests as can mulitiple-discliplinary testing across a long period of time to assess the unique special-needs of the unique child.",
