            "background": "The Mayor of London, has made the decision to axe several transport schemes that are of crucial benefit to economic regeneration, social cohesion and inward investment in London.\n\nThese schemes include, amongst others, the Cross River Tram (a scheme even Boris Johnson concedes \"has merit\"), the DLR extension to Dagenham and the Croydon Tramlink extension. Such schemes would create public transport links to parts of London are badly connected and would do much to create viable public transport links, promote inclusion (especially with regard to the communities served either side of the Thames on the route of the Cross River tram) and allow good access to employment. In the current economic climate, the need for such schemes is deeply compelling if not crucial.",
