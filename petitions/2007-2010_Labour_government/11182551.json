            "background": "I understand this increased rate (which in my opinion is far too low anyway) is not going to come into force until 2011! How many of those potentially affected will have instructed their accountants to find loopholes in this legislation by then; and how many will therefore succeed in altogether avoiding the payment of this increase?  If it's possible to bring in a reduction in V.A.T. only a few days after the measure was announced why is it apparently not possible to do this with the increased tax rate?",
