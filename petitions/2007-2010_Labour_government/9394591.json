            "background": "It has got to the stage now where our children can not be seen by a dentist as there is no places for them and no places for adults as NHS patients either and many people are being forced to pay to get urgent and necessary treatment they can not afford. Children are missing out on a vital service because to be seen by a NHS dentist within a local clinic they have to be refered by their own dentist which many children have not got.Also dentists with places available to private patients will not take children in the place or take them on as private.Some waiting lists are over 3 years long for an NHS place.",
