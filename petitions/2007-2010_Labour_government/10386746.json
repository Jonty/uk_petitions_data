            "background": "Overpayment of tax credits is a disaster. It pushes people on low incomes into unsustainable debt. This usually happens because you have to estimate your earnings for the year, and corrections are made at a later date. For self employed people this is even worse as mostly we work a year in arrears. Why can't the HMRC take your earnings from their own tax returns that we have to complete and they must have on file? Overpayments are clawed back at a rate of only 25%, meaning that when tax credits end (eg when kids leave school etc.) recipient is left with a horrendous debt. This is grossly unfair.",
