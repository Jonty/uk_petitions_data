        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In this country unemployed persons receive benefits for nothing so there is no incentive for them to find employment. I suggest that anyone who is medically fit & who has been unemployed for more than 6 months should be required to join our Armed Forces. At least this way they are giving something back to their country in return for the benefits they receive, if they do not wish to join up then there is a greater incentive to find other employment elsewhere. It will also greatly help unemployment figures. So it is a win win situation.",
