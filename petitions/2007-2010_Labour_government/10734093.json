            "background": "Many thousands of students are struggling to get by with the huge debt that they have taken on from going to University.\nWhy should people have to pay huge sums of money just so that they don't work in menial jobs for the rest of their lives? Especially since the government needs these people to do so well to achieve their many targets.\nThis is why tuition fees should be stopped, the huge cost for students is crippling, even more so since the government can't keep inflation down, making lives harder for the very people that it needs to do so well.",
