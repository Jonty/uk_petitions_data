        "background": "Since being assisted by the taxpayer, RBS has not yielded to the public's will. It has not freed up lending, it still wanted to pay staff bonuses and is paying a massive pension to Fred Goodwin. If the government nationalised RBS, the state could 1) ensure RBS increases lending as they have recently done with Northern Rock 2) Reorganise RBS to serve the public interest 3) Prevent any more scandalous bonus payments and radically change the culture of this and other banks. Since the public own the bank, they should be behaving like public sector organisations.",
