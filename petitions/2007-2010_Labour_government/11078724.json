        "background": "As individuals our bodies and their constituent organs belong to us . They do NOT belong to the state. The mooted proposal to make organ donation obligatory and enforced by law unless an individual specifically opts out (presumed consent) would, if made statutory, be an infringement of human rights. People need to give their consent before any medical procedure is carried out whilst they are alive and this should extend to after death as well. Presumed consent takes away this right. Furthermore, the fact that any government would even propose presumed consent suggests that human rights legislation and the law in general allows us to have the body (habeas corpus) but not to have the right to decide what to do with it.",
