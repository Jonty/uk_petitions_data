            "background": "There is irrefutable evidence that local councils are using council tax write off as a political tool, in effect buying votes.  This is a third world activity which our political elite regularly criticise when it happens elsewhere on the planet.  Any write off of council tax which is taken while the council is pursuing some of the population through the courts should be criminalised with a minimum, mandatory sentence of 30 years imprisonment for the political activist who authorises it.",
