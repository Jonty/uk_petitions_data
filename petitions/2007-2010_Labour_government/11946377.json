            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The governments policy to reduce interest rates has benefited very few mortgage holders, but penalised every saver (Seven savers for every one borrower) and caused an outflow of capital from foreign investors due to the weak \u00a3.  This has many serious consequences including higher import costs.  Savers will be less likely to spend money as they are earning a paltry interest, and may cause significant problems for recapitalising banks if savers withdraw their money.\n\nI propose that the government increase interest rates to a sensible level, so that savers can earn a decent level of interest and thus encouraging them to spend more, recapitalise the banks with money on deposit, strengthen the pound which will reduce import costs and encourage overseas investors to also place cash on deposit in UK banks.",
