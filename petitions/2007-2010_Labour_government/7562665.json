Or even foreigners visiting the country?\n\nI believe that by placing signs along the motorway would prove more effective than trying to change the way drivers are taught. Let alone the cost. \n\nI feel the signs would:\na)\treduce motorway congestion \nb)\treduce accidents\nc)\treduce \u2018road rage\u2019\n\nI hope you will seriously consider this proposal.\n\nYours Sincerely, \n\nCheryl Farnden",
