        "background": "A recent group on \u2018Facebook\u2019 that outlined the number of people who do not know how to use the motorway correctly (by staying in the middle lane) currently has 20,681 members! \n\nThis is an alarming number with a very simple solution: \n\nSigns along the motorway, even next to \u2018Tiredness can kill\u2019 signs saying \u2018Keep left unless overtaking\u2019.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand already have these signs and having driven around both of these countries, the signs seem to work well.\n\nWe can of course change the way the drivers in this country are taught, but what about all the other drivers that can already drive? Or even foreigners visiting the country?\n\nI believe that by placing signs along the motorway would prove more effective than trying to change the way drivers are taught. Let alone the cost. \n\nI feel the signs would:\na)\treduce motorway congestion \nb)\treduce accidents\nc)\treduce \u2018road rage\u2019\n\nI hope you will seriously consider this proposal.\n\nYours Sincerely, \n\nCheryl Farnden",
