            "background": "No amount of \"environmental taxation\" is going to change anything unless it is compensated by a reduction in tax on good things. People have only a fixed \"pie\"of income to spend, it has to be divided up in the way to improve our environment. For example, tax big cars, but positively (not neutrally) reward small ones. Use speed camera to reward people who save petrol by driving slowly, not people that speed... there are many examples where reward is a more equitable solution. We do not want to destroy society, just change it.",
