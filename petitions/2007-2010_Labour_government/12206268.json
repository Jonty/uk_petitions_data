I feel that the only section of society currently on a nice cozy fixed income are the spongers on tax credits or the new 'breeding' classes. Perhaps these groups should also assist the rest of the country by taking a cut in income, or maybe work/stop breeding. This may assist employers to retain staff by decreasing some of the exorbitant taxes currently being thrown at the most unworthy causes.",
