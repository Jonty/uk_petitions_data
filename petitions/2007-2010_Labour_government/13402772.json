            "background": "I would like to be able to buy seasonal produce from local farmers/growers, from my local supermarkets, I think the supermarkets should be supporting farmers/growers across the country and if this was available I believe more people would support their local growers. I would like to see at least a seasonal local section in all supermarkets all over the country. I live in Kent and would expect to see local apples on the shelves of my supermarkets at this time of year, instead, in my local Morrisons I see apples from USA, South Africa and New Zealand. The air miles on those alone should be the most valid reason to use these suppliers when apples are not in season in the UK. Supporting local growers/farmers will reduce all of our carbon footprints and maintain British agriculture.",
