            "background": "In 1929, the year before his death, under a cloud of censorship, relating to his book Lady Chatterleys' Lover, 13 oil paintings by D.H.Lawrence were confiscated by the police, deemed as obscene. Under threat of their destruction Lawrence was allowed to rescue them and take them to New Mexico where nine now remain under the condition that they 'never return to English soil'. What was considered to be 'obscene' at the time is to modern eyes now charming and mildly sensual and it remains a disgrace to our country that the artwork of one of our most celebrated and dynamic authors cannot even be exhibited on English soil without the threat of police seizure. Surely we are no longer such phillistines? We therefore request that this ban should be lifted.",
