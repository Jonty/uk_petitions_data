Since this has happened it has become impossible to get hold of these items for dissection or demonstration in the educational environment. \nI therefore propose the law should be changed regarding Educational environments from schools to Colleges and University's to buy or be given these items freely as part of the education environment. As these Items are now not available it is having a large effect on the education of students. A hands on practical has more educational value than a \"Text book\" education.",
