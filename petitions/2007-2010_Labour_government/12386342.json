            "background": "I am 63 years old, and I am concerned about alchol use,together with the availability of easy access to alcohol.\nAlcohol has become to easiley available.\nI sugest that all supermarkets seperate alcohol sales by having a section that would need customers to re enter the alchol sales section after buying their normal shopping. To have a alchol only department with a seperate check out till, with a responsible mature cashiere who would have the athority to question suspect purchases.\nI would also sugest that other shops selling alcohol have a mature cashier working on the till, to question persistant purchases of alcohol instead of just a rubber stamp attitude.\nIn other words making alchol purchases very much more observed than at the moment.",
