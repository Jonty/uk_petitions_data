The rule of 'everyone else does it' has never been morally right and should not be now. If anyone has wrongly claimed then they should be exposed as dishonest, as is the law of the land.\n There must be transparency.\n Please can our prime minister be the first to get a grip of these practises and bring back integrity and honesty to politics? His task as PM will surely be happier if he has the british people on his side.",
