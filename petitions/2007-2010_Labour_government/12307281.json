It is noted that the Office of Fair Trading deems false psychic readings to be a major area of fraudulent activity earning \u00a3140 million per annum. \nWe request the creation of testing centres to assess individual\u2019s claimed abilities are either paranormal or can be explained in mundane terms. Those passing such an assessment would be issued a licence, legally permitting them to commercially offer their services as a practitioner. This document, however, should acknowledge that even apparently authentic psychic abilities are neither precise nor predictable.",
