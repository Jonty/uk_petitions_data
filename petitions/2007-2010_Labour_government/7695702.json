            "background": "A few years back in the 80's or nearabouts, Brent Cross Shopping Centre became the home of the most beautiful fountain with a ceiling of coulured squares. They soon however demolished it all down to create a space where they could set up stalls. We all who have signed this petition urge the Brent Cross to replace this ugly square and replace back to the fountain and coloured squares we all loved and have memories of as children so that we can cherish it as it was back then.",
