            "background": "The government needs to assure the markets that the banking sector in the UK is financially sound. As banks do not trust each other it is time that the FSA, The Treasury and the Bank of England call on UK banks to present a detailed financial report in private to them.\n\nThis report would then be used to assess the health of these banks and also aide in producing an appropriate targetted aide package. \n\nBanks that have been found to be working outside of prudent banking practise would have their Chief Executives sanctioned, with some losing the right to work in the financial section for a set time period i.e. just like in the case of bankrupcy.\n\nFollowing this action banks would inidvidually be mandated to set their lending criteria for new propestive customers and then would be mandated to start the loans process in accordance with this criteria. Mortgages should have some mandated maxima set by the Treasury and as such mortgages could also start to flow again.",
