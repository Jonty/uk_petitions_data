            "background": "We (as lettings agents) have to turn away the majority of \"DSS\" or housing benefit enquiries we get because landlords are scared of, and we cannot condone, payments being made in arrears to the tenants directly in most cases. This has created a shortage of housing, and demand for more to be built or bought by PPP's and housing associations. A stigma has been created and sadly those tenants that don't pass the rent on are doing so at the detriment of the (increasing number of) good tenants that have been caught out in the recession. The council should be able to in EVERY case pay a regulated and respected agent, to \"sure up\" the relationship between a DSS tenant and a prospective landlord.",
