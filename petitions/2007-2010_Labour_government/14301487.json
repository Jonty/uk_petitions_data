        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A significant percentage of disruption to traffic in adverse Winter weather stems from large vehicles being unable to pass certain sections of road, they range from jack-knifed lorries to those unable to gain traction on a gradiant. Compulsory snow chains for vehicles of 7.5 tonnes and above between October and March would aid the situation and keep the roads clearer for longer.\nThe cost of purchasing snow chains is negligable in comparison to the cost to the haulage business of vehicles out of action and the cost to the nation for the impassable routes.\nOther countries in the EU already have mandatory chains in Winter, this would not be revolutionary.",
