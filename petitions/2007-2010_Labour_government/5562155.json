            "background": "Background\nAlphonsus claimed asylum in April 2006 when the political situation in Nigeria deteriorated. Alphonsus is an Igbo from the south-east area( Biafra) in Nigria and belongs to MASSOB (Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra) who are campaigning for the independence of the Biafra region of Nigeria. He was detained and tortured following attendance of  MASSOB meetings there. He has continued to actively campaign in the UK to highlight the abuse and persecution of the Biafran people and the brutal murder of MASSOB members and Igbos by the Nigerian government through the Biafran Actualisation Forum (BAF) and the Biafra Liberation League (BLL) in his capacity as the Director of Communications. MASSOB members here are active in the campaign for Alphonsus. They have issued a statement which contains the following: \n\n\u201cMr Okafor-Mefor is a MASSOB leader who has taken a key role in this peaceful struggle and, if he is deported back to Nigeria, unequivocally his life will be in danger. Even UK foreign office officials have confirmed that Nigeria takes a \u201ctough stand\u201d (diplomatic terminology for persecution and killing!) on MASSOB activism.\u201d",
