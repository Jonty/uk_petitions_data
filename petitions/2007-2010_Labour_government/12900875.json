I believe that our governments needs to make our immigration laws tougher and stop giving illegal immigrants such an easy life when they do get here. Our government has once again been under pressure from the French government to tighten its control over illegal immigrants yet nothing has been done. Our economy is getting worse by the day, people are losing their jobs, risk losing their homes however immigrants keep coming here believing they will find work and a home and if we keep taking more and more illegal immigrants it is going to ruin this once great country.",
