Mortgage Approved and in the Underwriter's in-tray, \u00a31300 spent out, and all of a sudden the seller \"changes his mind and accepts a higher offer\"\n\nI call, with this petition, that The Goverment follow suit of the Scottish, and Outlaw Gazumping.  For the sake of those who are struggling to get on the property ladder, like myself, and find themselves in a worse financial situation, with nothing but a smack in the mouth to show for it.\n\nProposed Law Change - An accepted offer is Legally Binding.  If the seller changes their mind, they are responsible for the fees paid out by the buyer, and compensation for heart-ache involved.\n\nWho will sign?",
