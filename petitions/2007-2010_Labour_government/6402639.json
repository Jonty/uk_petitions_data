        "background": "Looks like a strange list of states, doesn't it? I'll tell you why it is important to conclude FTAs with the governments of these states: because in all of those countries there uranium ore reserves (big reserves in most of them). Because we need much nuclear fuel for our current and future nuclear reactors, it is important. And it would enable them to export uranium ore to Britain, thus earning money.",
