            "background": "Take immediate steps ensure that business and industry come into line with the law regarding \u201cDuty of care\u201d.\nFossil fuels are great contributors to greenhouse gasses, every opportunity should be taken to reduce any and all emissions of these directly or indirectly into the environment along with other free form radicals that are either a product or a by product of their  industrial processes. There is a defining point where any given system can become unbalanced to the point of saturation.\nOnce that point is reached the system will no longer function and equilibrium will be lost. The Planets Eco system is of paramount importance, therefore every initiative should be seized as an opportunity to advance the world in safe practices regarding the environment.\nDuty of care should mean that no one should willfully or by neglect cause illness or suffering to an individual/s as a direct or indirect result of their actions.",
