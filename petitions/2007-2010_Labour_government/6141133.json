            "background": ",Allow the drug Velcade to be given to John McNamara who is a patient in St James`s Hospital Leeds.John was told he would be given the drug on Friday 10th August. On arriving at St James's Hospital he was told the North Yorkshire Primary Care Trust had refused funding even though patients on the same ward were to recieve the drug as they lived in West Yorkshire and were to be given funding for the drug . We feel this is both morally and emotionally reprehensible and we hope the Prime Minister will make a positive decision in this case thereby possibly extending the life of this young man who probably has only months to live.",
