            "background": "The protection of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the UK is grossly inadequate, and many people are not even aware that Grey Seals are still killed perfectly legally if they threaten to damage fishing nets or have entered fish farms, and no specific licence is required. We the undersigned request that the deliberate or negligent killing of Grey Seals be prohibited under any circumstances, including as accidental bycatch, regardless of their proximity to commercial fishing vessels, or sites of marine aquaculture, that no licences are granted, and any existing licences are revoked immediately.",
