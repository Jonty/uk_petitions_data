        "background": "To name two examples of lying, he said he wasn't looking at the polls when he decided not to call a general election in 2007; he also said that he was never planning on sacking Alistair Darling as Chancellor.\n\nHis election cry \"British jobs for British workers\" was, as he must have known, unenforcible, and so may equally be considered a lie.\n\nIt is not possible for a government to function with the support of people when it cannot be trusted, and the damage done by this mockery of the British public will extend beyond the current PM's time in office.",
