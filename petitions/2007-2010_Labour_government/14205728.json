            "background": "The UK is in dire financial straights & the Prime Minister has the audacity to pledge 1.5 Billion pounds of the UK's tax payer money to fund poorer countries climate change policies. The population of the UK is suffering enough & will continue to suffer for many years to come because of the bankrupt state that the government has got this country into, & the UK cannot afford to donate any more funds to countries outside the UK. The priority of this government should be to get the UK economy back on track before pledging funds that we do not have. Any rational & sensible government would control this irresponsible expenditure & ensure that UK takes priority. You cannot spend your way out of debt in this manner otherwise we will be in the mire even further than we are now. You, Your children, Your Grand Children & probably Great Grand Children will be paying the countries debt off due to the insane decisions like this donation made in your name by this government. Stop them now. Oh & just by coincidence the government has stripped 1.5 Billion Pounds from the defence budget !!!!!",
