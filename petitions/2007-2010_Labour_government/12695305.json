            "background": "We belive that the Sri Lanka governement has commited many war crimes, especially in the last few months by showing total disregard for tamil civilians and killing them. the sri lankan government has been able to get away with this under the watching eye of the whole world. The Sri Lankan Government must face war crime charges. The western goverments of the world have a duty to the people of this world to stop indiscriminate killings and mistreatment especially by the hands of another recognised state goverment. The evidence of these war crimes must be collected now before it is too late and has been hidden. The sri lanka government must allow media and aid angiencies access into the most affected areas to show they care and have nothing to hide. By signing this petition we demand action from the british goverment.",
