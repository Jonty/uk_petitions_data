            "background": "I belive that it is the right time for the Honour of a Knighthood to be awarded to lenny Henry, as he is a man of many talents, he has shown us that with comedy, lives can and have been changed.\n\nFrom his early start, as a hand full of Black actors during the  70's he has helped changed the way this country see's people of ethinic origins. \n\nMr Henry's attitude to life is mirrored in his views in helping others that may not have had the start in life they would wish for.  \n\nThrough Comic Relife, over \u00a3100 million pounds has been raised to help people in the Third World and More importantly, within the UK.\n\nThis is a man who should be appluded by his country for what he has done both to raise your sprits with laughter and raise awarness of the plight of others.\n\nPlease Sign this petition and make 'Sir Lenny Henry'",
