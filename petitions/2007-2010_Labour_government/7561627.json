        "background": "We recognise the government\u2019s good intentions in its early-years policy-making, but are concerned about the EYFS legislation, which comes into force in England next September.\n\nOur concerns focus on the learning and development requirements, as follows:\n\n1. They may harm children\u2019s development\n\n2. They will restrict parents\u2019 freedom of choice in childcare and education\n\n3. Their assessment profile requirements may place an unnecessary bureaucratic burden on those who care for young children\n\n4. Recent evidence suggests that government interventions in education generally may not be driving standards up and may be putting too much pressure on children",
