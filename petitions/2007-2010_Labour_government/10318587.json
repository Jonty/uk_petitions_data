All in a space of 24 hours.\n\nThis petition is urging the Prime Minister to incur tougher sentences on the perpetrators of such crimes.  \n\nThis country is going to pieces and unless something is done about it, it will only get worse.\n\nThe sentence never fits the crime here, we are way to soft, its time to toughen up.\n\nHow many more families have to go through the heartbreak of losing a loved one, parents are outliving their children in this violent country, we are going backwards not forwards, its time to make a stance.",
