            "background": "This petition demands that the prime minister calls a vote of no confidence in the current administration.\nWith such scandals as not giving a referendum on the EU treaty, losing confidential personal data, the northern rock fiasco, people\u2019s pensions being sucked dry, horrendous levels of taxation upon petrol and diesel, and many other incompetent acts.\nThe people who sign this petition are rightly fed up with poor leadership, they demand a government that is capable of delivering world class services our tax pays for, and also we want policy that is good for our nation and people.\nUnder the current limp administration this is not possible.",
