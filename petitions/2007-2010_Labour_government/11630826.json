            "background": "as there are laws about boy racers and such already ,if they create a nuisance there car is marked by the police and further annoyance means they are impounded and crushed under i think section 59\nthis petition is for the people who use there car as normal but like an extreme sporty tone but go about normal daily business IE drive to she shops, take the girl friend home etc. and as well the sound of the sporty tone is a good deterant against some more popular road accidents that on faster roads for example animals,walkers,horses as they are alerted to the car coming and therefore would mainly choose to avoid being in the path of the car due to the loud exhaust warning them. and as we live in a free country we should be able to express ourselves through the styling of the cars tone .\nkit cars tvr,s and such cars all display a loud tone and this is acceptable to pass an MOT \nI propose this new MOT rule be abolished and allow the laws already in place to deal with so called BOY racers i like to call them people who have an interest and who are not out robbing cars and houses to feed there crack habbit \nmany thanks for your attention",
