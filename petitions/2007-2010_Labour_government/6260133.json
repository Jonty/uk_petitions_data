        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The best way to tackle prostitution of today is to criminalze men who use prostitutes, by doing this will have a devastating effect on this most in-humane and biggest violation of women's rights. In 2002 Sweden created a legislation to do exactly this, since then they have reduced prostitution very dramatically and have very little problem with Sex Traffickers.  I urge the UK public to make a voice to do the same thing, as this may be the best way of tackling today's prostitution.  I have heard people say that prostitution is always going to be here, for as long as PUNTERS who use and abuse women are allowed to get away with this crime then maybe these people are correct, however by the general public making a stand against this then I believe we all can make prostitution a thing of the past. I urge anyone and everyone to do the right thing and between us let us all allow these victims of crime the freedom they deserve.\n\nPlease sign this petition and let the government know that YOU will not tolerate the ultimate violation of women's rights.",
