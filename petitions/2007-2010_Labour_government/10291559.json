            "background": "The government are not prepared to further invest in the Silverstone circuit to keep the British Grand Prix at the track that started Formula One in the 50's.  However they have previously invested in highways infrastructure at public cost around the the A43.  If the race is moved to Donnington the highway infrastructure will need upgrading, at public cost.  This will mean that the costs already implemented around Silverstone are no longer of such benefit.  Surely the government and public would benefit from investment being sent to Silverstone to make the most of the public money already spent.  Additionally, the local economy around Silverstone relies largely on the event and the government has a responsibility to protect the local economy.",
