            "background": "There are some mini roundabouts positioned so it is impossible for any car to go around it without going over it or kissing the kerb. If you drive past one of these on your driving tests, you fail as the Highway Code quotes ' All vehicles MUST pass round the central markings except large vehicles which are physically incapable of doing so.' So test instructors don't classify a driving school car as large. Or the DVLA should decide if a mini roundabout is badly positioned so no car can go around properly, they should not to use that road on a test route. I have failed one of my driving tests doing this and know of many others doing the same.",
