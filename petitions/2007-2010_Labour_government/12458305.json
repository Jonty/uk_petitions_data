Those thus broken laws of economics are purely psychological:- egos, commands, wagers, loyalty - all these are elements of human society having no link to to the patterns objective of physics rather than subjectivities of individuals. The breach of psychological economics by the efficiency demands of IP in conjunction with IT require a physical paradigm of value.
