        "action": "stop the licensing of oil companies to explore for oil around the Falkland Islands, as such exploration would not be in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The location of the Falkland Islands so close to Argentina makes an Argentian claim to sovereignty understandable, while the British government no doubt would put forward a historical case. As there is a legitimate dispute over sovereignty, it is an unnecessarily provocative act for British companies to drill for oil in Falkland Islands' waters. Rather than risk the lives of yet more military personnel in another 20th Century-style oil war based on 19th Century-style gunship diplomacy, a war which we neither want nor can afford, the money could better serve UK energy needs by being diverted to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. For instance, a seemingly tokenistic boiler scrappage scheme, likely to soon run out of funds, could be continued, and the Falkland Islands could trial wave and tidal power schemes, to the benefit of the islanders, under the auspices of a non-political scientific joint UK-Argentinian research institute, in a spirit of 21st Century friendship and co-operation.",
