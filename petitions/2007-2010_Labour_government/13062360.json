        "action": "support voluntary youth organisations by increasing the weight limit covered by the Permit 19.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The section 19 Small Bus Permit scheme allows drivers without minibus category (D1) on their licences to drive minibuses for voluntary groups, up to a maximum authorised mass (MAM) of 3500kg. This petition proposes that the weight limit is increased to 4000kg. Justification is as follows:\n- Modern 17-seater minibuses are over the 3500kg limit, typically around 3800kg \n- Since 1997, D1 entitlement is no longer given to those passing the car test, the proportion of drivers affected is steadily increasing\n- Power steering etc. on modern minibuses is better and improving - weight is not necessarily the deciding factor in safety\n- D1 licences are expensive & time consuming to obtain, time often the deciding factor for volunteers who already give up significant personal time to cover many activities provided for local youth\n- The Prime Minister has previously expressed his support for youth organisations (e.g. Cadet Forces). This is an opportunity for the PM to show this support & appreciation for the often difficult & always worthy work that volunteers carry out.",
