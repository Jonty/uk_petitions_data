            "background": "Trafford Park Station lies on the Liverpool to Manchester railway. Despite its name, the station is located in Stretford, about half a mile to the north of the town centre.\nIt provides a reasonable service at peak-times with trains running half-hourly in both directions. It is valued by the many commuters who use it and also by students of the next-door Trafford College technology centre. \n\nThe station is less utilised by shoppers and part-time workers, as during off peak times most of the local trains are not timetabled to stop there. This wastes a valuable resource to a densely populated area of Stretford. There is no promotion of the station with no directional signs to it. The station\u2019s name is confusing as it is not located in Trafford Park and no longer provides access to that area.\n\nWe call upon GMPTE, Northern Rail, Network Rail and Trafford Council to work together:\n\n\u2022 To provide a Sunday Service\n\u2022 To provide a full commuter service throughout the off peak period \n\u2022 To promote the station through better signage, lighting and consulting residents on a change of name for the station to better reflect its vicinity.",
