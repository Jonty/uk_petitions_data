            "background": "The Prime Minister and other ministers are highly critical of Iran and North Korea`s nuclear programs.\n\nMembers of the government should treat Israel and Iran (and others) equally, so when making statements. All government ministers should state clearly where referring  to Iran and North Korea, that Israel is also in violation of UN resolutions and refuses to sign the None Proliferation Treaty.\n\nThe British government is wholly \"racist\" in its treatment of Iran and North Korea and the only conclusion I can draw from this position, is a desire to plunge the world into another world war.",
