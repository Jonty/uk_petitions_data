            "background": "Some countries in the EU charge foreign drivers for the use of their roads - examples are Switzerland, Italy and France. In France last year we paid the equivalent of more than a year's road tax to use their 'motorways', or 'peage' as they call them, for a 2 week holiday.  Surely we should charge foreigners entering our country with motor vehicles - this would not put them off coming over here but would bring in a huge amount of revenue.",
