            "background": "As Baby P's legacy, pls sign this petition asking the government to implement changes to help better protect children at risk:\n\nIf on 2 occasions the authorities (police/medical) advise against a child being returned to its family, Social Services should not be allowed to overrule this\n\nSocial workers should insist that a child's key clothing & chocolate etc be removed at every visit as these may hide a multitude of sins\n\nIf a social worker is denied access to a child or living quarters social workers should call on the police to gain immediate access\n\nIf a carer says a child is with someone else, this must be verified immediately\n\nIf the carer fails to attend any appointment set by social services, the child must be seen without delay\n\nIf abusive pet owners can be banned from keeping animals, a similar law should be in place to protect children from abusive carers or carers who allow a child to be abused\n\nIf Social Services refer a child for assessment, the doctor should do a full examination",
