He stepped back and did not I repeat did not bow his head or even nod.  I have ran and re-ran the tape of this and he just has that blank expression on his face.  He thinks he is above everyone else on this earth, and doesn't care about whose feelings he upsets, he doesn't care about the Soldiers being killed in Afghanistan and other places where our soldiers are being sent to fight other peoples war.\nHe should hang his head in shame, the televison caught the expression on his face and it says it all.  If it had been in Henry V111 time then we should have said off with his head.",
