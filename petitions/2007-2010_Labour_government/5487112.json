            "action": "remove the requirement for anyone who chooses not to receive the BBC television signal to have to pay the BBC television receiver tax which is handed, in its entirety, to BBC managers and not shared equally among all television programmers - both terrestrial and satellite.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The senior managers in the BBC have recently awarded themselves a substantial and immoral pay rise while at the same time failing to provide high quality programming.  There are many options for receiving television signals in this hi-tech age and it is possible to bar the BBC signal.  It is an anachronism and THEFT to require a BBC Television Licence to be purchased by anybody who chooses not to watch BBC programmes.  It is about time the BBC was made to operate in a competitive environment to stop this monumental non-oversighted handout of money which is given to them willy nilly (and which, it appears, they can spread around to benefit themselves without hindrance) regardless of the quality or amount of new programming they produce.",
