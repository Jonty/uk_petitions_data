        "background": "As a student, i already find it hard to pay for food and University supplies after i have forked out for rent and tuition fees, so how can i afford to pay for prescriptions, dental care, eye examinations and the like. I do not think it is fair that people on the Dole, claiming benefits, get free NHS service, whilst we students, who often live off much lesser budget a week than those claiming dole and benefits,have to fork out obscene amounts of money which we just don't have. Through this petition i will prove that many other students across the country agree with me and hopefully bring this matter to attention.",
