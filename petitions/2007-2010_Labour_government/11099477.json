        "background": "VAT is effectively a regressive tax - that means that people of lesser wealth or lower income pay more of the tax as a proportion of that wealth or income than those who are better off. This is unfair.\nVAT also constrains individuals' freedom to buy whatever they please within the limits of the law. By increasing the end-price of many goods the government is effectively herding the public toward certain choices. This is illiberal. True, some goods are designated as necessities and are exempt or subject to lower rates - but can we trust the government to make the right choices here? A recent petition to remove VAT on sanitry products was rejected. This seems obviously unfair, especially as men's razors are exempt.\n\nIncome tax provides a potentially progressive system of taxation which is more fair and does not limit freedom in the insideous manner of VAT.",
