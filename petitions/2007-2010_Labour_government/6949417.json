        "background": "HGVs cause the most pollution of any vehicle type and are the primary source of congestion on our roads,\nTheir \"drag racing\" habits of driving in lane 1 at 56mph and lane 2 at 56.2mph effectively reduce our motorways and trunks roads to single carriageways for the rest of us. How many of us have been stuck behind an HGV in lane 2 of the A14 for mile after mile as they creep past their buddies churning black smoke out as they go? Lets get the freight back on the railways where it belongs.",
