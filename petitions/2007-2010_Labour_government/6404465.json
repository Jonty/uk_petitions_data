            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As a 17 year-old male, living in suburban Yorkshire, the cheapest quote for third-party insurance I can obtain, on a \u00a32500 group 1 car, is \u00a31700. My experience is common amongst young people.\n\nInsurers who discount for Pass Plus mostly charge more expensive premiums in the first place; in addition to the cost of obtaining Pass Plus this negates the discount.\n\nSome brokers offer significantly cheaper insurance that is invalid for late-night journeys. These offers are unavailable to the youngest drivers.\n\nThe majority need ways to prove less risk is presented than the minority who do drive dangerously and/or break the law.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nForce brokers to not discriminate unjustifiably and so extend offers of 'Pay-As-You-Drive' and limited-hours insurance to people of all ages.\n\nForce brokers to discount insurance if we allow speed-limiters/speed recording devices/breathalysers to be fitted in our vehicles to prove we don't break the law.\n\nSubsidise insurance on group 1 vehicles which are the least dangerous and most economical.\n\nCreate a new qualification to prove mastery of advanced driving skills, and force brokers to offer significant discounts if it is obtained.",
