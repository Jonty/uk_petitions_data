            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Veal farming is banned in the UK because it is deemed a cruel form of livestock farming yet the british govt is quite happy to export british calves abroad to  be reared on veal farms. \n\nVeal farming is when male calves are taken from their mothers within 24 - 48hours of birth.  The calves are then kept in separate crates only 2 feet wide and there is no room for the calf to lie down, stretch or turnaround, their movement is restricted to keep their flesh succulent.  In some countries they even put a chain around the calves necks and tether them within the crate to restrict movement even further. The calves are slaughtered within a few months of been born. \n\nEvery year thousands of british male calves (a bi-product of dairy cows) are exported abroad to for veal farming.  If our british male calves are not exported abroad for veal farming, they will be shot shortly after birth because they are of no value to the farmer - sounds like a mercy killing when compared to the alternative of living an inhumane life.",
