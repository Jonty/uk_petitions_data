History informs us that excessive taxation and prohibition only further encourages lawbreaking.  We have the right to be able to live free of 'stealth taxation', that eats away at our quality of life and the simple pleasures that we have. The long arm of the UK Government should not reach into our kitchens, our empty purses and onto our dining room tables, taking unnecessarily, under the guise of discouraging abuse.",
