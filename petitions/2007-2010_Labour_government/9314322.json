            "background": "In the spirit of the government's passion for banning anything that people actually enjoy doing, it is requested that a total ban on everything good is introduced as soon as possible.  Examples of this are drinking alcohol, going on holiday, owning pets, smoking in private places, using the internet, watching tv, shopping, driving, breathing (excessively), sleeping, talking.  We could then have a country more like Cuba or Tibet and the rest of the world would take pity on us, send us money and fight for our rights to do all these things again.",
