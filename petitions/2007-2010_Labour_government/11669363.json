            "background": "There is a lack of housing available for adults (and their children if applicable) who are classified as vulnerable. Unless you are severely mentally handicapped, severely physically handicapped or have severe learning difficulties (eg Down's Syndrome, Autism) there are very little support. Many local authorities only offer tenancy support to those living in council properties - many people who need help are not in one of those or cannot get a local authority property. Many adults (especially those fleeing abuse) needs support to regain their life. I have just come out of one and there needs to be more like them out there.",
