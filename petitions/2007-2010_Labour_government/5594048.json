To him we are the milch cow of the world and he is working towards wiping England [with help of the E.U.]of the map. This is treason. Therefore he does not qualify for the job of Prime Minister of England. Come on you English, before he dismantles any more of our country,before he makes it impossible to protest at having our rights and liberties detroyed and before he makes it impossible to vote him out,sign this petition now. Go home Mr Brown,Scotland has its own government which as a Scottish M.P. is where you belong.",
