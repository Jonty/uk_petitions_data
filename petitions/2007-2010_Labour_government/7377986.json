            "background": "Citizenship to Britain should only be granted to individuals that are members of other EU nations, falling within a certain criteria of similarities in human rights, economic stability, healthcare, education, etc.\nThe drain on our society with immigration from nations lacking balance in these areas, and where citizenship is granted to individuals from these nations, is the cause of immense drain on our society. We need to preserve British and European culture, not make Europe into asia, the middle east or other obscure cultures too far from our own ideals and social rights.",
