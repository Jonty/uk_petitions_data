            "background": "It seems both unfair and unhelpful that there is an apparent segregation in planned services for the parents of obese children in Scotland in comparison to those in England and Wales.\n\nWhilst a proactive and positive approach has been adopted in Scotland by launching a scheme to provide younger school children with free school dinners to tackle obesity, it seems that English and Welsh parents may be sent a letter of warning if their children are obese.\n\nIt would seem both sensible and fair that instead of providing English and Welsh parents with a warning letter that is a far more negative approach and of questionable practical help, they should receive the more helpful and productive scheme that we have seen launched in Scotland. It seems highly unfair that parents of English and Welsh children should be treated differently than those of Scottish parents in a matter that affects the whole of Britain.",
