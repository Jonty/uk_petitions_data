Samantha is 20 years old, pregnant, British, and has not been allowed anywhere near a fair level of contact with a solicitor. Her trial has just been moved forward to next week, which gives any solicitor little chance to prepare a defense.\nWe ask the Prime Minister, quite simply, not to let the Laotians kill her (and, preferably, to secure her safe return to the UK).",
