            "background": "Door to door salespeople prey on the elderly, the unintelligent and the naive. They normally sell products and services which either severely overpriced, unneeded by the customer, don't complete the job or have bad customer service. Plus some door to door salespeople will not take 'NO!' for an answer and some have spent several hours in people's houses before police intervention is required. If people do want to buy double glazing, change their energy provider etc, they should contact the company directly, not the company contacts them.",
