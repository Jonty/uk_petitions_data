            "background": "Given that the UK Government are currently considering a rescue plan for Jaguar Landrover they should incorporate this into a wider plan to revitalise the UK's ailing automotive industry. Since the loss of MG Rover in 2005 there has been no UK owned mass car production, most importantly in the small/medium car sector. The government should buy back Jaguar Landrover and resurrect MG Rover forming these companies into a group large enough to sustain ongoing sales and development of new world leading models. A government led programme like this is just the jobs boost the UK needs. Let's make Britain great again!",
