            "background": "There is an alarming increase in RSPCA animal cruelty allegations being brought before the Courts by this charity, Many cases lack legal credibilty and have not stood any legal tests before being given court time, why?\nMost of these cases are not challenged by the CPS and affect Women who in the main care for the animals they have.\nLooking at many cases , we feel that this is simply being allowed to continue to convict more women. Indeed this could be discrimination at the highest level.\nWe would like a judicial review on how these cases are being brought to Courts with immediate effect.",
