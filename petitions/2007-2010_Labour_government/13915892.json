            "background": "People in Britain deserve the right to feel safe in their own homes, without the threat of them being invaded and burgled by the lawless minority. I urge the government to make it law that if anyone trespasses in your home then you should have the right to defend it and yourself and family by any means necessary. At the moment you may only act if they come upstairs. So how does this help those in bungalows of flats? \n\nI believe it should be made a basic human right to defend yourself, your family and your home, regardless of where they are in your home. They should not be tresspassing there and must face the consequences if they do.",
