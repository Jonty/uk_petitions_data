            "background": "I propose that all product packaging should be marked with a \"green\" or \"grey\" mark to indicate which bin should be used. This mark should be obtained from government or new NGO and linked to an environmental tax against the packager(this government department/NGO can therefore be self funding). A green mark indicates that the packaging can be fully recycled and therefore placed in the green bin and so no tax should be due; however if the packaging has a grey mark then it should be placed in the grey bin and taxed on the basis of its volume.",
