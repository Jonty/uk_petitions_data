        "background": "please help Breakthrough Breast Cancer in their \"Constant Reminder?\" Living with Lymphoedema campaign. We want to make sure that the NICE guidance on \"Improving Supportive and Palliative Care for Adults with Cancer\" by December 2009 is implemented in a timely manner. This condition cannot be cured, but it can be managed effectively if patients have access to appropriate services. It is vital that all patients who experience lymphoedema following breast cancer are able to access these services to ensure that they can manage their condition and ensure its minimum impact on their quality of life. At present services are very few and needs are not being met. Also, further research is needed. \nplease sign this petition.",
