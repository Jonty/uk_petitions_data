            "background": "I think the government's attitude towards public transport is ridiculous. They believe that it should be run as a business. Experience has shown that it is impossible to run a decent public transport system in this way.\n\nI believe that public transport should be operated by councils and central government, on a break even basis. Money from profitable services would be used to fund unprofitable ones. Any extra shortfall would be met by public subsidy.\n\nThe government regularly claims that it is trying to reduce the burden on taxpayers, but many taxpayers would like to see some of their taxes spent on a world-class, integrated and cheap public transport network. What about the millions gained every year through fuel taxes, where do they go? And don't forget ,the users of public transport are taxpayers!",
