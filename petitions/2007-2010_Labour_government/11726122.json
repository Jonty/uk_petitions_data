        "background": "Everybody knew snow was coming long before it fell.  What has followed has been a joke. 5 days of road closures, train disruptions, air disruption. Schools closed, businesses closed and university's closed.\n\nSurely it is obvious by now that the preparations were woefully inadequate. This is a petition to create a realistic strategy to deal with such events. A strategy that will keep roads, rail track and runways clear of snow.\n\nWhat has been the cost to the economy for all of this? Surely a bit of planning and proper implementation would have been worth the investment.",
