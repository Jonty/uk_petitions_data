            "background": "The Russian government seeks to deny its own citizens the opportunity to benefit from the educational services of the British Council in Russia, yet numerous Russian politicians and diplomats have sent their children to university in the UK, including Sergei Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister.\n\nNothing better illustrates the shameless hypocrisy of the Russian government. They are only too happy to send their children to be educated here, or their wives to shop on Bond Street, or for themselves to attend matches at the Emirates Stadium, yet they would deny their own citizens the opportunity to benefit from cultural contact with Britain. \n\nLet's put a stop to this. Ban all Russian officials from sending their children to college here, and make their other cultural activities much more difficult. \n\nPerhaps then they will rethink their confrontational, bullying stance towards Britain and Europe.",
