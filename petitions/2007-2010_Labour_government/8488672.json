            "background": "The concept of a league is that it\u2019s equal - each team plays every other one. Usually twice, once at home and once away to compensate for the perceived \u201chome\u201d advantage, but any number of times is fair. \n\nThe Premier League are discussing adding a \u201crandom\u201d but seeded match  - meaning that each team would play 18 teams twice, and one three times.\n\n\u201cWhat effect could that have on promotion and relegation issues? Are we going to see local derbies played in a foreign country thousands of miles away? Are supporters supposed to accept missing on the biggest games of their season because it\u2019s being played on the other side of the planet?\u201d Football Supporters\u2019 Federation Chairman Malcolm Clarke\n\nThis would destroy the level and equal league system that's been working for 120 years - NO TO GAM\u00a3 39",
