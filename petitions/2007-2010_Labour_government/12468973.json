Over the past twelve years the British people have grown tired and become ever more frustrated as this Labour government has dismantled the economy, stolen our most basic rights, cheapened our sovereignty and surrendered our borders in the most outrageous act of treason this country has ever witnessed.\n\nWe, the British people, are demanding an end to the failure and moral destruction that is the hallmark of the Labour Government; and as such we demand that this government be dissolved so that we, the British people, can elect a new government with the best interests of this country to heart.",
