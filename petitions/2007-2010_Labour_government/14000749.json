With our Monarch as its formal Head of State.\n\nNo government of whatever persuasion shall have the right to introduce any legislation either by stealth,ignorance or subterfuge which alters this tradition, without the express permission of its electorate. Should any attempt at such changes be made, Parliament must always first seek approval by the electorate via a referendum if no Democratic Election be pending.\n\nThis petition also requests that all potential members of Parliament agree to uphold these traditions before putting themselves forward for election.\n\nAny member of Parliament who fails to honour this undertaking must resign their seat immediately and forfeit any severance/retirement benefits\n\nGod save our Queen!",
