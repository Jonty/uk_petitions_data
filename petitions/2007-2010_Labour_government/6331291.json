            "background": "Around 10% (1 in 10) people have dyslexic tendencies, with about 4% severe and 6% mild to moderate problems.\n Dyslexia can affect all backgrounds and abilities, from people with literacy difficulties to people with advanced doctorate degrees. Most people associate dyslexia with reading and spelling difficulties, however, difficulties include poor short term memory, you also have dysbraxia what is co -ordination fine motor skills and balance, then there is dyscalculia what is maths.\n I suffer from this entire thing and was not diagnosed until I was 20!   when dyslexia if picked up in the early years between the ages of 4-7 can be helped and can make a big difference in the future that is why I want EVERY child to be tested when they begin school, so theses learning difficulties can be helped and the child can have a happy school life and not have to worry about being \"stupid\" and do not want other children to suffer in silence like i did.",
