Its about time Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt were recognised for their outstanding contribution to British music. The band is a legend, still playing to sell out concert halls across the world. Its 40 years since their first single, surely it should be arise Sir Francis and Sir Rick? Many other artists with a fraction of these guys success have been recognised. Lets do the right thing and reward Britains greatest rock n roll band.",
