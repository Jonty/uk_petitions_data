        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The lack of dignity, shortage of staff and bad treatment caused by bad communication and too much emphasis on targets is hampering the work the doctors and nurses do, It is now time for the prime minister to call in all uk hospital chief executives and demand an action plan with reporting to the public to do away with at least 50% of targets, and to reduce administration staff and managers by 50%.  Savings would be spent on equipment and care and retraining of staff in respect for the elderly i.e. treat them as you would want to be treated\n\nThe elderly MUST stop being treated as a number, and given the same respect as those of 20 or 30 the attitude because they are old they don\u2019t matter that much must stop, it causes distress and pain both for them and relatives and they deserve better.  The Prime minister must remember that it is these people that fought for us all during the war and we owe our freedom of today to that, in their last years in hospital they are treated with respect and not ignored.  I call on the prime minister to call a meeting with all uk hospital chief executives to order change and announce their plans to stop this ongoing disgraceful situation.",
