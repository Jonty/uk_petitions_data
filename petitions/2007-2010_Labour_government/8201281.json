            "background": "There are cases where parents to not care what their children do, and in these cases they should be held partially responsible for their children's actions.  However, in many cases children come from loving respectible homes.  There should be tougher penalties for children who commit such crimes.  Tougher penalties will:\n1) Perhaps make them think twice before comitting crime in the first place, and 2) Make them face the consequences of their actions.\n\nIn some instances, where the child is suffering abuse at home, the child should also be offered help, but also taught that actions bring consequences. \n\nToo many children are getting away with commiting serious crimes.  Children, as well as adults, need to be taught lessons.  A slap on the wrist is not always appropriate, and obviously judging by what we are hearing on the news daily, is not enough!!",
