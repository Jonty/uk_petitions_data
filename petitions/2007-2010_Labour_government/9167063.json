            "background": "The Change to guidance issued by the ODPM/DCLG in 2006 is detrimental to the pension conditions of members of the firefighters pension scheme and differs from the guidance issued after consultation with stakeholders in 2004.\nThe result is that Firefighters who are injured or disabled will not be entitled to a pension of any sort and will be sacked even if they are capable of being redeployed.\nWe therefore urge you to revert to original 2004 guidance that supports the statutory provisions of the Firefighters Pension Scheme",
