            "background": "Flockton is village located on the A637 in West Yorks. The A637 is the main link for travelling between Huddersfield, from the M1 South, Barnsley, South Wakefield, and Sheffield.\n\nAs traffic levels increase, this is causing serious congestion and safety issues. As a response, the authorities used Traffic calming measures in the village to make it safer, such one way chicanes, crossings, a radar speed signs, and clearly marked parking areas.\n\nIn response to the measures already put in place, safety has not improved in the village, and it has become harder for the roads to clear traffic. Traffic queues for miles out of either side of the village and people can\u2019t get out of their driveways during peak hours.\n\nHouse prices are sinking, the road condition is appalling, villagers are unhappy.\n\nThe council\u2019s response is they don't have the funds so they can only afford to maintain. The village, Huddersfield, and motorists want and need this! Traffic levels are only going to increase.",
