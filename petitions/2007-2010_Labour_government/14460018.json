            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\nI am a UK citizen and Labour Party voter since 1992. I am originally from Eritrea and law binding citizen of this great country. I felt sad to hear that the UK is behind the UNSC sanction against Eritrea and that make me very upset and angry. Now I politely urge the Prime minister to instruct his representative in the UNSC to cancell the illegal and shameful sanction against Eritrea. Ethiopia is the main spoiler nation in the Horn region and the UK must ask Ethiopia to leave Eritrean territory occupied illegally and stop arming somali terrorists and interfer in somali affairs.\nsincerely\nMr K Measho",
