            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This academic year, MMU has made major changes to car parking regulations for student and staff.\n\nPrimary excuses include environment and income generation. The changes applied to MMU cheshire campus, which has poor public transport links and a lot of students and staff traveling considerable distances.\n\nThe few staff 'lucky' enough to get a parking permit also now have to pay and display!!!!!\n\nThe University needs to rectify the situation immediately as at present the situation is becoming untenable for residents and students alike as people are forced to park on residential roads, upsetting residents.\n\nMMU Cheshire needs a unique campus based parking policy to take into account its location and the fact transport is poor. Using the Manchester campus policies bodged for Chesire is NOT acceptable!!\n\nThe policy needs to be changed so that those who need to travel by car can park on campus. The university needs to understand that in many cases, banning cars increases costs for students to travel, wastes valuable personal study time and the fact many students have other commitments that cant wait for 3 buses to come at once an hour late!!!",
