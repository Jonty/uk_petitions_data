            "background": "Many people keep Goldfish in bowls or unfiltered containers which  are entirely unsuitable. Goldfish suffer in bowls, and if they dont suffocate or die of ammonia poisoning quickly will probably only live for several years, whereas in proper environments they can live for over 20 years.\n\nWe wouldnt put dogs in tiny cages for their whole lives, so why should goldfish be treated any differently?\n\nMany people believe that goldfish are not as intelligent as other pets, however they have been prooven to feel pain, and so Goldfish bowls should be banned",
