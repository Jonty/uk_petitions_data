            "background": "Millions of people use a blood pressure monitor to keep a record of their blood pressure to help detect and hopefully prevent any serious illnesses (and potentially death). We should not be penalised by the Government for something that we often have little control over. Blood pressure monitors are not luxury items bought on a whim. They provide invaluable guidance for a person suffering from a wide range of medical conditions, and the Government must acknowledge this and remove the VAT from these items immediately.",
