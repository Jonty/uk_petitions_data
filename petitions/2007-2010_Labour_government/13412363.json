This is detrimental to the health of the majority of the population who are not criminals.  We must have the human right to force the government to take action to protect us and if that means that we put convicted criminals to death, as a means of protecting the innocent, then so be it.  This is a decision which must not be left to a group of people who receive the absolute protection of the police forces of this country in everything they do and are therefore out of touch with the realities of life outside their cocoon of protection - our elected representatives.",
