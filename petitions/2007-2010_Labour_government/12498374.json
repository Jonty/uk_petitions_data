Should all have duty allocated accordingly. The highest levels paid on non essential use and the lowest by essential, HGV, public transport etc. \n\nThe current across the board fuel duty is an inherently unjust system, for example a disabled driver who has no option but to use a car daily should pay a lower level than a business driver who opts into a company car scheme and chooses to drive to work. Likewise hauliers should pay a lower level that a recreational driver. \n\nThis would be easily introduced via a card scanned at the pump to allocate the appropriate level of duty. \n\nIf this system were to be introduced it would eliminate most arguments concerned with unfair fuel duty.",
