            "background": "I was made redundant 6 months ago.  I was recently offered a 8 week contract but unable to take this because I would have to sign off. When I signed on again - I would have to wait another 16 weeks to get help with my mortgage interest and service charges.  This policy of 16 weeks penalizes those with mortgages - those people renting get their rents paid straight away and get more paid in cash than those with mortgages.",
