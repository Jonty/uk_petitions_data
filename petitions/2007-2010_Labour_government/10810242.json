Britain and the rest of the world needs you more than ever in this difficult climate. No other person in Britain can substitute you. I can see and feel there is a tiny corrupted regime exists within the labour party. They are like headless chickens. Tony Blair and his corrupted aides mostly responsible for today's law opinion poll. Millbank proved he not only just look like an idiot. Why are they still in your cabinet? It is time to eleminate those who betray your trust and show your strong leadership qualities.\nThank you\nYours Sincerely\nMarshel Arasan\nTel: 020 8866 4118\nMob : 07939 289 699",
