        "background": "Worcester City Council proposes to increase pitch fees for Little Perdiswell, Perdiswell and Brickfields facilites. We as sunday league football clubs find the council grossly insensitive in the current economic climate. Clubs currently pay \u00a3320 per season for home games on these pitches. Increasing these fees will have a damaging impact on local football clubs who enjoy these facilities. All signatories of this petition are helping to influence the council to reconsider the drastic increase in fees.",
