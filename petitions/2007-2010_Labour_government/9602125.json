            "background": "Fuel prices rise each week due to commodity gambling and greed on the part of sellers. If the G8 offered incentives to manufacturers to push alternatives in vehicles produced then over time our economies would not be so dependent upon oil producing states and might allow us to turn our backs on producers and the profiteering oil companies. \n\nWe know that oil prices will remain high for some time so offering tax incentives to manufacturers makes sense and is likely to be welcomed by the vehicle industry and in time the general public.",
