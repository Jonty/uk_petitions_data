The application is usually made to the coroner who has direct possession of the body. However, where the body is not returned to the UK (and is lying in a place from which it cannot be recovered) Section 15(1)(b) of the Coroners Act 1988 empowers the British government to order an inquest.\"\n\n(quoted from Reprieve press release, with minor changes)",
