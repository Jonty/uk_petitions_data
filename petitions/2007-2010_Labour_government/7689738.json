            "background": "The current ambition of the department for children, schools and families is for 90% of children to leave primary school being able to read and write by the year 2020 - an improvement on the 80% or so that manage now.  This means that in 12 years time we will be saying that it is acceptable for only 10% of our children to be ill-prepared to enter secondary education and almost certainly leave it ill-prepared for life.  Many of the illiterate and innumerate go on to become a perpetual drain on the country's resources instead of being productive members of society.  There are always going to be difficult cases but to aim for anything less than 100% is an excuse for our target driven education system to abandon problem children condemning them to a lifetime of underachievement.\n\nIndividual cases of illiteracy and/or innumeracy are almost invariably victims of unfortunate circumstances but the overall problem is a problem for our whole nation and we should therefore deal with the problem (and fund it) on a nationwide basis.\n\nSo why wait?  Let\u2019s make 2008 the year we eradicated illiteracy and innumeracy in our schools for good.",
