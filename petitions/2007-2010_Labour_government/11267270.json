            "background": "There is nothing more infuriating when you're running late (especially in a scenario where missing a train could result in missing an appointment completely) than having to spend time frantically searching your pockets for change to gain access to essential sanitary services like the loo. What's worse is the sorry state of the condition of these places. The advent of charging for the use of faciltes hasn't actually improved their maintenance. On top of this the machines for providing change from, for example, a pound coin, are half the time out of service. The turn styles, are usually in such a bad state of repair (and badly designed to begin with) that you often find yourself catching them, resulting in an embarrassing limp for the train, or bruising etc. I feel that these reasons are more than enough for the government to intervene and insist that these essential facilitys should be provided free to the public without hampering the entrance or possibly causing minor injuries to those who do pay.",
