            "background": "I would like to petition, that the amount of British History be increased in lessons of history throughout KS 3 and 4.\nAt present, little is taught about the British influence on History, the main bulk of History taught is usually about other countries and there influences, For example, The Romans, how they increased there empire to strecthc 1/5 of the globe. And I do not denie, this is valuable infomation to be taught. However, I do feel it would be much better, if insted of ignoring our contribution, or focusing on our worst times, but to embrace our past.\nSuch as how we were the first / one of the first to abolish Slave labour, and how the industrial revoloution helped us build our society into what it has become today, by the use of famous british entrepreneurs such as George Stevenson's locomotives etc etc... the list of great achiements is almost endless.\nPlus, I do feel this would help to raise peoples admiration for our country, and to show them what being British is all about.",
