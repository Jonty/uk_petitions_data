            "action": "limit the interest rates charged by banks and money lenders to a maximum of 10 per cent plus the Bank of England rate - The rate would therefore be 10.5%. This will help everyone with Credit Cards and Loans and help to inject money into the economy. The Banks will still make a profit and people will be able to save and spend the difference in interest between the rates.",

            "background": "Since the Bank of England has cut interest rates to 0.5% the credit card companies and banks have increased the interest rates. Some banks have increased the rates by over 10% - RBS interest rates are now between 22% to 30%. Limiting the level of interest rates to 10% above the Bank of England rate would release Millions of Pounds into the economy, it would help people reduce their debt and it may reduce the numbers of IVA's and debtors.\n\nplease support this petition",
