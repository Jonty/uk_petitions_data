Such money should not be handed to corrupt government departments - like the one headed by Gordon Brown - to be handed over as a bribe to 'vote for me' -  to any non-UK citizen who has never contributed to the UK national insurance payments system.  The taxpayers has a right to know how our elected representatives are using our money to purchase votes for the furtherance of their party political future.",
