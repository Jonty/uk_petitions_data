            "background": "Dear All, it isn't just that sixteen to seventeen yr olds have been stripped of any sort of 'adult' priveledge such as gambling, drinking, smoking and other such luxuries, and yet we are declined of a child train/bus ticket because, apparently, we have come of age. this absurd limbo that i am currently stuck in means that I spend all my money ridiculously on adult tickets when I am still at college, unable to have a proper job so that I can focus on my A levels. I believe that this should be changed to make child tickets up to eighteen years of age, so that this awful age still entitiles us to some benefits. Why are we deemed not responsiable enough to do any strictly adult activities and yet made to pay the same price as a full time working middle aged person?\nFor the sake of my allowance please, please consider this seriously",
