            "background": "Pregnant women are being advised to be vaccinated against swine flu. There are two vaccines which can be used - Pandemrix & Celvapan. The former contains an adjuvant which has not been tested on pregnant women. It also contains Thiomersal which contains Mercury.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended that pregnant women be given the adjuvant free vaccine wherever possible. In practice we are not being given a choice of vaccine. We are told we can have Pandemrix or nothing. This is unacceptable. We would like to be able to request Celvapan instead of Pandemrix.",
