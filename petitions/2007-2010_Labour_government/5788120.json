With the amount of traffic lights used around the country, the amount of energy saved will help the United Kingdom to become more greener. This scheme is already being introduced in other areas like Taiwan. My proposition is for the government to start introducing these LED traffic lights. With climate change currently in the spotlight, this would be a good move for the government to make.",
