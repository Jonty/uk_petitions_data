        "background": "Many people are unaware that commercial vehicles over 2 tons gross weight (including some Land Rovers, Pickups, Transit Vans and bigger) have reduced speed limits on a-roads, b-roads and dual-carriageways. \n\nIt would make common sense that the lower speed limits applicable to those vehicles are displayed in the cab so that anyone who drives said vehicle is aware. As the police clamp down, more and more irregular drivers of vans and bigger vehicles are being caught out. \n\nWe also suggest an ad campaign to make those aware that drive older vehicles where this information is not displayed.",
