How dare these politicians simply parade themselves on television holding a cheque? This is modern day highway robbery and should cease immediate effect. Or will this government once again prove it does not care about the hard working British people. Can an employee claim incorrect expenses and not face the sack if he or she simply says sorry??\nLet\u2019s discontinue making a mockery of this once great nation",
