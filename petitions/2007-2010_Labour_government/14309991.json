Anybody that has been to Bassett will know that it is a sleepy little town. It's not thier fault that they are on the route that takes our fallen hero's to thier final resting place...........however, this little town comes out in it's 1000's as a mark of respect to our fallen hero's, regardless of race, religion or ethnanticity. Yes I'm making a protest, and I think so should we all. This 'group' that want to march through Bassett are only doing it for publicity and to provoke emotions, well, it's worked. Tell them to go elsewhere, leave Bassett alone.....but no, that won't happen. It's about time, our government earned thier over blown saleries and grew a pair, and stopped this outrage. This is not a racist group, I'm only saying what most people are thinking, and I'm proud to be British!!!!!!! Please Sir, do something as I fear that this could cause riots all over the country, and a lot of inocent people may get hurt. You have the power.",
