        "background": "Why can't we adopt a system similar to the sale of alcohol in Canada?\n\nSeparate stores for beer and another for spirits and wine run by the government. I visit Toronto in Canada every year and I see the strict controls these premises have over sales and I have never seen a young person drunk in the street, certainly like all big cities Toronto has a share of older drunks these seem to be homeless persons but never young people. Also the age of drinking in Canada is higher than here and is VERY effectively controlled. It is so very easy for youngsters to get alcohol from their local corner shops here and not too difficult from supermarkets, it has to be stopped and I feel that the Canadian system is excellent.",
