            "background": "Why is it prisoners who have commited a crime are allowed free television yet patients in hospital have to pay \u00a37.00 for 3 days for the privelige of watching the same programmes. Prisoners can earn money during their stay in prison that should be used to pay for their viewing, many hospital patients lose both ways as many do not get paid sick leave by their Employers yet still have to fork out for T.V.Even when you buy a card to watch TV it lasts for 3 days from when you insert it unlike many cards (phone cards for example) which only charge you when you use it.",
