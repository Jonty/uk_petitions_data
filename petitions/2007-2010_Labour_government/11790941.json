            "background": "patients living in Mid Wales have to travel a great distance to get the hospital treatment they need.  Usually the appointments are at Hereford County Hospital which charges up to \u00a312.50 per day for car parking.  Patients and their relatives should not have to worry about this cost on top of the worry of coping with a serious illness or operation.  This is a huge financial burden and if a family has to do a bedside vigil the costs are astronomical.  The family are worried enough without having to meet these added costs.  This appears to be another postcode lottery as Princess Royal Hospital in Telford charges \u00a32 in total for a day's parking.  It is high time hospital car parking fees were abololished so that patients can concentrate on getting better not worrying about the financial implications of being ill.",
