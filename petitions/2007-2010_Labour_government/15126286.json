            "background": "It is unfair that the vast majority of responsible drinkers are labelled as binge drinkers, and the huge overall cost to the economy every year, running into billions. My idea is to bring in fixed-penalty tickets for people who become so unfit through their alcohol consumption they require hospital treatment. \n\nThe Government\u2019s idea to raise duty on alcohol just penalises everyone and doesn't address the core issues. I think if someone received a fixed-penalty ticket for \u00a3300-500 for their hospital treatment it would make them think a whole lot more, and would single them out, rather than the population as a whole, and with it saving the economy billions of pounds every year.",
