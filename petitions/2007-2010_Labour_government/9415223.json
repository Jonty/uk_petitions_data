Green lanes in North London, for example, is overrun with new betting shops thanks to changes in the law in the Gambling Act of 2005.  \n\nThese outlets do very little to benefit the community and in fact, there is an increased social cost of gambling to the community.\n\nThe government must restrict the number of betting shops allowed in an area, or within a certain radius.  To do this, it needs to modify the Gambling Act.\n\nBy the end of 2009, it is estimated that 1,500 new betting shops will open across Britain (Too many bookies? You bet!, Guardian, 12 January, 2008).  \nHow does the community stand to benefit?",
