These emails have not only been authenticated by journalists such as Paul Hudson of the BBC, but also by the scientists themselves.\n\nThe British public, and people throughout the world, deserve and demand the right to know how deep this scandal runs. If some of the world's most 'renowned' climate change scientists are complicit in efforts to quiet their opponents, doctor evidence, and hide data, it calls this whole field of science into question.\n\nWe will not rest until the truth is known - until the data has been released and independent, open-minded climatologists have been given the opportunity to examine and prove its authenticity.",
