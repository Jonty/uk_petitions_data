            "background": "Salford City Council plan to use 98 acres of green belt land on Barton Moss between Irlam and Eccles for Industrial use.  This would use either Grade 1 agricultural land or Boysnope Golf course being destroyed to provide warehousing and other industry.  This would remove almost all open space between Peel Green and Irlam and put extra demands on the A57 - already operating beyond capacity.  We the undersigned oppose Salford City Councils plans. They also plan to build a non-food retail park on the land to help repay the money to subsidise the Salford City Reds development at Peel Green",
