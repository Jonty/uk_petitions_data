This means that where HMRC have estimated tax liabilities and taxpayers have not lodged a formal appeal within the statutory 30-day period, HMRC will now pursue those amounts even where taxpayers can prove that their real tax liabilities are less.   This will expose many of the country's most vulnerable taxpayers to debts that they cannot afford and do not actually owe.\n\nHMRC should not aim to collect more than the right amount of tax.",
