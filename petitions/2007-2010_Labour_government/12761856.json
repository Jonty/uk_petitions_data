        "background": "For many years, HMRC have waived their statutory rights to tax in circumstances where taxpayers have been able to demonstrate that their true liabilities are less than the amounts being formally demanded. \n\nHMRC proposes to abolish this practice.  This means that where HMRC have estimated tax liabilities and taxpayers have not lodged a formal appeal within the statutory 30-day period, HMRC will now pursue those amounts even where taxpayers can prove that their real tax liabilities are less.   This will expose many of the country's most vulnerable taxpayers to debts that they cannot afford and do not actually owe.\n\nHMRC should not aim to collect more than the right amount of tax.",
