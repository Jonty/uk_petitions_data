            "background": "It is unfair to base the size of the maintenance loan a student receives is based upon their parents income. University is about living independantly, and it is something students struggle to do when they rely on their parents to top up their loan, and in some cases parents do not want to. \n\nWe feel that all students should be entitled to claim the maximum amount (currently \u00a36,403) as a student loan if they need it, as the loan students with high income families receive is simply not enough to live on in some cases, and we feel that this takes away from their university experience.",
