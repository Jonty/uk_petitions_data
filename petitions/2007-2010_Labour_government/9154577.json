        "action": "investigate more peaceful channels of public expression, address the rights on non - Uk nationals to conduct protest marches on British streets which need to be policed by British emergency services at British taxpayers expense and call for better community action to ensure ethnic minorities behave responsibly",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The furore around Bejing/the Olympic torch draws attention to how unstable British society appears to be at the moment &the risks that public sector workers in the emergency services are expected to take, the cost taxpayers are expected to pay and the tolerance/ respect that officials are expected to show. \n\nIf this kind of behaviour was at a football match, it would be called \"hooliganism\" ! Let's face it, the supervision of immigrants in all aspects of British life is atrocious, disrupting the lives of peaceful, law - abiding citizens. The British political, democratic tradition has always been proud of the rights of peaceful expression ... but that is precisely it : PEACEFUL ! Campaigners, who have no experience other than violent demonstration, from overseas, should be better orientated in how to conduct themselves - Everyone is entitled to protection from the state but please address this issue in keeping with the new anti- terrorism bill, attempts to promote community harmonity and quel racial tensions.",
