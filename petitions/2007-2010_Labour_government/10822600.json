        "background": "Sandmining in Montserrat needs to be stopped or controlled as it is destroying Little Bay, site of the new capital and much of the East Coast of the island. \n\nPlease also consider issues of corruption which are widespread across the island and problematic for the majority of the population.  \n\nImported food at the supermarkets is so expensive that they are being boycotted as much as possible - even investors and business people are boycotting the supermarkets and growing our own food.\n\nThese are matters of concern for approximately 80 to 90% of the population who live here, Montserratians and ex-pats alike.\n\nWe have good potential for wind power and geothermal but this will take some time after destruction of Plymouth, the Capital, by the Soufriere Hills Volcano in 1997.",
