Many people would probably not even miss it.\n\nLooking through existing petitions on this issue, including those which have closed or were rejected, I saw many making very forceful arguments against pavement cycling.  One of these referred to an appalling incident in which a cyclist killed a couple of people by, as far as I remember, cycling at them; at any rate I do remember that he (or she but think it was a man) shouted that he (or she) wasn't going to get out of the way.  More recently I read in a London free paper about an incident in which someone was killed by a cyclist \"riding like a madman\" who jumped on to the pavement in order to avoid a red light; this person was gaoled for all of 10 months.  It's well past time for penalties for pavement cycling to be realistic.",
