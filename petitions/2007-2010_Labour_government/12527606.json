            "background": "Reduce the Westmidlands bus fairs to 50 or 60p for children and students; and 1.00 or 1.20 for adults. Also daysavers for children and students costing around 1.50 to 1.80 and for adults of 2.50 to 2.80. These are good round numbers unlike the stupid high prices we suffer now of 0.85p. They get everyone in a mess. Also they are cheaper and better for us as the public, especially in this time of the credit crunch.",
