            "background": "We are writing to express concern about the Commercial Exploitation of the Buddha Statue with attached 'Genitalia' at an Art Gallery in Norwich, UK. We feel that showing the Statue of the Buddha in this way is extremely blasphemous and highly offensive to millions of people practicing the peaceful religious faith. Buddhists value peace and always extend goodwill to all people regardless of their Faiths. The Statues of the Buddha are highly sacred to us and should not be treated in this way. By displaying the Statue of our Founding Father in such a Pornographic way (Penis Erection) in full view of Public may incite Religious Hatred against Buddhists as well as Hatred by Buddhists against Non-Buddhists. Therefore we request our Government to take appropriate action as soon as possible.",
