            "background": "Invest \u00a32bn a year into Ground Source Heat pumps in social housing. This will eliminate fuel poverty over 5 years for 4 million families, reduce heating bills by up to 80%, reduce CO2 emissions and reduce the UK\u2019s reliance on imported energy. It will also provide tens of thousands of jobs. Ground Source Heat Pumps take heat out of the ground which can then be used for heating homes at a quarter of the cost and with zero carbon emissions if using green energy.",
