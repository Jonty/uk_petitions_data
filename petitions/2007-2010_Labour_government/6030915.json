            "background": "The Voters of Northumberland have asked for 2 unitary authorities not one as announced by the minister for local government.  I petition the Prime Minister to put listening to the voters in the heart of government and not force on the voters what they do not want and request that the decision to have one unitary authority is reviewed before it is implemented.  Maybe it might encourage people to become more interested in Politics and get involved.",
