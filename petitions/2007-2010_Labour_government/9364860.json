        "background": "I am amazed that large public limited companies like TESCO don't have their consumer policies better regulated. I am sick to death of freebies of this and that just for a minute of your time - complete this simple survey - give your personal details and WHAM ! an invoice arrives in the post or worst still, an amount is deducted from my account. All the time I thought I was helping them ! Does anyone else have this problem ?\n\nGiven the recent attention that has been paid to the lack of confidentiality and difficulties policing databases, please can the UK govt include in their new agenda : \"consumer Lifestyles\" which though they may have the TESCO logo -  I am not wholely convinced of their authenticity. Under consumer law, please legislate so that companies who say they will do this, or give you that actually do - and please give better advice on the rights aspects of contractual agreements in relation to the internet.\n\nThank you.",
