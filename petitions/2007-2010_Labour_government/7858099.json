            "background": "My mum is a hard working doctor who has spend eight years of her life working towards her profession. She earns \u00a3100,000 annualy, of which 40%/\u00a340,000 is taken, leaving our family of seven with \u00a360,000. I'm not for one minute suggesting that this is insufficient to support our family, but a proffesional footballer (the obvious example is David Beckham, who in five years is to receive \u00a3128 million from his club L.A. Galaxy) who is likely to be much better of than us, pays the same amount of tax, which is completely innapropriate. Now I am not doubting the skill of players such as David; I should know, I play club football for Southend United, but my mother has spend almost a decade of her life training to become a doctor, and it does 'rub it in her face' a bit when she gives away almost half of what she has earned to tax!",
