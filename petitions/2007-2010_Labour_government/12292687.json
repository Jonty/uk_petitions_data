            "background": "From December 2009 Southeastern trains will remove all the fast trains between Cannons Street and Ashford International. This means that prime commuting stations like Maidstone and West Malling / King's Hill will lose all their fast services, which currently run into London Bridge or Cannons Street. \n\nIf we don't stop this Southeastern will continue to erode our train service until only the most highly profitable trains are left. This will only mean extreme overcrowding on the remaining trains and will eventually marginalise  Maidstone and King's Hill rendering them irrelevant.  \n\nSupport Maidstone and West Malling - they needs more fast trains, not less.",
