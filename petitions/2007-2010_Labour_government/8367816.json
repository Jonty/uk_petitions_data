            "background": "The implementation of Sharia courts in Britain is now being widely reported. This is an attempt to set up a state within a state and challenge Britains legal system.  Sharia law breaches equality legislation and encourages acts of violence and oppression. By the turn of the century, this is likely to result in major civil disturbance.  A clear message needs to be sent to practioners that not only are these barbaric pratices unacceptable, but they will be actively fought.  To outlaw it now, will be far easier than attempting to contain armed insurrection in 20 years time.  In practice it would need to be treated similarly to treason. Organising, or attending a Sharia court, could attract life sentences or deportation.  Promoting sharia law should carry a lighter sentence but again or deportation.  The victims of Sharia courts should be compensated by religious institutions.",
