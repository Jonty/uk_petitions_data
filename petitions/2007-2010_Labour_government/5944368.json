            "background": "Many carers provide care for seven days a week.  Carer's allowance paid at the current rate works out at some carers being paid less than 50pence per hour.  Who in their right mind would apply for such a job?  Carers provide a service, which would otherwise have to be provided by the Local Authority, at a huge expense to the tax payer.  It is therefore only right and proper for Carers to be paid a fair price for their contribution to society and therefore should be paid at an hourly rate for the care they provide, based on the level of the Minimum Wage.",
