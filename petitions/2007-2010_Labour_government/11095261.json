            "background": "As you all may have seen a supermarket giant has cut the price of petrol again now making it 15p per litre cheaper than diesel. Petrol contains far more CO2 which is responsible for the destruction of the environment. This is reflected in vehicle excise duty as it costs more to tax a petrol car than a diesel so why is it not the same at the pumps? By keeping the duty high on diesel you are responsible for excessive food, shipping and public transport costs as the trucks, ships, buses, trains and taxis all run on diesel.",
