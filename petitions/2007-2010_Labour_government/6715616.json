            "background": "A local street market has been temporarily located outside the church in St Johns Grove,N19, which has now applied for permanant residence.  Parking bays are suspended, even for local residents who pay annually for this. It is affecting the trade of local business who have been there years, market traders leave rubbish all over the streets, there are hazardous cables from generators on pavements not covered, food on stalls that is not refrigerated or ice packed.....I could go on.....the council have not informed most residents in Pemberton Gardens, 100 yards away and yet Islington council  are supporting this.  Sign this petition to get rid of this market and get it moved!  It should not be in a residential area!",
