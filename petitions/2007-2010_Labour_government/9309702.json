            "background": "We are currently facing significant increases in petrol, fuel bills and food bills. We are being hit so hard financially in this country to the point where many are having their homes repossessed or are unable to afford to pay their gas or/and electricity bills or have had to reduce the amount of food they buy. It's time we fought back, in many other countries there would be a revolution! We cannot keep allowing the 'fat cats' to get away with this. I am urging the Prime Minister to listen to the people of this country, many of whom are suffering due to rising costs, to do something about it, before we have even more suicides, homeless and starving people who have been forced into this situation by the power elite.What about the elderly? They are greatly suffering to, many cannot manage.For all, our sakes PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION.",
