            "background": "The UK charges by far the highest levels of fuel duty in the EU, with the average of the other member states being around half of what we pay.\n\nMr Brown we implore you to reduce this duty now, you are penalising the millions of motorists in this country, many of whom rely on their cars since years of lack of investment have left public transport woefully inadequate.\n\nNot only this but you are forcing small businesses to the wall as their operating costs make them unable to compete with our European neighbours, while the larger businesses inevitably pass their increased costs onto us, the end consumer.\n\nThe duty escalator needs to halt now before you damage our economy irrevocably.",
