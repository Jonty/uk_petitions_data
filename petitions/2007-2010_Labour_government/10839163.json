            "background": "EMA is a necessary benefit, which aims to help students from low income families continue their education through sixth form whilst alleviating some financial pressure from the family.\n\nGiving teenagers \u00a310-\u00a330 a week however does not solve this problem.\nSome students will use the money for the purpose it is intended for, however a majority do not. They use it to fund their underage drinking and other purely selfish causes.\nI'm sure tax payers are quite happy to pay for the education of less well off students, but I imagine far less satisfied to know they are paying for teenagers' social lives.\nEMA as it currently works does not tackle the issue it aims to, by providing a disposable income for these students to waste.\nThe government trusts teenagers with this money, but does not trust them to vote responsibly, and I believe the former is wrong.\nBy giving the benefit to the parents however, you still cannot enforce what they spend it on, but they will be more likely to use it responsibly to fund the education of their children than the student is.\nSign to support funding the parents to keep their students in education rather than fund student social lives and see your taxes wasted.",
