        "action": "extend NHS cancer treatments : request NICE consider immunotherapy in addition to radiotherapy cancer treatments for NHS patients. Immunotherapy benefits include reduced relapses and side effects. Immune - boosting treatments for lung cancer patients reduces the risk of cancer relapse after surgery to the same extent as chemotherapy but without the risk of unpleasant side effects, says a Phase II Belgian study.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Because the treatment affects the most common form of lung cancer - non-small-cancer, the potential benefits far outweigh costs. In the study, all  patients had surgery to remove their cancer and were then randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or MAGE-A3 ASCI (antigen-specific cancer immunotherapeutic) injections over 27 months -- five given at three-week intervals, followed by eight given once every three months.\n\nPatients who received the MAGE-A3 injections were less likely to have any recurrence, went longer without recurrence, and were less likely to die.\n\nThis study shows that MAGE-A3 ASCI provides benefits in addition to surgical resection similar to chemotherapy with only minimal side effects, such as mild reactions at the injection site and fever within 24 hours of the injection.\n\nThe petitioner is urging the P.M. to monitor Phase III of the trial of MAGE-A3 ASCI, now under way.",
