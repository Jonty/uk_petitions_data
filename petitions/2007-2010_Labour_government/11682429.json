        "background": "This petition simply asks that the records about the effectiveness of drugs prescribed for particular conditions be published.\nFor example, if drug 'y' is prescribed for condition 'x' to 1000 patients, how many of those patients are cured or improved?\nThere is a lot more to the prescription of drugs than their overall effectiveness, and of course the ultimate test is whether it works for you, or a loved one. But wouldn't it be nice to know how effective overall a particular drug is? \nWouldn't it be nice to know if one health authority is more successful when prescribing a particular drug than another authority ? The publishing of these figures would highlight discrepancies in practise between different areas, and encourage a more evidence based approach to medicine.\nIn the 21st century isn't it about time patients were given relevant information about their treatment? This proposal would cost little, it is very much about publishing statistics which must already exist.\nSurely the days when 'doctor knows best' and relevant information is seen as the exclusive property of 'professionals' should be confined to history.",
