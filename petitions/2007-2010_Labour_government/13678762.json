            "background": "For the government to withdraw the advert aimed at children regarding the myth of man made climate change. My seven year old daughter was sick and so not in bed, she saw the ad and was scared to death. It is an appalling use of public money, even if our economy were in the best of states. Carbon dioxide is the food of the planet, as anyone with a bit of sense knows well.",
