            "background": "This will allow Britain to grow again as a world leader, rather than being viewed as honey pot for the many thousands of people on their way here, and who see our Benefits system as a way of leading a comfortable life. Other countries have 'skilled workers only'entry limitations and it works for them. It would in the long term reduce our social security hand-outs, revive skilled sectors, create more jobs/apprenticeships, encourage British people to aspire to learn more to compete with their foreign counterparts, and importantly, to promote mutual respect within communities where at present there is resentment and racial tension.",
