            "background": "In 2005 President Obama purchased $50,000 of Baxter shares. This was a time when Baxter where developing Tamiflu and a vaccination for the H5N1 bird flu and they now produce the H1N1 vaccine. surely there must be a conflict of interest when the president of a country orders his centre for disease control to push a vaccine that he profits from?  consider how many people are losing there jobs because of many work places making the vaccination compulsory. most of the World Health Organisation members also have shares and other joint interests in the companies that have been licensed to produce the vaccination and Tamiflu symptom reliever.",
