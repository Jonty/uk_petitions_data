During the A14 construction work these villages will suffer a great deal more with higher traffic congestion which does cause major problems now for villagers.There are very few parts of the A1 that now suffer as we do on the section from Baldock to Alconbury, we need some joined up thinking from the Transport Minister NOW.",
