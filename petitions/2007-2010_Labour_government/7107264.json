            "background": "Brookside became well known for its tackling of realistic and socially challenging storylines and was most popular in the 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1990s it began raising more controversial, and perhaps sensationalist issues under the guidance of new producers such as Mal Young and Paul Marquess. It is especially well-known for broadcasting the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss on British television in 1994, as well as a storyline featuring consensual incestuous sexual relations between two sibling characters. Brookside paved the way for soaps today and was not afraid of tackling all sorts of issues. For this, \"Brookie\" was an important part of television, raising social awareness and reflecting everyone's lives.",
