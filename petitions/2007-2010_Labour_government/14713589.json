This aircraft is an iconic example of British engineering and is every bit as deserving of public funds as the Battle of Britain Memorial flight. It is also an excellent tool for promoting engineering education and training.\n\nThe money needed annually is very small change campared to the financial requirements of e.g. the Afghan war.\n\nPlease fund the project in order to preserve this example of great British engineering.",
