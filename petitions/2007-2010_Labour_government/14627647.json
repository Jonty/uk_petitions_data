            "background": "There are plenty of people out there claiming benefits for a number of reasons.\n\nI would say most people are correctly doing so but there are lots that claim for lots of things but spend all day and weekend smoking cannabis and talking illegal drugs.\n\nI propose if claiming benefits for long term these people should have a drug test.  If this is failed three times then benefits are halved.\n\nI work hard all day and pay taxes.  I know people that claim benefits, smoke cannabis and take other illegal drugs and don\u2019t do a days work. (who is the mug)?\n\nThe way I see it is if I was tested at work for drugs and failed I would be sacked.  If you are claiming benefit\u2019s the same should happen. \n\nThe state is paying for this drug habit and the only people that are benefiting are the drug dealers that don\u2019t pay tax.\n\nI have put this on to see if anyone is on the same page as me??????",
