At present the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme explicitly excludes those wounded in the first four years of the \u2018War on Terror\u2019. Fairness dictates that, given the sacrifices made by British troops in service of our country in Afghanistan and Iraq, each soldier seriously injured in these theatres should benefit from the same compensation arrangements, enabling them a decent on-going quality of life. We call upon the Government to make this happen and to recognise the sacrifices made by all of those seriously injured in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
