            "background": "For many years, super-slim models have littered catwalks, posed for magazines etc.\nAs teenagers are very impressionable, they believe that to be beautiful they have to be skinny like these models. This usually results in anorexia, bullumecia, calcium deficiancy etc and can lead to death.\nBeing a teenager myself, i understand the pressure that other teenagers go through. The pressure to look beautiful (in their eyes- anorexic) to impress others.",
