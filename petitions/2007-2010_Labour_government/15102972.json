            "background": "The Low emission zone (LEZ) is due to move to euro 4 requirements in 2012. I feel that with the next to no reduction in pollution that euro 3 has made on London. The distress and hardship that it has caused to Bus, Coach and Haulage operators by forcing them to comply is unacceptable. The natural process of renewal of vehicles will occur and this would not finacially cripple small businesses that are both bringing passengers and income into London, or Supplies for the Capital in general.",
