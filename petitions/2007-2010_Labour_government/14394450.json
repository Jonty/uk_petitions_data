            "background": "Manchester's Metrolink continues to provide abismal service, this petition is to call for Stagecoach to be stripped of the operating licence and for the incompetent management to be sacked. Also all extensions not currently being built should be put on hold until the current system has a half decent service.\n\nHere are a few points:\n(1)Constant Delays and faliures\n(2)Inability to deal with demand when more than 2 stops down the line\n(3)Overrun of city centre renewall, resulting in a far worse service than before!\n(4)No or inadequate information when delays, or announcements that are just wrong.\n(5)No staff to stop trams becoming too overcrowded, it is only a matter of time until there is a crush injury or even a death.\n(6)Lack of basic common sense like having covered stations but stopping after the area where the covering stops,  changing drivers at rush hour on trams heading out of the city centre, if there are delays and all trams starting from Piccadilly are going to Altrincham, not turning one back up to Bury to split the trams up a bit and so on.",
