            "background": "Bus companies in the UK demand exact change from the passengers and if they do not have exact change they have to pay more or to disembark from the bus which either cause frustrating inconvenience or cost more money.\n\nTherefore current economic difficulties faced by the working class people of the UK should be considered where each and every penny counts to survive. We request the PM that please consider the convenience of the ordinary people by instructing all the Bus companies in the UK to return the change to their passengers and disallow the policy of exact change.\n\nWe further appeal that such Bus companies should be instructed to disclose such income in past years and donate it to the public charities because this money should be spent for the welfare of the community.",
