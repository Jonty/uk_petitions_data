In her rejection of the proposal the Secretary of State commented that in relation to the townscape generally \u2018the height of the residential elements of the proposal would dominate the park and that the overall mass of the scheme would be out of character with the historic grain of Dartford.\u2019\nThe resubmitted plans are for an even larger store which the infrastructure of Dartford will not be able to cope with. The local council have been heavily involved with Tesco in planning this application to such an extent that we no longer believe they can fairly and objectively decide this application.",
