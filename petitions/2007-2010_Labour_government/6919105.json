            "background": "We the undersigned frequent BAA travellers wholeheartedly support the conclusion of the Competition Commission that BAA \"have failed to manage security queuing and queue times to avoid unacceptable delays to passengers, crew and flights and consequently have not furthered the reasonable interests of the users of Heathrow and Gatwick.\"\n\nWhilst there are currently adequate incentives for BAA to invest in the capital structure of airports we believe that there have not been sufficient incentives to drive operational performance (particularly in relation to security queues). We fully endorse the recommendation that the Service Quality Rebate requires an overhaul to ensure that the regulatory regime provides adequate incentive for BAA to improve and maintain service standards.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister to ensure the CAA implement the recommendations of the Competition Commission in full.",
