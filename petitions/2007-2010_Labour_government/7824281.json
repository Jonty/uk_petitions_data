So why can't the rest of the country have a similar system for transportation. \n This method would save commuters time waiting at ticket desks and make public transport more convenient.\nIntergrating the pass would also benefit as you could easily make connections between different methods of transport. You would top up your card and need not have to worry about the change for the ticket. A quick swipe and it would be paid for.\nIf this project went underway, it should start in other major cities then moving on to the rest of Country.\n\nThank You for Reading!!^^",
