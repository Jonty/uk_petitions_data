This will mean hardship for those on low incomes and pensioners. I petition the Government to set aside sufficient money to recompense the owners of such cars for their loss and/or provide assistance for those owners to sell the cars to a Government agency at a fair price (based on their previous depreciation history) to enable less polluting cars to be bought.",
