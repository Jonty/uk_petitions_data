        "background": "The recent budgetry proposal to double the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) on some types of cars registered from 2001 onwards has meant that many cars have been made almost worthless on the secondhand market. This will mean hardship for those on low incomes and pensioners. I petition the Government to set aside sufficient money to recompense the owners of such cars for their loss and/or provide assistance for those owners to sell the cars to a Government agency at a fair price (based on their previous depreciation history) to enable less polluting cars to be bought.",
