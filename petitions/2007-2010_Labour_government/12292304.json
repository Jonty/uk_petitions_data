        "background": "Please help us protect your precious rural environment for future generations by signing our petition.\n\nWe are campaigning against plans to site an EfW (Electricity from Waste) incineration plant at Lower Greatmoor Farm Aylesbury Vale.\n\nThis is a beautiful green field site in the heart of the ancient Bernwode Forest - a green lung for the environment in North Buckinghamshire. The proposed incinerator building \u2013 with a chimney up to 94 m high - and increased waste traffic would dominate the open landscape, blighting Waddesdon Manor and the many beautiful villages and towns in the vale which provide R&R for urban dwellers too. \n\nOur families, livestock, trees, wildlife, environment and your peace all stand to lose.\n\nIncineration of waste has many problems. It releases greenhouse gasses, creates toxic emissions and hazardous ash, poses significant health risks as well as limits increased recycling and composting. \n\nMake a difference and tell the Prime Minister to prevent this damaging incineration plan NOW!",
