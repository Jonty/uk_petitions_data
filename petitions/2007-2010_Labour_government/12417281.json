            "background": "This petition has been created because I believe that all worker's that work night's should receive double pay by all company's by law. I think because the individual that is working night's is loosing sleep and then has to catch up with the sleep the next day. Therefor the individual has lost a day because the individual has had to sleep. Working the night shift can wreak havoc on your sleep. This leads to an increased risk of insomnia and other sleep disorders. Night shift work has also been shown to increase the risk of heart and digestive problems, as well as problems with moods and emotions. Night shift workers are at an increased risk for safety accidents due to tiredness. I do not think it is fair that people should loose pay because they have to sleep.",
