Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool all frequently do it, this is not a petition against those clubs, it\u2019s a petition against the premier league to ensure each club is treated equally in what is already a difficult league for the 'smaller teams'. \n\nWe would also like to seek clarification from the EPL on:\n\nHow many changes the EPL consider appropriate from 1 game to the next\n\nHow the EPL judge what is a strongest team available.\n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to take action and seek clarification and ensure fairness for all.",
