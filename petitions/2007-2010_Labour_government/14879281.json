        "background": "The English Premier league has taken it on itself to give Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club a suspended fine of \u00a325,000 for fielding a so called weakened team against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Tuesday 15th December 2009. \n\nThis is not about if Wolves where right to do what they did, its about each club being treated equally by the EPL\n\nMany other teams often make numerous changes to their starting 11. Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool all frequently do it, this is not a petition against those clubs, it\u2019s a petition against the premier league to ensure each club is treated equally in what is already a difficult league for the 'smaller teams'. \n\nWe would also like to seek clarification from the EPL on:\n\nHow many changes the EPL consider appropriate from 1 game to the next\n\nHow the EPL judge what is a strongest team available.\n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to take action and seek clarification and ensure fairness for all.",
