        "action": "Keep a fully staffed HMRC office open in Sunderland City Centre",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Both the Gilbridge & Shackleton House tax offices in Sunderland city centre are to close, relocating approximately 400 staff to offices at Washington & Longbenton. These staff spend a significant amount of money in Sunderland via retail, restaurants, bars and leisure. They also use local amenities e.g banks, parks & libraries. Most staff do not live in Sunderland & so will choose to spend their money elsewhere when these jobs are relocated. Sunderland was recently named as one of the 18 poorest towns in the UK & this loss of revenue will have a devastating effect on an already struggling city centre. The staff moving will experience longer/more stressful journeys to their new workplace, leading to a poorer work/life balance. Many part-time workers & those with responsibilities will have to work less hours to accomodate a longer journey time,leading to a decrease in income & a higher reliability on government benefits. We implore the government to re-consider their decision and keep a fully staff tax office open in Sunderland city centre, not only for the benefit of the staff, but also for the good of Sunderland itself.",
