            "background": "Schedule one offenders are walking freely across the UK into peoples lives and destroying our children's lives. We can only find out if they are a schedule one offender if they the offender, chose to tell you. We need more consistency to monitor these people to help us as parents to protect our children more effectively. Domestic violence is increasing and social services are failing children across the UK, because of these offenders being allowed to be free. Schedule one offenders are labelled this because they pose a serious risk to children. A paedophile is monitored much more closely and there are systems in place to help protect that. but what's the difference between sexual abuse and physical, mental or emotional abuse, they all cause the same amount of damage to a child. Why are schedule one offenders still getting away with unsupervised contact with children under 16? Why are they not monitored consistently across the UK.",
