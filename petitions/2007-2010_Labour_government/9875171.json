That\u2019s in addition to the unwilling support given by millions of decent hardworking folk reluctant to ignore PC directives, no matter how absurd, for fear of having their jobs/careers put on hold or ruined by the politically correct. Political correctness and compensation have become instruments of fear in the hands of too many people with vested interests all too eager to play the discrimination card. As a consequence, layers of our most cherished rights, freedoms and liberties are being surreptitiously eroded. This must be stopped.",
