        "background": "The member of the Commonwealth Countries have been paramount in the wealth of the UK over the past hundreds of years. It would now appear that EU members are given  preferential treatment over the Commonwealth members: this seems to be unfair. Those who contributed to the wealth of the Country are not being allowed to share in this wealth.\n\nGiven this historic influence of the Commonwealth countries over the European ones, the Government should therefore change their current policies, and align immigration more to the Commonwealth countries rather than EU. \n\nIn many cases, the educational and underlying rules of law of the Commonwealth countries are more aligned with the UK, than those of the EU countries.",
