They are not offered an alternative screening method.  \n\nThis means that people with rational objections to being scanned in this way are effectively barred from flying.  It impact their ability to visit family and friends abroad, and to undertake employment that requires them to travel by air.\n\nThis is an unreasonable restriction on people's conscience and movement.",
