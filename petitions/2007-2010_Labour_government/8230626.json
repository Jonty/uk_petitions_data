This little nation within Canada participates regularly in global affairs by quietly sitting on the side and doing very little to influence events while scavanging for bits of cheese.\nReligion: \nKingdom of Marc National motto: Credo quia absurdum, \u201cI believe because it is absurd\u201d, is the predominant philosophy, the people of Marc believe deeply in always, and immediately, doing very little.\nPopulation: \nOne of the current eight passport holders, all proud and lethargic, nearly did something last month.\nPolitical Structure: \nNot yet.\nEconomy: \nWe did have an economy but it was sold on e-bay so we could purchase some cheese.\nGeography: \nHistory tells us that the nation was founded on the second floor of an office building affording it the priviledges of anonymous fame and near-wealth. Negotiations are under way to expand, or annex, the neighbouring office however no one in the Kingdom can locate where the Minister of Pencils left her pencil case.",
