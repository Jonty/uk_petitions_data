            "background": "In recent years the funding to these organisations has been reduced.Due to their association with the established churches, it appears that they often fall outside grant aid, lottery and sponsorship citeria.The majority of adults have at some time been a member of one of the voluntary youth organisations and will remember the opportunities they recieved. Goverments always talk about social responsibility and citisenship (the Church Lads and Church Girls brigade have had a citisenship badge for many years)what better and more cost effective way to help encourage this in young people than to sufficiantly fund the voluntary sector. Many of these organisations have been serving their local communities for over 100 years.\nWe believe therefore that the goverment should urgently review the funding and support with the view of increasing the funding provided by the state to voluntary youth organisations",
