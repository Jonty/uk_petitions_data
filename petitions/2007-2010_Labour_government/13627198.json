            "background": "Mr. Brown, The Lisbon Treaty is set to have a profound effect on the British legal system, our sovereignty, and indeed life itself. With over 500 million citizens set to be affected by the treaty coming into force, it is only fair that the British people have their say before our future independence is taken away from us. Revoke the British ratification until after the next general election - if labour are re-elected you can always re-ratify. It is too big an issue to simply sweep under the carpet, and the British people demand their right to be heard. Do not let this issue become an even larger part of the democratic deficit - see how many people sign this petition in just one month, and you will see the will of the people.",
