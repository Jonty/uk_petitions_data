            "background": "The goverment are planning to introduce a new national speed limit of 50mph, where the national speed limit is currently 60mph. Not only will this fustrate motorists, tempt and cause more drivers to break the speed limit and cause the majority of drivers to loose faith in this contrys goverment - but the idea of introducing average speed cameras on these roads is widely viewed as a money making scheme.\nThe money invested by the goverment in creating new signs and putting up these new speed cameras would be much better if invested in the NHS, and advertising schemes to make drivers more aware of the dangours on the road. Prehaps upping the level of the driving test would help too ?",
