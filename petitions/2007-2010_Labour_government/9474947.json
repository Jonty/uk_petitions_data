            "background": "In the day and age where it seems acceptable to advertise credit facilities to every person on the planet non stop. I request the UK goverment set up an independant debt advisory service which has the power to freeze interest charges, abolish high interest rates such as 49.9% and to stop the practice of punishing people for having financial difficulty.\nAs we are seen as one of the main countries in the world we should set an example to others by helping those in difficult times not punishing them.\n\nHow many life's need to be lost due to the stress of debt before we take action?\n\nPlease take a moment to consider these points and sign up to this petition.\n\nThank You",
