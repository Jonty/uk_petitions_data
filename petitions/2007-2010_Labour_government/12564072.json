It has been produced in the village for over 100 years.  \n\nA cheese company is moving production to leicestershire & peak part officials and consultants are looking at the future of the defunct cheese site.\n\nGovernment should ensure that the artisan production of this stilton at the closed dairy site remains to recognise the important role this unique product in the village's history as part of the renewal process.",
