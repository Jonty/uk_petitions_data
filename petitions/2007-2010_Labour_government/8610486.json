If a political process like this existed in any African country then MPs in Westminster would condemn the practice as yet another example of a corrupt political process. Why should our MPs be subject to taxation rules which differ from those that apply to the rest of the population? If employees in the private sector dealt with their expenses in the same way that MPs are allowed to then they would be dismissed and possibly even investigated for fraud.",
