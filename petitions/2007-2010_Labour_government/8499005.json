My waters broke 11pm on the Monday and baby was not delivered until the Thursday afternoon. I was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia a serious condition that occurs in pregnancy, I had swelled up and had high blood pressure, however I was discharged from hospital, even though I was 1 week over due back to my community midwife who sent me back to hospital as baby needed to be delivered, however I was then sent away again. After 3 days, even though I believe you should be left no longer than 48 hours with broken waters I was given an emergency C section. I was terrified and was unsupported by some of the staff. I  Once discharged I was called by the same student who stated baby had contracted strep b, no anti biotics had been given to her and we hadn't been told this in hospital I then became distraught by the news and feared for my babies life, we were given false information and baby was well, I am shocked at the treatment and I am sure I will not be the last. Sign this petition to change the ways of the NHS, I felt my life and baby\u2019s life were put on the line.",
