In the worst instances, this amounts to \u2018The State\u2019 perverting the course of justice resulting in an innocent person being convicted, or children removed from loving parents when there was no genuine risk to them. There seems to be little that can be done to take effective legal action in these instances before damage has been done to the victim, to their family, and to the credibility of the British legal system. Arguing that action can\u2019t be taken \u2018whilst a case is in progress\u2019 (as often happens) is nonsensical as it is saying, in effect, that the system won\u2019t allow injustice to be stopped ... until it has succeeded! What this effectively amounts to is a blind refusal even to consider shutting the stable door until after the horse has not only bolted, but been flattened under a juggernaut out on the road. The Government complacency about this type of oppression needs to be addressed, and the situation corrected.",
