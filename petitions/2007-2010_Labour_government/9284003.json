        "background": "All other nations in the UK have their own individual anthem, except England.  We believe the song 'world in motion' by New Order, is well particularly well suited to  serve as an English Anthem.  It expresses all the pride and passion the English feel for their country, particularly in sport.\nWith 'world in motion' adopted as the English national anthem, 'God Save the Queen' could then serve solely as the UK national anthem.",
