            "background": "In the recent budget, the Government outlined some changes with regards to people who could \"earn\" over \u00a3150,000 a year.\n Anyone putting redundancy cash into their pensions would also be hit.\nYou may have thought that this would only affect the rich and famous but you are wrong.\n\n[ Remember, when they draw their pensions they will be taxed].\n\nREDUNDANCY is not EARNINGS it is compensation for the loss of your job. \n\n\nTaxing people twice is fundamentally wrong.  Taxing employees on the company contribution at 30% and then taxing the pension in payment at 40% or 50% (depending on income levels) has to be fundamentally wrong. \nThe whole ethos of pensions is that it is deferred pay and that it will be taxed either on the way in or on the way our - but not both. \n The problem again is that pensions is being seen as an easy target and hitting high paid as politically acceptable. But it is the very thin edge of the wedge - and, as I say, this should be a concern to all.",
