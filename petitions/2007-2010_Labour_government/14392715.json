            "background": "Every year, the people of the Feroe Island brutally massacre hundreds of innocent, defenceless dolphins and whales in a misguided attempt to keep up tradition.\nHistorically the people of the Feroe Islands were whalers, however times have now changed yet the residents in a number of villages still consider it acceptable to trap these animals and bludgeon them to death. These peaceful, friendly animals whos only crime was to swim too close to the Feroe Islands, die a slow painful death in seas stained red with the blood of their fellow mammals.\nAfter the slaughter, some of the meat is consumed, but the vast majority of the animals are left to rot.\nThis is a total waste of life, and I believe that the UK prime minister should raise this issue in parliament and have annual massacre outlawed in the European court of law before its too late and the dolphins become extinct",
