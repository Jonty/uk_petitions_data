            "background": "We must STOP rainforest destruction for any reason. Rainforests are increasingly being destroyed for biofuels, monocultures like palm oil or soya plantations and for livestock. Rainforests embody diversity and habitats for both people and other species.  Other attempts to curb climate change will be useless if we destroy our forests which act as an irreplaceable water pump for the planet. By now there should be a strong international rainforest protection treaty.  The rainforests are the lungs of the world.",
