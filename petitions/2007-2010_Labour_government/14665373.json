        "background": "Recently we\u2019ve started to see tougher sentences for cases of manslaughter using unlawful violence. But, we feel greater weight should be given to the loss of a life & appropriate sentences must be imposed.\n\nPeople must realise the potential consequences of violence as an act of drunken aggression. Theres no such thing as a safe blow to the head & every impact has the potential to take a life. Stronger sentences for those who kill will hopefully deter gratuitous violence by making people realise that just 1 punch can kill; that 1 punch can cause a lifetimes worth of pain for the victim's family.\n\nIt is only by the Criminal Justice System appropriately punishing these crimes that we might see a reduction in their prevalence. We would like the Sentencing Guidelines Council & Sentencing Advisory Panel to specifically address this type of crime in light of recent case law to encourage consistency in sentencing & to ensure that offenders are properly punished for the devastation that they cause.",
