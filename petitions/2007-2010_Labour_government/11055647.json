A co-operative parent who maintains strong links with his/her children and already demonstrates financial commitment (not just hard cash) but by way of housing, travel, food, clothing, entertainment, etc etc, must has this taken into account.\nThe system is completely unfair and causes more distress and division within already fractured families - at no point does it support children, as the name would imply.",
