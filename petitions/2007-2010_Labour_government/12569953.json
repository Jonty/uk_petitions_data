            "background": "On Liverpool Road, Widnes, Cheshire, just off Mayfair Grove is a pedestrian crossing which places people at risk each time they cross it. \nThe problem is caused because there are sets of traffic lights intersecting Liverpool Road, Hale Road and Prescot Road situated 50 yards West of the pedestrian crossing. The Pedestrian Crossing is wide enough for 2 cars to travel in each direction and tempts drivers to overtake on the pedestrian crossing to \"make the green lights\" at Hale Road and Prescot Road.\nOn numerous occasions I have either been subjected to or witnessed pedestrians having to take evasive action to prevent being struck by a car overtaking in the middle of the pedestrian crossing.\nA number of years ago, I wrote to Mr Derek Twigg MP to address the situation only to be advised that it was not classed as a hazard. In the last few weeks a sign has been erected on the same stretch of road warning of a high risk collision route.\nI request options be looked at to upgrade the crossing to a pelican crossing or to erect an island to prevent 2 cars passing the crossing at the same time.",
