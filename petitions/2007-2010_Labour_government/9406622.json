            "background": "Some people who have committed horrific crimes have been given the chance to commit these crimes again because we, the public, are not aware of who they are. This is because the courts have ruled that they should have a new identity to protect themselves. Wouldn't we all be safer if we knew all these people were? Why should they be granted this when they have done the unthinkable? This is for our protection. Their protection shouldn't even be thought about. Please sign this petition so we can try and put a stop to this astrocity.",
