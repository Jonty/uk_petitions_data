            "background": "to fund young carers projects, so they can get the support they need and that each young carers group around the country, get the financial support to allow them to update their equipment, like adapted minibuses and access to computers, without the need for the young carers to go out to shops and pack bags to raise funds. these children give up a lot of their time for little in return. they don't go out wandering around the streets at all hours and getting into trouble. maybe if they did and earned a few asbo's, would they get more funding and get days out paid for by the goverment. please can someone have some commonsense, and recognise the work these young people do. Young carers save our government billions each year in care fees etc, in return they get nothing from this government. Young carers projects do a fantastic job of providing support and a break away from caring for these young people. They SHOULD NOT have to raise funds in order to do so. With the money young carers save this government, the government should be able to fund these projects. We petition for a greater understanding of young carers needs & government funding to support them.",
