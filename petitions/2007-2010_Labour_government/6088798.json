            "background": "In May this year i was invloved in a near fatal RTA, Iwas not wearing a helmet. Since the accident I would like to try and get the Prime minister to make a law stating Helmets for ALL CYCLISTS to wear helmets when on the roads. This would greatly reduce the risk of fatal accidents to cyclists if they had to wear one. Please support this bid to get a highways law in all cyclists of any age to be made to wear a helmet as they are a valuble cycle accessory / protection when out having fun etc.",
