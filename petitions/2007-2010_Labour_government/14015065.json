            "background": "The Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia is a \u201cleading centre\u201d for the investigation of  \u201cmanmade global warming\u201d and government policy relies on the integrity of these statistics. Several claims have been made: that data was \u201ccherry picked\u201d to make the 20th century temperature rise look exceptional in historical terms; emails suggest the unit has colluded in \u201ctricks\u201d to \u201chide the decline\u201d in a high profile scientific journal, and this unit has colluded in active, secret and highly political campaigning through the website \u201crealclimate\u201d.\n\nThe preparation of climate statistics require many judgements: stations move & sites become surrounded by urban sprawl (urban heating) & a judgement must be made of the size of the offset to apply to the global temperature record. The University accepts most emails are genuine so it appears the Unit has been acting in a highly partisan way incompatible with that of a neutral body preparing and interpreting government data. We call on the PM to suspend all further use of the climate research unit until all pertinent allegations have been investigated and any action (if any) has been taken.",
