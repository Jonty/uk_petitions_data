Service Personnel working for the MoD are not - be THEY a typist or an infantry soldier - Same employer. VASTLY DIFFERENT RULES \nAll Service Personnel sign on the dotted line and state they will not sue for compensation because if they don't, in all likelihood, they will not be accepted into the Armed Forces, and ALL KNOW the risks that come with such a career\n\nIs this how a \"Grateful Nation\"  would want to thank our Service Personnel?\n\nI ask the people sign this petition so that the Government of the day will think twice before decimating our Armed Forces then send them into other countries battles, ill-equipped and under-resourced.\nFurther information  - http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=471700&in_page_id=1770\nhttp://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,2141936,00.html",
