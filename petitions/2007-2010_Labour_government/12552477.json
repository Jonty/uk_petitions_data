            "background": "Jacqui Smith's hold on the position of Home Secretary is no longer tenable.  She is involved in an expenses scandal and more importantly her policies are based on personal hang ups, not public opinion.  Criminalising the users of a prostitutes services will not work and push the activity underground, monitoring all internet, TV and telephone usage is outrageous and now she has capped it all by banning a DJ whilst allowing racist bigots to live in the UK.  She must be removed from office before her ideas are realised.",
