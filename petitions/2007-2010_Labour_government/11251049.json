        "background": "As peace-loving people, we strongly denounce the return to war by the government of Uganda, which attacked the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) on December 14, 2008 in Garamba Forest, DRC.\n\nWe are especially concerned for the safety of innocent children, youth and women with the LRA and civilians in the DRC, who are now at greater risk following the offensive.\n\nThe DRC is currently experiencing a devastating crisis in which two million people have been displaced; provoking the LRA will create yet more chaos in the Great Lakes region. \n\nWe ask that you use all diplomatic means to pressure President Yoweri Museveni\u2019s government to:\n\n1. Resume resolution of the over 20-year conflict through peaceful means.\n2. Recall its troops from the DRC.\n3. Honor the provisions of the Juba peace agreement which have been signed thus far.",
