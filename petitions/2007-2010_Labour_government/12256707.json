        "action": "Abolish the 'No Win No Fee' legislation from the Courts and Legal Services Act (1990)",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The no win no fee legislation has created a sue culture within the UK, this in turn has created a health and safety nightmare, prevents children from enjoying being children, and other everyday pleasures being removed.  \nPrior to 1990 people would only take a claim to court if it was thought there was a chance of winning any compensation, today these cases are being bought to court on a conveyor belt system with the knowledge of no financial risk. Children are no longer able to be children, parks are being closed, school trips canceled at the thought of teachers being sued. Let's get this country back to how is was 20 years ago. Abolishing the no win no fee legislation is a step forward towards this.",
