            "background": "Almost everyday we are bombarded by adverts for 'the fastest ever broadband' and claims of 'upto 8 meg'. Yet if you buy said broadband, you are often lucky to get even a twentieth of the speed. They are breaking the law. They try to get out of it with claims of 'upto' and 'network speeds may vary'. If your on the motorway, you'd get arrested for going along at 3.5 miles per hour, so why hasn't anyone done anything about the broadband scam?",
