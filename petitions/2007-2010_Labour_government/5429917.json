            "background": "Too many people are waiting for council properties in Bed and Breakfasts, hostels etc because the majority of private houses to let are advertised,  as NO DSS.  Is it to be assumed that every single parent or family on benefits are less worthy of a home than those who work or is it the belief that those needing DSS are considered trouble makers, criminals or defaulters of rent?  It is nothing less than discrimination and therefore it should be law that landlords are not allowed to advertise NO DSS.",
