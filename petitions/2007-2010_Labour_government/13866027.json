            "background": "due to the credit crunch more crimes are happenening every day making the role of a front line security officer more dangerus. on three accounts in the past four months i have witnessed and responed to distrested security offices who have been attacked for mirly seeing a crime. but thses attacks are never with an old fashioned puch any more. criminals are useing tools such as angle grinders, power saws and in one case an electric taser. i put it to mr brown to review the laws to help security officers/guards. inclued the use of such items as handcuffs, security dogs and battons. altho we may be security officers/guards we share the same job as those such as the police and the armed forces. this petition is backed by the people of this country with the intent to reduce crime and bring those who commit the crimes to justics. take a look at the group on face book to see how many people back security officers/guards accross the uk.",
