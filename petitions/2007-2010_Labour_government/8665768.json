For far too long, primate keepers have been under the scrutiny of those that oppose the keeping of exotics. If there is a strict code of practice in place under the new animal welfare act, then this will \u2013 we believe bode well for private keepers and show to those whom do oppose, and are calling for a ban on the keeping of primates in private hands, that exotics keepers can keep and maintain this species not only well, but extremely well.",
