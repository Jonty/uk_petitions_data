        "background": "Stoke-on-Trent City Council is planning on privatising nursery care in Children's Centres.  This nursery provision supports local children to achieve their potential, both developmentally and emotionally, and provides phenomenal transitional support through the early years and across all services at the centres. Privatising nursery care has great potential to effect other services provided as it will remove access to resources and break down trust that has been difficult to establish in communities suffering deprivation.",
