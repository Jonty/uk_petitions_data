            "background": "it is estimated that between 10 and 20 MILLION dogs and cats are eaten in china every year,they are crammed into tiny cages,not fed or given water,they then endure a long journey to the Hua Nam live animal market in Guangzhou where they are tossed off a truck (because they are crammed into tiny cages many die of suffocation) then they are hog-tied and agonizingly bludgeoned to death for their meat,in a country that is holding the 2008 olympics. Its a totally barbaric trade that needs to be stopped..Thankyou",
