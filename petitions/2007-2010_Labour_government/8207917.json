I was a little suprised to learn today about the LEZ that will take effect on certain vehicles on 4th February 2008. I cannot beleive that 6 days before this scheme goes live, that there has been NO public awarness about it what so ever.\nIs this another way of ensuring that drivers part with even more cash, (by not communicating changes) and then hitting them with fines for not registering/qualifying for LEZ.",
