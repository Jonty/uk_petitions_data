            "action": "urge China to end its policy of sending North Korean refugees back to North Korea",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many North Koreans attempt the hugely risky trip from North Korea over the border into China, to escape the terrible regime and conditions in North Korea. While most countries, including South Korea, welcome any North Koreans who have managed to escape with open arms, the Chinese policy is to send any North Korean refugees back to North Korea, where they face imprisonment in labour camps, torture and execution.\n\nThose signing this petition wish for the UK government to engage in peaceful but strongly worded discourse with China on this issue, and urge it to rethink this policy, as China is effectively sending North Koreans to their deaths by sending them back to their country.\n\nI have made the time for this petition short as it is an urgent matter of life-and-death that North Koreans be saved of this horrific ordeal and that an influential country like China is seen to be sympathetic to the plight of suffering North Koreans, as it may send a message to Pyongyang that its dictatorship and mistreatment of its citizens is absolutely unacceptable and must end.",
