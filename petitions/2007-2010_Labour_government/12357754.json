        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe that to help people give up smoking, reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarettes gradually, would make it much easier to quit. For example, if a cigarette has 0.8mg of nicotine in it, it should be reduced to 0.7 and then the next year 0.6 and so on. The smoker would not notice the small change in the amount of nicotine and over the years with the reduction of the nicotine content, people would find it much easier to give up.",
