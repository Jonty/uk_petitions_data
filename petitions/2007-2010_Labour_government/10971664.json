            "background": "Electric cars are in theory a good idea. In practise, they must be charged from the National Grid, meaning extra demands on power from Oil, Coal and Gas. This fails our green obligations on CO2 emissions miserably. Put Electric cars on hold until the Power Generation issues have been resolved that allow the extra demand required to recharge Electric Vehicles, to be met by renewables. Mr Brown stated that Government should not mislead the public at any time on any issue. So please don't. Electric Vehicles are not yet green or CO2 reducing.",
