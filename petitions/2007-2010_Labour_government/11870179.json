Why is the former boss of a company that has just reported 24.1 billion in losses receiving a LIFETIME pension of 650,000 pounds? \nAs this institution is now partially nationalised ..it is the hardworking, taxpaying millions that will be paying for this FATCAT to reap our rewards. Many people are being rewarded with unemployment for a job well done.",
