            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, spending on medical research by charities (including universities) is VAT zero rated. However, other research carried out by universities in fields as diverse as plant sciences, pollution control and materials science are all charged VAT on purchases. This can occur even when the research itself is funded by a charity and even though these fields are often less well financially supported in the first instance. This is seriously hampering the progress of science in the UK as 17.5% of money awarded for spending goes straight back to the Treasury. We therefore petition the government to remove the VAT-payable status on non-medical research in universities, thus increasing the amount of funds available to grant holders in all areas of non-medical scientific research.",
