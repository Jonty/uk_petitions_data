            "background": "Childhood Cancers have been linked to levels of pollution from car exhausts. Researchers have found that higher numbers of children developed and died from cancer in pollution hotspots.\n\n\"And the highest risk of cancer for children is caused by living within 0.3 kilometres of a chemical emissions hotspot and within 1km of an emissions source - such as a transport hub.\u201d\nProfessor George Knox, from the University of Birmingham.\n\nThe Harrison square part of Longshaw Street in Dallam,is unofficialy used as just such a hub with bus services which start at 6.30am and continue to 11.30pm,EVERY 6 MINS. These bus services, include old School diesel twin decks and WBC public transport synchronising their timetables.As a result this particular section of the street has at times up to 4 idling buses all within one hundred square yards, their engines running in excess of the legal engine idling limit of 5mins.\nthere is a bus there almost constantly throught the day emmiting just such noise and polution.",
