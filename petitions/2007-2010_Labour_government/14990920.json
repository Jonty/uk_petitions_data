        "action": "concentrate road investment in the South East of England to maximise benefit to the UK economy.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Without significant investment in its road network the South East's economic potential will never be reached.\nCongestion negatively impacts on businesses, and the poor condition of the roads makes a bad situation worse. \nInstead of relatively small amounts of funding to patch up the roads,  the region needs substantial financial support to increase capacity.\nAn improved road network would allow businesses to expand, stimulating economic growth and creating more jobs which would in turn lead to greater tax revenues for the government which could be invested elsewhere in the country.",
