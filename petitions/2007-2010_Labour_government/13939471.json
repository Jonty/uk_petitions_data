        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current terms stated in the rehabilitation of offenders act are outdated and can impose a negative effect upon those convicted of offences. \n\nThe current rehabilitation periods for those whose sentances included community orders, fines, curfew etc, currently stands at 5 years for those over 18 when convicted and 2.5 years for those under 18 when convicted. \n\nThese periods of rehabilitation are unduly harsh, whilst a minority of offenders will re-offend, the majority will not. Those who have been fined or undertaken community punishments or curfews have already served their sentance. It is questionable why these periods of so-called rehbilation are of such a long period. These rehabilitation periods leave many people at risk of being able to gain employment or having the offer of employment withdrawn due to having a current conviction. Once a fine/community punihment/curfew/compensation order/custodial sentance is paid/completed then this should class as sentance served instead of persons having to be classed as offenders for an unreasonable/undue amount of time.",
