            "background": "United Kingdom is the home of second largest Somali people in the Diaspora around the world after USA most of whom are British citizens. \n\nWe, being British of Somali background, feel to be a part of the solution and do more to ensure the safe returns of Rachel and Paul as that has taken too long.\n\nThe community is organising solidarity campaigns: Free Chandel Family Immediately. The theme of the campaign is \u2018British Somali community is on your side: Paul and Rachel not with the pirates\u2019 and the campaign will continue until they come home safely.\n\nI urge every one to sign in hope of bringing Paul and Rachel at home safely. The people who are holding the couple do not know anyone or anything other than money.\n\nWe also urge the British government to do more in helping the rebirth of Somali government so these incidents will never happen again.\n\nAlthough Somali people have mixed feelings about the pirates, under no circumstance no one can justify keeping as hostage Paul and Rachel.\n\nPlease join the movement and sign this petition.\n\nThank you before hand.\n\nM. Hassan",
