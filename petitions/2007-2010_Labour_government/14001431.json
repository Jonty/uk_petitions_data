            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Calman Report recommends that The Scottish Parliament should be handed control of airgun legislation in Scotland.  The Scottish Parliament may then wish to introduce registration for all airguns. This measure would be likely to reduce the criminal use of air weapons (armed robbery, assault, domestic violence and the suffering of wild and domestic animals.) whilst ensuring that responsible, legitimate sporting shooters would be able to register their air weapons and continue to use them as before.\n \nThose currently having unregistered airguns would not be 'banned' from owning them, they would merely be required to register them.  This measure, were it to happen would therefore have no adverse effect whatsoever on responsible owners.\n  \nAir weapon are all required to be registered in Ireland, and there is therefore no reason whatsoever why this should not happen elsewhere. We therefore petition you to grant devolved power for air weapon legislation to Scotland.",
