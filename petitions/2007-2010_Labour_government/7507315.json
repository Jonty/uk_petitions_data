            "background": "Liberty is precious. The Magna Cartas. The Scottish Constitution and the UK Bill Of Rights and the unwritten UK constitution with its laws, liberties and rights accorded therein should never be diluted or surrendered or compromised by treaty obligations. The European Union respects the written constitutions of every EU member country and so respects our written Scottish Constitution, but does not respect the English/Welsh/UK unwritten constitution.  Ted Heath a former Prime Minister promised the UK no loss of sovereignty before the UK voted \"Yes\" for the joining the EEC trade block. At that time Mr Heath was silent on the subject of what sovereignty he meant which was that the Britains own sovereignty was to be replaced yes replaced by a new Pan European Sovereignty which we would all share. I believe the wool was pulled over our eyes in the semantics but that's no reason not to have all that was there before enshrined into the EU. Save it now as none of it can surely be defended in a majority EU vote. Keep our UK Constitutional liberties, freedoms or rights.",
