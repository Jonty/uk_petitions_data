            "background": "The decision to close BBC 6 Music goes against the BBCs stated aim of focussing on \u2018quality\u2019. 6 Music is an excellent radio station that does a great deal for championing new music which is something that could not be solely transferred to Radio 2, Radio 1 or commercial radio (which plays far less new and varied music than BBC radio stations or XFM generally). The decision mustn\u2019t solely be based on listening figures but for its added value \u2013 in terms of inspiring people to go out and buy music, go to gigs and follow new bands having heard the music on 6. The BBC could save money by curbing excessive salaries for celebrities and news readers rather than closing down a perfectly good radio station to fund the \u2018rebranding of Radio 7 as Radio 4 Extra\u2019.",
