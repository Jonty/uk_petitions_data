            "background": "Why is it that our government do what they want, not necessarily whats best for the people of Great Britain? They are more concerned about their image as being politically correct and helping everyone else in the world except for the people who put them where they are today with their high salaries and second homes furnished by the taxpayer. Stop spending money on helping the rest of the world when there's people in Britain who need help, because if the tables were turned I bet they wouldn't help us!! Charity starts at home!!",
