            "background": "If the government used taxpayers money to bail individuals out of debt, the amount of disposable income in the country would increase, allowing the taxpaying public to start spending again.\n\nWhy should the banks still profit from each individual's debt when, due to negligence and incompetence, they have had to be bailed out of their own debt by taxpayer's hard earned money? \n\nWe are taxed almost a third of our salaries every month to pay for services which are constantly failing and now it seems, to bail out the banks who have been over-lending, overspending and over-borrowing. \n\nIn the current government, the more you earn and subsequently the more tax you pay, the less you benefit from it.\n\nWhy does the general public not benefit directly from their own money?\n\nHow does encouraging the banks to lend again help with the issue of national debt?\n\nTaxpayers money should be spent on improving the lives of the general public by reducing each individual's debt, not to allow the banks to recover from their incompetence to start lending and charging once again.",
