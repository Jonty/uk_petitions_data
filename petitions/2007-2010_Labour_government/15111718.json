            "background": "Years 10 and 11 are the two most important years at secondary school. At this age, whilst under taking GCSEs, students have enough to contend with without compulsory PE. Every 14, 15 and 16 year old understands the basic importance of physical excercise and no longer needs to be taught it. The time spent on PE in Years 10 and 11 could be much better utilised to do work that will affect career choices and futures in the world of work.",
