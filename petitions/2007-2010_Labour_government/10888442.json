        "background": "Iceland as a nation is vulnerable at the moment.  Despite the strained relationship that has sometimes existed between our nations, they are still a fellow democracy, and hopefully our friends.  Although they've made some mistakes in their financial activities, now is not the time to punish them.  They need our help.  Using anti-terrorist legislation to seize their assets is no better than a street mugging.  The UK government should feel thoroughly ashamed for even contemplating kicking them when they're down.",
