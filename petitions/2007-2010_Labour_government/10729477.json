        "background": "Premiership teams are spending ever growing sums of money on buying players, whilst the lower tiers of the game struggle to survive.\n\nThe levy would provide much needed funding and resources for youth, womens, amateur and lower league sectors of the game and might act as a brake on the currently ridiculous rise in transfer fees.\n\nIt would be good to know that when a player moves for \u00a350 million in the next transfer window, that \u00a31 million of that transfer will be coming back to the place where the game really lives - in our communities.",
