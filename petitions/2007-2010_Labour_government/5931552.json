        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If the smoking age is going to be put up to 18 years old(so ive heard) then I suggest that it also include the sell of Rizla papeers, matches, lighters etc as it seems that a child of below 16 at the moment can go and buy these items with no questions asked. What are they doing with them? erm let me see, well probably smoking a hell of a lot worse than cigeterttes so why are they also not banned to children, I think they should be as what would they need a packet of rizla for exactly. Its alright banning kids from buying cigerettes but they would be ignored walking down the street with one of them in there mouth, I think this is stupid, Rizla are also used for smoking but also \"scinning up\"kids dhould not be able to get these therefore making it harder for them to smoke the illegal drugs that we cant put a stop too.\nAlso I think there should be something to stop adults buying the cigerattes for them as children stand outside shops waiting for a adult to ask to get them some fags.\n\nThanks",
