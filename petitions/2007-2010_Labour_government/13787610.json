            "background": "In the UK Millions of pounds of the tax payers money is spent on cleaning chewing gum off the streets. This is an absurd amount of money spent when this money could be spent on more worth while causes. At the moment the penalty is between 70-80 pounds fine (depending on borough). I propose the amount of the fine should be increased and a criminal conviction of community service (to clean this chewing gum off the streets) should be inforced.",
