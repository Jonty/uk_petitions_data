        "action": "Extend the weekend hours of operation on our London Underground - for safer & more accessible nights out in our capital",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "My proposition is that the hours of our London Underground Tube service, operation are extended on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. \n\nBy extending the hours of operation on these evenings to 4am for example, revellers could enjoy much cheaper and more importantly safer, nights out in London. \n\nThis would: \n\n* Calm the 'rush' of people using the last tubes \n\n* Be safer for people to get home, detering them from having to get unmarked taxis, especially with the necessary rise in cab fees once again. \n\n* Making it more accessible and affordable, which would boost business in London at the weekends \n\nI can not believe that being one of the richest countries in the world, our tube service (and public transport system in general) is much poorer than lesser financially privileged countries. \n\nI feel charging extra pay-as-you-use road fees and is not the way forward, public transport standards and services should be improved as a priority making them more user-friendly.",
