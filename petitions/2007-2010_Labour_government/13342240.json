            "background": "I think it is ridiculous that celebrities are paid extortionate amounts, such as millions or even billions of pounds, to simply entertain us, when there are people in professions such as the army, the police etc. who are risking their own safety every day and are paid hardly a tenth of what a music or sports star may be paid. For example, many professional footballers are paid in excess of 20 Million GBP per year, whereas an average member of the army (who may be fighting for their life in Afghanistan or other war territories) is only paid 20-30 thousand pounds per year. Please sign this petition if you think this issue needs to be addressed.",
