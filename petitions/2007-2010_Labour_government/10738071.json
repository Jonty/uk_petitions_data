            "background": "The UK MoD has large sites with multiple buildings that could be retrofitted with Wind, Solar PV and hot water systems.  This would not only reduce UK MoD energy consumption, but could produce surplus energy for sale.  This would demonstrate this governments commitment to green energy.  All SLA and Married Quarters should be included in this scheme.  This is a spend to save scheme.",
