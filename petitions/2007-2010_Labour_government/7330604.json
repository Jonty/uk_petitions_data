            "background": "As a British Citizen living in France and paying French taxes I am fighting to extend our fundemental voting rights in the EU. In France and other EU member states we are a very large number of expats who wish to be able to become fully integrated into local life, this means that we must be accepted as councillors and have the right to vote and stand as candidates in all the local elections up to Regional Level. In France we have only the right to vote for the town council elections, however the local taxes are paid on the same basis up to regional level.I ask our Right Honorable Prime Minister to help defend and increase our voting rights as British subjects living and working in other EU member states.",
