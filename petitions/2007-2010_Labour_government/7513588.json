        "background": "Having had 4 pet sheep killed and one severely mauled by 2 local dogs in three separate attacks, we were astonished to discover the police have no power to remove the dogs until the owner has been convicted in court. This can take many months and until then the dogs are free to continue their killing sprees.  Current legislation should be amended so that dogs which have been seen attacking people or animals can be immediately impounded until the outcome of a court case. Please ensure Darcy the sheep didn't die in vain.",
