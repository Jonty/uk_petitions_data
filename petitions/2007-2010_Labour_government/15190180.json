            "background": "The proposed measures should apply to the following 4 breeds:\nAny variation of Pit bull, Rottweiler, Doberman or Alsatian.\n\n- Ban ownership if under 16s are living at the owners address.\n- All dogs to be chipped.\n- Must be muzzled when outside owner premises (including outside grounds \u2013 i.e. no more guard dogs in domestic areas).\n- When in public must always be on a leash.\n- To own any of these dogs you must have a license at a cost of \u00a32000 per year \u2013 a portion of which goes into a central insurance fund.  This must be carried around at all times and cross referenced with the dog chip.\n- Under 25s are not allowed to own these dogs or be in control of them in public spaces.\n- Instant life ban of owning any of these dogs if the owner allows the dog to injure other dogs or people anywhere including their own house; or it proven to be in violation of any of the above rules.\n\nThis rules are harsh but would ensure people could still own these dogs, but their threat, especially to children is limited.",
