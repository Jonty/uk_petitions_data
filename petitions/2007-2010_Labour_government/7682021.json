They are not easily recycled, needing highly specialised recycling plants and yet more vast amounts of energy. The Government should also provide full details of the poisonous chemicals and heavy metals that are incorporated into these environmentally unfriendly devices. \nThe Prime Minister is also urged to promote the far more effective LED lights, which provide a far higher quality of light and ultra low energy usage, without the environmental cost of compact fluorescent bulbs.",
