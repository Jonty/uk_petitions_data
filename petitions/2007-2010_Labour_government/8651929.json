            "background": "I propose that a vote of no confidence be made in this labour government.\nMy reasons for this are as follows.\n1. The act of persecution of the lowest in our society, persuing the sick and infirm\nwithout good cause.\n2.Spending the countries money on keeping other countries afloat.\n3. Corruption by MPs in the form of over inflated expense claims,and not declaring outside intrests, nepotism.\n4. Not representing the intrests of the voters that elected them.\n5. entering us into an illegal war that has cost the lives of under equipped british serviceman.\nthese are just a few of my reasons for my petition but no doubt gagging orders will be enforced.",
