            "background": "I feel it is very important that we label our alcoholic drink much more clearly, and think that the warning should be suitably strong given the social and health problems this dangerous drug provides us with.\nAlcoholism is an extremely common problem, yet there are hard-hitting and to the point warnings on cigarette packets, and no such warnings on wine bottles, lager cans etc.\nThere is much more help readily available for smokers than there is for drinkers.\nAdverts on the television warn people of the dangers of smoking, but we see no similar health promoting ads warning against the most common, socially acceptable drug available!\nIt is essential we make people think when purchasing alcoholic drink, as we have a major social problem surrounding it and we must begin to tackle this at the very start.",
