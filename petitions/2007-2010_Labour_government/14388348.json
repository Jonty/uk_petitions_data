Some inocent people get fined as well and loose their licence too. Traffic camera's are not altered according to weather conditons that's what is wrong. I need to explain this in greater details if you are prepared to hear me on this serious matter which is conected with all british citizen's. Thanks nd hope to hear from you soon.",
