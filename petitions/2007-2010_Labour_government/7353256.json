        "background": "A tournament of this nature in the summer of 2008 will help towards brightening up what is otherwise going to be a very dull period for British and Irish football. It will also assist businesses likely to suffer as a result of non qualification and give the players an opportunity for competitive match experience in readiness for World Cup qualifying games which start in September 2008. I would suggest all five teams in a single league playing each other home and away giving fans 20 great games to watch.",
