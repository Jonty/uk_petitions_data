            "background": "The essence of a league competition, football or other, is that every team has an equal chance of success or failure. In football, that equal chance is having the opportunity to play each of your league opponents twice - once at home and once away. The Premier League's proposal to add an extra, overseas fixture to the football calendar is a cynical, money-making scheme which will undermine the integrity and fairness of the greatest game on Earth.",
