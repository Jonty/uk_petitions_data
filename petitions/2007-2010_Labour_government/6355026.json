            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A large proportion of most peoples waste is plastic packaging. Why can't the supermarkets use packaging that can be reused several times before being recycled. Recycling uses a lot of energy and therefore produces C02. Reusing uses less energy. Therefore we should reuse packaging before recycling it. When I was a child I used to take our fizzy drink bottles back to the corner shop and got 10p for my trouble for each bottle. Why can't supermarkets do the same for all their packaging for bottles, etc. Standard plastic containers of various sizes could be designed and made so they could reused by consumers and consumers rewarded with money off of their grocery  bill when they return the reusable packages. Why are we throwing away perfectly good plastic bottles and containers and glass bottles that could be reused? It's so wasteful of time, energy and money. So please vote for this petition, write your to your MPs, write to your supermarkets, and do everything you can to persuade retailers and government to reuse before recycling! Thank you.",
