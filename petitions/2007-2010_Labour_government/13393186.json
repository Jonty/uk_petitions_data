            "background": "Nurse Shirley Chaplin is being disciplined by Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Trust for wearing a Crucifix necklace while on duty.  She has worn this symbol of her religious belief throughout a 30 year nursing career and should be able to continue doing so.  Furthermore, the Prime Minister should ensure that legislation is upheld that prevents discrimination on the wearing of objects and/or clothing relating to religious belief, irrespective of whatever faith is being adhered to.  The only other alternative is to prohibit all personal religious objects and clothing at work, and to ensure that all religions are treated the same within any such prohibition.",
