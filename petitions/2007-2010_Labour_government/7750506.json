        "background": "London has one of the highest turn over rates for nursing staff in the country.  This results in a reduction in the quality of service due to new staff having less experience.  One of the main reasons for this high turn over is the high cost of living in the city and then the high cost of traveling into the city if you move out.  One answer would be to pay nursing staff a lot more, but anther solution would be to offer free travel into the city in a similar way as the MET police do, \"Free travel is available up to an approx 70 mile radius out of London.\".  This would mean that staff could afford a good quality of life whilst still working in the city and therefore staff retention would increase.",
