            "background": "This petition is aimed at increasing the number of people in the UK who can speak (and write) in complete and grammatically correct English. At present, many failed young people including graduates lose out in employment and other opportunities due to careless spelling and grammar. A whole generation has never had any grammar lessons in our state schools. Sadly, as is often the case, those who do have a good understanding of grammar were either educated at private schools or had to learn the grammar of English in order to learn a modern foreign language such as French or Spanish. We need grammar lessons in schools so that the next generation know what \"adjectives\", \"adverbs\" and \"pronouns\" are when they leave school and join the work force.",
