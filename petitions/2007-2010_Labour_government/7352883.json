            "background": "By far the best candidate for the job is Jose Mourinho.\n\n1. He installs winning mentalities in his players\n\n2. He can manage big egos\n\n3. He doesn't tolerate poor form\n\n4. All the players know and respect him as one of the world's best managers\n\n5. He'd get the best out of Lampard, Terry and Cole\n\n6. He's pro-active in his tactics and substitutions. If a player is playing poorly and the system clearly isn't working, he wouldn't hesitate to sub him off and change things around after half an hour of the game. Unlike Sven and McClaren who tended to stick by their favourite players and formations regardless of who things were going\n\n7. He might even figure out a way to play Lampard and Gerrard togethber. After all, that's what he wanted at Chelsea before Gerrard decided to stay at Liverpool.\n\n8. He's available\n\n9. He's already settled in London\n\n10. He's good with the media, which would count for a lot.\n\n11. He is at the right age in his managerial career to take on a big challenge like this.",
