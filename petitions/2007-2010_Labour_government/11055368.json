            "background": "In 2005, 'The Supply of Relevant Veterinary Medicinal Products Order 2005' was introduced to prevent vets charging for prescriptions. This enabled farmers and pet owners to buy medicine at a more affordable price on-line or in chemists. (Possibly indicating that vets overcharge for the medicine in the first place?)\n\nFrom October 2008, vets are once more allowed to charge per animal, per prescription, with no legal limit set for the charges. \n\nI am concerned for the welfare of animals needing ongoing treatment, particularly in the current climate of financial constraints. They will be the first to suffer.\n\nPlease sign this petition to ask the government to reinstate the law for free veterinary prescriptions.",
