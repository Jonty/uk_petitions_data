            "background": "About 75% of what a council spends comes from Whitehall. On a national level this is roughly the same amount of money raised through VAT each year.\n\nInstead of sending the money to Whitehall, for them to send it out to local councils, let the councils raise the money themselves by replacing nationally collected VAT with a Local Sales Tax.\n\nThe current system promotes fiscal irresponsibility of local authorities as those which turn council tax into high quality services aren't eligible for as many grants as those who do not. The result is that the council tax people pay has little effect on the services they receive. Efficient councils need to disproportionately raise taxes as they lose grant money, while inefficient ones operate at the expense of the of the whole nation and not just those who voted them in.",
