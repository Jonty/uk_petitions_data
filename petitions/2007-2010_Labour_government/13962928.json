        "background": "i would like to petition the goverment to include sex offenders under the proceeds of crime act.the reasons i would like this to happen are..cities across the country are lacking in available support for victims of sex crimes, this is mainly due to lack of funding. it is evident throughout that sex offenders who have assets continually use them to assist them in the grooming and sexual abuse of their victims.if this change was made, monies taken could be put into a victims fund to pay for treatment and compensation for the victims. thank you",
