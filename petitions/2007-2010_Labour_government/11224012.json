            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nThese work restrictions imposed on Romanian nationals prevent access to the labour market on an equal basis with UK or other EU nationals. Romanian nationals are precluded from getting jobs in the UK because employers are not willing to employ Romanians citing these restrictions even though they have the right documentation. These restrictions create unfair discrimination and push people to the black market. It is time the UK government stop these unnecessary and unfair restrictions.",
