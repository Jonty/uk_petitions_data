            "background": "I would like to see the complete closure of supermarkets on Sundays and a restriction of trading times of supermarkets when they are in close proximity to a residential area. This to include staff and delivery movements. At the moment most stores are closed for only two days a year.\nThe impact of noise and disturbance on nearby residents is unacceptable. \nStaff arriving early with no regard to sleeping residents is one aspect that planners do not seem to take into account. \nThere are enough out of town stores and the availability of online shopping to justify these closures.",
