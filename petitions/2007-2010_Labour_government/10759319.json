There will be enough channels available for this to happen without the schedules of the five 'terrestial' channels being messed around.\n\nCharging to view matches will result in fewer viewers and fewer people being interested in those sports.  This will create a downward spiral of interest in sport in general.\n\nThe management of the variopus spaorts have been greedy in accepting over inflated payments from televesion companies so that those companies can make even larger profits.",
