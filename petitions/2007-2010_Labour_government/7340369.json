Please offer some guidance on what to do about this, Prime Minister - here is one example - LOTTO PROMOTION, National Office, Kruslann 205, 1098 SJ, \nAmsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nGiven the current attention in the media about database protection, fraud and identity theft,- the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to filter these a bit. Every day I get at least 10 offers of fortune and NONE have been fulfilled - do my consumer rights include prosecution of these companies -the possibility of criminal negligence is great enough to warrant nationwide, governmental action. What does the rest of the nation think ?",
