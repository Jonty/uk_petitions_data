            "background": "Current legislation forces people to be regarded as male or female. Some people live outside of these binary categories and their lives are made difficult by having to constantly explain to people that their gender differs from that recorded in government databases. Far from giving these people confidentiality, incorrectly recording their gender results in them having to constantly fight for recognition & sends the message to the rest of society that it is ok to misgender these people. This causes gender dysphoria which nobody should have to endure in order to maintain employment, access medical care and live without harassment.\n\nConsequently we regard labelling non-binary people as M or F to be unnecessary disclose of their assigned gender. We do not feel that issues in altering legislation that currently reinforces an artificial binary justifies systematic erasure of people's identities and the lives they lead.\n\nWe call for the creation of an 'other' option in addition to M and F.",
