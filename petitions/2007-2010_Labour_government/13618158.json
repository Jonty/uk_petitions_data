        "background": "People pay income tax and national insurance contributions as individuals, but when it comes to benefits, couples are treated as a unit wherein one partner is working and that same partner is penalised financially because of the other\u2019s circumstances. This is unfair and tantamount to innocent individuals having to subsidise the government in respect of contributing financially towards an individual who has paid into the national insurance system in order to receive support when it is needed.",
