So how about the government stop spending our road tax on different things and actually make our roads drivable instead of the diabolical condition they are currently in. Also with green taxes, i dont mind paying them so much if you actually spend my money on green schemes in order to make things better, but i have not seen any green projects being produced by the government. Stop spending my tax on useless things and if you are not going to use it for what im being taxed for, I would like my money back!",
