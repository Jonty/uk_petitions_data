        "action": "Protect investment in construction work to help the competitiveness of the UK",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Building magazine has launched a campaign to protect investment in UK construction. This is not a special plea for the construction industry, but an economic argument that continued capital investment will pay dividends for the economy. This case is borrowed from the LEK report commissioned by the UK Contractors Group, which argued that every \u00a31 invested in construction generates \u00a32.84 in GDP. Hence our campaign name: Charter 284. \nWe appreciate that public spending will have to be cut. What we want is for some areas to be protected, and after a great deal of consultation with the industry, we have selected five measures to extract the most benefit from capital spending:\n1. Complete the renewal of the school estate \n2. Don't let spending on transport infrastructure fall more than 10% below current levels \n3. Reduce the regulatory burden on the housing sector to encourage more development \n4. Give householders incentives to green existing homes \n5. Prioritise the development of renewable energy, including nuclear, through incentives for private sector investment.",
