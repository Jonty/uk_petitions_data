            "background": "The extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin shows that Britain and other countries needs to find ways to put pressure on countries which are failing to act on the issue of pollution. This could be via trade restrictions such as a tariff on goods which originate from countries which have not signed the Kyoto agreement or have not got similar agreements. The income would be used on research/investment in areas such as animal conservation and environmentally friendly technology. The tariff could be variable so that countries which are making an effort would get a lower rate than a country which is just ignoring an agreement. For example, at the end of 2006 only Sweden and the UK look like fulfilling their Kyoto committments even though many other countries have signed the treaty.",
