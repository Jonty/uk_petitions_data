            "background": "With rape increasing, averaging 167 women per day in the UK, I think it is about time that all women were provided with a source of protection against an attacker.\nFor example a personal attack alarm which releases an ear piercing alarm, when activated, which can be heard half a mile away.\nThey are inexpensive and may just put some attackers off.\nEven if Mr Brown would not  provide them for free, if they could be advertised better and offered at an affordable price for all women.\nOr any other form of protection for women which would be suitable.\n\nMany thanks",
