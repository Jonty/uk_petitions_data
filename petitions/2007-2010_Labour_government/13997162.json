            "background": "Award winning Angus Mental Health Association (AMHA), has been funded by Angus Council since 1995 to provide mental health services and has done so with an unblemished record. Angus Council have now said that they are not allowing AMHA to tender for future services and as result AMHA faces closure. If this is not overturned, Angus Council will have closed an effective local charity,denying vulnerable adults access to new and innovative services, as would have been delivered by AMHA and the unique partnerships it has developed with other leading agencies - Scottish Association for Mental Health and the Volunteer Centre Angus.",
