            "background": "for too long now we have been driving around on sub standard roads. Its about time the government made councils resurface the roads properly. A survey by Kwik Fit (that replaces a lot of the damage) has concluded that 1.1 million motorists damage tyres and wheels after hitting potholes each year.\n\nIt was already known that councils spend \u00a360,000,000 a year compensating motorists for pothole damage, yet only \u00a335,000,000 repairing potholes. why not just use this money properly and reapir the roads.\n\ni live in sheffield and have recently found out i have a buckled wheel. Most likely cause......potholes in the road. i now have to spend my hard earned getting it repaired. i'm sick of it.  please join this protest and pass on to EVERYONE you know.",
