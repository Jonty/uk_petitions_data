I agree smoking does put a strain on the NHS, but if every one stopped smoking, how much would our taxes increase?\nThe natural way forward would be to ban alchohol. How much of a strain is alchohol related health problems costing the NHS? How much for Policing? Is it possible that there is a vested interest in the sale of alchohol? No, surely not! Are we a democracy any more? I think not. Our freedom of choice is being taken away from us. What a sad decline for this once, very respected island.",
