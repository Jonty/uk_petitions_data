Not only has he brought laughter to millions for his comic appearances, but has written for so many other comedians. He is a comic genius and should be recognised as such, the only fitting tribute would be to give him a knighthood. Let us celebrate all he has given to the world of entertainment now in his lifetime, and not wait to do so in his obituary.",
