As a result, the computer network that regulates the nations tax system is in the hands of shareholders and the number of data centres in government buildings has reduced from more than 10 in 1990 to 1 by 2010 (Only Accounts Office Shipley is government owned, other buildings are owned by the companies concerned)\n\nPlease protect jobs and the level of service by bringing this service back into government hands",
