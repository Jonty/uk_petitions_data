            "background": "As atheism presupposes that we live in a closed system of natural causes and that there is no God or supreme being, it follows that issues of truth, justice, right and wrong are entirely matters of personal opinion and that the use of absolutes is incompatible with claims that our existence is entirely attributable to the random operation of time plus chance rather than creative design. If there is no God then there is no reason and no purpose to our existence. Atheists should make sense of life as they wish as long as they allow others to do the same. The bloodshed of the 20th century caused by the twin atheistic evils of communism and fascism ought to encourage less dogmatism.",
