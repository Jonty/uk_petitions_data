            "background": "Southeastern trains huge price increase on train faares shouldnt be allowed especially be allowed to be unregulated! \nWhen will the fare increases end?\nIt certainly would never reduce!\nWe have been told that the increased pricing is for faster trains servicing Ebbsfleet! Unbelievable!\n\nThis is the highest rise in the country.\nAt a time when we are struggling with the recession, this train company is adding to our difficulties and is stinging us for more cash.\nThese rises could make the recession bite harder and could lead to more congestion and pollution as people abandon public transport for their cars.\n\nLets call on the government to step in and use the power they have over regulated fares to impose a freeze on ticket prices for a year. \nJust as the Government stepped in to freeze fuel duty for motorists because of the recession, they should change their mind and stop these price increases going ahead.\n\nAs Rail passengers we feel angry and that we are being taken for a ride by Southeastern trains.",
