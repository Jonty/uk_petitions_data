            "background": "It has recently come to light that 4 out of 5 schools are not doing a Christmas Nativity play this year. At our local school they have had special assembleys for Eid and Diwali as well as other religious festivals explaining to the pupils the religious aspect of these festivals but they are not putting on a Nativity play, I feel that children should be taught about all religions and do not understnad why some get speacial treatment compared to others. By the way I am not religious, I would just like my children to have the advantage of learning and understanding as many religions as possible especially a religion that was quite a factor in our history.\nI would like it to be school policy that religions should get the same amount of coverage as eachother.\nIf you agree please sign my petition that will be sent to the PM.",
