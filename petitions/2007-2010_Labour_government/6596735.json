        "background": "Time to stop Tax relief for Buy to Let Landlords who own multiple properties?\nThe Buy to Let Landlords have an advantage over hard-pressed first-time buyers because they benefit from tax breaks that are not available to owner occupiers. \n\nThe Inland Revenue, allows landlords to offset the costs of mortgage interest, letting agency fees, and replacement furniture and repairs, against the tax payable on rental income. \n\nRegular buyers, however, waved goodbye to tax relief on mortgage payments back in 2000 when the government abolished Miras. \n\nBuy-to-let investors are locusts who turn pleasant residential neighbourhoods into desolate wastelands occupied by transient tenants, stopping the growth of stable communities.\n\nSurely if the governement stopped or limited the number of properties that the Buy to Lets bought that would stabalise the property market",
