            "background": "In an effort to ease the financial burden of the newly back to work the government could instigate a policy allowing any unused tax allowance to accumulate or rollover to be used in the next tax year. With a sensible constraint, my suggestion is a maximum of two years, hence if someone is newly back to work after a prolonged period unemployed they could have a tax free allowance of \u00a318105 in that first year. This would be of particular help to university graduates, the increased income would help them pay off existing debt whilst increasing their spending power giving the economy a vital boost.",
