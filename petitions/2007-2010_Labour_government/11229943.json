The people of this fair isle require more sleep and ' rest time '. Maybe 24hrs in a day was fine in the 1950's when commerce wasn\u2019t as fast moving and demands so great. However ' times change '. Making this radical move will also help you. So help others and at the same time help yourself and they will help everyone help each other through times of help.\n\nWe await your response \n\nThe 28hr a day Party",
