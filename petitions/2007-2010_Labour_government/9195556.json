            "background": "The no smoking ban, whilst a boon to those of us who have been driven out of public places in the past, is now driving smokers to sit/stand outside public places making doorways a carcinogenic corridor. They now take up all the outdoor drinking/seating/dining areas in Britain meaning the non smokers are forced to remain inside irrespective of temperature or inclination.  I want smoking banned everywhere except in smokers' own homes.  It has been proved carcinogenic so let smokers keep it to themselves.",
