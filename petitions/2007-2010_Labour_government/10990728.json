            "background": "In the current age where it is necessary for 2 parents to work full time I think it is ridiculous that children should be given approximately 14 weeks holiday off school in a year, when you consider that the average person gets around 4 weeks holiday entitlement off work.  The children also get bored having 6 weeks off for Summer.  It was ok when we were younger and only one parent needed to work, but in the current climate where it is necessary for both parents to work, this should definitely be revised.",
