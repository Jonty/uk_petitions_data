            "background": "The government is bringing democracry into disrepute. MPs and Lords live a totally different lifestyle to their paying constituents at the expense of their constituents. The peple of Britain have no faith in the current government and/or system which is why the extremist parties are more appealing to the voters. The inability of various MPs to answer any questions which were reasonably put to them on Question Time merely highlights the lack of trust between them and the voters. A system needs transparency so the voters can see what their hard earned money is being spent on, this is the only way to regain trust from the public. Frankly if the expenses scandal had not been published MPs would still be claiming fraudulently without any guilt whatsoever. Another point is that if any voters tried to be fraudulent with benefits they would be facing prosecution while MPs only have to say sorry, ergo you can see my point of the system and government being soo far distanced from their constituents' lifestyles and laws.",
