            "background": "There are so many older and disabled people who would love to have a pet of some kind for a companion.  Unfortunately due to the very high vets bills many will not take on the responsibility of a pet because they cannot afford to look after them properly. \n\nIt seems such a shame as the animal sanctuaries are overflowing with animals that just want a home and to be loved and there are people who would willing look after an animal but do not have the funds as the vets bills are so very high!\n\nIsnt it about time that the government stepped in to devise a scale of payment for vets in accordance with what income you have. \n\nIt would solve the problem of over crowded sancturies, pets not being looked after properly because of very high vet bills, and give a lot of people the enjoyment of loving a pet and combating loneliness, and a chance for an animal to have a loving home.",
