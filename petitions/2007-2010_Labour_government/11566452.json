            "background": "The Ministry of Defence are currenty trying to gain planning permission to turn the small independant shops within the market square of Greenwich into a Hotel. This will involve the unfair take-over of business owners premisses, who have been there over 20years, and have every right to stay there and continue trading. If this planning permssion is granted, Greenwich will loose it unique quirky independence and be on its way to becoming a dull commecial town with no character. Greenwich market is one of the best in London and attracts hundreds into the area every week! please help save not only Greenwich market, but also Greenwich village by signing this petition. Your contribution will be much appreciated!",
