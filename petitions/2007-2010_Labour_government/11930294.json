            "background": "The National speed limit of 70mph was introduced several decades ago, and reduced to 60mph in the seventies. Cars and their associated safety sytems have improved no end, including ABS, intelligent braking systems, allied with better tyres have seriously reduced stopping distances. Motorcycles have also benefited and ABS is becoming more and more common on these vehicles too.\nIf the speed limit was increased and police more effectively people could reach their destination sooner and spend less time polluting in their cars. This benefit would be felt by the economy as people would be able to do more work more efficiently. \nReducing speed limits in this modern day and age is ridiculous. It just proves how out of touch the current administration are with their voters!",
