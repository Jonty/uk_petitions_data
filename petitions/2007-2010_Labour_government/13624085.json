        "background": "Recently a friend of mines, a biker, had been knocked down by a driver because the driver did not hear his motor bike coming up the side of him as he had his music blasting, it litterally caused his windows to vibrate!\nMusic should be kept to a certain dB when in cars.\nPlaying music at above 100dB is simply un-acceptable, this causes distress to other road users and citizens, that is about the same volume that is created by a jet taking off a landing strip!\nThis can also eradicate the function of the drivers pernament hearing, I personally feel if you do not have the ability to hear, you should not be driving alone as this can prove dangerous in itself! \n\nLoud music kills.",
