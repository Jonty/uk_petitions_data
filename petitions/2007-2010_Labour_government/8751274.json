            "background": "We continue to oppose badger culling as a method of controlling bovine TB.  We appreciate the anxiety and disruption that bovine TB causes in the farming community and the contribution of livestock farmers to environmentally friendly land management. We also acknowledge that badgers have a role in the spread of the disease.  \n\nThe Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) published its final report in June 2007.  Their firm view was that culling badgers would not solve the problem and could even make things worse. Since June, without the public knowing, the Government\u2019s own Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir David King, considered the scientific evidence afresh and published his report in October.  By contrast to the ISG, he concluded that badgers should be culled in areas of high incidence of TB in cattle.",
