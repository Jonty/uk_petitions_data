            "background": "I have been in receipt of DLA for 9 years now. I have always been awarded the high rate care because I need somebody to be awake and caring for me during the night as and when I cannot sleep. I pay a carer on a contract with funding from the Local Authority Direct Payment which is topped up with the highter rate care allowance.  This has been taken away and replaced with the middle rate which means that I can no longer have care every night of the week which I need.  This decision could well result in hardship for me, and puts me at risk of injury or worse as a direct result.  DLA is intended to help people like me.  What do I have to do, die?  I have been advised today that the DLA have up to 11 weeks to review their decision, even if they have made an error. They cannot be held responsible if I suffer as a result.",
