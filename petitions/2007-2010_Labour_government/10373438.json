            "background": "That this government seeks to \"restore\" what it cannot take away is an absurdity. That it must \"restate\" this right is nonsense. That it has made homeowners afraid to defend themselves against violent invasion and citizens on the street afraid to resist a mugging or lend a hand to a fellow Brit under attack lest they be prosecuted and imprisoned afterwards is an outrage.\n\nThat the government has abused the people mercilessly is a fact. That it now \"allows\" them to \"use force against criminals who break into their homes or attack them in the street without worrying that 'heat of the moment' misjudgements could see them brought before the courts\" is not something for which we are grateful.\n\nWe have a right to defend ourselves without being attacked by our government and our police services. \n\nUnder the British Constitution - the Coronation Oath, Magna Carta, Common Law, the Declaration of Right (singular Right, the covenant between the people and the monarch, not the Declaration of Rights approved by Parliament) - under all these covenants we have the right to defend ourselves under our ancient laws and customs and under our natural rights.",
