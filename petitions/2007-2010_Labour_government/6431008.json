        "background": "The prime minister seems to think that raising the age to 21 will stop underage drinking,yet he seems to fail to understand that underage drinkers simply get people who are of the age limit in the streets to buy the alcohal for them. He doesnt understand that the majority of people who turn 18 and start drinking to not go over the top. He thinks that if 18 yers old carry around what he calls \"smart cards\" which limits them to 3 units of alcahol a day then that should stop them going over the top, its not the amount of alcahol they take its how that person's body can take",
