It is wrong that these peadofiles, rapists and molesters have a criminal record for life and are not on the sex offenders register for life. a crime that can lead to imprisonment such as benefit fraud leads to a person having a criminal record for life as well as being exempt from other opportunities in life. it is bad enough these people are not \"named and shamed\" there is no logic behind a short span of time on the sex offenders register.",
