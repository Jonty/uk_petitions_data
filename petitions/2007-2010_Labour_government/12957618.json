            "background": "Mr Peter Harvey a science teacher has appeared before magistrates charged with the attempted murder of a 14-year-old pupil at a school in Nottinghamshire.\n\nPeter Harvey, 49, of Rannoch Drive, Mansfield, is accused of attacking Jack Waterhouse at All Saints' Roman Catholic School in Mansfield on 8 July.\n\nMr Harvey should not be charged with attempted murder. He is the victim here. For far too long the plight of teachers has been ignored and the youth of today are getting more and more disrespectful and violent. Teachers are attacked daily, physically, mantally and verbally. It is no wonder this poor man snapped. He had only recently recovered from a stress enduced stroke and returned to work. Mr Harvey like thousands of teachers out there are abused and belittled by disrespectful youth. \n\nIt is only right and proper that he be released as soon as possible without charge so he can seek treatment. \n\nI call on you to pardon him!",
