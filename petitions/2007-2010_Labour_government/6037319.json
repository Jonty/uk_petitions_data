        "background": "I propose that the country should introduce more punishments that fit the crimes, i.e. hard labour, shaming, causing embarrassment etc.  \n\nRather than putting on tags, asbo's, how would a teenager look to his mates if he was made to go around the streets 15 hours a week cleaning and picking litter around the area he was causing a nuisance whilst wearing a yellow boiler suit with his crimes on the back?\n\nOr as in recent flood areas the criminals in prisons or young offender\u2019s institutes being made to fill sand bags to help the households out.\n\nGet the criminals to be an active part of society in some sort of way whilst still showing the country is not being soft on them, and then it wouldn\u2019t look so soft.\n\nThen if all this didn\u2019t work out the country could run on a 3 strikes and your out basis, mandatory prison sentence for 3 criminal offences committed.",
