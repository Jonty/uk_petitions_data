Despite this, and the fact that 84% of the population are happy with opening hours, the government has stated that unless GPs \" voluntarily\" accept extended hours then a more extensive scheme will be imposed. This is a disgraceful negotiation tactic, and will backfire at least as spectacularly as the \"on the day appointments\" debacle.",
