        "background": "Heathrow is too big and too busy. It needs to be a smaller, more efficient airport serving local residents, business people from London & British Holidaymakers. I live 10 minutes away. It is a nightmare to fly from & a nuisance to live near ; most of the passengers using it are not from the UK at all. Why should one industry in the Thames Valley be allowed to blight the quality of life of millions of people living under the flight paths?  Imagine Heathrow was a noisy smelly factory - do you really think it should continue expanding indefinitely ? of course not - the priority is to make it work better for Britain and this means reducing & prioritising flights in the country's interests - not in the interests of shareholders.",
