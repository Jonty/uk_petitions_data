        "background": "The government has set a target that, as of 15/04/2008, 2.5% of all petrol and diesel bought in the UK should be derived from biofuels.  However, it has been suggested that using crops as fuels could lead to a shortage of food, or a rise in prices, that causes the poorest in the world to starve.  Such a result would be monsterous, and must not be allowed to occur.  Halting climate change should be about preventing starvation, and not contribute to causing it.",
