            "background": "The Bloody Sunday families have been promised that the report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry will be handed to the British government in the week beginning 22 March 2010. However, at that point the British will keep the report for an indeterminate time, at least a few weeks, during which time it will be scrutinised and possibly redacted by Ministry of Defence lawyers, the same lawyers who represented the soldiers at the Inquiry.\n\nIs it fair that the British government get advance access to the report, advance possibility of preparing a response, and the possibility of changing Lord Saville\u2019s report?\n\nIs it justice that the British government, who were responsible for Bloody Sunday, will control the release and maybe even the content of the report?\n\nThe families and the wounded are not asking for special treatment, all they are asking for is equality and justice at this crucial time. We demand that the families be treated fairly and that the report be released intact by Lord Saville to all interested parties at the same time.",
