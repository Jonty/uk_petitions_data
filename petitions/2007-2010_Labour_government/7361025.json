            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "An internal inquiry of this nature would not be considered in any other industry.  It would solve little, as the same FA politics, cleeks and views would remain.  The man stated to lead the inquiry, Brian Barwick, is not qualified to make the hugely influential decisions regarding changes at grassroots (i.e. coaching reviews in youth football) or branch level (i.e. selecting a future manager).  Barwick has already proved his incompetence with the appointment of the previous manager and the shambles made of that affair (i.e. the treatment/failure to appoint Scolari or Hiddink).\n\nIt is suggested that an adopted Englishman, Craig Johnston (read http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11096_2899637,00.html ) be appointed to decide a strategy for changes.  Johnston is a pro-active, free thinker who would not buckle under the pressure or influence of the old regimes at the FA.",
