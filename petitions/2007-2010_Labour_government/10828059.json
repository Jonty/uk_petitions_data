It was one of the finest pieces of Victorian architcture on the British Railway network and was demolished amidst considerable public opposition.\n\nThe new 1960s station at Euston is architecturally nondescript and the station has no proper frontage. \n\nNetwork Rail have announced plans to rebuild Euston, and this would be the perfect time to re-build the arch.",
