            "background": "The standard of accommodation for the armed forces has been widely criticised recently and, as a member of the armed forces, I have seen the standards myself.  The standard of single living accommodation is shocking and the modernisation project to upgrade it is years behind schedule.  Service families accommodation is also terrible and I personally know a number of servicemen and women who are leaving the forces so their families will have better, and safer, accommodation.  Please increase the funding to fix this huge morale lowering problem.  When people return from 4 or 6 months in Iraq or Afghanistan, they deserve decent standards of living to recuperate.  Thank you.",
