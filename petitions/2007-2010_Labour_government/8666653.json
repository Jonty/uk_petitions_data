            "background": "Ofgem, utilities regulator, consisting of non-executive and executive members and a non-executive chair takes decisions, including price controls and enforcement. They are selected for their experience and expertise. Technocrats seem to run those quangos. Since Expert knows best takes over, customer and citizen disenfranchisement and dissatisfactions are the results!\nWhy should customer not to vote like a shareholder .Why is it left to quango to be judge and jury, why shouldn\u2019t they be accountable to their customers! I propose, that all regulator agencies of public services and utilities such as ogfem, ofcom, ipcc are subject to a satisfaction vote during their term and that if they failed the vote of public satisfaction,be removed of office. Executives and Chairman would be elected by the customers of the utility company(ies) supervised by the regulator agency.!",
