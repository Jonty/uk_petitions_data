            "background": "Allow Children to be Children longer, it seems that Children are going to School,earlier and earlier and expected to stay on longer and longer.\nSurely this is not good for childrens emotional well being, they are unable to enjoy being a child.\n\nIt's all well and good Ministers saying that Children need to stay in School longer, like they do in other Countries but how many of these Countries do the Children start school aged 3?\n\nYou used to be able to choose which playgroup your child went to before starting school between 4-5 years old, now you have to choose a Nursery in a School, to get a School place and these Children have to have uniforms and be tested and start age 3.\n\nIf you raise School leaving age, surely you need to raise the School entry age\nAnd allow the children to actually enjoy life before School, as it doesn't always work for alot of Children.",
