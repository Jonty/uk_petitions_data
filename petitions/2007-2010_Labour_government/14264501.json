        "background": "There is allegedly a planned march by Islam4UK at Wootten Basset. This is the town where dead British soldiers returning from Afghanistan are mourned in a huge street gathering as the cortege passes through the silence in honour of the fallen. This makes for a sacred place to British people. A Muslim march should be banned here. It is not right.\n\nThis is not a group to incite racism, facism or any other ideas similar whatsoever.\n\nThis is intended to be a group of peacefull people who wish to add large numbers in aid of a common belief. It is hoped that these large numbers will be used as a vote and the total sent to the relevant authority.",
