        "background": "I have \u00a360k sitting in a pension I no longer pay into as I am unemployed due to the credit crunch. \n\nOver the past year it has lost more than \u00a330k, so is an awful investment. \n\nI want to move that money into a SIPS pension, and then purchase a studio flat which I intend to rent out. \n\nThe flat would earn \u00a3400 a month, which I would also reinvest in stocks and shares.\n\nHowever, as the rules for SIPS pensions were changed. I can not invest this money.\n\nCrazy. Just crazy! At a time when there is no credit around, and the lower end of the property market is in a slump. There must be thousands like me who would love to invest their pensions in property. \n\nNot only would this get the bottom end of the property market going. It would also be a great long term investment for me. \n\nMr Brown, please look at doing this and doing it soon.",
