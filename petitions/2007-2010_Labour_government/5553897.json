            "background": "In order to calm the housing market and return to some normality,the goverment should remove the exemption of primary residence from capital gains tax on re-sale.This can be done similar to the continental system where tax is paid related to how long the house has been the main residence, reducing the longer the house has been the primary home.\nThis will ensure private speculators who buy and sell one house at a time,with the real sole aim of making profits,but escape tax by the primary residence exclusion would no longer be able to do so.At the same time this would send a clear message from the government that houses should be regarded as \"HOMES\" first and not simply profit centers.",
