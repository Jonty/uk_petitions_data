        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "HGV's are a continuing nuisance on Penkford Lane, always ignoring the speed limit of 30mph, and endangering the lives of the villagers. The road is used as a short cut from the M6 and M62 motorways to the industrial site in St Helens. St Helens council refuse to support a ban, by adopting a NIMBY attitude, and Warrington council (responsible for Collins Green) have continually stalled on implementing this ban. The ban is now in place, but both councils continually ignore the continuing use of the road by these HGV's, so in reality there has been no change to the earlier status quo. Now is the time to say 'enough is enough'!",
