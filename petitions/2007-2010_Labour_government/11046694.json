        "background": "Despite repeated legal decisions the banks continue to avoid the repayment of bank charges deemed excessive by various courts and trading standards. The general public through taxation has propped up the poor decision making and reckless pursuit of 'profit' via sharp practices, one of which was the decision to take advantage of customers who might have previously counted on a bank's support in \nthe short term. Only making a difficult situation worse??, Its time they repaid the albeit enforced trust of the british Public in a high profile and practical manner coupled with the annoucement of a realistic and relevant charges policy to support their customers and dare I say the country at large.",
