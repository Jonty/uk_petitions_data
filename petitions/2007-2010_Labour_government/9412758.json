SPDC (military government) of Burma could have minimised the damage by warning and taking precautions.  They can prevent suffering now by taking effective action - but we doubt that they would, given the disregard for citizens' welfare that they have demonstrated recently.\n\nUS Campaign for Burma states : \"Money and humanitarian assistance should only be provided to trusted, international humanitarian organizations who can reach the victims of the cyclone directly.\"\n\nWe, the undersigned, call on the UK government to send the aid IMMEDIATELY and through trusted channels.",
