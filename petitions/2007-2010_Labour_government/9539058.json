Cannabis is being reclassed to class 'B' again, even tho it is not as harmful as tobacco. we feel that in the best interests of the public, tobacco should be reclassed as a controlled class 'c' substance. those who smoke now, could still obtain by prescription but will be drawn off it, those who don't smoke should be prevented from obtaining it so easily.",
