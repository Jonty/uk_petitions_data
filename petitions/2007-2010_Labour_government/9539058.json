            "background": "With all the health costs and demand on the NHS due to smoking tobacco, and the recent ban in public buildings. Cannabis is being reclassed to class 'B' again, even tho it is not as harmful as tobacco. we feel that in the best interests of the public, tobacco should be reclassed as a controlled class 'c' substance. those who smoke now, could still obtain by prescription but will be drawn off it, those who don't smoke should be prevented from obtaining it so easily.",
