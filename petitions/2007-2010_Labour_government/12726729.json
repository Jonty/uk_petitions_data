        "background": "See 'Monkey World' in Dorset, website - amazing 17 yr care Alison and late husband Jim Cronin rescuing apes from all over world; from cruel British Pet Trade; un-thinking new owners who buy.   \nWatch programmes 'Monkey Business' on 'Animal Planet' several times a day, to see the wonderful work done by Alison and Jim. They are recognised by many governments who seek help to stop ILLEGAL pet smuggling. Thailand signed up to CITES 1983 - but not enforced by their Government.  Please write to the Thailand Embassy in protest.  DON'T go to animal 'shows' when on holiday.\n'Monkey Business' programmes show the utter cruelty metered out to these amazing animals.\nChannel 4 are putting out programme \"My Monkey Pet\" 10pm 2/6/09, on Americans who own such pet monkeys.\nThese people treat them as substitute children, dress them in baby clothes, \nwheel them in prams. By the time\nthe moonkeys/apes are 3 years, they will be too strong for their owners, bite and wreck everything.   A 3 year old chimp has the strength of a full grown man.\nPLEASE HELP STOP CHANNEL 4 FROM SHOWING THIS PROGRAMME, as it will only encourage unthinking people to buy baby apes and monkeys.",
