            "background": "As the President of the Association of Independent Celebrants, I know how important it is for couples to have a choice when it comes to their wedding.  Currently in England, only Registrars and Ministers of Religion can conduct marriages when Humanist/Independent Celebrants cannot.  This means couples do not have much choice when it comes to getting married.  In Scotland 2005, 12 humanist celebrants were authorised to conduct weddings but in England this is still not possible.  There are many differences between a Civil Ceremony conducted by a Registrar and a Humanist or Independent Celebrant, the latter usually offers more choices for their Ceremony.  It is also unfair that same-sex couples cannot include Religion into their Ceremony - an Independent Celebrant can offer that, ie prayer or hymn. I therefore ask the Prime Minister to consider making a change to this outdated Law - after all, to not allow this is surely discrimination on the grounds of belief and contravenes Human Rights for the couples involved.",
