One scheme used across many states, including Pennsylvania classifies the degrees of murder as follows :\n\n First Degree Murder: All premeditated murders, and (in some states) murders involving certain especially dangerous crimes, such as arson or rape, or committed by an inmate serving a life sentence. \nSecond Degree Murder: Non premeditated killing. \nThird Degree Murder: Any other murder",
