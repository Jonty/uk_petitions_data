A royal navy serviceman was battered to death in Concert Square, in the heart of the city centre, and a man was stabbed to death on Berry Street, at one of the city's landmarks but yet there was no CCTV footage available for these events. The people who make these proposals need to be named so we can kick them out at the next elections.",
