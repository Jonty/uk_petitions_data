            "background": "With regards to his queries as to why BBC should show Formula 1, stating the licence fee should be spent on \"real sports rather than the wealthy industry of Formula One\"\n\nMotorsport in particular Formula 1 apart from being one of the greatest sporting spectacles brings in a large amount of revenue into this country, it also showcases our engineering prowess, we should therefore should support this great industry before it disappear abroad along with so many others. Through his discouraging comments of Formula 1 I personally believe Mr Mackinlay to be doing this country a dis-service and therefore should be ejected from his post. Furthermore an investigation into the BBC using license to fund Formula 1 coverage should be scrapped as coverage is for the good of the nation, and such investigation would be yet more waste of my tax money as Mr Mackinlay.",
