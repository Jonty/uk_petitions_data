        "background": "One of the things American men have that our Briish men don't, is routine access to the PSA test, a blood test administered by GPs that can diagnose prostate cancer. Although the test has some important drawbacks, evidence from around the world shows that the wider use of the PSA test is associated with higher prostate cancer survival rates. In the UK, men who are concerned about their prostate have no automatic right to the PSA test. The five year survival rate of prostate cancer in the USA is 98.5%, compared with just 70% here.",
