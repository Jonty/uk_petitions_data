            "background": "This petition is intended to protest the treatment of Dutch MP Geert Wilders. He faced discrimination and censorship when he intended to share his opinions and ideas as an invited guest of this country. He was denied entry because government authorities feared the Islamic community's backlash might lead to unrest and violence. When Salman Rushdie wrote The Satantic Verses did we ban the book? It is not the material that is in error but rather the illiberal response to the material that is at fault. Christianity stands up to scrutiny everyday. Why not Islam? If we do not allow this free speech we have appeased those that would have us silenced through any means. Adding your signature to this petition shows that you do not wish to allow fear to govern our decisions as a democracy.",
