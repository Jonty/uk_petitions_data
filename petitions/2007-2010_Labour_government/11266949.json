            "background": "It has been shown that Western pressure has had no effect in easing the crisis in Zimbabwe. If the West has no willing to save lives then hope must be directed to the African continent. A number of smaller, less influential countries are already showing opposition to Mugabe but the only country with the economic, political and military might to make a difference, South Africa, is tolerant of a corrupt and murderous regime. If Western pressure is innefective on Mugabe then an indirect approach of pressuring South Africa might have results in favour of humanity.",
