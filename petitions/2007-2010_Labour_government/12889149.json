        "action": "legislate that Christians in this nation will not be forced by equality and diversity legislation to act in their workplaces contrary to clearly mandated orthodox biblical principles for an individual's conduct and in accordance with an individual's conscience",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The United Kingdom claims to protect freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, but this is increasingly being put to the test by various legislation introduced and proposed, including Equality and Diversity legislation, and a proposed Coroners and Justice Bill. Recent cases such as Reigstrar Lillian Ladele, to conduct Civil Partnership Ceremonies (CPCs) and Deputy Registrar Ms Davies in Islington, dropped from her post as Deputy Registrar to receptionist for refusing to work in a way which violated her conscience as a Christian, are in danger of becoming the norm. When orthodox religious opinion on sexual orientation at work and various other ethics, are no longer tolerated by the State in the public and private life of its citizens, and a government fails to see the point of  a free speech clause in Bills currently before Parliament that would protect those who hold such views, all citizens everywhere should be alarmed. Everyone who cares about true freedom and open democracy, one with a diversity of opinions in society should be extremely concerned by the way our society is being led without public concensus.",
