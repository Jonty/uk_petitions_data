            "background": "Nicky Weaver has recently been let go by Manchester City Football Club after 10 years of loyal service. Nicky 'Weavs' Weaver is a goalkeeper who is fully deserving of the status 'legendary' and could well be the last time a player who cared for the club, wears the famous sky blue shirt. The imminent takeover of the club signals a new era of investment which may bring success to a trophy-starved Manchester, but which may well rip the heart out of a club steeped in the local community and tradition. The release of Nicky is a sad indictment of the way football is going and I believe the Prime Minister should take steps to enforce the re-signing of Nicky Weaver by Manchester City Football Club. Charlton Athletic, you are not worthy of such greatness!",
