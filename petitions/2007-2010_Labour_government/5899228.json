            "background": "Many married/cohabiting couples have one partner that works whilst the other looks after their children. The Partner does draw any social benefits except child benefit for the children. Yet if the working partner earns over \u00a325,000 per annum the non working partner cannot claim free healthcare/benefits even though they dont have any income.\nThey have to pay for pescriptions, Dental work and general health care\nThese non working partners may have worked before looking after the child so income into the household will be affected as well as the increased cost of bringing up a baby.",
