            "background": "I find it offensive that Police CCTV vans have a sign saying \"Smile! You're on CCTV\" on the side of them.  The implication is that the public are predisposed to committing crime and are only stopped from doing so because of the fear that they might be caught.\n\nThe vast majority of the population are not only law abiding, but go far beyond what is expected of them in order to make this country a pleasant place to live.  The Police exist to serve us, not to treat us all as potential criminals.\n\nI believe that these signs should be removed from all Police CCTV vans.",
