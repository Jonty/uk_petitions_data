        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In Germany, electricity generated by householders and industry, using new renewable technologies such as solar power, attract a favorable price set by the Government and fixed for a number of years. There is an obligation for the energy companies to buy that electricity at the set tarrif.\n  Once the new technology has been established and become economically viable, as for example with wind power, the tariff is reduced to the regular market rate.\n  In the U.K., solar and geothermal power on a small and large scale, and the budding but underfunded wave and tidal power industries, would benefit greatly from such a tariff. The U.K. could be self sufficient in renewable energy, and a world leader in wave generation technology, but only if Government help is forthcoming.",
