I deeply object to being treated like a second class citizen, or indeed a leper, simply because I choose to smoke. Criminals in prison have their human rights and can still enjoy a cigarette, so why can't we? Provide us with smoking areas. It's not difficult! You have enforced people to smoke out on the streets where more people are going to come into contact with cigarette smoke, and our streets are becoming ashtrays. Where is my human right to smoke in comfort?",
