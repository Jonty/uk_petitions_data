            "background": "We are all faced with being charged for the amount of rubbish we throw away, but many of us try to recycle as much as possible. However, many companies sell their products in an excessive amount of non-recyclable packaging. The Government should bring in a law to ensure that companies share the responsibility for waste; in this way, if a waste charging scheme is brought in, people who are not making any effort will have to pay more than those who are, rather than everyone being punished",
