            "background": "Ever since I got back into BMX racing 2 1/2 years ago I have always wanted to get the track in South Woodham Ferrers reopened.  After talking to a couple of people I knew who rode or raced there we decided to give it a go.  It seems we were just in time.  After an initial talk with the council today it seems that the land the track is on is earmarked for a total re-development at the start of the new year.  They plan to build a big sports complex with football, rugby and hockey pitches and part of that plan is to flatten what is left of the BMX track.  \nBMX racing is a fantastic sport that everyone can enjoy. There are age groups from under 5's to 40 plus so any one can take part and compete at all levels.  It is a great way to get kids off the street and involved in something constructive and be part of a community.",
