            "background": "Practically the only help currently available to the mentally ill on a nationwide basis is through the Jobcentre (which provides very limited services) or the DWP (which only offers help and guidance to those already in work and suffering mental distress). Benefits are also quite restricted, making it even more important that help is at hand.\n\nThose with mental health difficulties find it much harder to get into work, as the disruption of their lives through mental illness often means that, though they may be perfectly capable of doing a job, they aren't able to prove this to the employer in the form of a qualification, or by showing previous experience.\n\nA quarter of us will experience some form of mental distress during our lifetime, and I believe that a nationwide work training scheme, provided solely for those with mental health difficulties and offering training, guidance and long-term support, would be highly successful in helping thousands of people back into work.",
