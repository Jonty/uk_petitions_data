Some of our Public Houses are the only meeting,social gathering places in a village, some have history going back hundreds of years. Our pubs have seen many changes throughout the centuries like world wars, the great depression and in one or two cases even the crusades. this is the first time that they are staring to collapse through the inaction of members of Parliament. we need to preserve the English Pub for future generations to enjoy. we are the custodians of our national heritage and we must do what ever it takes to save them.",
