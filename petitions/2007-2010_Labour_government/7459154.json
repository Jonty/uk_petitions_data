            "background": "On the 27th September, The schools adjudicator changed the admission policy for Howard of Effingham school meaning the distance from the school was no longer a factor in admissions. After looked after children, special needs and siblings the remaining places will be awarded on those living furthest away from their \"Next Nearest School\" as the crow flies. In reality this means local children including those from the village from Effingham are un likely to go to the Howard in the future. This will rip communities\u2019 apart, stop children from walking the school in the area, cause displacement of children to schools up to 60 minutes away and an increase in both traffic and damage to the climate in a rise of CO2 emissions. \n\nThis must be stopped!",
