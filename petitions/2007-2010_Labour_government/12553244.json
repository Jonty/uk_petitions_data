The proposed plans are to relocate them to Brize Norton - a base that is already fully accommodated with ONE runway. If this happens in 2012, Lyneham's community will suffer hard. Not only that, but by basing so many aircraft on one airbase means one airstrike could wipe out a lot of our air capability!",
