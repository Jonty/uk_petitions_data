            "background": "Having just received my go smoke free pack from the local council I am amused to see the requirement for an A5 No Smoking sign to be displayed at the entrance to all enclosed public places.\n\nAs at small business retailer I am part of a very long row of small shops. \nAs each of these retail units are now BY LAW required to display this A5 sign at the entrance to the property or risk a \u00a3250.00 fixed penalty all the public will be faced with is a barrage of signs every 5 to 6 meters along both sides of the street.\n\nI have no problem with the law itself but I think the requirement to display the signs in shop doorways along a high street needs to be reconsidered, and some common sense applied.",
