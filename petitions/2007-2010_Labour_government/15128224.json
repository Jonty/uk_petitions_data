            "background": "Camden Council has told schools to cut their budgets\u2019 by 10% over the next 3 years.\n\nThe Council say they expect Camden to lose out from a new \u2018fair funding\u2019 formula. But they haven\u2019t checked this with the government and Cllr Andrew Mennear, the man in charge of Camden\u2019s schools, admits this is a \u2018worst-case scenario\u2019. They are the only London council telling schools to make cuts.\n\nThe state of the economy means that there is going to be pressure on public services for the foreseeable future, but there are good economic reasons to protect education. \n\nWe are opposed to schools making cuts based on speculation. \n\nWe don\u2019t believe Camden\u2019s schools are over-funded. These cuts will raise class sizes and will damage children\u2019s education.\n\nIn the 1990s school budgets were squeezed very tightly. Camden\u2019s parents, teachers and governors convinced the Council to protect the education budget.\n\nThis time round the Council have ruled out putting extra money in, even though they have \u00a3100m in their reserve.",
