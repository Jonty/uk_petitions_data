            "background": "Are you sick of being afraid and intimidated by young people who have no discipline or respect for anyone. There have been far too many instances of people being hurt or even murdered by out of control children who have never been forced to accept responsibility for their actions. \nBy sending these children and young adults to a boot camp they can learn discipline, self-reliance, and respect.\nFurthermore, this may provide the short-sharp shock these yobs so desperately need to stop their sprialling descent into a life of crime, which is not currently available due to the \"Human rights\" and \"Dont scare the little darlings\" emotion in Britain, and prison overcrowding. Likewise, use of those sent to boot camp to help in the community by cleaning grafiti, building social centres etc... will help to repair the damage these same people are doing",
