            "background": "The method with which a knife opens has no effect on what the person holding it wishes to do with it. Criminalizing those wishing to use knives easily opened with one hand only strips useful tools from the disabled and those with conditions such as arthritis. Neither of these knives were ever made with combat in mind. Automatic knives were made for fishermen to cut nets in extreme sea-going conditions, and gravity knives were designed to cut parachute chord. Both of these knives are designed with safety in mind, and at present, a few 'feel good' laws criminalize those wishing to have the safety and function these knives offer.\n\nWe ask that The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act (1959) be repealed.",
