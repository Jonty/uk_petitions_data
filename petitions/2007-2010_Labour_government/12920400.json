        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "UK tax payers should not have to fund cases brought by 'Bullet Chasing' Lawyers, and the reputation of our armed forces should be vigorously protected.\n\nSince the first case when an Iraqi citizen won damages against the UK Government following British Military operations, there has been a steady increase in the number of cases put forward by lawyers claiming damages against the British government. \n\nThis is the unfortunate knock on effect of people thinking they can now make easy, fast and large amounts of money through allegations about our armed forces. These people make it very hard to recognise any legitimate claims that are made.\n\nThe law should be changed to make it very difficult for people to make claims , many years after the event, as currently it is effectively 'open season' against our armed forces.\n\nWhilst we recognise the rule of law during military operations, we need to protect our armed forces reputation against people who seek personal gain, through playing the UK's legal system.",
