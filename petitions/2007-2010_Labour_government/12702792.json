            "background": "These are some of my ideas for reforming the Political system.\n\u25cf Split the current job of MP up into a constituency Governor and an MP, MPs to be elected proportionally and Governors to be elected on Constituency basis to govern the constituency.\n\u25cfAllow anyone to run as an Independent MP or Governor. \n\u25cfCreate a political lending system, in which people are lent money to fund campaigns by political brokers\n\u25cf Organisations would be unable to run for government however it can still exist to co-ordinate supporters, who have to run by themselves and not be elected as a collective group. \n\u25cf Make Cabinet elected\n \u25cf Have a lottery (between all judges)for a small number of Judges to monitor corruption and political brokers who serving short times in office (for example 6 months before being rotated) \n\u25cf Have a lottery for Magistrates (between all magistrates) to monitor individual regions and ensure that a manifesto is produced pre election  and is analysed after their term.",
