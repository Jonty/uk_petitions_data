        "background": "The new motorcycle test introduced on April 27th 2009 is potentially dangerous to novice riders, particularly the new \"avoidance\" exercise, which saw several accidents and injuries on the first day of testing.  We submit that the new testing regime takes little account of real world riding conditions and in adverse weather conditions contradicts the riding advice given in the Highway Code.",
