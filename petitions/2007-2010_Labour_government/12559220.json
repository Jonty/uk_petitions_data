Yet they are not allowed to vote for who represents them in adulthood. In 2004, David Milliband stated \"it is illogical to prevent 16-year-olds voting when they were allowed to get married and work at that age\". 5 years on and there is still no justice for the youth of this country, Mr Brown must push this issue through immediatly as this law discriminates against Britain's youth by saying that they are too immature to decide on issues that matter to them!",
