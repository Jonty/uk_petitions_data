As the Community Charge is based on the valuation of a property and a Banding 'awarded,' it is fair to ask that now that house valuations have fallen by a third, a review of the bandings should be ordered.  One notices that when values have risen in the past, so have the bandings.  In the meantime and in the current climate a 'freeze' would be fair prior to a review of bandings for the next financial year.",
