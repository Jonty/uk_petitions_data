            "background": "The PM has stated that the current status of cannabis will be reviewed, with a view to potentially reclassifying it as a Class B drug (it is currently Class C).  This would have no discernible effect on the widespread use of the drug and would serve only to impose heavier sentences on people using the drug, despite the fact it enjoys a high level of public acceptance. Studies have repeatedly failed to prove that any negative ramifications of using the drug outweigh the positive experiences of the nations thousands (if not millions) of cannabis users.  When measured against the negative health, personal and social impact that alcohol has, it makes no sense to further criminalise cannabis.  There is no real justification for further restricting our access to the drug or for increasing the penalties against users.",
