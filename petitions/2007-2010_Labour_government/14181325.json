            "background": "This petition is to stop Landlord abusing their power with PubWatch. \nCurrently there is no legislation to protect consumers and help them to appeal unjust PubWatch bans, simply due to a Landlords dislike of a patron, and whilst we accept that management have the rights to deny service to whomever they choose, they should not then be able to spread slanderous and often unjust comments or opinions to other venues.\nWe would also like the public to be able to attend these meetings where they are 'tried' as currently Landlords can say whatever they like, which will not be challenged in the consumers defence. \n\nWhilst PubWatch is predominantly a fair and useful system, it needs the right people at the helm to stop people in power taking advantage of their community.\nThis is to stamp out 'bully boy' landlords who exert their power by using their occupation, often in unfair circumstances.",
