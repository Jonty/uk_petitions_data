        "background": "Recent policy changes in the name of political correctness are proving unpopular with some forces personnel. This is because, like anybody else, they resist change.\nThere is a petition trying to allow the choice to display, it quotes \"No female personnel have complained about the images\". This is an unfounded statement. I have heard plenty of complaints from female personnel.\n\nThe banning of offensive material is welcome, in particular with this changing society and Armed Forces. There are plenty of women who are offended and dare not say in case it ruin their career or ruin the working relationships.\n\nPublications such as FHM may be popular, however they cause alot of uncomfortable feelings with the females in the work place because the images are openly on display, this causes the team work to become less effective.\n\nTeam work is very important in the Armed Forces, the showing of offensive and objectifying images undermine teamwork and the trust needed in a military environment.",
