            "background": "If someone is involved in an accident that is proven to be completely not their fault, and all their damage costs are covered by the person who did cause the accident, it is completely unacceptable that car insurance companies sometimes raise premiums for these innocent victims of accidents. They are being punished for simpply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nBeing the victim of an accident that was not at all your fault does not make you a more dangerous driver, so your premium should not increase as a direct result of that - if anything, it makes you a safer driver because you are more cautious due to your experience.\n\nFor the above reasons, the undersigned support a rule that would forbid car insurance companies from raising a customer's premium for the sole reason that they were the victim of an accident caused by a third party.",
