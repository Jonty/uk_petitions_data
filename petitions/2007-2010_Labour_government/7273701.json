            "background": "Currently credit reference agencies are able to profit by holding misinformation on people and charging them for access to their report and correcting this information.  They have very limited customer service access and make it very difficult to get in touch except by signing up to expensive \"credit monitoring\" subscriptions.  This creates a moral hazard when it is not in the interest of a credit agency to hold correct information - if they hold false information they will profit from you paying for access to the file.\n\nCredit agencies should be held financially responsible and legally accountable for any incorrect information and should be encouraged to actively ensure their information is correct.",
