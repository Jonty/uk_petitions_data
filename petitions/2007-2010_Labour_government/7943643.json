            "background": "MP's would like a pay rise to match the salaries of those in the private sector. When MP's decided to become MP's they did so knowing what the pay amounted to, do not forget they are elected by the people, they are a public service and in too many situations they forget this. They would like a pay rise of 10% far higher than the rate of Inflation.\n\nThis does not help the image of MP's, and the house of commons as an institution.",
