            "background": "Many public places now have a baby changing table.   The problem is that these are usually located in the ladies toilets.  All public places should be required to have a place with a changing table which is clean and accessible to both mothers and fathers alike so that fathers out on their own and daddies who simply want to do their fair share of changing can so do.  It would be a simple change at minimal expense but make a real difference to parents.",
