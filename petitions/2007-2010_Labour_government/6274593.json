            "background": "So many people are away from work on holiday at this time of year that a half a day taken from Friday would not make a difference.\nTraffic is notorious on the Friday before any Bank Holiday so this would ease evening congestion when holidaymakers mix with commuter traffic by being able to stagger journeys.\nThe loss of economic output would be minimal but the benefits, including the general wellbeing and feel-good factor are undeniable.\nI therefore petition the Prime Minister to bring about a proper debate on the subject.",
