        "background": "The STFC has recently announced that it will be withdrawing from the Gemini telescope suite, in response to cutbacks in funding.\n\nIt is apparent that the astronomy community has not been consulted in any meaningful way.  The STFC's unilateral decision threatens to prevent UK access to large ground-based observatories, especially in the northern hemisphere, and will severely weaken Britain's centuries-old tradition of leadership in astronomical research.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister to direct the STFC to undertake a proper consultative exercise on the future of the UK's involvement in this vital resource.",
