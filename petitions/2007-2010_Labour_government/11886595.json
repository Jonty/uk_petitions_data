        "background": "As a direct result of the world financial crisis the British Government has taken a super-majority share holding in the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Since the Government has not adequately explained the immediate benefits of this nationalization-in-all-but-name in any concrete terms, it is the position of the following petitioners that any tax-paying member of the public should be allowed to use the toilet at all Royal Bank of Scotland and National Westminster Bank retail and office locations.  Since the tax-paying public has had an extraordinary burden placed on it due to the record-breaking losses at RBS, we feel that it is only appropriate that the Royal Bank of Scotland open their restrooms to the very people who have saved their bank from certain ruin.",
