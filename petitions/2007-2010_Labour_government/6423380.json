        "action": "Lobby OPEC to increase production which will decrease prices of crude oil and channel current fuel taxes into alternative energy research and production",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Oil production, distribution and price regulation is the remit of OPEC. It\u2019s objective is to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies among Member Countries, in order to secure fair and stable prices for petroleum producers; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on capital to those investing in the industry. A great idea but how effective is it at its main purpose and how fair is it to UK consumers?\n\nOPEC has recently agreed to raise production by 500,000 barrels a day today. Unfortunately, the global commodity markets reacted with a great big shrug \u2013 the price of crude for October delivery was up to $78.23 a barrel. It's highest price ever.\n\nSo a new daily output, which when measured in August was 30.37 million bpd \u2014slightly lower than output in 1979. I call upon the British Government to lobby OPEC to live up to it's initial remit and increase production to compensate for the global demand increases since 1979. I also call on the government to use the already imposed fuel duties to pump-prime research, development and sustainable deployment into alternative non-global-warming energy supplies before its too late.",
