            "background": "The rail network doesn't work and should be closed down.\n\nIn the last ten days I've travelled on, or tried to travel on twenty one trains. Eight of which have been late (and not just five minutes!!) and another two have been cancelled altogether. Yesterday my reservation for seat fifteen was stuck on seat sixteen, last week they didn't even bother putting the reservations on the seats. Half the time the trains haven't been cleaned and are full of yesterday's traveller's rubbish. The floods are a convenient excuse, but even before then I couldn't rely on them getting me to meetings on time. I don't think the train companies are even trying anymore.\n\nLast night it took me six hours to get home from a trip to London, it doesn't take that long to drive, even if I catch the worst traffic on the M25 and M1. From now on it is drive or fly and forget the CO2.",
