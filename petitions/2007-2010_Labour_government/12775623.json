            "background": "Firstly it has to be said these petitions are absolutely pointless. You cannot negotiate with the filthy rotten and dispicable bourgeoisie.\n\nSolidarity and equality will only come with the destruction of all monopolies and privileges. To be replaced with workers self management and internationalism, so the worker may truly profit from the product of labour. Live in peace with humanity and nature.\n\nThis cannot be achieved through parliament. It must be fought for in your work place and on your streets. It will not be handed to you.\n\nThe workers have all the power. They sell their labour for what? So the capitalist, bureaucrat and the priviliged can benefit. And so we can live in an ever increasing atomized life?\n\nIt is only the workers who can change this world for the better, with ideals of solidarity, understanding and brotherhood.\n\nIsn't it about time we ran our own society? Through organising in the workplace, in communitites power can be won, the only limit is your imagination.\n\nThe dominant ideology, the ideology of the ruling class is falling apart. Open your minds to class consciousness.",
