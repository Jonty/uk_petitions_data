        "background": "The roads in the United Kingdom are now as good as the third world countries.\n\nRecent bad weather has hurt the roads with chips and pot holes big enough to sink Britain.\n\nWe are concerned that it is not only costing the average individuals in more maintenance cost to their vehicles but also the council in claims and later the council tax payers for repairs.\n\nI think the government should start reserving funds to repair and maintain the roads in London just to save its face for the 2012 guests who will be arriving from all over the world but will also take back their experience to share with others.\n\nI hope that in the good times to come we dont be reminded to pay a premium to enjoy living here.\n\nIts time the governmenr starts concentrating on the road network which is a logistic for every individual living on this island.",
