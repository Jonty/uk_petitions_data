They do not have a choice in whether they go or not, and are good at what they do, protecting our country. They should be given a lot more benefits and a large increase in pay, it has been revealed that the highest paid job in britain is CEO's and people who generally sit around risking nothing, I think this is disguisting and should be changed immediately. People who risk their life should be paid most!",
