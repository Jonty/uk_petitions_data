While the inspector's recommendation to create a South Downs National Park is welcomed, there is huge concern at his recommendation to exclude the western Weald (including Petersfield, Liss, Midhurst and Petworth).  This area is of exceptional quality and while different to the chalk downland has strong associations with it.",
