            "background": "The dangers of smoking have been well documented and publicised over the past 2 decades. Every year \u00a3millions are being disproportionately spent by the NHS on provision of care for individuals who consciously refuse to cease smoking. Progressive (year on year) restrictions on access to free treatment for conditions unambiguously related to the deliberate act of smoking would both promote a healthier lifestyle and allow for the reallocation of this proportion of funding into areas of need such as breast cancer treatment and care of elderly.",
