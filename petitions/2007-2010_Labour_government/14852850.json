            "background": "I instigated court proceedings against a major high street bank for a claim not exceeding \u00a35,000 in the belief that it would be allocated to the small claims track. It was not.\n\nLitigants are informed by HMCS Document EX307 that they should be able to proceed without the benefit of legal assistance.\n\nLitigants are not told defendants could utilise the best available legal advice and assistance.  \n\nLegal Aid funding is not available for claims of \u00a35,000 or less.    \n\nProceedings where one party is legally represented and the other is not cannot be fair.\n\nThe small claims track procedure therefore effectively excludes those on State Benefits, I am on Pension Credit, from instigating justifiable claims.\n\nIt is therefore my belief that the small claims track procedure needs changing to make it more equitable to one's rights to a fair hearing granted under Article 6.1 of the Human Rights Act.",
