            "background": "I live in greenock were polish workers are being employed for less money and denying local workers a fair chance at getting jobs.These workers are being taken on only on the basis that they provide cheaper labour.This government is implying that this will help our economy. This is rubbish in a lot of cases.These people are indicating that they are here to save.Some work in Compact they are stating that if they work here for 5 to 10 years they can save and go home and it will set them up for life.This will do nothing for our economy as more companies take on these people for cheaper wages it will drive wages down further and people who are already struggling will find it even harder to survive.Make companies pay them the same rate of pay. Giving all a fair chance.",
