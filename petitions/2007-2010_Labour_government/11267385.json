        "background": "I recently contacted my local Esporta Health Club to say that I would not be renewing my membership after my 12 months was up - I was told that I had to provide 3 calendar months which would take my membership up to 15 months. I feel this is an unfair clause written into the contract to forcebly extract an extra 3 months payments. This clause is written in such a way that consumers feel they have no way to contest and if you do these leisure companies use solicitors and debt collectors to bully consumers into paying the extra 3 months payments or else they threaten court action or CCJ's - this needs to be stopped as this is unfair to consumers. It has now become apparent that this is common practice in the leisure industry and OFT has raised similar concerns  <http://www.oft.gov.uk/advice_and_resources/resource_base/consumer-regulations/traders/790/1/>   At the moment nothing seems to be done about this clause and I think consumers need to know that that this will be looked into and this clause updated to 1 month or less.",
