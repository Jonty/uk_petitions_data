            "background": "As an employee in a large supermarket chain I was struck last Sunday by just how little justice two minutes silence does to the thousands of dead servicemen and women. Some people paused, most were silent, some just carried on shopping. \n\nI feel this represents the degree to which Britain has become a nation of shoppers and not citizens. We need to show real respect and spend a whole day, undistracted, honouring those who have made the deepest sacrifice for us.\n\nAll large shops should be forced to close so people can think deeply and sincerely about the freedoms we would not have if it weren't for the thousands who have served us.",
