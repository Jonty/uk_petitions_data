I have just applied for this allowence and have received confirmation saying the law allows ME yes ME to be able to LIVE on \u00a360.50 a week how in gods name can anyone survive on that with having to pay the bills,food ect( especially in this current financial climate..CREDIT CRUNCH) it doesnt cover any of that plus the fact its paid in arrears fortnightly it doesnt help doing that either. I have worked and paid my tax's and this is all i receive, i think they should raise it to \u00a3100 wk, i understand that people may want to stay on the dole if it is this high but most people want to get back into work and not sit around watching daytime t.v or spend there dole in wetherspoons everyday....I DONT but if this situation should crop up again and i have to apply for this benefit id be happy in the fact that i could at least afford to eat and pay my bills.I know there are thousands of people in my situation at this time. So come on people help me raise the dole.",
