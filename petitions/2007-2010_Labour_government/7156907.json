            "action": "Introduce new laws to prohibit individuals and businesses from buying up domain names in bulk purely for the purpose of selling them on to legitimate users for fee's sometimes in excess of 10,000 times their original price.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is now increasingly hard to find unused business names and website domains, this is compounded by the problem caused by individuals and businesses buying large quantities of popular domain names for less than \u00a320 and then re-selling them for up to \u00a3100,000 at a later date.\n\nWe would like to see a law that recognized the practice of \"domain parking\" as a crime of extortion, and see this added to the relevant act to preserve fair legal use of the Internet.\n\nThis could be regulated by providing a quick and cheap arbitration process to reclaim domain names that are not being used - and have been bought purely for the purpose of extorting money at a later date.\n\nAlternatively a fee cap could be applied such that charging above a certain fee for a domain (say 10 times it's cost from the original provider) is extortion, so these people and businesses cannot charge excessive fee's as they would be committing a crime.\n\nWe request that the government take responsibility for all domains awarded by the UK, and raise the issue within the European union for all domains awarded by our European colleagues.",
