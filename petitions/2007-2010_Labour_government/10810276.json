            "background": "'God Save the Queen' is loathed by most people in the UK.  It is unclear whose anthem it is - is it the British anthem or the English anthem?  It doesn't mention the country, only the Queen.  It excludes republicans and those who don't believe in God.  The tune isn't even unique, as it is shared with other countries. It is an embarrassing dirge which needs to be replaced.  \n\nThe 2012 London Olympics would be an ideal opportunity for Britain to launch a new anthem, one fit for Britain in the 21st century.  We are calling on the government to launch a search for a new anthem, either an existing tune with new words, an existing song or something wholly original, written and composed by a great British composer.",
