            "background": "supermarkets currently sell produce at increased rates per kilo for a smaller quantity of the same product. for example, lose vegetables can often be sold at more than 50pence more per kilo than the same vegetable sold in larger pre-packed bags. cheese is another example costing, often a great deal, more per kilo when purchased in smaller quantities. i would like the prime minister to pass a law stating that all produce sold in supermarkets remain the same cost per kilo regardless of the quantity bought.",
