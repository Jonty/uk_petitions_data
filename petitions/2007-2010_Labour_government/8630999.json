            "background": "The Mayor of London recently announced a \u00a325 charge for 'higher polluting vehicles' and a \u00a30 charge for 'lower polluting vehicles\u2019 to enter the congestion charging zone.\n \nThe congestion charging zone is a zone that exists to reduce congestion in central London, not to penalise higher polluting vehicles for the amount they pollute.\n\nAll types of vehicles (be they lower or higher polluting) contribute the same amount to congestion to London. \n\nBecause of these two statements, we the undersigned request that the congestion charge should apply to all vehicles equally, no matter how much they pollute. \n\nPollution tax should be taken care of by vehicle excise duty banding. \n\nLastly, residents living within the zone who use higher polluting vehicles should still be eligible for the same discount as other people living within the zone who used less polluting vehicles.",
