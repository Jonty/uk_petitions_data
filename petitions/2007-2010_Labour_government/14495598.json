            "background": "It is currently standard to have CRB checks disclose details not just on convictions but also accusations made against a person, even when the police and social services have found it fit to drop the case. When this happens the person gains no criminal record and no charge, however if this accusation has been malicious an innocent persons career is effectively ruined, especially if they are in a care role e.g. nurses, teachers. Better investigation procedures need to be in place, then when a person is found innocent the CRB check should show no record of the investigation.",
