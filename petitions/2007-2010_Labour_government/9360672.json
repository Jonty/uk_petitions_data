            "background": "Nearly every other week now, we see stories in the newspapers and on television of teenage yobs commiting disgracful acts of violence, vandalism, anti-social behavior and murder. Teenagers have always been rebellious and caused trouble, most would say it's part of growing up. \n\nBut when an 11 year old boy in Liverpool is shot by a youth for walking down the street. When a young 16 year old girl, is beaten to death, just for the way she dresses and just for protecting the boyfriend she loves, and when a man is beaten to death just for the fun of it, enough is enough!\n\nIf they are big enough to kill people, they should be big enough to take the full weight of justice and the consequences of their actions. Presently, they get ridiculous jail sentences, of which they will probably only serve half....then they are out to breath free air that they dont deserve. The government has been far too soft on these \"kids\" for far too long. \n\nWE have the power to change this world, let us use it now to make this country a safer place for everyone, young, and old alike.",
