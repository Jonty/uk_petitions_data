            "background": "The British Government during the troubles under invested in Northern Ireland as a region of the UK while over financing the rest of the UK. Now they want to under pay Northern Ireland\u2019s workers so that those who work in the south of England are paid more at the expense of Northern Ireland\u2019s workers being exploited to accommodate this discrimination. The minimum wage at present is below a living wage in Northern Ireland, the price of a loaf of bread is cheaper in England than what it is in Northern Ireland and this argument applies to all commodities. Northern Ireland\u2019s workers deserve a regional supplement similar to the London allowance as the cost of living in Northern Ireland is more expensive than living in the London region.",
