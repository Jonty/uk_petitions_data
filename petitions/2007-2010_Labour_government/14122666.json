Please support this petition to ask the Prime Minister to provide funding and a scheme for local garden centres to give away native trees all across the UK, our childrens future is at stake and this is one small but simple step we can take to a better tomorrow. The UK government should be a role model for the rest of the world and funding should be provided to land owners who are prepared to set aside fields to be turned into forests - if this could happen all across the world then there could be a real difference made in a generation to the atmosphere of our planet - please start the process of letting nature fix our environment now and plant not just one tree but how about billions! Please Prime Minister let the UK be the world leaders and save the planet for our children.",
