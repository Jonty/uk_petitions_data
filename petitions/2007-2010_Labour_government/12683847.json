            "background": "Ok i admit i'm 13 years old and my status toward the goverment is atleast the lowest if not nothing atall and at worst at speaking for children but to know the problem itself you must have been through it to understand a point of view but for it to been seen it must be viewed in all it's aspects reasons to keep homework in act is to enforce learning beyond the time of school and also to use as experience in later life but it never does it just ruins learning and even when a perfectly good explanation it's still punished it pulls marks down decrease time to spend outside of school im in Year 9 \"40 Mins Approx\" a piece, i'm not proposing it to be banned altogehter but to have choice and flexibility just as it may work for some children fair due but the majority it doesn't so here it is.\nActions taken should give homework a choice to the pupil and not to adults who lived through it having less homework who often think it easy so Homework should be a choice to the pupil.",
