        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With oil prices soaring and nuclaer power being dangerous and environmentally degrading, why not encourage citizens to generate their own power with microgeneration units for their own homes? Any excess electricity can be put back into the national grid, giving more clean, sustainable energy and reducing the Uk's reliance on oil. As more units are sold the price will come down, in the meantime please help those who want to utilize this technology but can not afford the initial cost. Your party slashed the grants that once were available to people wishing to install the technology, and demand has duly dropped. Please reinstate considerable subsidies for microgeneration as a matter of urgency.",
