            "background": "The Charlotte is the most iconic music venue in Leicester.\n\nAnd it is facing closure, due to economic pressures on the owners.\n\nSince 1985 it has played host to the likes of: \n\nThe Stone Roses, The Charlatans, The Las, Deacon Blue, Primal Scream, Blur, The Levellers, The Manics, Suede, The Cranberries, Pulp, Radiohead, Dodgy, Supergrass, Stereophonics, Squeeze, Muse, Coldplay (pictured), The Coral, Athlete, Snow Patrol, Razorlight, Bloc Party, Scissor Sisters, Arctic Monkeys, The Hoosiers.. And loads more.\n\nAfter the closure of London landmark the Astoria, it's more important than ever that cities have places for people who enjoy live music.\n\nFor the people of Leicester an exciting, intimate live music venue with it's own history is a MUST!\n\nSign this petition if you feel that the Government should be doing more to help keep live music venues open.",
