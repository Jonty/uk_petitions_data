            "background": "The last country to sign the Lisbon Treaty was the Czech Republic. This move has drastically jeopardised the United Kingdom as a democracy as the authority of Brussels over Westminster increases. \n\nNot only do we loose control over issues such as immigration and asylum economic policy has now been brought under firmer control from Brussels which for many British citizens could mean the end of the British Pound as we know it. Also in this treaty we are merely one voice out of a total twenty-seven member states. The Treaty of Lisbon is simply a piece of legislation aiming to create a federal united states of Europe as it already has its own flag, anthem and currency.\n\nWe must opt out of this treaty in order to protect our democratic rights as a nation!",
