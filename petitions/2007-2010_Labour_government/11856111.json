        "background": "Some bus routes still use buses that require passengers to walk a few steps to get onto the bus. My grandmother has difficulty in climbing up/down stairs. Where she lives, the bus service is every half an hour. One of the buses the bus operator uses is a coach. She cannot use the coach as it's a high step to get onto the coach then 3 or 4 small steps inside.\n\nShe had to wait for the next bus to come along - 30 mins later. This is unacceptable for elderly people to wait half an hour extra in the cold because the bus company has put on buses that they can't go on.\n\nIf the bus service was every 5-10 mins, my grandmother doesn't mind waiting that amount of time. Thirty mins is wrong!\n\nPlus the really annoying thing is that a relative works opposite the bus depot and sees at least a dozen buses which are disabled friendly and why can't the bus company use them?",
