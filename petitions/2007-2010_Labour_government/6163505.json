            "background": "Kirkby (Liverpool) has been starved of investment for many years. This huge shopping and football development could safeguard Kirkby's future for our children and grand children.\nKirkby's present predicament seems to be compounded by a ramshackle alliance between those with a narrow house-price agenda and football fans who want Everton to stay at Goodison. Both positions will have dyer consequences for Kirkby and Everton. \nThe first position is flawed and contradicted by hard facts. The second cannot be sustained without squandering Tesco's huge financial backing. \nThe opponents of Kirkby's Development have entrenched themselves generating bogus issues and absurd scare stories. Support Kirkby's future, support the Development.",
