Public objections to planning applications have no effect. Legislation designed to protect and preserve conservation areas and built heritage must be seen to be obeyed. To ensure impartiality and objectivity, there must be no overlap of personnel between English Heritage, the various Urban Regeneration Panels and the Council for Architecture and the Built Environment.\nWe ask the Prime Minister to set mechanisms in place to monitor Local Authority planning decisions and to call in all those that are made contrary to planning law.",
