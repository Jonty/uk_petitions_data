            "background": "I believe that Giles Clarke has by his actions brought English Cricket into disrepute, by allowing the England Cricket Team to take part in a game soley for monetary gain rather than seeking to develop and further advance our great game.  Giles Clarke should seek to act as a guardian of the game, yet has allowed an individual to blatantly purchase our national team and has showed contempt and disregard for the rules of our great game.  For this alone the Government should intervene and protect our national game from potential irreprable damage.",
