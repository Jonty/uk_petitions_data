            "action": "renegotiate the current PPP relationship between Tube Lines and TFL to require them to conduct London underground line upgrades and engineering works during the regular nightly closures as opposed to the current full weekend closures endured by Londoners.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Londoners are regularly subjected to weekend closures on their underground. Similar upgrade work is being undertaken on the Paris Metro with no weekend and full line closures. There therefore appears to be no reason why TFL, Tube Lines and their contractors cannot conduct work in a similar way. The disastrous and ongoing Jubilee Line and upcoming Northern Line works are a case in point as to why this should not be allowed to carry on.",
