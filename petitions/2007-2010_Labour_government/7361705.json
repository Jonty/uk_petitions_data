            "background": "There are clear indications that the introduction of HIPs is adversely affecting the supply of houses coming to the market. Agents, solicitors,  surveyors and mortgage lenders have noted a considerable slowdown in the supply of 4 bedroomed houses and now 3 bedroomed units. The pack is causing delays dues to problems in obtaining searches. The Housing Minister refuses to acknowledge any defect in the system despite continual warnings from the industry. The PM should consider  her suspension pending the outcome of the enquiry.",
