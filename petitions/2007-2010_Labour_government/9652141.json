            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If the car manufacturers would make cars with engines upto 3000cc, instead of 'super cars' with engines in excess of this. The impact of exhaust emissions on the planet would be greatly reduced.\nThe money wasted on developing 6000cc+ engines could be used to develop efficient lower capacity engines that produce hardly any emissions.\nThe reduction of fuel used to power cars would slow down the rate at which fossil fuels are depleted. This would allow more time for hybrid vehicles to be improved and made a more practical option.\nWe need to promote a greener way of driving and London with all its wealthy drivers running gas guzzling sports cars and SUVs that travel at 8mph is really ridiculous.",
