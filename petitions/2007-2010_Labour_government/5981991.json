        "background": "Yesterday it was announced that two warships were to be built and named Queen Elizabeth and The Prince of Wales.  HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, served in the Royal Navy and was mentioned in despatches during  WWII. He has unfailingly supported our Queen and therefore I question why the other ship is not being named after him instead of his rather profligate son. He has made a public contribution to the UK for 67 years and continues to escort Her Majesty when most men of 86 would be taking life easy.",
