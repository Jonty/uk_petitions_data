HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, served in the Royal Navy and was mentioned in despatches during  WWII. He has unfailingly supported our Queen and therefore I question why the other ship is not being named after him instead of his rather profligate son. He has made a public contribution to the UK for 67 years and continues to escort Her Majesty when most men of 86 would be taking life easy.",
