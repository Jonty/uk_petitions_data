            "background": "Our towns and villages are becoming swamped with estate agents boards for offices to let or for sale .  These boards remain in place until the property finds a new owner.  Beautiful High Streets with protected and listed buildings are defaced by this monstrous free advertising adding to the over-signed country we now live in.  If someone needs a first floor office in a High Street wouldn't they look on-line or visit an agent anyway?  Pictures taken of our historic streets are permanently defaced by these boards and simply advertise to visitors the plight of business in our country today.\n\nWe propose that these signs are banned from High Streets to preserve their appearance and our image to the outside world.",
