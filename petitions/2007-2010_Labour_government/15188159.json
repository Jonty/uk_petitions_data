            "background": "The current percentage of earnings paid in CSA payments is too high and unfair. Many parents with care are living very comfortable lives off CSA payments that far out weigh the real costs of raising a child. The vast majority of children do not benefit from the total amount received, whilst the parent with care benefits with a far higher standard of living.",
