            "background": "MBNA causes undue hardship for people in financial hardship despite the requirements of the Banking Code and OFT Debt Collection guidelines to sympathetically consider financial hardship. Abiding by both documents is an implied term of the contract, since most people previously contracted a company that was a signatory of the Banking Code, and MBNA is a consumer credit license holder, and therefore legally bound to abide by the terms of the OFT Debt Collection Guidelines.\n\nBut they deal with people in hardship un -sympathetically and contrary to the spirit of the guidance. They operate at the margins of legality and cross the line when it comes to harrassment.",
