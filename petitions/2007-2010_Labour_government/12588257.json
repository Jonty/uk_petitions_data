Is it not criminal for MPs to stand-by and watch people lose their jobs, homes and dignity while they claim for dog-food and light bulbs?\n\nALL MPs should be made (by a new law) to pay back ALL their claimed expenses on second homes (including those they 'flipped').\n\nLet's make Britain great again!",
