        "background": "INSPIRE science museum in Norwich has announced its closure in early September 2008 due to under funding. This will be a great loss to the provision of science education in East Anglia since the hands-on approach the museum takes is not replicated anywhere else within easy access. Many schools, both primary and secondary, will have the enrichment \u2013 which the new National Curriculum for teaching from September 2008 emphasises as essential to effective teaching and learning \u2013 reduced to nil. The centre is also a fantastic resource for the community and provides many interesting family activities.\n\nI have visited INSPIRE Hands-on science museum on several school trips and always found it to enthuse the pupils and they returned to school eager to learn more science. In this time of reducing numbers of pupils taking science to higher education any enthusiasm can only be positive.",
