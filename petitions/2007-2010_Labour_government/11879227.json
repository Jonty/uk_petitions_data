            "background": "In many cases justice could be delivered much more quickly, cheaply and easily.  The American Judge Judy television programme illustrates well the sort of thing that I have in mind.  This certainly seems to work well for financial disputes, but could the same principles not be extended into other areas?  The government should collect information about where the justice system is not working well because of slowness, expense or difficulty and then act quickly and decisively to change the system for the better.",
