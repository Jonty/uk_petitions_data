            "background": "Edgware Town FC has been the latest victim of being evicted from their ground. This has been due to developers buying the land from the freeholder.\n\nPlaying fields are a cheaper option for developers. However, if there was government intervention to prevent such land being developed in this way, developers would have to buy and build on thousands of plots land where buildings are empty instead of scavenging our sacred playing fields.\n\nMake developers leave the ever reducing hallowed turf where millions play their favourite sport and live healthy, active lives! Where active sport has proven to reduce crime! Where millions congregate and feel a sense of community! If government does not act on this petition they are underlining the lack of commitiment when it comes to crime, community spirit and the population's well-being.\n\nIf the government is listening, let our new PM, Gordon Brown, make his intentions known by using Edgware Town FC as an example and stop the planning permission going ahead. Hopefully this will prevent Edgware Town FC having to leave their ground by the end of the year.\n\nSupport this petition! Stop the rot!",
