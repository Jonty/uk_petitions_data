            "background": "Social services have a poor reputation in the UK that is well deserved. Social Services are run by each local authority and inspected by the SSI in Northern Ireland, the CSSI in England & Wales, with Children's services inspected by Ofsted.\n\nIndividual social workers are unregulated and if you have a problem with a social worker you can only complain to your local authority, who will investigate the complaint themselves.\n\nThere is currently no licencing system for social workers and the UK needs a licencing authority to regulate social workers just the same as doctors are regulated by the GMC.\n\nThe agency should be responsible for ensuring consistent training, qualification and work practices. The agency should have the authority to investigate complaints independantly of local authorities and have the power to impose sanctions against or strike off social workers who fail to meet good practice.",
