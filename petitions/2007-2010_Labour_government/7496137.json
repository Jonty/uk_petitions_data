            "background": "It is important that the government recognise Parent Alienation Syndrome enacted by the resident parent against the non-resident parent. Thousands of children are being used/estranged from their non-resident parent and these parents must be given the ultimate sanction of losing their child to the non-resident parent if they presist in causing their children not to want to see the non-resident parent. At this point in time their is no sanction to stop them from so alienating their children which is not in the paramount interests of that child or children.",
