            "background": "RAF Lympne was situated in Kent. Lympne was and Advance Landing Ground, one of the 11 Group satellite airfields used by fighter squadrons as required, often flights or squadrons would detach to the airfield in the morning and return to their main base in the evening. \n In the 1930s Lympne Aerodrome was the starting point for several long distance record flights, including a solo one to Cape Town by the aviatrix Amy Johnson in 1932, and also ones by her later-to-be husband Jim Mollison. Jean Batten later flew from Lympne to Darwin, beating Johnson's long-distance record, in 1934. The aerodrome was also the venue for air races. The airport has now been closed and turned into an industrial estate. I think it would be better if the industrial estate were to move to a new location, such as closer to Ashford, and the Airfield were re-opened\nIt would be popular with aviation enthusiasts and it would bring in lots of tourists to the area. Having an active civil airfield at Lympne would be sure to give a boost to the local area.",
