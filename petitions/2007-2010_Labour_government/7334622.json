        "background": "Despite numerous high-profile breaches of the Data Protection Act, most recently by HMRC, the Information Commissioner's Office rarely prosecutes the offender. In the majority of cases, the offender is merely require to sign an undertaking not to re-offend. This is no deterrent and does not encourage companies, organisations and inividuals to manage personal data in accordance with the Act. The law should make it easier to bring prosecution and for prosection to be automatic under defined circumstances.",
