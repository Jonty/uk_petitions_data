The cull is not for food but a custom to celebrate adulthood. Nothing is being done to prevent this barbarism being committed.\n  \nAs part of the EU Denmark should stop this Cull now. Horrifying pictures are taken by shocked witnesses of dolphins lying slaughtered in a blood coloured sea and then dragged to the beach to be gutted alive.",
