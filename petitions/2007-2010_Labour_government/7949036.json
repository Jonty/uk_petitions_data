            "background": "Weights Lane is a council-maintained road which forms the route to work for many people and is regularly used by thousands more attending car boot sales at Weights Farm. Numerous requests have been made to the council to properly fix the road surface which is always in a state of total disrepair, with large craters and potholes across its width. The council approach seems to consist of filling the holes with grit occasionally - a measure which lasts a week at most with the heavy use of the road by cars and heavy trucks - this is not an acceptable solution.",
