            "background": "Rotherham Council has recently cut social service provisions, namely meals on wheels and laundry services. \n\nThis has the following unacceptable consequences:\n\n-causes 'choice' to come at a potentially doubled price - a customer may now  need a home care visit for 30mins to heat and serve or fetch a meal -thus paying  twice -once for the meal and again for the carer\u2019s  visit. \n-it removes the 'choice' of having a daily hot meal served without having your privacy invaded for up to  30mins\n-may encourage poor diets (ie carers being sent to take-aways, chips shops etc as they are close by and cheap) \n-places more expectation and strain on informal carers -contrary to law and policy that aims to ensure carers' wellbeing\n-contributes to job losses at a time of economic crisis\n-places service users at risk of abuse if they are turning to people whom have not been vetted to provide cheaper services for them \n\nand furthermore -there is NO alternative service to deal with laundry soiled through incontinence. This in particular will be pushed on to over-relied on families\nThus these services must be reinstated or else appropriate, affordable and genuinely choice-providing services must be created.",
