        "background": "The Cow Lane bridge at Didcot is a hazard to all users because it is too narrow such that wide loads hit the barrier between pedestrians and motor vehicles, also the foot way is shared with bicycles and is not fit for purpose as it is also too narrow for successful passing. The width of the footway is entirely used if a wheelchair user needs to pass, this creates conflicts if there is an accident the ability to return in the direction of entry is required.",
