            "background": "The UK is famous as a world leader in popular music and for 40 years the BBC has played a major role in fostering and promoting new talent. 6Music plays a major part of this and there is no other station - commercial or state funded - with a comparable output. Furthermore it provides a musical education by playing older music from all sorts of genres that are not otherwise played.  In doing so it enriches the cultural life of the nation.\n \nIn short 6Music does what the BBC ought to do: it provides a public service.\nThe cost savings would be paltry compared to the overall cost of the BBC.\nPlease do not allow the BBC to cut this station.",
