            "background": "Lizo Mzimba. A name now associated with Newsround as much as the great John Craven. Lizo is the modern day version. Lizo has spent almost ten years now with Newsround, brining news to children and young people in a way only really gifted people could. He has encouraged me, for one, since I was very young to want to watch the news and to become a broadcaster. He has inspired many more I am sure. His years on Newsround have taken him to all four corners of the globe, bringing the powerful stories that matter to young people to millions of Newsround viewers.Among his filming assignments in 2005, he travelled to the scenes of devastation in New Orleans to make a special Newsround programme about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the effects on the children caught up in it. Hopefully you will agree that it is time Mr Mzimba be rewarded for this work and his dedication to Childrens News in whatever way the Government see fit to do so. Thank You.",
