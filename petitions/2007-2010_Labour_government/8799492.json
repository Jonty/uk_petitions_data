            "background": "Consumers should not have to choose between 1) buying from companies that make unverifiable claims about their ethical practices and 2) companies that do not pay workers in developing countries a decent wage, nor ensure that they have reasonable working hours and conditions. Such an important issue, even if companies could be trusted to report their practices honestly, should not be left to the discretion of the consumer. The government must create legislation to compel all UK-based businesses to comply with certain ethical standards. A government-funded inspecting body should also be created to measure businesses' compliance with this legislation. This could also report on the use of child labour, environmental impact, and any ethical initiatives, such as providing free schooling for workers or workers' children, and the information should be made available to the consumer.",
