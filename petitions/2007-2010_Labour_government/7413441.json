            "background": "The current level was set in 2002. Since then, the costs of fuel and motor insurance has risen. Combine this with inflation, the true cost of using a car for work has risen dramatically since 2002. \n\nThe AA have suggested that the real cost of motoring is now at least 44p per mile. \n\nKeeping the allowance at 40 pence per mile means that those who need to drive for work are in fact losing money. This stealth tax must be brought to an end.",
