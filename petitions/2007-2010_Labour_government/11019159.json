        "background": "British people of all ethnic backgrounds who work hard and pay their tax's don't want their money given away to un-deserving individuals.\n\n1) Why should immigrants be given houses and benefits for doing nothing? All immigrants should potentially given their situation work for the state for 5-10 years at minimum wage until they are entitled to any benefits or even British Citizenship.\n2) Jobseekers allowance should be paid on how much you have given in tax's rather than indefinately.\n3) Why are the criminals getting treated better than the people they commit crimes against? Why don't prisons stop giving them hotel style living accomodations and start doing something useful with their time like manufacturing things for the British public.\n\nI understand about helping people who help themselves. I am sure the government wouldn't give me \u00a3170,000 a year and a \u00a31m house if I asked, and why should they I can work afterall.\n\nThis is nothing to do with race or sexual persuasion this is about hard working british Citizens being treated properly.",
