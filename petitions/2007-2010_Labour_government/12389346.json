            "background": "The government should pay electricians, plumbers, joiners, bricklayers etc etc to train the youth of today.  Not only will it give people work and skills, but will also enable the tradespersons company to grow and succeed.  The money the government spend on job centre plus and benefits paid to the youths looking for work would be better spent on a scheme like this.  Also the value of true apprenticeships (4 years+) should be recognised.  You cannot become an electrician or plumber in 6 weeks or 6 months as stated by organistations such as the skills centre.",
