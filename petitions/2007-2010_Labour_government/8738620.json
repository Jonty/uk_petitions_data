        "background": "Parents of children with Special Needs have to fight to get an education that their children deserve.  My daughter and another child in our LEA suffer from Cerebral Palsy and have to fight our LEA to get an education that will benefit them. Our LEA closed all schools but one and considers this school adequate despite clear documentary evidence that this is not the case. Parents are forced into a tribunal system that claims to be independent and must fund the fight themselves. We are forced to fund raise to place our children in a school outside the LEA area that has a proven track record in improving the lives of children with Cerebral Palsy allowing them to fulfil their potential in life. Currently only one of the children attends this school and her place is funded by constant fundraising by friends and family, she is the only child at the school who is not funded by their LEA. The other child's parents are now being forced into independent tribunals knowing that they have little chance of winning and face 14 years of trying to fundraise in excess of \u00a3290,000 to give their child the education she needs and deserves. This post code lottery is unfair and cannot be allowed to continue",
