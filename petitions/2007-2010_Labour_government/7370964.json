Dr Graeme Laver, who helped create the jab more than 40 years ago, believes it should not be relied upon to protect from a potentially severe flu epidemic.\n\nThe Australian scientist also claims that people's lives could be saved if drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza were used instead, once the disease has already struck. So the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to examine the feasibility of supplying this on the NHS and over the counter,as  Dr Laver advises.",
