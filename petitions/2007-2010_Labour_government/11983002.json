Stop the ruination of our coastline and loss of employment as a result.  These are our shorelines and we demand immediate action to ensure they are safeguarded absolutely from exploitation.  This cannot be allowed to continue as our fish stocks are dwindling before our eyes and nothing is being done about it. Save Our Shoals",
