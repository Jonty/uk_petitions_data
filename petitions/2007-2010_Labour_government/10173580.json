            "background": "Due to rocketing fuel prices the winter of 2008 will see great hardship amongst OAPs. It\u2019s quite likely cold weather will result in many deaths. To date the answer has been to give OAPs \u2018fuel money\u2019 \u2013 but this is, never enough and just increases CO2 emissions. What is needed is insulation, which pays back now \u2013 and for evermore.\n\nA practical low-cost solution, is to create a \u2018WARM POD\u2019 \u2013 say 8\u2019 x 10\u2019 \u2013 within old people\u2019s houses. Constructed with fire-resistant rigid foam and foil (or similar), 6\u201d thick, prefabricated and erected in just it couple of hours, it would be heated with no more than a light bulb, TV and body heat. It will be warm as toast. There would need to be a small heat recovery unit (HRV) at the top to ventilate it and a window in one side that could be aligned with the window in the host room. Even if the person needed to come out to make tea it would provide a warm refuge. Put a bed in there and you have a \u2018WARM-POD\u2019 that would cost a fraction of other solutions.  Not perfect \u2013 but needs must. A life-saver.",
