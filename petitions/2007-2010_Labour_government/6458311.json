            "action": "remove artificial 'anti-competition' laws, following the EU ruling about Microsoft.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I have no vested interest in this but anti-competition laws are an artificial means of preventing a truly free economy. A truly free economy must allow that one company, or one individual, can, without breaking the law, attain a position where they account for the vast majority of trade in a particular business. It is therefore up to smaller businesses to find a means to compete. If they cannot do this, this does not necessraily mean that the larger company has 'abused' its position therefore anti-competition laws are not needed. Other existing copyright laws are sufficient. There is no natural reason why a company such as Microsoft should be forced to share its own hard work with other companies or to allow other companies products to be compatible with products it has heavily invested in. Anti competition laws are a throwback to the socialist, anti-business 1970s and before and mainly serve only to line lawyers pockets further.",
