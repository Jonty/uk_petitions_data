        "background": "Trinity Street PO in Gainsborough ably serves the area in which\n     it is located as well as the surrounding area.  It is\n     relatively easy to access for both pedestrians and motorists,\n     catching locals and passing trade; provides a wide range of\n     post office services and has much longer opening hours that\n     some of it\u2019s nearby competitors.  The postmaster, his wife and\n     their staff are efficient, pleasant and patient with customers\n     and provide their service with smiles.   This is a PO that is\n     always busy, sometimes frantically so, but when there are\n     queues, these are dealt with swiftly and efficiently and with\n     good nature so that customers do not mind the wait. If nearby\n     village POs, which open much shorter hours and provide far\n     fewer services, are closed, then Trinity Street PO will be even\n     more necessary to the DN21 postal area. The suggestion that\n     customers of Trinity Street PO should take their trade to the\n     Lindsey Centre or Queensway is not feasible or desirable for\n     many of it\u2019s customers; the first being far too busy with\n     regular lengthy queues, the latter being far too far away. We\n     demand that Trinity Street post office be retained.",
