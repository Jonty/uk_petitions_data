        "action": "address English As A Second Language Campaigns (ESOL) as part of govt immigration policy",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "AOL today reports that, \n\n\"Immigration minister Liam Byrne has pledged to put national interests \"centre stage\" as a report was published dismissing the Government claim that immigration is good for the economy\". Try telling that to the millions of unemployed people who are competing as job applicants at interview with foreign nationals. Like it or not, Britain IS a multi - ethnic and multi - lingual society - not only with labour but social mobility, not only within but between EU states, as well as also between continents. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to ensure consistency - what a waste of resources for ESOL trainers to teach basic skills to people who then leave the country ! Is this really an appropriate use of valuable resources ? Can Rt Hon Byrne please consider employment as well as social issues, like racial tension, when addressing this issue. Also on the subject of ESOl- the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to set up an online database of translators for public sector workers to improve healthcare - it is very difficult to deliver the baby of someone who doesn't understand you !",
