            "background": "We believe that the days of the eurovision song contest being just that, a song contest are well and truly over. \n\nEvery year the UK puts money into this so called contest, yet get nothing out of it. It is basically now just political voting as 2008 has proved. \n\nWe do not wish to take part in such a contest where the tactical voting replaces what the competition was once about A SONG CONTEST. \n\nThere is no competition to it anymore and we wish not to take part in next years so called 'contest'. Use the eurovision money for something the UK can enjoy and let the rest of Europe have their little political battle.",
