Many people in the UK think that they way in which animals are killed in this way is extrememly cruel. Food in supermarkets now has to have a list of ingredients shown on the packaging. I think that it should be law that you know what you are eating and there for wish for all commercial premises to show signs that they use halal meat in their food.",
