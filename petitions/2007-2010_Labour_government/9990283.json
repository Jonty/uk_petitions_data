            "background": "The Care Industry has a desperate shortage of care workers (Carers/Care Assistants/HCA's), although this fact is not recognised by the Home Office or the Migration Advisory Committee.\nHCA's do not qualify for a Work Permit under the skilled worker section and will not fall into Tier 2 of the Points Based System.\nTo make matters worse, the Home Office or UK Border Agency has stopped virtually all new Work Permits for Senior Carers.\nWhat is needed is a special 'Sectors Based\" scheme under Tier 3, for low skilled workers, for HCA's or Carers from outside the EU.\nIdeally, this would allow carers to work in the UK for a period of two years before returning to their country.\nWorkers from Eastern Europe have not solved the staffing crisis in the private care sector, which spends millions on temporary or agency staff. In fact, according to Home Office figures, the number of EU workers coming to the UK is actually falling and thousands are returning home.\nCare Homes will be forced to close by CSCI unless they can maintain adequate staffing levels. Patients are being put at risk. Must the Government wait for a tragedy to occur before taking action?\nSet up a Sectors Based Carer Work Permit now.",
