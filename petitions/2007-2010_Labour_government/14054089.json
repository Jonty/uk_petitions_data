            "background": "In 1989 the gates that remove the public's right to access Downing Street were made permanent. However, the road itself is a public right of way.\n\nIn 1974 Harold Wilson refused to allow the blocking up of Downing Street, with his PPS stating \"I much regret this further erosion of the Englishman's right to wander at will in Downing Street.\"\n\nThe British Prime Minster holds office from a regular house on a regular street because he (or she) is a commoner elected by the people. The Prime Minsiter is not a President ruling from a resticted and private domain, admitting the people when he chooses if at all.\n\nTherefore, I call on the Prime Minister to remove the gates at Downing Street and once again allow the British public the freedom of access.",
