            "background": "Amy Winehouse has appeared over and over again in the tabloids doing copious amounts of illegal drugs. Any normal person caught on film taking class A drugs would be sentanced to a minimum 7 years in jail just for possession of such substances. There is no actual reason why Amy Winehouse should be any different and should be made an example of as currently she is sending out the message that doing illegal drugs is fine provided that you make enough to support your habit and are famous. If the government insists on waging its war against drugs then it should include celebrities such as Winehouse. Laws should not be wavered for the sake of fame.",
