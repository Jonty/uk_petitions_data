        "background": "I seems to be the norn to make each day a little harder for the young to obtain independance in a world that is becoming safer at any cost !  All of us remember the thrill of passing our test at 17 and sure enough we all were not the perfect drivers but we evolve over many years. Seting a higher age will merely extend the age and who says a 18 yr old is so different in responsability to that of a 17 yr old.\nThis will also force the young into the dagerouse world of the moped which as a motorcycle rider I can assure has\nfar more daily dangers than a car.\nThe last point I would like noted is that of the parents who will be expected to ship siblings round for another year which in most cases turns a 2 way jouney into that of a 4 way trip at more cost to the tax payer and this already overcrowded road system and overpoluted world we call home.\nRemember FUN !",
