            "background": "With effect from 31st December 2008 Standard Life Bank will pass on just 0.8% of the 2.5% reduction in the BoE base rate to its Standard Variable Rate customers.  This is a considerably smaller reduction than the rest of the banking industry and leaves its SVR at 5.79% which is 3.79% above the BoE base rate.\n\nFor example the average reduction in the SVR for the 9 lenders who have to date responded to both the November and December interest rate is 2.0% (data from BBC news website on 5th December).  \n\nIt is also important to note that Standard Life Bank is not using the additional funds from its borrowers to support its savers and has also announced a reduction in its variable savings rates of between 0.75% and 1.34%.",
