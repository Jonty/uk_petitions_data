Pagans are obliged to tick 'other' boxes on official forms, compelling us to declare our faith in a way which makes it seem subversive and unusual. This creates a culture of distrust in which Pagans may feel discriminated against as a direct result of their faith and may be excluded from certain strains of Public Sector employment (e.g. religious schools) due to our religion appearing dangerous through a lack of understanding and acceptance.",
