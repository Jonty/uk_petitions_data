            "background": "There are rogue tenants who deliberately sign up to tenancies they cannot afford. They take housing benefit, but don't pay it to the landlord. They know their rights inside out, but never fulfil the associated obligations and are seemingly not bound by the contract or the law. The government should do to ensure these tenants face up to their responsibilities and pay their debts. Such behaviour is resulting in landlord stress, illness and bankruptcy. The government seems to condone this sort of behaviour as even though these people's details are in the state system, and they abscond without leaving a forwarding address landlords cannot register CCJs or attachment of earnings without tracing agents, and additional cost. Benefits continue to be paid, and there is no help at all to the landlord. Make these fraudsters accountable for their actions otherwise they will continue to cause hardship.",
