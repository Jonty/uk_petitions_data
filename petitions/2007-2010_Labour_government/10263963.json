        "background": "Prime Minister, Please allow the proposed cull of badgers to go ahead. I am aware that badgers are a cute and attractive animals and that the policy would be unpopular with many urban voters, as Mr Benn alluded to. However 1000s of cattle are slaughtered every year as a result of Bovine TB. Surely  the public acceptance of a policy must come in second place to the real good of the country? Rural and farming comunities feel besieged enough.",
