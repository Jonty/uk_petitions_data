        "background": "MPs continue to debate whether or not to allow a third runway at Heathrow Airport (LHR).  This is a bad idea, given that there is no room for LHR to expand further, without serious antagonising local residents and the loss of woodland and villages.  Yet Britain desperately needs more capacity for the future, when the economy recovers and if we are to continue to compete with other countries.  The solution is to build a brand new airport, either offshore or by converting an existing unused RAF airbase.  Not only will this create new jobs and boost the ecomomy, it will take the stress of LHR and reduce the need to expand Gatwick or Stansted further.",
