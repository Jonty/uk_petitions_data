            "background": "As an emergency service that many people throughout Britain rely on, i am asking the government provide some kind of annual funding.\nThis service is all voluntary and they risk their own lives for others.\nIf you are not already aware it can cost around \u00a35000 to send a boat out on one life saving journey.\nThis money again relies on people giving  voluntary charitable contributions.\nIf on just one occasion someone from the government was to need help out at sea, they would rely on this service, yet if  the money wasn't available for the RNLI to go out on a rescue, what would that person do.\nI'm sure they would think twice about funding of this wonderful emergency service, who so many of us do and may yet require to rely on.\nI am therefore asking for you all to get behind this petition and help all those that help us.",
