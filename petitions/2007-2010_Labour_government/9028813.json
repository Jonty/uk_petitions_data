            "background": "Rather than charge people for throwing out rubbish why not reward good citizens for seperating and recycling their waste materials. I have seen this working in other cities abroad such as Vancouver, where glass bottles and various other waste has value. This means that every person is keen to return their waste to proper sites. I'm sure a tax on plastics and other materials could pay for this returns policy.",
