        "background": "For half a century (1945-1991) Russia, then called the USSR, has threatened Britain, Europe and the US. Now, after a 9-year break, the Russians are back since 2000 (the election of Vlad Putin), and are threatening Britain again. Now, it happens every week that a Russian strategic bomber penetrates our airspace, and it is ONLY because of British servicemen that they haven't attacked Britain yet. The Russians have also refused to extradite Lugovoi, and threatened to aim their nukes at Britain. British-Russian diplomatic relations MUST be ended.",
