            "background": "Fireworks only create fear and suffering for our pensioners, young children and animals (pets & livestock).  Although they can be very pretty and spectacular it is not fair that the aforementioned must suffer any more than need be. Fireworks are for one night only - 5th Nov - so it should be law that they can only be used at this time.Also more policing to prevent fireworks at other times would be beneficial for all concerned, especially in rural areas.Let's stop the suffering.",
