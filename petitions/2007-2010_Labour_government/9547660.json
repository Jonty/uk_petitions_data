            "background": "Oil prices continue rise at an alarming rate, yet there is no global shortage of oil. \nInstead, the price rises are driven by speculative investments on the worldwide oil exchanges by individuals with no desire except to make money from the rising prices, they are not genuinely interested in oil, they simply wish to drive the price as high as possible in their own profiteering interests. \nGiven that oil is the single most important commodity to the world wide economy, we believe that it should be exempted from such speculative trading, and that oil exchanges around the world should be purely for the \"real-world\" buying and selling of oil.",
