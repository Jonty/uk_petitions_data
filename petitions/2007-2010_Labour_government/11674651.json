Let a yob in a hoody call you names and threaten you, See where innocent dads get stabbed, speak to people in job centres. See for your self that this country is not the wondrous place you see it is from your comfy leather chair in westminster. Politics doesnt exist anymore I feel alienated and disgusted by the way this country has been left to drain away. Bring Politics back for the real people. Otherwise things will only get worse!",
