We should be proud of the members of the armed services for their role in protecting us and their courage should be recognised on a daily basis. Many businesses are keen to do so by offering serving members a discount. To do this effectively they need a nationally recognised \u201carmed services discount\u201d symbol that they can use as a window sticker, on posters and websites, and in advertisements. We are calling on the Prime Minister to launch a symbol for businesses that give a minimum of 10% discount for serving members of the armed services.",
