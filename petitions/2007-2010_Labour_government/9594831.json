        "background": "Many people are concerned that our country does not adequately recognise the courage and sacrifice of members of the armed services, except on special occasions such as Remembrance Day. We should be proud of the members of the armed services for their role in protecting us and their courage should be recognised on a daily basis. Many businesses are keen to do so by offering serving members a discount. To do this effectively they need a nationally recognised \u201carmed services discount\u201d symbol that they can use as a window sticker, on posters and websites, and in advertisements. We are calling on the Prime Minister to launch a symbol for businesses that give a minimum of 10% discount for serving members of the armed services.",
