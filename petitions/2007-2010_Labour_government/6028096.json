            "background": "The Office of Fair trading has started High Court proceedings against a number of banks who they feel have been guilty of unfair charging to their customers. Until this matter is settled, which could get drawn out for a number of years, the FSA has issued a waiver allowing banks to suspend all complaints and claims for refunds.  \n\nBank customers, driven into a spiral of debt by these unfair charges, will not be able to seek compensation either through the FSA, the FOS or local county court. Stripped of our rights we will be at the mercy of the banks and their unfair charging structures. \n\nThe Prime Minister, in association with his treasury ministers, who the FSA are directly accountable to, must step in and put an end to this unfair decision, that will strip millions of their right to recompense under the law.",
