            "background": "In June 1940, after Italy entered the Second World War,all Italian male civilians were forcibly interned. These internees were held in inhumane conditions, without proper food, sanitary facilities and medical care. Following a decision to transport a number of internees, the liner \"Arandora Star\" left Liverpool for Canada carrying over 1,570 internees. On the morning of 2nd July 1940, the liner was torpedoed off Ireland and sank with the loss of nearly 700 lives - which included 446 Italians. This July 2 it will have been 70 years since the loss of the Arandora Star. The tragedy is that the loss of life need not have occurred had the British Government of the day, realised that the internees were no threat to the British public.   \nThe events have left a bitter after taste with the Italian communities both in UK and Italy.   I would like  a formal apology to the Italian people be made on the 70th anniversary. \nI would kindly ask the Prime Ministers office to liaise with the Italian authorities and representatives of the Italian community in the UK, to make a formal apology to those that lost loved ones, not just the Italian but the German, Austrian and other nationalities that suffered loss.",
