            "background": "Exempt Lotus Sports Car's from paying Car Tax, due to the current market conditions I believe the best way forward and to further increase Lotus cars sales therefore securing job's both at the factory and suppliers' alike would be to scrap vehicle duty (Car Tax) for these vehicles.  Lotus have highlighted the need for change and have already produced Eco Friendly cars, I feel that they should be rewarded so a scrap of vehicle duty would increase sales and benefit all.  \n\nLotus are themselves a niche car manufacturer so this would not lead to a huge deficit in revenue for the government but would help sell these fantastic cars as such a crucial time preserving  job's",
