Animals are treated in humanely, some have never seen daylight, and are used like machines. They are continuously impregnated, particularly cows, to keep milk flowing. Piglets have tails ripped off, and other painful things are inflicted on these helpless, innocent animals, all without pain killers.\nThey are kept in cramped conditions, often living in their own waste. \n\nMost of these animals are not shocked properly, before enduring a slow and painful end to their suffering life. \n\nWe must make this cruelty a thing of the past, we must but a stop to this cruelty happening in our country.",
