            "background": "There is no logic in putting a wheel clamp on an illegally parked vehicle. If the vehicle is actually causing an obstruction, why is it not towed away? Putting a clamp on means it cannot be moved thus the obstruction persists longer. If it is not causing an obstruction this raises two issues, the first of which is why is there a parking restriction in the first place? The second is why not issue a fixed-penalty ticket?",
