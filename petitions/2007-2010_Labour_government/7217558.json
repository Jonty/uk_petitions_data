            "background": "When the budget was drawn up, the goverment's figures were worked out on fuel costing between 92p and 93p per litre.  Now that the cost of crude oil has rocketed, the price of a litre of fuel is now 100p+.  This means the goverment is making an extra \u00a312 million per day on top of what they have budgeted for.  Therefore, i am petitioning the goverment to reduce the tax on fuel by at least 8p per litre!",
