            "background": "There are many things that can be done to eradicate child poverty that would\nalso have a positive impact on all people living in poverty. These include;\ntackling the gender pay gap and the concentration of women in low paid, part\ntime work, expanding affordable childcare, the government taking a lead in\nputting Living Wage Agreements in place, a massive expansion in social\nhousing to address the housing crisis and soaring housing costs. We also\nneed to look at all the barriers people experience to taking part in\nemployment, this includes tackling discrimination \u2013 minority ethnic\ncommunities remain disproportionately affected by poverty. It also must be\nrecognised that asylum seekers need support, not stigmatising. These are\njust starting points, and I believe that we do need a serious discussion-\nwhich includes the voices of those living in poverty and fully involves all\nmembers of the local community.",
