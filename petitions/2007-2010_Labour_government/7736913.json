            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The point of restricting the trading hours of large stores on Sundays is to prevent companies forcing their staff to work long shifts on what should be a \"family day\". This doesn't work, as staff are still made to stock shelves, clean, etc for a full 8 or 9 hour shift, after the store has closed.\n\nI propose that the Sunday trading laws are changed, to prevent any company making any staff member work more than six hours on a Sunday, but allowing the store itself to remain open 24 hours, as they are the rest of the week.\n\nI believe that this way, everybody wins, workers AND shoppers.",
