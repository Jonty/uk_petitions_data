            "background": "Since Stagecoach took over the running of the East Midlands Trains franchise, passengers have seen services slashed/short formed, and 162 staff now face the threat of redundancy. This is in spite of Stagecoach announcing a 6.7% rise in rail revenues since October. I call on this government to act and put an end to these cost efficiency exercises to line the pockets of shareholders at the expense of passengers and workers jobs.",
