            "background": "The 9 point penalty currently automatically imposed on football clubs who enter financial administration is both unjust and ineffective.\n\nIt only serves to penalise fans, supporters and players who have had no role in the financial structure or running of the club and are therefore not at fault.\n\nAdditionally, the guilty parties who financially ruined the club may have subsequently left and therefore are unaffected by the punishment.\n\nThis is an ineffective penalty, which unjustly punishes innocent fans and supporters who are the heart of any football club.\n\nIt should be scrapped with immediate effect and an alternative, appropriate penalty should be considered.",
