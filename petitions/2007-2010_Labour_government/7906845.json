            "background": "The government seems to be obessed with passing new laws regarding gun control (VCRA for example) and knife crime, when there are already plenty of existing laws which cover these areas; they just need to be enforced more often. It is clearly just a case of the government trying to win over  voters and be seen to be taking a pro-active stance against specific forms of crime, minor as they are. More people die falling down stairs each year than are shot or stabbed to death, yet the government fails to realise that introducing yet more unenforceable laws wont help one faintest bit; police need less red tape & greater resources- that will make a difference.",
