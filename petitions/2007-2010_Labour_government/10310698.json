However it is quite clear that the current leader of the British government is ignorant to the fact we don't like his decisions.\n\nWhether we want to be a part of the EU or not should be our decision. Not his as an elected representative. He should listen to the public. \n\nWe are taxed to death and the poor are left to struggle whilst those who can't be bothered to work are given free cash. This makes it harder for hard working people to have a decent standard of living. But we shouldn't worry because people will be employed to look into this and set up a think tank to waste money on looking into the social impact!\n\nThe NHS is a drain and the wrong people are given too much money to waste.\n\nIt is time for a change.",
