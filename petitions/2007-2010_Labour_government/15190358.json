            "background": "There are no benefits to so-called Daylight Savings Time, or British Summer Time as it is known in the UK. There is the same amount of daylight on any given day of the year, whatever time we choose to call sunrise and sunset. Any jobs which require light or darkness will be carried out at whatever time is required, regardless. GMT is the correct time zone for this country and it should remain so. Everywhere else in the world bases their time zone on the offset from GMT, so why do we spend half the year offset from it ourselves? This practise causes more confusion than it is worth. It's long past time to stop messing with the clocks.",
