        "background": "\u201cThe proposed analog radio changeover to digital disadvantages everyone and is ludicrous and pointless. It forces you to scrap all your existing radios - and you 'have' to waste more money buying DAB sets instead when this country is already in a desperate financial state. Car radios, kitchen radios, bedside radios, stereo tuners, all become scrap. And the liberated bandwidth is used for extra services no-one wants - witness the DAB station failures - polluted with advertising, and never again the chance to hear a foreign station by accident. This is not a future I want and certainly will not accept.\u201d",
