        "background": "Currently, ISP are planning to monitor the Publics Internet Connection to look for illegal file download and disconnect people who are file sharing. Also, ISP want to block a vital internet port to try an \"stop\" spam, but infact, this block would stop most of the legitimate emails travelling aswell. The ISP's should not be allowed to monitor and filter their networks, they should be passive in the internet process as they are just the provider. These new plans seem that they will cause more problems to people using their network more than those they are trying to catch.",
