So that the sentencing reflects the severity of the crime.\nThe amount of family's like ours who have lost a loved one to violent street crime is growing by the day, and the small sentences that these violent people get is so small, 2 years for manslaughter (time served) and yet 18 months for tax credit fraud? Therse no comparison is there. This can not be justice.",
