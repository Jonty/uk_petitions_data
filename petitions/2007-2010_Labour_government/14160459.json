            "background": "The National Flood Forum is a charitable organisation that only has enough funding to continue working in its current format until March. It is already doing vital work to help the nation - it is the leading organisation to offer people advice on protecting their own homes and how to make their homes flood resilient if they are threatened by flooding - and could achieve so much more with some additional funding from the Government. Without it, the work it does would fall on the Government in any case. It is the first port of call for millions of people who have suffered flooding, or are in fear of flooding, and could offer much wider services and resources to help people with flooding problems with Government funding.",
