            "background": "The Framework is intended to reduce bureaucracy but appears to demand a great deal more.A central flaw of the Framework is the assumption that meaningful comparisons can be drawn, on the basis of data, between very different types of provision. A modern apprenticeship is very different from a full-time college course, which is very different from a non-accredited evening class. I have just under gone work preparation for what will be 13 weeks and it has helped give me the boost I needed to gain employment and show what potential I posses. Without that encouragement from a small provider in my area I would be on a dead end road instead I am on a much more fulfilling destination.I personally do not know much about this subject but i think its an over-ambitious Framework.The effect of a change in April 2008 in the way places like the one I attended are funded could be catastrophic so please make sure we can keep these vital providers who on very small funds help improve everyone\u2019s life!",
