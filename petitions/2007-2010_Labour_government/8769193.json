            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "169 post offices are under threat in London. The Post Office has launched a 6 week consultation which closes on 2 April 2008. Mayor of London Ken Livingstone is launching a legal challenge as government advice is that consultations should last 12 weeks. In Wimbledon alone 4 more post offices are facing closure - Wimbledon Village High Street, Leopold Road, Coombe Lane and Kingston Road - together with 2 further branches in Morden and Mitcham.\nThis will not only affect the most vulnerable and least mobile groups - such as the elderly and disabled - it will further erode the life of local communities in London. It will also  prevent the already restricted access of local businesses and time-poor professionals to e-commerce, including posting and collection of parcels using the Royal Mail's own online postage. \nThis means the Royal Mail Group will miss out on the massively growing commercial market for internet trading, which it already blames for it's demise due to the growth of email.",
