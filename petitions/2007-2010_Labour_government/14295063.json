        "background": "The current Government thinking around green policy seems to be about generating tax revenue. This creates mistrust in the public domain about green issues and undermines the message.\n\nThe Government needs a scheme where the implementation of remote working becomes attractive for employers.\n\nThousands of people travel to work everyday when there is no real need to. Why do you have to sit in an office to use a computer?\n\nTechnology exists to maintain collaboration and a work place community.  Just think of the benefits.\n\n1) Less cars on the road.\n2) Less people on the rail network at rush hour.\n3) More cash in your employees pocket, or even pay them less.\n4) Less corporate real estate required and associated costs.\n5) Access to skills nationally not just locally, increasing opportunities for all.\n6) Redistribution of wealth from the South East.\n7) A better work/life balance.\n8) Better rested employees that don't mind giving a bit extra back.\n9) A policy that reduces carbon footprint and rewards people for reducing it rather than punishing them.",
