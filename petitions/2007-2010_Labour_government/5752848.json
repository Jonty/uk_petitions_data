            "background": "A recent report states that 1200 bikes are stolen every day and yet this demoralising and often aggressive crime is not treated as a priority by the police. Stolen bikes feed into a criminal network including drug crime and as such the police should be supported in tackling this crime wave. A government serious about addressing global warming and encouraging healthy living should be taking any crime that discourages cycling very seriously. Cycles and cyclist are easy targets for thieves, thieves who know that their chances of being sought and caught by the police are low. A bike is someone's transport, their freedom and often their sport and yet stolen bikes are rarely investigated or recovered. Please add your voice to this petition.",
