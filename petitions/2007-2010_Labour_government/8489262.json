            "background": "I wish to protest at the Premier League's proposal to play a 39th round of foreign fixtures. In proposing to seed these games the Premier League has shown beyond doubt that it is more interested in making money than the integrity of the country's top league competition. The idea shows a total lack of respect for the game's supporters and those of other domestic leagues world-wide and I strongly urge all Premier League Chairmen to reconsider this ludicrous, insulting and greedy decision. NO TO GAM\u00a3 39.",
