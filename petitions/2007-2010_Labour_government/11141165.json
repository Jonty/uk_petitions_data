So many people are ripped off, and it needs to stop. Basically, the time of paying >\u00a3150 for a \u00a325 ticket need to end. \nWhat needs to happen, is the sale of tickets (above face-value) has to be made illegal on eBay. The sale outside event doors needs to be stopped and official return/resale facilities require setting up. Even a similar process as that used at Glastonbury Festival could be implemented.",
