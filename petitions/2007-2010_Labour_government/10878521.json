            "background": "There is once again a movement to remove the limited rights (under the Children Act 2004) allowed to parents to exercise moderate physical correction to their children. This is motivated by a doctrine that fundamentally believes that parents should have as little as possible to do with raising their children and that this should be left to 'experts' and the state. This doctrine is supported by pseudo-science that claims that such correction causes psychological damage to a child.\nParental authority has been severely undermined already and our society is suffering massive damage as a result. Children want and need clear boundaries. Loving, proportional but decisive correction is both appropriate and a duty of parenthood. Protection against excess is aready more than adequate. Generations of succesful parents can testify that children benefit from unambiguous guidance including, where necessary, an occasinal sharp spank. \nThe common sense of millions of parents must prevail over woolly 'politically correct' activists.",
