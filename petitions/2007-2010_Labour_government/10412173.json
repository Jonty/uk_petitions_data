            "background": "Five post offices in Luton are threatened with closure and this could have a very serious impact on people in the neighbourhoods affected. \n\nThe post offices earmarked for closure are located in Atherstone Road, Trinity Road, Biscot Road, Seymour Road and High Town Road. These post offices are the lifeblood of local communities and provide essential services in a friendly environment particularly for elderly people, from passport renewal and cashing benefits, to paying bills and collecting items ordered on-line.\n\nThe closure of post offices also undermines government policies about promoting the well-being of older people. Luton Borough Council is campaigning to ensure everyone knows what is happening and to encourage residents to speak up to save their local branches.",
