            "background": "Esentually the Government should consider setting its fuel duty tax at a level that maintains a fuel cost below 100p per litre for all vehicle fuel (whilst it is relistically possible due to fuel supplied cost) so that transport costs (which affects our every day lives, for example the cost of products on our shelves, etc) and stabilises inflation in general and allows the government to meet its inflation targets and ultimatly helps the consumer. The government will not find its tax raised, and thus services these funds support, reduced in any way. It will just be stable at the rate it was six months ago. In summery the govenrment wins on popularity and inflation targets as well as the benefit to the economy as a whole.",
