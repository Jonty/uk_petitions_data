        "background": "Tax Credits were suppose to make people better off, but instead they have made matters worse, because the advisors, didn't know the complex system of the benefits system. \n\nThis resulted in people having credits one minute and the next being taken away, and people having to pay back the tax credits which were suppose to be there to help. This has caused the most vulnerable people like myself to be left with a mountain of debt which causes so much stress.\n\nThe unfair part of this, if a claimant makes a mistake, they have to pay back what they owe, from previous years as well as the current year which is fair enough. \n\nHowever if it is the opposite way around and the Tax Office  has a get out clause. If Tax Office owe a claimant, from previous years, the claimant loses out, because the system doesn't allow the tax office compensate the claimant for hardship caused which is unfair by their mistake. Lets have a level playing field where both sides can have the same opportunity and give the people you promised help they deserve.",
