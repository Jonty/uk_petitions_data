        "background": "Royal Air Force Station Uxbridge is in the London Borough of Hillingdon. In the near future, RAF Uxbridge will close down and cause devastation to the many units currently based there. Some of the squadrons, including: 63SQN QCS, HQ Music Services, 1083 SQN ATC and many more, will have to be relocated due to this closure! Some of the units have already found a new home, but us at 1083 Squadron Air Cadets have not! For many years, 1083 Squadron has been proudly named as one of the BEST Squadrons in the entire Air Cadet Organisation! The Commanding Officer said \"Whether staying as a cadet or moving up the ranks and becoming staff, being a member of 1083 Squadron is one opportunity you don't want to miss.\" \nYou can find information about 1083 Squadron and the planned closure of RAF Uxbridge on the internet.",
