        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This purpose of this petition is to create a legislation wheras all major food outlets have to offer a fairtrade option on all basic food items, as stated on the CPI. \n\nAfter seeing the conditions that asian workers have to operate in in order to produce cheap food for the western world, and only get paid as little as 8 pence per hour, disgusts me.\n\nI also do take into account that you can only make a judgement on wages in relation to food and housing costs. The average wage for an asian worker in the food industry is around 500 baht per week, which equates to around \u00a39. This is spent in the order; \n\n- 400 baht per week for accomodation.\n- 100 baht per week for food.\n\nThis is clearly not enough for a human being to survive on, which is why I decided to start this petition. Introducing fairtrade options, where prices are set at a reasonable level above the usual price, and all the surplus filters back to the workers suffering these conditions. \n\nI do not want the workers to live a life of luxury, just to have a reasonable standard of living. I believe that the workers will also have this viewpoint.\n\nIf you have signed this petition, I thank you for your time and, of course, your signature.",
