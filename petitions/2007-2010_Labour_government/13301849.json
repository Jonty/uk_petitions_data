        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We think the imprisonment of Mr Guy Button is very unfair, disproportionate and unecessary. Guy was recently sentenced to 3 years in prison for obtaining his father's gun for him from his father's home and bringing it to him in hospital at his father's request. His father subsequently used it to commit suicide. Guy is a decent man and an inspirational music teacher to many pupils within Buckinghamshire.  The decision to sentence him seems wholly inappropriate to a case where he clearly acted through love and misguided loyalty to his father.  He has admitted his guilt but he poses no risk to society at large and detaining him is merely depriving many young children of a brilliant music teacher. We petition you to reopen his case and release him from prison to allow him to return and teach the children who value his talents so much.",
