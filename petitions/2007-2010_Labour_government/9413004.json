            "background": "after september 2008 new drivers will have to undergo 35 hours of training in order to get their licence. by 2013/2014 all psv and lgv divers will have to pay \u00a31200 every 5 years in order to keep there licence. we passed our test so i think this is proof enough. this will cause a shortage in psv/lgv drivers in the uk as nobody will be able to afford it. the government want people to use more public transport but we need drivers first and if it's not for lgv driver who provide food in our shops petrol in our cars this all helps the economy to go round. so please help to say no to this ludicrus bill on our livelyhoods.",
