        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Strangely there is two underground stations in London with the same name though there is more than enough reasons to rename one or both of the stations. Our request is to rename the \u2018Aldgate East\u2019 station to \u2018Brick Lane- Bangla Twon\u2019. Why so?\n\nBrick Lane is a place full of historic significance and well known throughout the world for many reasons. But in recent days it has been elevated to new height as the curry capital of London, the lane is cluttered with Bangladeshi restaurants serving traditional Bangladeshi/Indian sub continental food. People from everywhere visit here to satisfy their hunger for this traditional spicy food. Also every year the Bangladeshi community holds a big traditional Bangla Fair which is visited by thousands. Also the exit of the \u2018Aldgate East\u2019 is just by the Brick Lane, whereas Aldgate is at little distance. \n\nSo we request the PM, the Mayor of London and Transport of London (TFL) to Rename TFL Underground  Station \u2018Aldgate East\u2019 to \u2018Brick Lane- Bangla Town\u2019.",
