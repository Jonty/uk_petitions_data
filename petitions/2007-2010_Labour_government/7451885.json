We can't (apparently) afford decent medical treatment for people who need it, or homes for those who can't afford to buy their own, or any number of things ORDINARY people on low incomes need; the idea that people in the financial situation of the royal family need help from the government would be funny if not for the fact that not funding the things I've mentioned can have tragic consequences up to and including AVOIDABLE DEATHS!",
