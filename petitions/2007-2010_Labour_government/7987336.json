The loss off these businesses will detract from the character of the Saddleworth villages. Furthermore, this development is not supported by local residents. There are already 5 tesco stores within 8 miles of Greenfield. We do not need another, and the increased traffic it will bring. We call on the government to have this decision reversed.",
