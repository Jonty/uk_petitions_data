        "background": "Tesco have been granted planning permission to build a store in Greenfield, Saddleworth.\nThis store will seriously undermine local businesses, and may lead to their closure. The loss off these businesses will detract from the character of the Saddleworth villages. Furthermore, this development is not supported by local residents. There are already 5 tesco stores within 8 miles of Greenfield. We do not need another, and the increased traffic it will bring. We call on the government to have this decision reversed.",
