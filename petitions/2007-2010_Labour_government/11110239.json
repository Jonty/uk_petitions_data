What happened to that poor, innocent child is unexplainable. The social services and evryone involved with Baby P have failed that poor child..if they are allowed to carry on working with children similar to Baby P, this could be an ongoing viscous circle of tragic lives being selfishly taken.\n\nSo please show your support for Baby P, and stop this from happening in the future. Thank You.",
