        "background": "Gordon Brown denied that he had originally wanted to replace Alaistair Darling despite briefings all week by No 10 to journalists that Darling would be replaced.\n\nTom Bradby asked him twice and twice Brown refused to give a simple answer, as well as blatantly lying about his original intention. The turnaround was caused by Brown being so weakened that he could not carry out the move of Darling.\n\nGordon Brown invoked the memory of his father, his church upbringing and his own 'moral compass' and 'integrity' during the meeting - yet told the most brazen lie.\n\nAdmit an honourable journalist told the truth Mr Brown.",
