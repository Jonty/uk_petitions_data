This building is now complete.\n\nThe Government are now demanding \u00a3350,000 VAT as they're classing the building as an extension to the main building and because of this VAT is due.\n\nThe original building did not attract VAT as it's a \"Charity\" facility.\n\nRules on VAT don't have any flexibility for what is morally wrong!!! May be the MPs who have been morally wrong to abuse the expenses system can do something for a Charity that support terminally ill children to demonstrate they do know the difference between what is right and wrong!!!!!",
