            "background": "Dr. Benny Meilik, an emergency surgeon and consultant at the Tel Aviv Medical Center, had arrived in London on holiday the day before the attack with his wife and two children. They were in the Russell House Hotel, next door to the tube station.\nWhen the bomb went off in the deep underground tunnel, visitors at the hotel felt the tremor and heard the bang.\nMeilik told staff who he was and got down on to the platform, to which passengers were being led.\n\"The injuries were severe. I must have treated around 20 people. I was just running from person to person, doing all I could. Many were not in good shape at all,\" Meilik said.\nOne victim, who had two broken arms, emerged to tell reporters he had been helped by an \"Israeli hero.\"\nHis wife was then told to leave the hotel with her family without him. She did not know her husband was safe and fighting to save lives.\nFrom www.israel21c.org/social-action/israeli-doctor-touted-a-hero-on-bombed-london-tube",
