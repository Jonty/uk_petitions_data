            "background": "RAF Martlesham Heath is a former Royal Air Force airfield in England. The field is located 1\u00bd miles SW of Woodbridge, Suffolk.\nMartlesham Heath has now become an industrial and dormitory satellite of Ipswich and the four pre-war hangars and technical site buildings are now used for light industry and storage.\nNearby, on the old RAF parade ground, stands a memorial erected to the memory of those members of the 356th Fighter Group who lost their lives in World War II.\nPart of the site of the airfield now contains the main Headquarters building of the Suffolk Constabulary\n\nThe airfield is no longer active for civil flying and there have been a number of new developments on the site.\nI would like to see the site re-opened for civil flying. This would be very popular with aviation enthusiasts all over the whole country and it would really give a boost to the local area and to tourism.",
