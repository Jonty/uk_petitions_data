            "background": "A dog is no longer for life, but just for the weekend, with the launch of a 'rent a pet' service in the UK. \nAn American company, has already signed up 100 'part-time owners' in London, but the scheme has been criticised by animal charities, who said that such 'time-share' schemes are cruel to the dogs involved.A leading pet charity has said: \"When dogs are passed around, they may become confused, distressed and unpredictable.\" The Kennel Club added: \"The concept of renting out dogs as a \"timeshare\" equivalent is detrimental to the dog.\" Legislation has already been introduced in Boston,USA to ban companies like this from operating & we need to do this in the UK before the company expands further.Flying in the face of the Animal Welfare Act 2007,this is nothing but a 'four-legged escort service',devaluing all parties and promoting the whole concept of no commitment.",
