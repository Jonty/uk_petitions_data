            "background": "On the one hand this Government makes hollow claims about encouraging entrepreneurship, whilst at the same time punishes small business owners with an ever increasing tax burden.\n\nSmall business owners create employment and bear considerable risk.  Are they to get no reward for the years of stress and financial worry when they come to sell the business? Is the tax revenue they create through providing employment for others not enough?\n\nCurrent policy encourages mediocracy and penalises hard work. Why should anyone work hard to earn beyond the upper tax threshold?\n\nThis petition proposes the Government:\n\n- Scraps the introduction of 18% flat rate capital gains tax and reintroduces taper relief on the sale of assets held for 2+ years.\n\n- Reduces corporation tax for small businesses back to 19%\n\n- Consults with experienced small business owners prior to introducing policy",
