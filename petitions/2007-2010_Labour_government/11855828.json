        "background": "Geoff Dornan has been found guilty of dangerous skating after he was filmed rollerblading down the main street of Southport. we do not see this as something dangerous and he knows what he is doing. we believe that a charge of over 2000 pounds is a ridiculous amount of money to be fining an elderly gentleman who in our eyes has done nothing wrong. he has made an appeal to court as it is his right and we want to help him as much as possible.",
