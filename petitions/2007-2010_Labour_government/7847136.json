            "background": "The British government still does not recognise Taiwan as an independent sovereign nation.\n\nMostly this is because China threatens, bullies and bribes nations that recognise Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan is a major trading partner and has an excellent record on human rights and democracy, unlike China.\n\nThe British government should recognise Taiwanese sovereignty and establish full diplomatic relations.  If presented with an ultimatum by Beijing then the British government should favour Taiwan.",
