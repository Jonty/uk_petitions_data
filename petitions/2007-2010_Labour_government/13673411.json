            "background": "Basically, recent research has made shocking discoveries about the shortage of midwives and how womens care is put at jeopardy due to there being not enough staff. The nation is calling out for midwives, and yet there are extremely limited spaces on the courses at university! More spaces would mean more keen people could be qualified, resulting in the one to one care women deserve, resulting in less childbirth deaths, and more sufficient post-birth care. Please join this cause, as there are many people who would love to help, but don't get the chance.. many babies and their mothers have died from the lack of midwives, and it's about time we did something about it!",
