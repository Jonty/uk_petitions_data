            "background": "I propose and ask for your backing for 3 radical new changes to the UK Drink Driving Laws.\n\nNumber 1.  Zero tolerance.  Why should there be a limit?  If one is all you can have then surely it isn't needed.  Then there can be no error in Judgement.\n\nNumber 2.  The punishments are not severe enough and do not seem to get the message across.  With Zero tolerance, any alcohol detected that is relevant to that day should result in an instant six month ban and a large fine.  Any alcohol over a certain limit should result in a lifetime ban and possible sentencing and an even larger fine.\n\nNumber 3.  Finally, all passengers in cars of drink drivers should be given a fixed penalty of at least \u00a380.  I know some people will say thats not fair but knowingly getting in a car with a drink driver should be a crime. People may also say 'Well I didn't know he/she had had a drink!'  How unhappy would your mates be with you if they got hit with a fine?",
