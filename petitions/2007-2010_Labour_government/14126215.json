            "background": "Bullying has been endemic in British schools since their inception. It is one of the biggest causes of social disharmony and under achievement. It is time the government did its job and put a stop to it. No more ineffectual 'we are doing this', 'we are doing that'. We wish for a complete and instant solution without delay. If the government is not up to protecting its own nations children now, it genuinely is not fit for purpose by any definition. We demand an end to this intollerable situation without delay. This is one of the most important issues affecting this nations future. We beseech the government to put all necessary resources into finding a solution right away.",
