            "background": "I am lilly alex. I am staying in east ham. I have 2 kids. My daughter is doing her 1st year of GCSE. IF she go back to India she won't be able to study there. It's affecting her future and career. She is already depressed about this thing so is my son? Her teacher asked her why is she so sad and she told her the reason. She called me up yestersay and told me these things. She got more than level 6 for ever subjects for her sats exam. These rules are spoiling my daughter's life. YOu have to do something about it. We came here only for our children and now after hearing this my daughter cannot even concentrate on her studies. wE need her back. We pay tax without even missing a pence and still they are punishing us. We have never asked or any benefits or anything. We haven't cheated anyone in this country. We left everything in India and came here for our childrens education and Now eventhough we go back, there is nothing for us. We spent all our money we got here itself. It's too much for us to bear. it's a request not an order or anything..........MY CHILDRENS I DONT WANT TO SPOIL THEIR FUTURE. WE ARE ALIVE IN THIS WORLD JUST FOR THEM.",
