        "background": "In so many areas around our communities people have installed security lighting systems that are badly adjusted.\nPlease, Please Allow councils to force these people to adjust their lighting systems such that the light only falls within their property boundaries.\nIf they do not comply then severe fines should be imposed.\nIn my community some security lights, light up chimneys of houses across from their own back gardens on other properties. This is not acceptable, yet they have been like this for years. Please do something now.\nI would love to see the skies like they used to be, and not have others lights lighting up my upstairs rooms!",
