            "background": "to investigate fully the device called a tvt sling for incontinence which is being used in operations for women in the united kingdom. this device is over 14 inches long and is made of polyprolene and if complications arise from the sling coming away there is a lot of suffering as the mesh becomes embedded into healthy tissue which grows over it.\n\nin october 2008 the fda in america issued a health publication about this operation and the complications which can arise this has not been issued in this country.\n\ni myself had this operation in april 2006 and i have since found out that the plastic polyprolene is entwined around my bladder and embedded in other organs in the pelvic area and i was not told that this could happen.\n\nthis cannot go on and needs to be addressed.\n\nthis petition needs to exist to open up awareness to the public about the complications involved in the tvt sling operation. \n\nthe use of this device needs to be investigated and explored further in order to enable it to be safe when inserted into the human body.\n\nplease sign up to this petition in order for investigations to take place.\n\nthanking you\n\nteresa hughes",
