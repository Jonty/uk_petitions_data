            "background": "I'm totally amazed that my local air ambulance is struggling for funds, due to the recent increase in fuel costs. I believe the national lottery should fund all air ambulances. It's the peoples lottery and should be put to constructive use to save peoples lives. I'm sure it could easily help to fully fund the air ambulance country wide. Change policies so that the national lottery can save lives. Nothing else can be more worthwhile than saving a life.",
