        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Some mums want to work and bring their children up without a childcare facility. Mums should be given the opportunity to work more flexibly in any area of employment as many of us did before we had children. \nWe should be given the support and respect to be able to care for our own children and work whilst they are learning and not have to send them to a third party childcare environment.   I believe children benefit more from the stability of having a parent with them as often as possible. Children need their mums and we need them - they are not children for long.  For employees who would create such positions I think the government should offer them some kind of initiative - this could also benefit people who are coming upto retirement age who are shortening their work routines and they could fill in the gaps of school holidays!  Less benefits for the government to pay out, less funding for childcare, happier population and more importantly more secure and nurtured children.  It is also paving the way for mums to then join full time employment once their children have left school and not be in a position where they are without skills and experience and otherwise unemployable.",
