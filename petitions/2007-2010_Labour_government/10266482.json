All MP's should be within the same Tax structure as the general public and not a seperate, internally audited entity. We, the people, insist on a system of parity within the Public Tax system, and we insist on MP's not taking  advantage with \"special priviledges\" which seem to be only applicable to members of the Barr system, all MPs and the House of Commons. It is long overdue and we, the people, demand that MP's should be on par with the Public that they serve.",
