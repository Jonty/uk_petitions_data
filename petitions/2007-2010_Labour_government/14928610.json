        "background": "As far as most inhabitants of Dundee are aware, we do not hold much similarities with the city of Dubai. \nWe would like the opportunity to experience our cultural parallels by living in said city amongst our contemporaries in order to understand if they like onion pehs as much as we do.\nWe would also use this year long research trip to locate similar entertainment facilities such as the notorious Deja Vu and 24 hour bakery.\nThe reconnaissance mission would be very helpful to the development of both us as Dundonians and indeed the wider world.\nAs Dundonians we are rarely exposed to direct sunlight and therefore would expect you the Prime Minister to provide relatie sun blocking materials.\nWe will do you proud, Mr Brown, letting the Dubai-ins aware of our culture. We've heard that you're not allowed to drink much there, but we expect that a scotsman such as yourself will apply the relvant pressures to repeal this law before our arrival on Saudi soil.\nIt'll be a braw wee holiday!",
