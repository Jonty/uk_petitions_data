The economy has failed and public services are not delivering, despite massive injections of taxpayer funds since 1997.\n\nBoth Houses of Parliament have lost the trust of the electorate, through a series of scandals relating to expenses and payments in return for changed policies or honours.\n\nA fresh start is needed in 2009, not in 2010, in order to restore the UK to a strong position within Europe and the world.",
