Many are put off from moving because of the trauma that a house move brings.\n\nCould a package be made available to these people to help them to downsize and make available these family homes for familys.\n\nI am currently going through the process and have found it very stressfull.\n\nIn particular I was involved with a potential purchaser who kept me hanging in limbo for several months before pulling out of the deal.\n\nFrom my limited knowledge of it the Scottish System seems to have a lot to offer.\n\nBest Wishes in your new role.\n\nDerek Wiles",
