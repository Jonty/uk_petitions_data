            "background": "There has been so many cases of parental abuse to children in the UK gone un-noticed and we need centers to deal with it. Parents who abuse their children don't realise the negative impact it has on them. The centers should be able to help children, and also to do something about the parents like placing them in a correctional facility or seeking psychiatric help and there should be more help via phone other than childline which has a habit of putting children on wait. Alot of children have been caught by their abusive parents waiting for someone to pick up the phone and suffered more abuse for it. Please help.",
