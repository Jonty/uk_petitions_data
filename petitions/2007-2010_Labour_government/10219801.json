            "background": "We want to abolish London (Heathrow) to Paris (CDG) and London to Brussels flights in favour of a carbon neutral Eurostar train journey. These train tickets cost very nearly the same (under \u00a310 more expensive and in some cases cheaper). These journeys are from city centre to city centre. So there is no travelling outside of the cities to the airports incuring a bigger carbon footprint. The Eurostar London-Paris and London-Brussels routes should also be given a IATA rating allowing British Airways and SN Brussels airlines to withdraw their air services between the cities.",
