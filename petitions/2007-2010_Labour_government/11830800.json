            "background": "Dear Sir\n\nI am sure I am not alone in wanting to ask for some clemency to allow Jade and her fiance Jack Tweedy to be allowed to spend their wedding night together - not entirely for Mr Tweed's benefit, but for that of Jade herself.\n\nI lost my 17-year-old nephew to cancer and the cutting short of a young life is almost unfathomable in its cruelty.\n\nI appreciate fully that Mr Tweed has committed and been found guilty of a serious criminal act and that his punishment includes his punative curfew.  I am aware also that there are doubtless many more private individuals dealing with the same situation affecting Ms Goody and Mr Tweed.\n\nHowever, should I ever have the misfortune to find a member of my own family in the same position, I would be making a similar plea on their behalf.\n\nI appreciate that mine is only a single request; however, I have been so affected and deeply saddened by Jade's predicament that I respectfully ask for your consideration in this tragic matter.\n\nMany thanks.",
