        "background": "Currently the Department for Transport ask airport security staff to make parents or guardians of babies open and test baby food and milk.\nNo other European country asks for this when taking baby food through an airport as long as the jar or carton is still sealed. \nIn doing this the DFT are making it increasingly hard to travel with babies. Baby food and milk should be used within 2 hours once opened if not chilled and as the parents have then test the food it is not sterile.",
