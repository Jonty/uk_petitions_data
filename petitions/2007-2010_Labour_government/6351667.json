            "background": "Manufacturers of devices requiring DC power - mobile phones and electronic games - deliberately create a plethora of different power connectors in order to tie in customers. This means every time you buy a new phone or game, you have to throw away the charger, which is  also bad for the environment. This is an area where legislation is needed to protect consumer interests. An act of parliament should be passed creating a standard committee whose approval would be needed for the introduction of any new style of connector. The manufacturer would be required to demonstrate that existing permitted designs would not meet the need of their product. The committee would also be responsible for maintaining the list of approved designs  with the remit of reducing the list year-on-year. Here \"design\" refers to the combination of voltage level and physical shape.",
