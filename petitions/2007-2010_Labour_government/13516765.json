            "background": "Recently, a friend's daughter was subjected to a tirade of constant harassment, blackmail, bullying and ID theft across the Internet by an individual on Facebook and other social media and as a result she became suicidal. \n\nAs the individual concerned, was based overseas, the police have indicated that they cannot deal with it as it is out of their jursidiction. \n\nObviously, having been within IT management for many years, I know that there is no global legislation to combat this new area of crime as Interpol only deals with serious crime and social media abuse is not considered a serious crime. \n\nPlease support this petition to protect our citizens from social media/networking abuse committed by overseas citizens.",
