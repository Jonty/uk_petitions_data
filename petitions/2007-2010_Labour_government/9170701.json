        "background": "At the moment, the PE practical exam is based on four sports, all assessed by the teacher.  Two teachers assess a class of around 30 students, however I feel that this is unfair, as there is no way that the teacher can give an accurate representation of your skill and technique in that particular sport if she has to also watch 29 other students.  \n\nIn addition, in a mixed ability group, your skill and ability cannot be shown correctly.  If you take four students for example, playing netball - two of whom are of the same average ability, one is excellent and the other is below average - the average student 'marking' the excellent student is going to seem worse at netball than the average student 'marking' the student of lower ability.  It is rather hard to explain this theory but I hope I've made it pretty clear.\n\nFinally, I feel that you shouldn't be marked on your fitness.  Surely you should gain marks based upon the effort you put in and the skill and ability you possess, as not everybody has excellent stamina, strength, endurance etc.",
