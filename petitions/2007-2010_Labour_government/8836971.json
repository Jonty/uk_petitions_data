            "background": "Having kept tropical fish for many years now its great when i walk into a local fish shop [LFS] and see well kept fish in good sized tanks and most of all being served by staff who actually know the in's n out's of fishkeeping. The number of staff out there that are purely out for a quick buck is quite sickening, knowing fish purchased from these pet stores are going to suffer and die a slow death. Other animals like dogs and cats have all the protection in the world and so they should, with homes and owners having numerous checks, so why do fish seem to be totally forgotten, its such a shame as these can be some of the greatest pets you could want, so all you fish keepers out there please sign up and help this small but good cause.",
