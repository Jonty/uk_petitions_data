            "background": "Melbourne Post Office has been earmarked for closure, this will have a devastating effect on our village, a village that has been marked for development by East Riding Council. A shop is attached to the Post Office which will probably close if the Post Office goes. \n\nThe Government is preaching \"Get out of your cars and onto public transport\" well this hardly exists through the village of Melbourne and if the Post Office is closed people will have to GET INTO THERE CARS AND DRIVE 5 MILES EACH WAY to get to a Post Office, this is contrary to the Govermnets plan to cut Co2 Emissions. \n\nPeople will no longer want to move to this village, who will want to buy a house where there is no shop or Post Office, and no way of getting to one.\n\nThis decision along with the decision to close other rural Post Offices needs to be stopped now, before we allow our villages to become like our City Centres, where nobody goes, because there is nothing there for them.\n\nThe People of Melbourne call on the Government to consider the effect this will have on our community. Dont allow the Post Office to isolate our villages simply as a cost cutting exercise, the cost to the community is far greater than the money saved",
