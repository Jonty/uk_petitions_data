            "background": "Recently a friend was knocked off his bike by a driving instructor and, in a separate accident, my father was injured in a crash caused by an off-duty policeman. Accidents happen on our roads and in other areas of life, even though the guilty have every intention of avoiding them and would normally go out of their way to prevent them.\n\nNo one is perfect and our brains can play tricks on us, as is shown by numerous psychological tests. It is not just a matter of concentrating harder, but context and distraction can play a role in how we react.\n\nPrison sentences are handed down based on the consequences of these accidents, yet the injuries sustained are a matter of luck: does the victim hit something hard or something soft? Are they on a bike or in a car? Do they live or die?\n\nIt is usually clear that the perpetrators of these accidental crimes wanted to avoid them, if for no other reason than they were likely to sustain losses themselves (injuries, financial and, sometimes, damaged careers).\n\nI propose that sentencing should reflect the INTENT of the crime rather than its consequences, and that expensive prison sentences should be avoided for accidental crimes.",
