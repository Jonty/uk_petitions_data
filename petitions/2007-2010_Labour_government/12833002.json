            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "For more than a decade, the media and government has used video games and movies as a scapegoat for the problems of violence in the world.\nHowever, the persecution of these media is based on acts of horrendous violence by already disturbed people.\nThe PEGI system wrongly assumes that the general public suffer from some form of mental disorder that will see them launch into a frenzied attack on their fellow man at the slightest provocation.\nAlso, use of PEGI would do irrevocable harm to the anti-piracy measures already in place. If a 15 year old can\u2019t buy a game because it\u2019s classified 16+ then they will simply download the game from bittorrent networks.\nSo we heartily petition the government to dismiss the PEGI system as discriminative and rather than have a board of non-gamers deciding what content is appropriate for whom, we have a panel of citizens from all sides to decide on the BBFC classification of games and movies and should at least consist of gamers, game developers and parents.",
