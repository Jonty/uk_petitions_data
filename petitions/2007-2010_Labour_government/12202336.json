            "background": "This race has to be banned.Its a race which pushes the horses beyond their natural instincts and abilities,all for people to get rich,and in the name of sport.\nThe fences are too high.The horse approaches the fence,not realising the drop on the other side is often double in height,more in fact.This is a peaceful,law abiding petition,giving people a voice for the horses welfare.\nA lot of people think the horses enjoy it, because they keep racing even when their jockey has been un-seated.This is so far from the truth,the horses are herd animals,they just want to stay with the other horses.\nIts all about money at the end of the day,as with so many things involving the abuse of animals.None of the horses benefit,only the owners,trainers,the brewery,the catering companies,and last but not least,the owners of Aintree.Please sign this peaceful petition,and speak up for the horses,they cant speak for themselves !!",
