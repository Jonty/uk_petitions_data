            "background": "All over the world, but particularly in china, animals are being beaten,tortured,skinned alive, and eventually killed in inhumane ways.\nThere is no problem in killing animals HUMANELY then skinning them or sending them to be processed and eaten. But the problem is, people are using it as a sport, torturing the animals and then skinning them alive. Something has to be done. And the undersigned would like to ask the priminister to speak with the leaders of these countreis, and also help make changes within the EU to make sure good regulations are set out AND kept in effect to protect these animals.\nAnimals are not just \"dumb creatures\" they do FEEL this pain. How would you feel if it was you being skinned alive, im sure you wouldnt take kindly to people assuming you didnt feel it and it didnt matter.\nSOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE.",
