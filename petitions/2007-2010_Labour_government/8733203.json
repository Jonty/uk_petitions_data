            "background": "The current capital in London is anything but central to the rest of the United Kingdom. Situated in the far South East of the country it is not even centrally located in terms of the United Kingdom. If the government were to move the capital including parliament, the Royal Courts of Justice and the Queen's official residence to Chorley, Lancashire - the capital of the nation would be truly centrally located for the benefit of all it's people. Situated along the M61 and within minutes of the West coast mainline Chorley is strategically placed along the country's busiest transport corridoor. Furthermore, the town of Chorley is ideally located to be the Capital of the United Kingdom due to it's proximity to Wales and Scotland (this will eliminated the alienation felt by some in those countries). The move will also assist in combatting the feeling that the UK is run entirely by the South-East of England. In addition, the people of the regions will feel as if they are more recognised by government - and government will be more accessible to the people. There is no humour intended with this petition",
