        "background": "Officials do not paint areas with double-yellow lines, creating a no-parking zone for any amount of time - for any reason, without cause. Too often police officers walk or drive by situations where one parked on a double-yellow line, and the officer walks or drives by as if there is no offence. Too often, accidents result as one person involved in a vehicular accident could not see around a curve because of a car parked on a double-yellow line - thusly zoned because parking there obscures view.",
