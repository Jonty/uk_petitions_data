        "background": "To stop the \"database\" state; to stop the government forming a constitution of communism by closing ranks on its own citizens.\nThe government is more wanting cctv on every street corner, every shop, pub, you name it, they want ID cards, they have ANPRS (to monitor and log for 5years the location and travel details of every vehicle on the roads) to log txt msg's, phone calls, net use, trolling sites such as Facebook, the police's use of \"intelligence gathering\", council spying laws, you name it, every bit of detail is under pry and logged, the censorship of any story the political regime does not want published, and I believe it is time we petitioned to have it all abolished, in place of our freedom, civil liberties and human rights.\nThe government is just pressing on, ignoring what the population is saying, for their own self thought ideals and profits, using terrorism and extremism as an excuse to push it through, they create the fear more so than the terrorists, in order that we bow to them.\nWe must stop this controlling aspect of our lives, and live in civil democracy, not under pin point control and monitoring regimes, all at the hands for people in power to abuse.",
