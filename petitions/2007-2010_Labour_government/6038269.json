            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, many night clubs have no facility to cope with smokers.\n\nVulnerable women leave drinks unattended whilst leaving clubs to smoke outside as they are not allowed to take their drinks with them. On their return, drinks have been spiked or stolen.\n\nSpiked drinks result in date rape. Non-alchoholic drinks left by drivers also get spiked and result in road accidents where the driver is not to blame. The new law is a danger both to smokers and to non smokers and to any and all road users. Who knows what will have happened to your drink when you return?\n\nThe obvious suggestion is to allow an area in which people may smoke but also take their drinks. My suggestion would be to allow nightclubs with multiple levels to have one floor upon which people may smoke. Non smokers need not go to this level.\n\nThe current rushed implementation of the smoking ban has not taken into consideration the dangers to individuals and could result in date rape, road accidents, theft and in severe cases, death. Crime rates will rise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the government could create grants for smaller clubs to create a smoking area into which drinks may be taken? Currently many can not afford to do this.",
