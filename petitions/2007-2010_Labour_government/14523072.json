            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The cost of running public transport vehicles has increased dramatically over recent years.  This applies to all forms of public transport including taxis, buses, coaches and community transport.  Yet these vehicles provide a real (and greener) alternative to private vehicle ownership for many and should be encouraged.\n\nA similar reduction in fuel duty should apply to commercial vehicles used for public benefit e.g, road gritters, refuse collection, ambulances etc. that are paid for out of local authority budgets.  This would make a significant difference to the expenses of local authorities that are struggling to balance budgets, especially in rural areas.",
