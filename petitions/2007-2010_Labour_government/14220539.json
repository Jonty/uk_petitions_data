            "background": "Britain is working on tough emissions curbs in the future.\nWith population said to be going to reach 70 million by 2020, this is laughable.\nEmissions are proportionate to people.\nWhether CO2 is rising is debatable, and there is much info to show the whole thing is a fabrication.\nHow can they then cut emissions, yet add millions more people to consume more and emit more?\nIts illogical and non-sensical.\nSo, curb emissions simply by stopping population growth.\nQuite how economic growth and increased consumption square with planned reduction also baffles me, seems like the only thing is reduce consumption.\nSo, petition is for curbing population growth and finding a new economy  not based upon growth, ie more and more consuming every year, do we need to buy more and more?",
