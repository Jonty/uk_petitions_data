Whereby Local Councils, and Residents in the nearby vicinity to such sites must be notified in writing, prior to the issuing of such Licences. Not as the current law states to advertise in a local paper whereby Councils or residents have no suitable notification, i.e never see the advertisement and can therefore make no suitable objection. To prevent such Operators using sites without planning permissions, i.e Councils to be notified of such sites, prior to granting of Licence.",
