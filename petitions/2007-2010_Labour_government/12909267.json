            "background": "chicken pox kills roughly 25 adults a year and between 4 and 8 children. it is seen as a fairly mild illness that actually has numerous complications resulting in thousands of hospitalizations each year. i am aware that they will hopefully be introducing the chicken pox vaccination on the nhs eventually but i am also aware that they wish to booster this with the mmr. we do not want this. mothers are already scared of the mmr vaccination and as so we would like the chicken pox vaccination offered seperately. there must also be a booster available when children are about 12 to avoid the complications of catching shingles when you are older.",
