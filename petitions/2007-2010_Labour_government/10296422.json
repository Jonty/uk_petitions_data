            "background": "It is apparent from news reports that the UK Government is making sweeping commitments to the G8 with regard to giving money to 'poor' nations, 'climate change', vehicle usage, etc.  I would propose that as these sweeping commitments affect every individual within the UK that they should be put to a referendum in order for the people to decide.  A lot of these commitments were NOT current government manifesto policy at the last general election and therefore they should be voted on individually via a series of referendums.",
