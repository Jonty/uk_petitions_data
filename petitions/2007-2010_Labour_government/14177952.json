            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The proposition is that every citizen be allowed to cultivate sufficient herbal marijuana for their own use. As well as being only right and fair this would also take away from organised criminals, both foreign and domestic, a substantial amount of their income. Putting the means of Marijuana production in the hands of socially responsible adults would make it far less likely that vulnerable people would come into contact with it or that demand for it could be used to fund organised criminal activity.",
