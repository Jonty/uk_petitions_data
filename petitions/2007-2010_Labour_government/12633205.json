            "background": "Okay, I'm going to be very blunt, I'm speaking for millions of smokers when I say the tax rises are literally making tobacco inaccessible to people on low incomes. I'm not sure if that was the Governments agenda but It's really making many people struggle.\n\nI pay \u00a36.02 for 20 of my cigarettes.\nDo you not think that is enough for the time being? \n\nIf tobacco sales stop, where will the government recieve its revenue? \nThe ban on smoking inside pubs has nearly killed the pub industry.\n\nSmokers cannot smoke indoors anymore, buying tobacco requires ID for those who look under 25 making underage tobacco consumption greatly reduced, what's the problem?\n\nWhy does the government desperately feel the need to stop me from smoking? I'm fully aware of the risks, its written on every packet of cigarettes I purchase.\n\nIf the government feels so sour about people who smoke recieving free treatment from the NHS, ban smokers from recieving free medical care.\n\nIf smokers wish to pollute their bodies with carcinogenic substances that are destroying their health and nobody elses, thats our choice.",
