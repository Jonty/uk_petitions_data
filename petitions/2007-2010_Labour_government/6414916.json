        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The khat use has become so wider spreed in the immigrant countries and crippling them in so many ways. Khat is associated with psychological disorder, family break downs and relationship problems, high unemployment, pysical health problems such as heart problems, mouth cancer and liver problems. \nKhat has also recently appeared to have become a host for the sale and distribution of other hard drugs. It is not good for the environment as it creates a lot lof rubbish that are thrown in the streets and it keeps its users from integrating with the wider society. One of the community that Khat has so badly affected is the somali community and it is evident that other somali communities living in countries where khat is banned have integrated better.",
