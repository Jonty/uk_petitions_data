        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Some mortgage companies are charging in excess of 4% above base rate on variable rate mortgages.  Many variable rate customers are being hit hard and told that their rate is not dependent upon the Bank Of England base rate or the Libor rate.  This amounts to loan sharking.  \n\nThe only way to stop this is to regulate the amount above bank base rate they can charge.\n\nThe FSA and Banking Ombudsman can do nothing.  \n\nFamilies are being forced out of their homes because of this.",
