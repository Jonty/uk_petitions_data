        "background": "Sir Keith Park, Commander of 11 Group, Fighter Command, RAF - Battle of Britain, 1940. As Marshal of the Royal Air Force, Lord Tedder, said of Sir Keith Park to his peers in February  1947, \"If any one man won the Battle of Britain, he did. I do not believe it is realised how much that one man, with his leadership, his calm judgement and his skill, did to save, not only this country, but the world.\" \n\nSir Keith Park, a New Zealander, commanded the Royal Air Force 11 Group Fighter Command \u2013 the squadrons which bore the brunt of the Battle of Britain.  The failure of Nazi Germany to defeat the RAF in 1940 was Hitler\u2019s first major setback \u2013 and forced him to call off his planned invasion of Britain.  So it would be a fitting tribute to Park\u2019s leadership that a statue of him should be erected on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square beneath Nelson \u2013 another British hero who defended our nation\u2019s freedom in her hour of need - and alongside others\nwhose military skill, foresight, leadership and prowess has been remembered.",
