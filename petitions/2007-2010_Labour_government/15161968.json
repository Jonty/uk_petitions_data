        "background": "After a meeting was called about the HS2 Groups proposal to route a new High Speed Rail Link through some of the most beautiful countryside in England, which is from London to Birmingham, 500 people crammed into Brackley Town Hall to protest about these plans. They are just a very small proportion of what will become a tidal wave of opposition to this route from all those people now blighted by this proposed rail link, as well as those who value the British Landscape.",
