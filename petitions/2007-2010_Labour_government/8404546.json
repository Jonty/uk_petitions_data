If I were to visit a person in prison who was being held for extradition on alleged terrorist offences, I would be insisting that the interview was taped for my own sake. Do MPs visit all the constituants that are in prison or just particular ones ? We need far more open government. Politicians should account properly for every penny they receive just as people in the REAL world have to.",
