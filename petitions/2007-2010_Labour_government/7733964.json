            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The collapse of the sub prime mortgage market is another example of banks being allowed to market substandard investment products without being held accountable for lack of due diligence or reasonable care with regard to the robustness of the underlying investment. The FSA should faciltate investors wishing to take legal recourse against the promoting banks should their investment products prove to be wholly unsatisfactory, as in the cases of packaged subprime mortgage bonds, CDO's, Argentinian bonds issued just before default etc. Why should banks be generally immune from product liability, when car manufacturers, retailers and service providers are held liable for defects and short comings in their products?",
