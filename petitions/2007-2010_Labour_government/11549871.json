            "background": "I am fed up of with seeing NHS and other Nurses and staff going to the shops in Uniform, they then go on to treating people with severe illnesses in NHS hospitals and clinics,as well as the private sector.\nThe patients are at a low state of infection control themselves due to not having enough antibodies to fight infection.\nThis also can cause cross infection on wards, as well as leaving the people and staff in the shops at risk. Most NHS authorities ban this use of uniforms, outside of work, but its not enforced, this is a problem that needs to be dealt with if we want to see an end to killer viruses like MRSA taking more lives.",
