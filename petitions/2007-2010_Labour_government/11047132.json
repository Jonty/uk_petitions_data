            "background": "The current procedure were social workers visit parents of children who have been placed on the 'At Risk Register\u2019 to assess and identify possible signs of abuse relies on a social worker carrying out visual assessments of the child and verbal questioning of the parents who maybe prone to 'lie, collude & deceive' in order to hide the true nature of their Children\u2019s \u2018inflicted injuries\u2019, I would like parents of children who have been placed on the 'At Risk Register' in addition to routine social worker visits take mandatory polygraph tests by phone on a weekly basis, not to prove guilt of abuse of their children but to be used in addition to existing control measures as an early indicator to the possibility of child abuse, this would enable earlier investigation and intervention by social services.",
