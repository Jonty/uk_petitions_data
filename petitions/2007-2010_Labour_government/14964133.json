Whilst denying that when this ridiculous debacle started, the service me and women got none and bought there own boots.\n\nI am amazed that any one in the recent visit actually wanted to shake your hand.\n\nIf you want the confidence of the public, stop evading questions, lying, misleading and being evasive.\n\nAdmit that you were not elected, get rid of Meedelson.\n\nVery soon it might get through that most people loath you, do not believe a word you say, have never heard you give a straight answer to a simple question.\n\nYou are todays Baron Munchausen.\n\nWhy can't you see how hated you are ??\nOr are you like Cowell, Lleweln-Bowen, Michael Winner or Gordon Ramsey... So far up yourself that you can only look down on others.",
