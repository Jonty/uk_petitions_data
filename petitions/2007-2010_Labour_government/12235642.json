Without the Pill, half of the month, I would be in bed riddled with pain and feeling light headed all of the time.\n\nEvery 24 weeks, I have to get a new 24 weeks worth from the doctor. I cannot get a repeat prescription, but have to book an appointment. I am feeling that I am wasting that appointment and could have been used on a patient that needs a doctor's help and advice more than me. \n\nI think that if a woman patient has been on the pill for longer than 2 years, then they should have the right to have a repeat prescription. If they are suffering from side effects of the Pill etc, then that's the time to visit them.",
