In particular we would like to see newspapers who use these words, especially when in used in headlines that imply bigoted opinions based on speculation and 'tarring everyone with the same brush', to be fined  with the money then going towards charities that help with school support for romany children and to fund access to the internet for them on sites to give them the educational advantage their peers have and to help broaden their opportunities in life.",
