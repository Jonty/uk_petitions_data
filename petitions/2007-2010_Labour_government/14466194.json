            "background": "In light of recent global airport security breaches, isn't it about time that aviation security officers were treated and paid as professionals? Currently Aviation Security Officers work for near minimum wages because of the need to maximise profits by the airports and companies responsible for providing airport security. This needs to change either by forcing a minimum wage for this position or by taking the responsibility out of private hands.",
