            "background": "You\u2019ve only got to look at the rabbit hutch estates built in the 60s in London, Manchester, Glasgow etc to see the effect of overdevelopment of an area with an over reliance on rented property.  I admit that the majority of social housing renters are good and decent people, but long-term recipients of benefits are responsible for a higher ratio of crime and drug abuse and are more likely to be in rented accommodation.\n\nFor the sake of the decent and law abiding majority, please regulate percentages of rental properties permitted in one area and cap the housing benefit to no more than 10% of property in each 1 mile radius of private rentals and 25% of social housing rentals.  \n\nPlease consider protecting those in rented accommodation by requiring all landlords to register with their local council before letting a property.  The properties could then be independently inspected and \u2018licensed\u2019 to ensure rogue landlords are not cramming inhumane levels of people into ill equipped and unsuitable premises.",
