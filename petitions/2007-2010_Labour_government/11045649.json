        "background": "Recently there have been hints about the P.M. thinking of reducing taxes. I think it is now time that those who are in full-time employment but with no young family, receive no family tax credits, who receive no benefits or help of any kind but are still only on relatively modest wages, start to be treated fairly.  We are the ones who never receive anything from this government (in fact it is only recently that our income tax was raised!!!!).  Week in week out we work hard only to see our real income getting lower and lower.  Now it is time for us ALL to get a fair deal! If not this budget then definitely the next.",
