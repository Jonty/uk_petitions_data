Government whips' aim is to manipulate, by any legal means, the way in which their party requires their party members to vote and against, if necessary, their constituents' interests, instructions or their own consciences. This practice should be illegal in the way that it is illegal to 'jury tamper' or, more generally to interfere with the course of justice. MPs are elected to vote by their constituents and for their constituents. If this statute is introduced then MPs will be free to vote as instructed by their constituents thereby properly involving the public in the process of government.",
