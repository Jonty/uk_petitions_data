Recently Burma has seen massive peaceful protests from Monks and ordinary citizens alike, despite this the Junta has cracked down and begun the murder of the peaceful protesters.\n\nWhen an emergency session of the UNSC was called - China blocked Sanctions against the Junta.\n\nI feel that it is Immoral and unjust that China be able to benefit from western economies and obtain money that would come from the Olympic games they are due to host.\n\nI call on the British government to boycott the '08 Olympic games in response to this disgraceful situation.",
