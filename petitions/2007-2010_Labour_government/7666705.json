        "background": "This would be done in controlled environments, possibly through the NHS, called \"shooting galleries\" where drugs are not glamorised or seen as rebellous, with a strict restriction on supply: an addict would get what they need and they would have to consume it there and then.\n\nThis is not the same as legalisation as that would legitimise the drugs trade, but we have to be realistic about the fact that people will experiment and that many addicts use their habit to deal with crippling emotional problems and traumas. \n\nBy denying drug dealers in being able to profit from peddling the worst substances, there would be no profit in pushing the worst substances and over time there would be fewer addicts and less drug-fueled crime.\n\nGovernment policy only creates criminals  it does nothing to help society.",
