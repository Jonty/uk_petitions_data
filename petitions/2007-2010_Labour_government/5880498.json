            "background": "Combine married couples taxable allowance at each tax band, in order to reduce tax burden when only one parent is in employment. Currently if the spouse stays at home to look after their children, the wage earner does not receive any benefit, their income is still taxed at the same rate. Of course it is the higher earner that returns to work, and therefore attracts the higher rates of income tax. By combining the tax thresholds at each tax band would assist parents in this situation",
