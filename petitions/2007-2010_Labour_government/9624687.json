            "background": "We demand that the government does not increase road tax for band F cars.  This ludicrous idea takes no account of the fact that for many changing their car is no longer an option due to the credit crunch.  It takes no account that for the majority they do not buy new cars, it takes no account that families are already suffering from high taxes, increasing fuel costs, increasing food costs and wage increases below inflation.  Hitting the motorist is not the answer.",
