            "background": "We feel that the government should implement an increased penalty scheme for dangerous driving , and allow police to have more power to enforce harder penalties on a case by case basis. This would allow situations where arbitary speeding fines could be dissmissed if situation was found to be not dangerous, or if the circumstances meant there was no way of avoiding speeding, but at same time implement more penalties for people who deliberately and wrecklessly break the law in a dangerous and life threatening manner.",
