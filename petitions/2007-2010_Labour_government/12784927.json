They came back abnormal CIN3 to which I responded with utter panic and was told I needed an urgent colposcopy.  The waiting time for this being 6-8 weeks then I discovered the waiting time for results is 6weeks and upwards.  I ended up paying private but many people who cannot afford it have found jo's trust and are supporting each other through the wait.  The government need to do something about this to have  a potential waiting time of 3 months to be told you have severe precancereous changes or worse in simply unacceptable. Thsi is such an emotive issue and many woman are suffering as a result of this wait.  FIX IT!",
