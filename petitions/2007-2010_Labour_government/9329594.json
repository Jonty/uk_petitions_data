            "background": "The petitioner is writing in support of the inquiry - and calling for a review of the right of armed police to shoot at all in public places. Seven bullets is an awful lot - please decide if the British constabulary has a shoot to stop OR shoot to kill policy against peaceful citizens.\n\nThe petitioner is asking that the inquiry uses this opportunity to address flaws identified with current anti - terrorism measures to support the police - but remind custodians (those charged maintaining the peace and with protecting the public) that people are  innocent till proven guilty.\n\nWe support you in this but urge you to carry out your duties as peacefully as possible.\n\nWe also agree, however, that Police officers should be allowed anonymity when they give evidence will also be considered in order to balance the request for justice from the public, the victims' relatiives and the CPS. \n\nPS I feel I cannot sign the DE - MENEZES petitions, because a formal inquiry has not yet decided that the killing was \"unlawful\".",
