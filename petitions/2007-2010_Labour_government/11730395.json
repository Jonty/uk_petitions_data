            "background": "It is not possible to understand how a politician can publicly be in favour or two diammetrically opposed principles.  Gordon Brown says we should stay in the EU at whatever the cost and then goes on the state a policy which is illegal and THEN he personally suffers deeply damaging criticism from his so called colleagues who lead other EU member states.  This is total confusion which he needs to explain to those of us who believe that the ONLY reason this country is in the EU is for the personal benefit of the elected membership of the HofC (excluding Mr Brown, of course, who has yet to be voted for by any single member of the population now being most badly affected by his actions - the English).",
