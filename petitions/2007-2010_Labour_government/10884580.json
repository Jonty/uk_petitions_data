Given this once proud nation is almost bankrupt I feel it is a perfect opportunity to expand her majesty domains, Iceland could be bought at a bargain price; this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase the country that brought us Bjork, Magnus Magnusson and Puffin Pie. \n\nWhy wait, buy Iceland today!",
