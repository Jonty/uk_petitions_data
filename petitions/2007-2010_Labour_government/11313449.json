Ending the occupation of Gaza only served to increase attacks from there, so clearly \u2018ending occupation' isn't the key to solving the problem.\n\nAnd not fighting terror is ineffective since the Palestinian terror continues.\n\nCan the gov\u2019t clarify what exactly is proportionate: \nShould Israel dispatch a suicide bomber to a Palestinian civilian target after a Palestinian suicide terror attack on an Israeli civilian target? \nShould Israel launch rockets indiscriminately on Palestinian civilian locations after Palestinian rocket attacks?\nShould Israel ensure an equal number of Israeli and Palestinian casualties?\n\nIf the UK can do a better job of fighting Islamic terrorists \u2018proportionately\u2019 then it is most welcome to come and help Israel.",
