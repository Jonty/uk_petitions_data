            "background": "UK communications minister Lord Carter has drafted new regulations that will require ISPs to warn customers suspected of sharing copyrighted material, that they are acting illegally. Furthermore, ISPs will have to hand over details of repeated infringers to the entertainment industry and other rights holders.\n\nTo enact such a system the Internet Service Industry will be forced to examine the data that its customers transmit and receive on the internet.   Due to the many legitimate uses of file sharing (such as the transfer of extremely large operating system installations) it would not be possible for an ISP to just look for types of data, they will be forced to examine the information more closely. This is surely a massive breach of privacy and personal liberty and should therefore be rejected out of hand.\n\nFurthermore we demand that legislation be put into place to protect the privacy and freedom of those using the internet.",
