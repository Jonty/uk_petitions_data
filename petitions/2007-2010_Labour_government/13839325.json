            "background": "as the removal of Professor Nutt from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs  is an outrage to evidence based policy that the government claim to support, please reinstate his position as Chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs with immediate affect. The decision to sack him is a knee jerk reaction of media influence that has cast this government in a very bad light and totally undermines the respect of freedom of speech.",
