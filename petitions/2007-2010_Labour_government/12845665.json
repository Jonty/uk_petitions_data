            "background": "Many M.P's have wrung out every possible penny in expenses. We know how amoral many of these claims appear.   I urge M.P's - consider the contrast with our Armed Forces.  Our brave men and women have to Pay as They Dine - every portion of vegetables paid for separately.  Many do not use PAYD as fast foods are cheaper but have  less nutritional value.  MP's do not have such concerns. Even their snacks are paid for by taxpayers.   Armed Forces face danger with equipment that is out of date, not fit for purpose.  Our MP's do not have such concerns, with ipods & multiple camera purchases.    Armed Forces can serve abroad for up to seven months and do not have rest period entitlement between tours.  Our MP's do not have such concerns - they have second home allowances if it is too far to travel.  Our Armed Forces have to use washing facilities which bear warning signs of asbestos on the walls.  Our MP's do not have such concerns - they can submit a claim to refurbish.\nOur Armed Forces do the bidding of our elected M.P's ......putting their lives on the line for our safety.\nI urge all MP's to consider the contrast between what they have and what our Armed Forces endure and to exercise probity accordingly.",
