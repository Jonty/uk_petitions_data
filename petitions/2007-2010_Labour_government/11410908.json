        "background": "I am well aware that this country operates under a representative democracy, but believe it is hardly necessary to abolish all hereditary peers from the House of Lords and in doing so, destroy a tradition and a value that predates anyone who suggests it is worthless. Birth right is something that cannot be avoided, and are a quintessential part of this nation. Please do not so easily brush away those who have dedicated their lives to this country, just because they happened to be born into a ranking family. The executive and the Commons monopolize the power anyway, they do not need to create a duplicate House. Peerage is about duty, and it is well served.",
