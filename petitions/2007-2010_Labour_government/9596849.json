        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently almost all motorbikes are petrol engined and for a learner or light motorcycle you are restricted to 125cc and 14.6hp even though higher categories only use power and power to weight limits.\n\nHowever there is growing interest in old diesel motorbikes and diesel conversions, and even some new bikes being developed for the military and even commercial sale.\n\nBut anyone wanting to take advantage of the massive fuel economy of the diesel bikes, and even run them on waste vegetable oil, has to learn on a petrol bike of up to 125cc and 14.6hp, even though the diesel bike they want to ride, though it might be 500cc, will produce less than 10hp!\n\nThis is putting unnecessary roadblocks into the path of anyone wanting to take up Diesel motorcycling.\n\n\"Learner\" Diesel bikes should be allowed up to 15hp to level the field and remove the need to learn on a petrol bike then switch.",
