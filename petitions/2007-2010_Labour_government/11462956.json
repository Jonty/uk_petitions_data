            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In the present climate of low base rates which although good for borrowers there is little incentive for banks to lend as the return is small. The introduction of a lending interest rate subsidy to restore the interest rate to about 5% for responsible lending would give the needed incentive to the banks to start lending again. This hopefully would restart the economy and base rates to normal and the subsidy could be phased out. \nResponsible lending could be well specified and only lending meeting the required standards would qualify. These could be mortgages to a maximum of three times salary, lending only to businesses with a good track record and business plan and only on a standard variable rate basis.",
