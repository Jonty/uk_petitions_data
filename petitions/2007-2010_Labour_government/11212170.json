            "background": "Train companies such as National Express continue to provide a shocking service.  The conditions travelers face with every single journey are worse than those assigned to cattle!  Often trains are delayed/canceled due to incidents that are managed poorly and that appear to be bizarre to say the least! Yet, despite this shockingly poor service provided to customers, prices are due to increase.  The people in charge of the price increase are trying to justify it by stating that customers are poised to receive a \u201cbetter service due to an increased number of trains and schedules\u201d.  I for one have had enough of their constant lies and false statements!\n\nI, along with friends and family will boycott the use of the train and bus services in protest of any price increases.  I will also ask fellow train sufferers to join me in not using the train + bus services for a period of 2 weeks beginning 12th January to 25th January.",
