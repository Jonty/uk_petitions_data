        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At each bi-election and general election electors are presented with exhortations to vote for candidates they know little about and have probably never heard of. MP's must be about the only people who get selected for  their jobs without submitting a structured application form to the selection panel (the voters). Even McDonald's require an application form.\nI'd like an independent committee set up to formulate an MP's application form for candidates which should be posted to everybody on the electoral register. This should include details of education, career information, details of directorships and other positions of influence held etc. This should result in a more informed decision regarding the suitability of each candidate, and a better standard of parliamentarian.",
