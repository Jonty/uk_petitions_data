            "background": "Many of the world\u2019s endangered species are under threat from poaching and the bush meet trade. I think that the UK should of its military services to those countries in which these animals are under threat. The survival of endangered species is not just the responsibility of the country in which those species are resident but the responsibility of the whole world. Often the rangers who are responsible for the safe keeping of these animals have little funding from there governments and are over stretched. An example of such a species are the Gorillas of the Congo, in recent months/years Gorillas have been killed not just for meat but as a threat to local government with the bodies being left where they were shot.",
