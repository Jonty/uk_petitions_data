            "background": "The loss by HM Revenue and Customs of data discs carrying the personal details of 25 million UK citizens shows the risks associated with large databases containing personal data. The fact that it was possible to extract the data in unencrypted form on a CD indicates an astonishing degree of ineptitude in specifying and designing the system. \n\nGiven this loss, in addition to the losses in September and October of a CD with personal data of 15,000 Standard Life customers and a laptop containing the data of 2,000 people with investment ISAs, it is now clear to all that the Government is not capable of developing, managing or protecting large databases containing personal data.\n\nThe planned ID cards are the physical embodiment of large-scale national databases. It is now clear that the Government cannot and will not provide adequate protection of that data and should withdraw the plans for the databases and ID cards.",
