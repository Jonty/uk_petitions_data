            "background": "It has become increasingly aparrent in recent years that organised religion is not a force for good in the world. Also with Africa still crying out for help and funding problems for various schemes in the UK, it is not possible to conclude that funding another \"Site of Worship\" is a good use of money, especially if it uses government funding. With this in mind I would like to call for a ban on construction of all  buildings with a religious purpose, and call for the money to be used elsewhere.\n( It could even be left unused to reduce our international debt ! )",
