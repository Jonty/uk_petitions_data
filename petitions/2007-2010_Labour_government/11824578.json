            "background": "It is shocking to see the number of plastic bin liners sold by supermarkets and which are then sent to landfill after one use. It is more environmentally friendly to use plastic carrier bags given freely by the supermarkets. These bags can be used several times on trips to the supermarket and then used in the kitchen pedal bin. This is a more practical solution for most people than the so called bags for life that the average busy person doesn't have time to think about when rushing about their day, doesn't want the hassle of carrying around and probably wouldn't want to be seen carrying around.",
