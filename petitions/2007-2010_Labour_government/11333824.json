        "background": "We call upon the NHS to bring a new Cancer Treatment Centre to the Westmorland General Hospital in Kendal providing radiotherapy, chemotherapy and full clinical support.  The lack of a local cancer centre means that an unacceptably low proportion of people from south Cumbria survive cancer.  It also means a stressful, arduous and often painful 100-mile roundtrip for cancer patients from south Cumbria to receive treatment.  A Cancer Treatment centre in Kendal would save lives and improve the experience of treatment for cancer patients in south Cumbria.",
