Lets get them into the services. I can already hear the human rights group calling foul. So lets quiet them by offering the youngsters a choice as follows;\n1. Stay at school and complete your studies.\n2. Find a job with good prospects/ training.\n3.Join the services for 2 years.\nNo more roaming the streets and behaving like feral beasts.\n3 Options pick one and learn about life properly not from feral gangs.",
