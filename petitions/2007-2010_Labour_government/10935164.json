            "background": "The US tried throwing money at public works programmes in the 30s, as did Japan in the 90s.  It didn't work out in either case.  The government is already spending money hand over fist in the public sector and it doesn't give us better services - it makes them less efficient.  When the government sells or monetises lots of debt, the value of sterling falls and we are all stealth-taxed by inflation. Please put an end to the zimbabwe-economics and sign this petition.",
