            "background": "The laws regarding the owners responsibility in having control of their dog/s in a public area needs to be updated and altered. If a dog is not kept under control then the law should state that the dog be rehomed and the owner prosecuted. If the dog goes into someone elses private property and attacks their pet/s, then it should be clear that an offence has been committed by the owner for allowing it, and action should be taken by the police. My cat was blinded in an incident like this and it is seemingly up to me to take legal action as the police have their hands tied by useless legislation. This act needs to alterered to give local police more power to act and make the dog owners take responsibility.",
