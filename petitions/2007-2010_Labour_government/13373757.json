            "background": "New start up businesses, especially small concerns, need help in order to continue through the current economic climate.  Exempting them from paying non-domestic rates in their first year of trading would remove one hurdle for them in their efforts to stay afloat and keep people in employment.  The government should be supporting new small businesses in these times of high unemployment, not hindering them.",
