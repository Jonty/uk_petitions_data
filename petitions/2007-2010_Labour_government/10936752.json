Yes i agree that we have come up with a way of stopping the jewels from reaching the shops but it is mine and other people's opions that it is not the satisfaction of the customers that chose to lavish themselfs with useless jewels but it is of the children who are killed and kill everyday. imagine if you were stolen from your parents brought up in an atmosphere of war and aboilshment, then forced to kill their own parents... would you do it and spend a lifetime in a cave never to see the light. and there digging out more war. i am sure you are aware that the money made is used for more war and if they were to go to war the children would be put at the front line. in addition to this the goverment over there is doing nothing but you can england is more powerful than africa ecspecially in places such as sirra leone. make a difference, save lives, save the future generation and generations to come-please.",
