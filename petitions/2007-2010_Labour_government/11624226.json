        "background": "The people of Helford in Cornwall are being blocked from building a jetty to improve their livelihoods by mostly second home owners who hardly ever live there.\n\nMore than a million pounds worth of fish are landed there each year which has to be lugged up the beach because it has no jetty. A jetty would improve the lives and economy of the people that actually live in Helford.\n\nAccording to a local resident, the Jetty plan has support from the council as well as the local environment groups who believe the Jetty plan is in keeping with the surrounding area.\n\nThose people need your support so please sign up now and show your support for local hard working people who are trying their best to improve their businesses and their community",
