A jetty would improve the lives and economy of the people that actually live in Helford.\n\nAccording to a local resident, the Jetty plan has support from the council as well as the local environment groups who believe the Jetty plan is in keeping with the surrounding area.\n\nThose people need your support so please sign up now and show your support for local hard working people who are trying their best to improve their businesses and their community",
