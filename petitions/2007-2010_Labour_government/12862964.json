If the vote was made on the evidence from the debate a very different outcome would have emerged. I believe the public votes for an MP hoping that they will treat issues for debate seriously - and there is nothing more serious than taking us into war - then to vote on the evidence. Not just turn up to vote the way their party has decreed.",
