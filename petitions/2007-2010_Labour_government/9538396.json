        "background": "There is an acute shortage of homes in this country. Holiday homes cannot be used as permanent residences without planning consent. If it was required that planning consent be obtained before a permanent residence could be used as a holiday or second home very many homes could be released for permanent use. This would be of enormous social benefit to many communities being destroyed by the use of good residential homes by second/holiday home owners.",
