            "background": "17 babies a day die in the UK, either in utero or within 28 days of birth. Just over 1 in 200 pregnancies end in still birth and around 1 in 300 babies born die within 28 days of birth.  Not all of these deaths are preventable, but these figures have stopped decreasing since the early 1990s, and many parents feel that their babies could have been better cared for and their deaths prevented.  Please sign up to request making this campaign to improve ante natal care a priority, acting upon enquiries into the care of pregnant mothers whose babies die perinatally or neo natally by CEMACH (Confidential Enquiry into Maternal And Childhood Health), and by setting NHS official standards of ante natal care including such measures as better monitoring of pregnancies, individualised care, a guaranteed consultation with a hospital consultant within the first 3 months of pregnancy, automatic classification of women over 40 and those who have had previous miscarriages or still births as 'high risk', and specifically high-level monitoring of fetal health from week 36 onwards with uncertainty management addressed using the precautionary principle of early delivery.",
