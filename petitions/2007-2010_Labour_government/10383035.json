        "background": "i would like the idea of street urinals aborted.some men hate seeing other men pee.nearly all woman hate it.and especially allowing my children to see it.\n\nwhat about supply proper encolsed toilets for men ( and woman ) at night. or arrest more people who urinate in public. try to make them stop.\n\nI have seen people asking on forums where these toilets are so they know not to take a holiday in the area they are in.\n\nPlus urnals for men.this idea of peeing in a urinal beside other men, this should be old school now. With so many different ethnics and religions and people now that live in any one place at any one time, men / boys should be given their privacy.. yes there is mostly a cubicle in a public toilet, but have you sen the state they are in.disgusting\n\nI think men need to stand up for themselves and ask for a little privacy and protection.\n\nBullying in schools often starts in bathrooms.. Small camera phones taken into public facilities.. and who thinks urinals are disgusting looking.",
