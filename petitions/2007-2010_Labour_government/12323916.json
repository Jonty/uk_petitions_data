            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "MON 810 was approved for cultivation in Europe by the EU in 1998. The plant produces a toxin to fight off a certain pest, the voracious larvae of the corn borer moth.The cultivation of MON 810 is banned in six  EU member states, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Greece, France and Luxembourg.  Germany announced on 14th April 2009 plans to ban the genetically modified seed. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth Germany both welcomed the ban. Greenpeace's genetic engineering expert, Stephanie T\u00f6we, said the decision was long overdue, explaining that numerous scientific studies demonstrated that GM corn was a danger to the environment. \nUnder the new regulations, the cultivation of MON 810, a GM corn produced by biotech giant Monsanto, will be prohibited in Germany, as will the sale of its seed. German Agriculture Minister Ms.Aigner told reporters she had legitimate reasons to believe that MON 810 posed \"a danger to the environment,\" a position which she said the German Environment Ministry also supported.\n Aigner is taking advantage of a clause in EU law which allows individual countries to impose such bans. UK should follow in these steps. Ban the sale and planting of the MON 810 seed.",
