The state of today's Economy might be a little better of if all these fat-cats were paid minimum wages, No doubt they wouldn't agree with me, but if it wasn't for people like me they wouldn't be in the jobs their in,think about it do they really earn or need or is it just pure greed...  WHY SHOULD THEY BE ANY DIFFERENT TO YOU AND ME... FOREVER SKINT...",
