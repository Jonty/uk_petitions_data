            "background": "1Xtra is a digital radio station that was created to promote new urban music. 1Xtra is controlled by the BBC and is funded with money from television licenses. \n\n\n\n1Xtra uses it's evening and night shows promotes underground music and new talent. I was therefore surprised to find out that it was cutting two of its drum and bass shows and releasing L Double and DJ Flight from its roster. This will decrease the number of hours dedicated to drum and bass from 12 hours to a poor 4. Both L-Double and Flights shows were committed to bringing in new talent and giving new artists a chance to develop their skills. \n\n\n\nIt's not just drum and bass that has suffered. Other underground shows of hip hop and garage have been axed.\n\nIn their place will be Trevor Nelson and Tim Westwood. Two DJ's that have been established and on the roster at Radio 1 for a number of years. These DJ's aren't that favourable with showcasing new British or international talent. Instead they will opt for chart friendly RnB and rap.\n\nSo please can you consider the asking 1Xtra to rethink its pending reshuffle.",
