I was parked in a side road and in no way was my vehicle obstructing pedestrians or other vehicles.  The other day however i came across a vehicle parked on double red lines obstructing the inside lane of a dual carriageway and also parked 2 foot from a pedestrian crossing. My blood started to boil as i saw a traffic warden approach the car and ignore the offences because the car was displaying a blue badge.  Disabled or not you should have to adhere to the same parking rules as everyone else.",
