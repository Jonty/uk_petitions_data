            "background": "There are numerous families living in Middlecroft Drive. This street leads directly to a local primary school. There are no speed deterants in place and frequently people drive at excessive speed of 60 MPH down this street, therefore putting children and toddlers at risk. We have written to our local MP John Greenway on several occassions with no response. Also a neighbour in the same street has written to Ryedale Council, again no response. We are parents of young children and do not feel the street is safe enough to let our children play in. We would like the Government to inforce speed deterants in Middlecroft Drive before a serious accident happens.",
