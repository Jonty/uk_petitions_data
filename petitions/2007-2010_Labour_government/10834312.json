            "background": "Since everyone in the nation has to tighten spending. The government needs to stop wasting taxpayers money on the identity card programme - it should be scrapped.\n\nIdentity cards will not prevent illegal immigrants entering Britain; or legal immigrants working, nor terrorists.\n\nAs with all legislation there has to be efficient policing for it to be enforced and effective.  This will not happen; added to the fact that criminals are better organised than the government and will not take long for them to produce fraudelent documentation...as we know they already do.\n\nOf course, the major problem is the fact that the government should not be allowed to have confidential details of its people. They cannot be trusted with information as we have seen in recent past.\n\nThe 'thought police' will soon be here!",
