            "background": "The Treason Act needs to be reintroduced and amended to prevent religious and political extremism both home grown and perpetrated by foreign nationals; this includes preachers of hate waving placards with slogans intended to incite racial hatred, including English citizens that condone terrorist acts or acts of subjugation against England, the English flag and the English people. Example: it is a federal offence in America to burn the stars and stripes. This should be the case for the St George cross. Anyone who aids and abets extremist individuals or groups that intend to do harm to England or its people,must be subject to the full rigours of the law.",
