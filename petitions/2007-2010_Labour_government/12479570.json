Take a leaf out of the Obama book and lead us for as long as you have left in an honest and honourable manner. This country will only regain strength if we play with a straight bat and be candid, honest and fair at all times. Mr Brown, you have let us down with your behaviour over many issues. You have also let yourself down as you have not fulfilled the pledges that you made on the day you came to office. You have also clearly lost your famous moral compass and need to do some soul searching if you are to find it. The people were fed up with Blair and his lies and spin and hoped you would be better. So far you have not but you still have time to change. The new world order demands a new approach from politicians. Obama gets it!! Why dont you? Try it - you might find it works.",
