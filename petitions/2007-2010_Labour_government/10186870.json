            "background": "There are many things wrong with the child support agency. These Policies are seriously wrong and need addressing.\nThey should allow for all kids of the second family, not the first 3. [I have 5 what about them?]\nShould not allow Tax credits factored in to assessment. [Mine are paid directly to my Wife anyway]\nShould allow for 2nd family mortgage. \nShould not factor in overtime payments if taking leave. \nShould close habitually resident loophole. [My ex claimed from Bolivia?]\nShould not rely on Child Benefit for Checks.The only check the CSA perform to find out if your child is in Full Time Education is to check if they receive child benefit. This is inadequate and the CSA should do it's own checking.\nShould introduce regional assessment. [Why should someone living in London be assessed the same as someone in an area with cheaper house prices. This is serious because the PWC's mortgage is not factored into any assessment.]",
