            "background": "I hereby suggest that there be a European policy that it is not up to the individual to say which country they wish to claim asylum in. Centres to be set up throughout Europe and you are allocated a country of asylum and given papers and fingerprints taken. This is your refuge. No assylum seeker can claim asylum having passed through a country that they could have asked for asylum in but decided to move on to one they choose. Also, if a country is declared safe then repatriate those assylum seekers that should now be ok to return. Refuge is temporary not Permanant.",
