            "background": "If the government were to introduce incentive schemes to both employees and employers to encourage people to work from home then this would benefit the Environment, the employee and the employer. \n\nThe environment would benefit as there would be less congestion on the roads, resulting in less pollution to the atmosphere.\n\nThe employee would benefit as they would not have the cost of travelling to work.\n\nThe employer would benefit as in most cases the employee would be able to do more work as there would be less interruptions and they could also have smaller premises resulting in less overheads.\n\nWith the advances in modern technology (phones & computers) there is no reason why most of the current office based staff could not do their jobs from home with maybe 1 or 2 visits to the office per week.",
