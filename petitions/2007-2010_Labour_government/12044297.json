Calls to the telephone helpline have doubled in recent months, and emails from anxiety sufferers requesting support are up 400%. The Department of Health funding of \u00a350,000 per year has formed a substantial part of the charity\u2019s core funding for the last 9 years, and this shocking news has thrown the whole financial sustainability of the charity into question.",
