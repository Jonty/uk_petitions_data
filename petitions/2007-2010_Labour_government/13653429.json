            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This government has craftily slid the Prison Service together with the Probation Service, under the title National Offender Management Service. The idea was to reduce re-offending.\nThe reality was the reverse - \"NOMS\" has forced the Probation Service to operate as though it were a Prison Service in the community, and it has virtually ceased to be any help to offenders.\nThe rules for prisoners released to Probation Supervision are extraordinarily harsh, lean towards the punitive, and result in most offenders being breached and returned, arbitrarily, to prison.\nSo the prison population continues to rise, and ex-offenders get no help.\nNOMS costs one billion pounds to run and makes the construction of yet more prisons inevitable.",
