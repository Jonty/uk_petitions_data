            "background": "Most people believe that cross dressers are homosexuals. However most cross dressers are actually heterosexuals.\n\nCross dressers can only go to gay village and feel perfectly safe but if they aren't homosexuals then why should they be pushed into going to gay village?\n\nA high majority of cross dressers like to wear bikini's. Let's give them somewhere where they can sunbathe, swim and enjoy the summer in the way they would enjoy most.\n\nI suggest that part of the Blackpool beach should be transformed into a cross dressers beach. This wouldn't cost much at all and it would be great for tourists and business.",
