            "background": "We ask the Government to scrap their recently announced plans to reduce the national speed limit to 50 mph for two thirds of our A roads.  Plans to enforce this limit with yet more speed cameras will result in many drivers traveling at even slower speeds, thus more people will take risks by overtaking.\n\nPlease credit motorists with the intelligence to decide for themselves whether 50 mph would be more appropriate at any given stretch of road, even if the speed limit is 60 mph.",
