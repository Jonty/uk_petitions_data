        "background": "Given that students are now forced to borrow huge amounts of money and that these sums do not allow them a decent standard of living, is it not about time that the government helped them a little?\n\nOne way is to stop charging them the TV Licence Fee. Given that students often live in a single room in halls of residence etc, making every student buy a TV Licence is nothing more than a tax on the poor.\n\nStudents are our future... They will pay for Gordon Brown's pension! Unlike the hundreds and thousands of bums who sit at home doing nothing at the taxpayer's expense, students will potentially drive the economy in the future. So stop being so incredibly mean and give them a break!",
