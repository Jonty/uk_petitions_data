        "background": "The unnamed police officer left his two German Shepherd dogs in his car on the afternoon of June 30 this year, when the outside temperature reached 28C (83f).\n\nThe dogs, one of which was over ten years old, were trapped in the parked car outside Nottinghamshire Police headquarters on the outskirts of Nottingham.\n\nAlthough the dogs are not thought to have been locked in the car for a long time, the outside air temperature was so great that the temperature inside the vehicle rose extremely rapidly.\n\nAnimal welfare experts said that it would have taken just 20 minutes for the air temperature inside the officer's privately-owned car to reach as high as 47c (116f).",
