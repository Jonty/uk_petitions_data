        "background": "This is a very simple, but very heartfelt plea to the Prime Minister. It is a very simple request - we would like the trains in this country to run on time.\n\nIt sounds obvious and simple, and it is. However, for decades now, under any Government, Labour or Tory, Britain has seemed unable to achieve this simple feat despite billions of pounds of investment. Nationalised services were constantly late and cancelled, and so were privatised ones.\n\nThis country pioneered the railways and we used to be able to run them on time. Countless other countries manage to run their trains on time.\n\nIt should not be beyond the whit of this country, one of the richest and largest economies in the world, to simply have trains that work to time.\n\nStudy what they do in other countries and copy it. Look back to when our trains ran on time and what went wrong to make them late. Do whatever it takes, but please do it. Give the people of this country just one simple thing we can rely on and be proud of. PLEASE!",
