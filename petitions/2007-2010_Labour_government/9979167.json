The argument is that it is too expensive to buy/rent another form of transport so that you dont use the 4x4 for every day use, also we would like to call on you to abloish road tax alltogether so that you only pay for what you use, it would also get rid of the need of customs and excise spending millions of pounds tracking down the evaders and avioding the advertising costs telling the evaders that they were trying to catch them",
