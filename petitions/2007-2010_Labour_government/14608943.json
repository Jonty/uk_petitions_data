        "action": "create a tiered electoral age system, where parish council elections would have a voting age of 12, district councils 14, county coucils 16, and national elections 18.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "One of the issues our democracy is facing is the voting age. There are many arguments both for and against lowering the voting age, but they tend to miss an obvious compromise - a tiered system, where town parish council elections would have an age limit of 12, district council elections and age limit of 14, county council elections an age limit of 16, and a national age limit of 18.\n\nThe advantages would be numerous. It would give people a chance to become more involved in the political process as they grow older, while also serving to gather useful information that would inform further debates on the voting age.\n\nWe hope the government considers this idea carefully.",
