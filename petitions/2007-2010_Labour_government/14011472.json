I read today of a proposal to create a position in the UK whereby a family, not just a person, may be disconnected from the internet without trial, without evidence, on the basis of an accusation. \n\nAccess which has only recently been enshrined in Spain as a human right, and yet here in the UK we propose to toss it to the whims of a mere accusation? Such sanctions, based on a civil matter (as copyright infringement is), should not be taken lightly, and should never be enforced without the input of a judge and jury.\n\nPrime Minister, reassure us that you will not sign away our rights so lightly - Not to an accusation, not to mere corroborating evidence, but only after a true full trial should such a sanction be offered.",
