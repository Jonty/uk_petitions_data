            "background": "Our Post Office is under threat. The claim that we can easily reach another post office is simply untrue, and for people who do not drive, young or elderly, it is very difficult to take the bus at a convenient time. Our Post Office and Shop has a large catchment area, and were it to close, many people would be affected. Also, driving to nearby post offices is not environmentally friendly, so if we are to try and minimize the use of vehicles, closing our Post Office will not help.",
