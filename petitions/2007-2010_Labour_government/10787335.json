            "background": "That where a designated cycle path/lane exists on a road or a pavement, then cyclists should be obliged to use it and a failure to do so should be treated as a traffic offence.  \n\nWith increasing numbers of cyclists taking to the roads (not a bad thing) there is a safety need for them to be ordered and respect other road and pavement users - this would be greatly aided if they kept to the specially designated cycle lanes where they exist.  Too often these lanes are empty and cyclists ignore them preferring to use the road or pavement and as a consequence becoming a hazard to themselves and other road and pavement users.",
