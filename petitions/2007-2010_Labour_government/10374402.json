            "background": "The government is considering an all out ban on happy hours in pubs and clubs.\n\nThe government is expected to publish the results of an independent review into the link between price promotion and alcohol abuse in the next few weeks. It will then begin consultation about new legislation to regulate the industry, which could include banning happy hours.\n\nAlcohol must be sold and marketed responsibly, but this is no need to put a complete ban on happy hours in pubs and clubs.\nPut more pressure on individual pub companies to market more responsbily, but don't put a complete ban on happy hours.",
