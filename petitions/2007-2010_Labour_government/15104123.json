            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The funding for lumber and spinal injections has been withdrawn by N.I.C.E\nfrom the Pain Clinic at St Mary's Hospital Portsmouth because of a lack of funding. The pain clinic now relies on Pain management courses instead. This is simply because it is a cheaper option than drugs and injections. Therefore patients have to live with constant pain and suffer, day in and day out, 24/7. Against medical advise, N.I.C.E has gone for the cheaper option of increasing community Pain Management courses, on how to live with the pain. Well this is not, and should never be, the case. We would like to see the re-instatement of funding to not only St Mary's Hospital but any hospital, that requires it. Not everyone has the benefit of private healthcare such as M.P's or \u00a31,000 for private treatments for Lumber facets injections. We have paid once in our NH contributions. Why should we have to pay again for Chronic pain relief? Is this not our right!!",
