I have now finally want to see if I can do anything to help my country and wanted to start a petition to save Zimbabwe. Hopefully we can get enough people to sign so that the government can be removed and a new one put in place to rebuild this amazing country. It is a beautiful country and now everything that was fought for in the beginning is no longer there, the people are dying and the government are hiding everything they can from the rest of the world. Something needs to be done, so please help!!",
