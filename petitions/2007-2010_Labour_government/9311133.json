            "background": "The government is currently planning to make \u00a350bn available to banks to ease the credit crisis. This should not happen - the banks must be forced to use their own funds.\n\nIn recent years the banks have posted record profits and dividend payments. These profits have been made in part BECAUSE of investment in the sub-prime lending market. So in good times the shareholders profited from these strategies. \n\nNow the detrimental side of these strategies is threatening the banks revenue and profitability. Tax payers money is being used to alleviate the problem - so we ensure that those same shareholders who benefitted in the good years are cushioned from the long term effects of poor business practice.\n\nThis is gross market interference and gross misuse of tax payers money.\n\nThe government should be FORCING all banks to do what the Royal Bank of Scotland has VOLUNTEERED to do - raise the money from shareholders !",
