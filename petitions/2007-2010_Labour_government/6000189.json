        "background": "Following the so-called historic period of power sharing between the DUP and Sinn Fein in the Northern Ireland Assembly, we call upon the Government to apply pressure on Sinn Fein to publicly condemn the ongoing attacks on Orange Halls, marches and members of the Loyal Orange Institution of Ireland.\n\nThis step must be taken by Sinn Fein, as they helped start such attacks by establishing anti-Orange \"resident groups\" in various part of Northern Ireland over ten years ago as a part of a wider campaign against the Orange Order, in order for them to show that they are fully committed to a shared future in Northern Ireland like the rest of the people of this part of the United Kingdom.",
