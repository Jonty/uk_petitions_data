He was voted as the best right-back in the World between '62 and '64. In 2008, he was inducted to the football hall of fame, making him one of the best players the country had ever produced. After football, Jimmy served his county in the role of Deputy Lieutenant and then High-Sheriff. Jimmy Armfield also beat cancer and is loved by many despite the football divide and transcends local rivalry. He is a true gentleman and deserves this honour",
