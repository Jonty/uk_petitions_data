            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recent increases in taxation by the chancellor in the guise of clamping down on binge drinking have affected the public houses in the country when it is not the public houses on the whole who encourage binge drinking. We believe that the majority of binge drinking taking place by young people in the country is fuelled by off licences and supermarkets and not the public houses. Public houses on the whole police the over-drinking problems and the under-age problems well, but we are being hardest hit by the recent tax increases. The smoking ban, increases in supplier prices and now tax increases are causing the death of the British pub culture with some 57 pubs per week closing down. We petition for increases in taxation in off-sales and a relaxation in taxation for responsible public houses.",
