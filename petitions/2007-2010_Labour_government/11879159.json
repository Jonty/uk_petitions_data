Most jurisdictions deliberately delay non - airmail franked letters for up to 28 days which is the expiry time for HMR&C online registration authorisation delivery by mail. No Government Department seems willing to put in place a registration process that is actually workable for non-residents.  This needs fixing in 2009.",
