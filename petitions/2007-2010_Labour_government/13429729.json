            "background": "Up to 50,000 UK students have been denied places at British universities this year while the number of non-European students given places has doubled over the last ten years.\n\nAccording to the report, in 2007/08 some 229,640 students came from outside the European Union, compared with 117,290 in 1998/99. Students from China remained the \u201cmost significant\u201d number.\n\nMost universities in the country prefer international applicants who pay more than double the fees that British Students pay.\n\nTherefore we petition the prime minister to cap the number of international students allowed into British universities and ensure British students are given priority.",
