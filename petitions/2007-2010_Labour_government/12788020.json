            "background": "The prison sentances now-a-days are a joke! If someone commits a crime and given a prison sentance, that person should serve the whole sentance not half. Most offenders that are released - leave to commit more offenses, only worse. If someone is given life, it should be for there life and they stay in prison until they die. How can 25 years be justified as being a life sentance? Murderers, rapists, peadaphiles etc should have stronger sentances anyway. Murderers particuarly. If you take a life, you should give up yours - no excuses.",
