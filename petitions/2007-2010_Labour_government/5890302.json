            "background": "In light of what I saw on the cover of the Daily Express today (a photograph of some Muslim women, holding signs saying 'British Police Go To Hell', with reference to the four terror suspects being detained), I feel it is only necessary that something is done about people immigrating to our country and spreading hate towards us, this cannot be tolerated. I want people to know that I do not have a problem with Muslims, middle-easterners or any other immagrants to that matter, I just believe that we shouldn't be subjected to bullying in our own country, especially by supporters of extremist terrorism.",
