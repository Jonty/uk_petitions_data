        "background": "Banned in the UK for 50 years, these barbaric traps, together with other leg hold devices, poison traps and hunting dog packs are in common use by farmers. They inflict terrible injury and suffering on wildlife. From Cape Mountain leopards at the top of the food chain down to smaller predators such as caracals, jackals and eagles. \nOther non-lethal and ecological methods have been proven to work successfully and effectively. These include livestock-guarding animals, use of herdsmen, protective collars and fencing, live trapping and GPS tracking or relocation of leopards where they come into conflict with humans. \nGin traps are completely inhumane and unnecessary when these other options are available.",
