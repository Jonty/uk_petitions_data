            "background": "Feel that it is intolerable of this Government to allow tax payers monies to be spent on such an enormous mosque in the london area, and to be even given permission to build such a thing when the country is such dyer need of nurses, midwives and other health professionals! With the current climate of terrorism, is such a building not an open invitation to undesirables who wish to visit harm on this country and its citizens? Why oh why does this government continue to bend to the Muslim vote all the time, why does it not listen to the other citizens of this country and their views? It is time that they listened to the grass roots voters, after all it is my parents, grandparents and even my great grandparents who voted for a country who respected all views and not just the minority!!",
