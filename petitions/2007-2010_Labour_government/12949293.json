            "background": "Bicycles, tricycles and the like use the road system. Unlike motorised vehicles, no tax is levied on these for the use of the road system. It would seem equitable for a further tax, in excess of VAT etc., (say 10%) to be applied to the purchase price of all pedal vehicles, and secondhand pedal vehicles purchased from a business, and all spare parts specific to pedal vehicles.",
