            "background": "It is a sad fact that businesses have to hold a PRS Music Licence to be able to listen to the music from a radio if there are 4 or more customers. Why is there this petty need, how can listening to music from a radio be harmfull. The radio is an old entertainment system steming back to 1866. It is also the best way for people to hear a song they like and then go and buy it. Please sign this petition to try to ban the need for buisinesses to have to buy a PRS Music Licence to play a radio.",
