            "background": "Hereford United have played their home matches at Edgar Street since their formation in 1924. Originally they ground-shared with amateurs Hereford City and the ground is owned by Hereford City Council.\n\nI would like to see the football club moved out of the city to a more suitable location on the outskirts of the city. This is being successfully in Worcester where Worcester City FC are going to be moving.\n\nAt the moment the football ground is in the city centre and it causes a problems such as traffic congestion and crowd trouble. There is often crowd trouble and violence from the football supporters. It would be much better to see the ground moved away from Hereford so these problems were alieviated.",
