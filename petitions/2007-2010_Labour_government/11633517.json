        "background": "The cost of using public transport has increased significantly in real terms in the last ten years, whereas the cost of motoring has remained the same in real terms. Taxes should be increased on private and commercial motoring (toll roads, fuel, etc.) and the increased revenue be spent on improving public transport. (10 miles of new motorway can buy electrification from London to Bristol & South Wales)",
