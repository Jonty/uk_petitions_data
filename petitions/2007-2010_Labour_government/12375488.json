        "background": "While MMR may be safe many parents want to use single vaccines if for no other reason than they are more effective vaccines than MMR conferring a higher level of protection. What is really important is that children ARE vaccinated; not that they are vaccinated by \"brand x\"  MMR or by single vaccines. If parents want to use single vaccines then they should be supported. It's not as if they were refusing to vaccinate their children merely that they wish to use a different route. \n\nDepartment of Health should be encouraged to act responsibly and encourage the current licence holder to restart production immediately or licence its production to another company as a matter of urgency.",
