            "background": "Bob McGowan was told he could not claim the \u00a3300 subsidy because he moved into his flat just one day too late to qualify.\nDespite his age and the six years he spent fighting for his country across Europe, Asia and Africa, the Pension Service said it could not show flexibility.\nMr McGowan, of Portsmouth, has been waging a battle of principle with Whitehall ever since he was turned down for the fuel support in 2007.\nHe wants an apology from Gordon Brown and says if it is not forthcoming he will post his five medals to 10 Downing Street.",
