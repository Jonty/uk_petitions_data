            "background": "Anyone legally in the UK, even temporarily, deserves to be treated like a human being. Vouchers force asylum seekers to walk miles to find shops which accept them, and are inflexible: change cannot be given and they cannot be used for basic provisions such as toiletries. This also inconveniences other shoppers and shop staff. Replace this with a basic post office bank account into which the allowance is paid.",
