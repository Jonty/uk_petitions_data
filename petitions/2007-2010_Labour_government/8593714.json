        "background": "Brian Matthew has done more for 1960s popular music than any other broadcaster. Brian is 80 this year and has been broadcasting since the late 1950s.  He still presents a Radio 2 show called Sounds of the 60s which ensures that 60s pop, in all its myriad styles, is given the airtime it deserves.  Brian featured the Beatles regularly on BBC Light programme's Saturday Club and these guest appearances have appeared on a CD called the Beatles at the Beeb. As a child of the 50s/60s, Brian was my mate on Saturday mornings for Saturday Club and Sunday mornings for Easy Beat. I also watched him on TV as a presenter of Thank Your Lucky Stars.  What a better way to recognise this wonderful man, who sounds as good today on Saturday mornings as he did 50 years ago, than to make him 'Sir Brian'",
