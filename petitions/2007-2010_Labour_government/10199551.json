        "background": "Research has shown that children restrained by a poorly adjusted 3 point seat-belt are very likely to suffer serious neck injury in a crash.\n\nThis injury results from a victim sitting too low for the strap, with it lying across the throat of the child and not the chest/shoulder. A cheap and easily fitted standard booster seat raises the child to an appropriate height significantly increasing safety.\n\ntransport with only lap-belts fitted should be immediately withdrawn from service as these restraints invariably cause severe spinal/abdominal injury in a heavy collision.",
