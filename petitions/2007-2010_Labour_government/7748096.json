        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We know we are becoming unhealthier, and take too little exercise.\n\nThere is no better way to exercise than cycle or walk.\nSlower traffic speeds will make cycling safer, and encourage more children (and adults) to walk and play outside their homes.\n\nThere is simply why no reason why cities such as Birmingham cannot have default 20mph speeds, with faster speeds on some roads, and slower on others.\n\nIn addition to slow speeds, if we want cycling to become popular, we need all our children to receive cycle training in school so they can cycle safely on our roads. \n\nWe also we need cycle paths by the side of busy roads where speeds are greater than 20mph.\n\nIn this way anyone will be able to cycle anywhere without having to cycle on a busy road with speeds above 20mph. Over 25 years, with other measures such as more bus lanes, secure cycle parking, congestion charging, cycling rates can be increased to the 50% level achieved in Denmark and Holland.",
