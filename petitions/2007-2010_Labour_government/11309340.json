            "background": "Do not give \u00a3450 billion to the banks directly, simply split the money up by every mortgage holder in the UK and send them a cheque to whatever amount it comes out at on the proviso they must send the same amount to their bank/building society/mortgage lender.  This way the banks get refinanced, mortgage holders gain valuable equity and the recession ends within 30 minutes of everyone paying a chunk of their mortgages off.  Lower repayments on mortgages increase the disposable income of most working people so we all spend more and the recession ends.",
