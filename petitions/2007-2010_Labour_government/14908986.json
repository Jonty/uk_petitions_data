            "background": "Recently, the DWP centralised all the telephone numbers for contacting your local Jobcentre away from a local phone call, to an 0845 number.  They don't apprear to have taken into consideration the large number of people on benefits who rely on Pay As You Go mobile phones, for whom the cost of such a call has now risen to between 40-45p per minute.\n\nThis now means, certainly for myself, maybe for others, that a 10 minute call to the Jobcentre to speak to an adviser, now sets me back \u00a34.50, half of my fortnightly top-up gone in one call.\n\nI urge the Prime Minister to order this change to be reversed, or to provide an alternative standard telephone number for mobile customers.",
