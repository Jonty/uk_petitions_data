This was obviously extremely frustrating and annoying; I resubmitted mine, pointing out that the other petition was NOT similar, but it was again rejected on the grounds of similarity!  \n\nWhatever anyone's feelings on the specific isue of pavement cycling I'm sure you would agree that, however much one might agree on the undesirability of similar or overlapping petitions, it is obviously wrong to reject a petition on those grounds when it ACTUALLY asks the OPPOSITE of the alleged similar petition!  I hope, therefore, that if this petition is approved it will gain a reasonable amount of support; my experience could be repeated (and may well have been repeated) by any other petition creator.",
