Central government have overuled the local authority and communities wishes. they are not listening to the local community who will have to live with the windfarm - They are supporting the developers. Windfarms are not an economical way to produce electricity and a number of other european states are now removing them or removing the subsidies to build them - will this government listen to what the local people want. Support the local residents, not the developers.",
