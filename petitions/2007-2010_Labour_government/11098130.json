As an industrialized country the UK is one of the largest transportation and destination sites for trafficked people in the world. \nInternational games serve as major trafficking ground, and with no specialized forces in place to combat human trafficking within the UK, the disbanment means four years of planning for international organized crime rings. \n\n(Feel free to do a google search of: \"UK disban anti-trafficking unit\")",
