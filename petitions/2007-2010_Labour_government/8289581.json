        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "All persons seeking to become British Citizens should be required to undertake a period of National Service. This would be an ideal opportunity to screen prospective Britons, and also teach people our culture, our ethos, our language and the British way of life. On succesful completion of their service, persons are granted full citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, young persons given ASBO's and convicted of violent crimes should be required to serve for a period of time. This would help educate them, teach them discipline and morals and make them better people.\n\nUnemployed persons should be required to serve in the military if they do not find work and are claiming benefits for more than 1 year. Thus , if after 1 year of claiming from the state they have not found work, they can serve in the miltary to pay back their debt to the rest of society.",
