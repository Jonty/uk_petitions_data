            "background": "Cars are a vital part of everyday life. They are however detrimental to the environment due to their size yet preferred due to their safety. Motorcycles are much more efficient for single person commuters but not used due to safety fears from other cars on the road. By adding new lanes, or converting existing ones, to the road network dedicated purely for motorcycle users; many people would feel much safer about using the more efficient form of transport reducing global warming and the ever increasing congestion issues. \nThe motorbike lanes should be the same width as half a conventional lane with two lanes side by side. A new traffic system would have to be devised to handle junctions with the two lane system safety without the use of an overpass.\n\nAlternatively an entirely separate road network could be implemented for Motorbikes, although this would require significant changes to infrastructure.",
