There are millions of pensioners in the UK who will have to make the decision this year on whether to 'heat or eat'. \nMany pensioners are living below the poverty line, surely this should not be the case in the 21st Century, when we are one of the riches countries in Europe?\nWe want to be able to live out our lives in dignity and with respect. Is this too much to ask considering just how much this 'forgotten generation' have put into this country?\nThe Pension increases will not even cover the cost of main ingredients like milk and bread, so how are we expected to pay for a staple diet on a fixed income?\nPlease do something now, in the hopes of saving many lives come the winter.",
