        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In these enlightened times most adults are ok/indifferent about someones sexuality. Sadly Most schools say that have a Rigorous 'Anti-Bullying' pollicy, but infact it has not teeth. If anything the Victims are ejected not the aggressors. Many of the Victims end up taking their own lives; if this happened in a corporate environment you can imagine the Corporate Manslaughter  charges. During this period where kids are exploring their sexuality, they dont need to be bullied because someone else has judged that they maybe gay('not one of us'). This tacide approval of Bullying is introducting the acceptablity of Homo(/any)Phobia in society. This is a simple problem for the Prime Minister to fix and yet on his watch the problem has arisen and become acute.",
