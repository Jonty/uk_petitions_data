            "background": "HMRC are issuing fines for late filing of end of year returns (P35) despite its systems being unable to cope with the on-line filing of these forms.\n\nMany businesses are only now being informed that their electronic returns failed to reach HMRC some 4 months after the event because the HMRC system has not been updated. These businesses are now being fined \u00a3400.00 when they had no way of knowing that their electronic return had failed.\n\nFines should not be imposed unless HMRC can forewarn businesses that their electronic returns have failed or businesses can check their on-line records in a timely manner. \n\nOther Government Agencies such as Companies House update most of their customer details in less than 7 days. \n\nWhy does it take HMRC FOUR MONTHS to update data it receives electronically?\n\nDue to the systematic failure of the HMRC system both this year (4 months to update) and last year (9 months to update) these fines should be cancelled and no fines imposed until HMRC systems are working properly.\n\nHMRC should not be allowed to profit from its own system failures.",
