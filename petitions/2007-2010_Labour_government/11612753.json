            "background": "facts:\nfree early learning for 2,3 and 4 year olds is available for 7.5,12.5 and 15 hours per working week term time only.\n\nMost providers of this will not make you aware of this. It is up to you to get a form from them and sign it and return it before the eligible term start date.\n\nthe 12.5 hours standard entitlement is only for a full working week, i.e: 2.5 hours per day for every working day (term time only) your children are in there for. which means if i put my child in 3 days only, i only get 7.5 hours entitlement.\nEarly learning providers do not have to provide this entitlement, your LA does have to make sure you can get your entitlement though a provider that may not be of your choice.\n\nI petition that \n1) all state and private early learning providers contact the parent/guardian in reasonable course to tell them of their rights to free early learning and,\n\nb) endeavour to provide the learning in a case-by-case flexibility to offer the working parent a genuine flexible help.",
