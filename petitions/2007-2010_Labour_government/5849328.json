            "background": "I would like the government to support the option of a more open commune lifestyle, whereby as people can use their skills to self-provide and not be part of 'the rat-race', driving up property prices and buying everything in packets.\n\nOld council warehouses, offices and land can all be harnassed to provide homes for those who choose to work with the planet and not spend a lifetime making money for determined capitalists.\n\nI want to encourage the building of communities, from localised festivals, neighbourhood watch schemes, elderly support, children support, local food provision and education necessary to the local community.\n\nA body is being created to further research the necessities in life, how to produce electricity sufficient for production, water filtering and much more.\n\nPeople should have a choice of whether they want to be subject to the boss's whims and grab as much money as you can or live more in harmony with each other and provide living opportunities for others to come and learn, whether it be educational or vocational.",
