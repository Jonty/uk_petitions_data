        "background": "We do not want drinking water to be fluoridated, this is a matter of choice. If drinking water is fluoridated the choice has been taken away from the individual.\n\nChildren can be given fluoridated water via another source i.e. school/parents.\nSome people choose not to use toothpaste containing fluoride and should not be forced to drink water with added fluoride.\n\nThis is mass medication where levels of fluoride cannot be controlled in the individual. The effects in people with medical issues such impaired kidney function/diabetes/allergies/sensitivies is unknown. Also, impact on small children and people who drink high volumes of water is not truly known.\n\nLong term impact on the environment is an unknown.\n\nHowever 'choice' is the issue and this is our right - to choose what we put in our bodies.",
