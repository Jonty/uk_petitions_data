            "background": "It seems to me that vast sums of money is spent imprisoning foerign nationals. Whether they are involved in terrorism, rape, theft or honour killings, I believe if found guilty of crimes, they and their immediate families should be deported back to the country of origin and their british citizenship withdrawn.\n\nThis should also be extended to 1st generation british citizens. \n\nIt might be reasoned that it is unfair to deport the families of such criminals. But I believe it would send a clear message that Britain is not a soft touch. This would also free valuable much needed prison space.\n\nIt also might be argued that it is against their human rights. But that argument has two sides. What about the rights of British Citizens not to suffer crimes, and also of the British taxpayer not to pay for those who commit them.",
