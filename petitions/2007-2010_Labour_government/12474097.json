Over time, those events or the requirement cease to be relevant, thus the laws drawn up in response themselves cease to be relevant.\nIt is therefore suggested that such laws are subject to a 'Sunset Clause' so, if not specifically renewed, expire after a given period. This would ensure that the Statute Book remains relevant",
