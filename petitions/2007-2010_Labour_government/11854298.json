After the fall of the Icelandic Banks, in which the hospice had over \u00a35 million invested in the Goverment has told them they will not offer ANY financial help.By doing this the Goverment is turning its back on the children and families who get such great care from this amazing place. I am doing this to get the british public to make a stand for a fantastic charity, one we all hope we will never need help from.",
