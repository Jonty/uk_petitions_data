Even before these cards are introduced, the government are talking about fines and penalties!  NO ONE has ANY RIGHT to FORCE these on the rest of us.  The government have NO RIGHT to fine/punish us for not purchasing a card or keeping you up to date. Where are the reperusssions to the government for losing our personal data? The choice should be ours. Either a referendum is called or an alternative party takes power.",
