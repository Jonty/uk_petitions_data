            "background": "We believe that the proposed Ford Eco town will damage the environment and should be rejected\n\n- 5000 houses between 3 small villages (Climping Yapton and Ford) will reduce the area to urban sprawl\n- Other local villages will be badly affected by the traffic generated \n- Building by the sea means there are only 3 ways into this area - the traffic system will be completely overloaded, or if more roads are built, will become more polluted and less safe\n- The 'Eco Town' will have no individual identity as it will be bounded on all sides by main roads and the adjoining villages\n- The proposals are based on out of date information\n- The are insufficient work opportunities to support this influx of people\n- This area has built much new housing in the past 15 years, from the Littlehampton seafront development to the houses in Horsemere Green Lane in Climping, and the new Housing Association developments in Yapton and Littlehampton.\n\nWe accept locally sympathetic development where this does not overload the area - the Eco Town will be a disaster for our environment and will concrete over many green fields in addition to the 'brownfield' areas that the Developers claim for the site",
