            "background": "Mr Darling's \u00a32.7 billion emergency package to raise tax thresholds was designed to compensate the 5.3 million households who lost out as a result of the scrapping of the 10p tax rate - but this wouldn't have been necessary if monetary measures, like the intro. of the euro dollar, were carried out with proper consultation, analysis and parliamentary debate.\n\nShort - term economic measures only win or lose elections - the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to reassure the electorate that govts consider the long - term welfare of British citizens, acting as a govt. rather than a political party.\n\nWith political pressure to avoid unpopular tax rises ahead of a general election, the IFS said the Government may be tempted to increase borrowing - can I urge the P.M. to maintain it's traditional tax and spending rules.\n\nThe IFS said that raising tax thresholds this year is already set to take borrowing to \"within a whisker\" of the Government's self-imposed ceiling of 40% of national income. So I urge the P.M. to manage budgets as housekeeping - with a little left over for a rainy day.\n\nI don't really understand the \"big issues\", but suspect that more people will soon be selling them !",
