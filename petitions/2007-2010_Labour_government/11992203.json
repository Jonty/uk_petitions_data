Early action needs to be radical and the absolute priority of any government.  We urge the Prime Minister and indeed all politicians to set aside party political issues and treat the matter akin to the way a serious national emergency would be addressed.  There is a real danger that politics will get in the way of what clearly needs to be done to address the terrifying potential that daily unfolds of a future world bereft of diversity, beauty and in consequence, morality.",
