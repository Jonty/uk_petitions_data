It should also recognise that being creative is not contingent on being paid, that an industry doesn\u2019t need to be generate millions of pounds to be considered to be productive and culturally influential.\n\nThe Creative industries have lost control over their means of distribution and the government should not legislate against file sharing to protect an industry that has been outmoded by technology. Would the government also consider it a good idea to ban the printing press in order to keep monasteries illuminating books by hand?",
