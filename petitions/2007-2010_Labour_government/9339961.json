            "background": "Until recently transsexuals could be denied access to goods and services based on their transsexual status. However this changed with the introduction of the goods and services amendment (2008) to the existing sex discrimination act (1975). This effectively outlaws all discrimination towards those individuals accessing goods and services, who are undergoing, have undergone or about to undergo gender reassignment irrispective of whether the individual in poccession of a gender recognition certificate.\nAs someone who is still experiencing such discrimination with a major supermarket, I call on the PM to address this issue to company bosses at the CBI, to force them to recognise this new amendment to the law, and thus avoiding unnecesary and potentially stressful court proceedings.",
