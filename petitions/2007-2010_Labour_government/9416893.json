            "background": "Throughout the UK bus companies demand exact change for their journeys. This means if the journey is \u00a31.50 and you only have a \u00a32 coin the company gets your 50p. The other option - your walking home.\n\nWe understand the security situation facing bus drivers but feel that our overpayment should not go to  bus companies without our permission. Therefore we request that the government creates legislation that requires the bus companies to donate any extra moneys paid to a public nominated charity.",
