            "background": "50 disabled people in Aberdeen employed at Glencraft have been told that they have lost their jobs and are unlikely to find alternative work due to the Local Authority withdrawing its funding.  How disgraceful is this decision to one of the most vulnerable groups in society.  The Scottish Government recently gave millions to Tesco which makes billions but cannot fund a factory which gives people purpose, focus and dignity.  Please support this petition to shame Politicians in to supporting vulnerable groups!",
