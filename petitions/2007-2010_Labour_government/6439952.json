            "background": "I live in a mortgaged flat on a private estate and pay two lots of service charges per month to land and flat management agents.  When I have been unemployed in the past I have received no state help towards my service charges. Ironically a non worker renting in the same block of flats got his full rent paid which includes service charges hidden in the rent.  I would like to see all those with mortgages given the same welfare as those who rent eg income support plus housing costs of at least 50 pounds per week. Also I would like to see a discount in council tax for those who live on private estates as we don't cost the council money to cut our grass or pick up litter etc.",
