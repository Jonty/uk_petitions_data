However, the even worse situation, which happens far more often, is when the ringtone is the call of an exotic bird, the theme tune of some thankfully long forgotten TV programme, or worst of all their children going \"Daddy, Daddy, pick up the phone\". \n\nThis is made all the worse when people have left their mobiles on their desk and the phone rings anything up to 8 times in the hour they're away for lunch, before someone disparingly picks it up, shakes it around and finally discovers how to put it on silent.\n\nSomething has to be done.",
