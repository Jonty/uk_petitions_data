            "background": "Look around you, everything you can see has been in a van or lorry at some point to get into your home or office. This country needs road transport.As if the tax on fuel wasn't already high enough, the recent hike in prices throughout the UK by up to 4 pence per litre in some place's is having a terrible effect on small businesses and owner operators in particular. I am a fairly new start up business and it is almost impossible to make a honest living. the cost of fuel goes up and up and our customers look to force their prices down. The tax on fuel needs to be cut in a big way now, in order to give the working man in business a chance. Otherwise there will be bankrupt small businesses all over the place, and that will do this country even more harm.",
