            "background": "As residents in Blaenau Gwent we are used to being kicked in the teeth and ignored over the years, as the rapid decline in our jobs will prove. Now we face the prospect of the \u201cgovernment curfew\u201d being set upon us at the stroke of midnight. For each night at that hour we must be in our homes as our local council are financially forced by the \u201cso-called leaders\u201d of this land to leave us in complete darkness. We are forced to be at home because it is way too dangerous to be out in complete darkness where you can\u2019t see who is lurking around the corner or where the trip hazards are in our uneven/damaged pavements. Out side our homes it is now a real treat for thieves as they can do what they want and not be seen. Also with the winter now closing in we face the problems of leaving for work on icy mornings in complete darkness with real prospects of slipping on untreated pavements because its too dark too see the danger. We urge the government to act on this right away and increase the funding to allow us to feel safe in our communities.",
