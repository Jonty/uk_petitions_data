            "background": "The United Kingdom and Iceland, though we have had our differences in the past (Cod Wars, Rockall) are both islands in the North Atlantic on the edge of Europe.  This current economic crisis has proven particularly fatal for our cousins across the water, but in the spirit of European kinship, it would be helpful to them if the British Government would provide to Iceland the emergency loan they have been seeking over the past few days.  Their hopes currently lie with Russia, who have signalled their intent to provide a 4-billion Euro loan (only \u00a33-billion).  Russian has been a very temperamental figure on the world stage lately (gas supply halts, Georgian invasion), so is it right to allow a nation of 300,000 people to become reliant upon them, so near to Christmas?  Prime Minister, please sell a few of those shares you recently bought for us in HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds TSB etc and provide a helping hand to a nation on the verge of bankruptcy!",
