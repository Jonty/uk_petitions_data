            "background": "As someone who is a complete coward, with a very low tolerance of even discomfort let alone pain, I feel very strongly that a voluntary euthanasia law is needed in this country. Objectors to this idea cite the sanctity of life; but where is this sanctity when people lose their lives via careless, dangerous, or drunken driving; or by a driver using a mobile phone or texting?  Or when someone dies from the cumulative effects of passive smoking?  Or when people in the Third World die from starvation, because people in Britain object to their taxes used for famine relief, or from the effects of climate change because the Government insists on building a third runway at Heathrow which, among other effects, makes British citizens wonder why they are making efforts to reduce the effect of this?  These are only the issues I've just thought up from the top of my head; I'm sure there are many more.",
