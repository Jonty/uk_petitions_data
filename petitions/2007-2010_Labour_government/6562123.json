        "background": "One quick and simple option for improving energy efficiency would be to make greater use of compact fluorescent light bulbs. \n\nEach one of these bulbs produces the same amount of light as an incandescent light bulb whilst being responsible for the emission of 70% less carbon dioxide. \n\nIt also saves money; about \u00a37 ($12) per year in the UK, more or less in other countries depending on electricity prices. \n\nGiven that investing $450m could save $1.8bn, it is hard to understand why anyone would still choose incandescent bulbs.",
