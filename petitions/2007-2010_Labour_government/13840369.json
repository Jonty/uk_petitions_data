            "background": "David Nutt was sacked from his position for doing his job: making statements relating to important public issues using scientific evidence and research.\nHis sacking is a blatant example of withholding information from the public for political reasons, thus potentially misleading the public. Furthermore, it shows a disgraceful disregard for freedom of speech.\nThis petition is a call to the Prime Minister to allow freedom of speech and public knowledge of what directly effects them. Without these two things, democracy is impossible.\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to reinstate David Nutt in his post as chief drug adviser and apologise for his inappropriate sacking by Alan Johnson.",
