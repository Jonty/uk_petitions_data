Dave and Virgin 1, and Sky charges for them, we will be forced to pay a Sky subscription, in order to receive what others, who receive their TV signals from a main transmitter, get for free.\n\nI call on the Prime Minister to make  Sky and Freesat provide the same channels as Freeview , as Free To Air channels.",
