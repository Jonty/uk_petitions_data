            "background": "Incinerators produce massive amounts of Carbon Dioxide, far more than a conventional gas fired powered station.\n\nThey are not economic and \ngenerate electricity at only around 35% efficiency, compared to over 65% by power stations.\n\nRecycling is cheaper and greener than incineration\n\nWhatever enters the incinerator leaves the facility, either to landfill or \u2018sky-fill\u2019. Carbon dioxide, \ndioxins and acid gases are not present in the waste; they are all created by the burning.  Burning plastic inefficiently in incinerators is not the way to manage residual wastes, making it much harder to meet climate change targets.  Disposing of a community\u2019s wastes may be their biggest \ncontribution to climate change.",
