            "background": "We would like the government to introduce a law that all bendy buses should play accordian music when they go round corners (especially roundabouts). This will improve the mood of the public using the buses and therefore productivity of those people when they work and hence improve the economy, whilst the public using the buses to go shopping will spend a little more on the high streets as they are happier and more contented, again helping the country out of the recession.",
