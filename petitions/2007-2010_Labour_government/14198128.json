        "background": "Whilst it is true that all of our soldiers are volunteers, whilst it is true that most if not all of them love army life, and whilst it is almost certainly true that the adventure involved in such as Afghanistan is appreciated by many of them, it is also true that, thus far, 242 of them have been killed in that adventure and that unnumbered of them have been injured. Of course, that is all part of being in the army and being in the army is bound to be risky. But whilst 'our boys' are running the risk of being killed or injured in Afghanistan, relatives and friends at home are going through their own hell. If it was for some advantage, we are sure that those of us at home would be more than willing to suffer our hell. But nothing has been achieved out there, nothing is being achieved, and everybody knows that nothing will be achieved. Afghanistan is a lost and very expensive cause and we still say to the Prime Minister and/or to his successor, 'Bring our boys home.'",
