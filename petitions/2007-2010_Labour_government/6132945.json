        "background": "Every day at around 9am and 3.30pm\nyoung children that can read walk past news agents with signs or billboards that have distressing news on them. I believe that there should be some control over these things. A recent example was \"15 year old boy stabbed to death\". Another was \"mother and child found dead\". I am 8 years old and am not allowed to see movies about this kind of thing. Why should newspapers be allowed to advertise using headlines like this that children can easily read?",
