        "background": "This valuable rail link was closed in the 1960's as a result of the Beeching \"plan\". The result has been increasing road traffic levels which are now intolerable particularly during the holiday season. A \"park & Ride\" scheme based in Hull and using a rail link to Hornsea over the largely intact trackbed would drastically reduce congestion, pollution and allow the residents of this beautiful and increasingly popular seaside resort to enjoy an unstressed and unpolluted atmosphere.",
