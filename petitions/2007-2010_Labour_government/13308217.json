            "background": "Everyone is sick of the nanny state. Except it seems, the men and women who sit in Parliament 'running' the country. We need people to make intelligent decisions that don't encroach on the private lives of the general public. A good example of the Nanny State is the smoking ban, you may agree with it but wait. Consider the men that used to sit at the bar in pubs and clubs and smoke and drink into the night. They were inside and didn't make noise, therefore not keeping young children, mothers, fathers, and old people awake. Now however, these men have to go outside and smoke, bringing their pints along with them. Speaking from experience, they are incredibly noisy and bad language is consistenly used. they just create bigger problems for the wider community. STOP THE NANNY STATE AND GIVE BRITAIN BACK TO ITS PEOPLE.",
