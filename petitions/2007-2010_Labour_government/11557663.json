            "background": "It is common knowledge that insurance companies:\n- makes more money on instances where there is one car and more than one driver\n- current terms are LIMITING USAGE OF THING which is ours and this is not acceptable\nMoreover, Insurance policy is against damage done to third party regardless if car is driven or empty [i.e. hand brake failure whilst car parked on a slope].\nBecause of above all car insurance policies shoild be any driver - 'anybody can drive'. Of course in terms of claims car owner is responsible and in case of no claims he/she can get cheaper premiums. This will encourage drivers to let drive their car by responsible persons who can drive safely. In addition it'll improve safety on our roads because in case of long journeys deivers will be able to swap without fear of insurance cover provided.",
