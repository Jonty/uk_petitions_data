Though this won't include the content it will include who we called & our locations.  From 2009 this data will also include our e-mails and the websites we visit.  A whole range of officials (not just police and security services) will have access to this information.  These include local councils, NHS trusts, the Department for Transport & the Food Standards Agency.  There was no parliamentary vote on this matter; it was introduced to bring us into line with the European Data Retention Directive, as the government are legally entitled to do.",
