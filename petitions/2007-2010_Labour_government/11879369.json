        "background": "Person Centred Planning (also known as Personalisation) is becoming more and more popular in the adult world, especially in the caring professions, but it is also needed in our schools.  If children are fully involved in the planning of their own education and the needed resources are put in place then the result will be happier, more motivated and better educated young people.  And, all sorts of social problems will be eliminated.",
