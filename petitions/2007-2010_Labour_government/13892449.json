            "background": "Restore the right of people to have wages and benefits paid either in cash or drafts not requiring processing by banks.\nThe ordinary citizen is virtually powerless when dealing with banks. They have to accept whatever conditions and charges the bank sees fit to impose and the fact that other agencies can access and control bank accounts seems like an infringement of their human rights.\nAs an example: pensioners in Scotland can have their accounts frozen by Sheriff's Officers acting on Summary Warrants which are not appealable and granted without the opportunity of contesting them.\nThis can result in people being denied access to the basic necessities of life as defined in the European Convention of Human Rights.\nAll organisatioms should have processes to handle monetary transactions without resorting to banks.\nThose who wish a bank account will still be able to have one.",
