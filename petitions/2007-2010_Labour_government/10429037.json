        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "MY petition is for the Government to compensate all OAPs for the loss of the 10p tax band by raising the personal allowances immediately and paying compensation for the overpaid tax to date plus a refund.  Since April 2008 and the loss of the 10p tax band, my tax code has not increased, but the amount of tax deducted from my meagre pension of less than \u00a370 per month has doubled to over 50%. HMIR tell me that there are plans to compensate people like me, in the future, but no plans to compensate anyone over the age of 65. Not all senior citizens claim benefit or pension credit and many like us, have to work in the open market in order to maintain their home and a semblance of normal lifestyle. British Senior citizens have paid their taxes to Britain far longer than all these single parents and people with ethnic or  cultural  or religeous differances, yet we have the same bills to pay at the same rate of inflation. So why are we being disciminated against and not being compensated by an increase in personal allowance like these younger groups. Why are we still paying the higher tax rate? This is ageism. If you agree please sign the petition before the next budget.",
