            "background": "We recognise that capitalism is the most viable system we have.  However, it has two inherent flaws.  It pools wealth at the top, despite the invisible hand, and it causes excesses of greed, alienation and desperation.  By periodically (once every generation or so) cancelling all debt (mortgages, personal debt, etc.) this inherent weakness in capitalism can be redressed.  Promoting social integration, enterprise, innovation and putting people back in power rather than the many being permanently beholden to the few, rather than corporations controlling how people act.\nWe believe that a general cancelation of debt would create a golden age the like of which has not been seen for millennia.  We have a growing community on Facebook and have already been tackling some of the finer details of enacting this policy.  Thank you for paying attention.",
