            "background": "As part of the re-organisation of secondary schools in Stoke-on-Trent the Director of Education & SERCO has 4 options. The favoured option being to close all senior schools, including St Joseph's College (SJC); despite previous consultation communicating no change at SJC.\nSJC is a highly successful, over subscribed, mixed Catholic 11-18 school. Exam results are outstanding. According to OFSTED the school is: \"good with outstanding features\u201d and \"Students make good progress throughout the school because learning is extremely well organised and the progress of individual students is closely monitored.\" \nYou called for an end to \"poverty of aspiration\". SJC is an outstandingly aspirational school, delivering on every policy and agenda of education. You\u2019ve talked about the significant impact your school had on you, even using your school motto upon becoming PM! SJC has the same impact on its pupils. All children deserve the right to the standard of education enjoyed by the current 920 pupils of SJC, bring the others up to the same standard and don\u2019t close one of the most successful in the country. Mr Brown, come and visit SJC and see for yourself why it should continue.",
