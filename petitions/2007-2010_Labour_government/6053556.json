            "background": "To me the calls of telemarketers are a constant assault, there is nothing I can do to defend myself. The law currently offers me no protection; I suggest that the act of unsolicited telemarketing should itself be made a crime.  \nThis is especially where they make long series of calls in short periods of time, hanging up every time someone answers the phone. This can become obscene to the point of torture or assault and can effectively disable a persons phone. These parasites and their constant calls make me so angry to the point I wish I could kill them, but unfortunately the killing of parasitic salesmen is still currently illegal. \nSurely it would be in keeping with Labours \u201ctough on crime\u201d policy to allow decent citizens some defence against these salesmen who force their way into our homes. One decent action that can be done today is to make every call a crime.",
