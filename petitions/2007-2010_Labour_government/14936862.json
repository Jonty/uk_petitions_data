            "background": "This petition has been created because I believe that all workers\u2019s that work unsociable hours should receive pay and a half more than there counterparts who work days by law. I find it hard to believe in this day and age the British government is still behind other countries like the republic of Ireland has already set up a different minimum wage just for people who work nights so why has our government not done this. \nI have found security firms are the worst when it comes to paying there employees who work unsociable hours, some companies even pay them less than employees who work days and I find this unlawful but until the government changes the law these companies will get away with it because right now they only have to pay the standard minimum wage for nights and weekends...\nSo I put this petition to you to make the right changes to the minimum wage system.",
