GRRRR!\n\nI, as a haulier find this extremely frustrating and very expensive. access to most places in london is awful and the space to park safely and unload is minimal. loading bays are few & far between now because square metres = money. 9/10 deliverys we make have no such facilities. But we try our best... and in doing so get tickets for numerous \"reasons\". so Im asking for a compromise.. please consider the need for hgvs and allow us an hour for loading or unloading or \"perhaps\" you could provide us with special bays similiar to - taxi ranks, bus stops and disabled bays - at regular intervals throughout the city.",
