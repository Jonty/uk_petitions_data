            "background": "In this current day and age political internships are extremely difficult to obtain and are usually given to Oxbridge students. Not enough consideration is given to other students which is further compounded by the lack of number of internships available. MPs should be forced to take on an intern at all times allowing them to use their expenses for something well worth while as we are tomorrow's politicians. How is a  university student from other than Oxbridge ever going to be able to obtain any experience when the world of politics is so reluctant to take anyone on if they do not have that background.",
