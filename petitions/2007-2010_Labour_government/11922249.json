This is irresponsible, firstly because the premise is not necessary true playing the Nintendo Wii does involve exercise. Watching TV,  reading books, listening to music involve no psychical activity so by the premise of the advertisement are just as likely to cause death yet none of these things are mentioned. At the same time all the benefits of playing computer games are ignored. By doing this the government is failing to properly inform the public.",
