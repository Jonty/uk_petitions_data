        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Fuel pricing in the UK has reached a ridiculous level which is now impacting almost every individual and business within the country.\n\nThe UK government says its reasons for keeping fuel taxes high are to provide a financial incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to raise revenue. The price of oil is blamed for the current pricing situation.\n\nThe simple truth is that more than 70% of the current price is tax, so the current situation is primarily within the governments control and could be simply resolved. Put simply why should uk motorists pay inflated tax on fuel if other nations do not follow suit - fuel in the US is significantly cheaper due to much lower taxation levels.\n\nPlease add your signature to this protest to ensure the government becomes as aware of this issue as they did with the recent 'say no to road charging' e-petition which did demonstrate sufficient strength of feeling to make the govenment reconsider.",
