        "background": "The election system in this Country means that if you dont want the Conservatives in, you have to vote Labour, and vice versa.  People who support smaller political parties are usually forced into voting for other parties just to prevent some even worse scumbags from being elected.  Give the people a voice.  This shouldn't even need a petition.  Introduce a PR-style system were people can put their first, second, third etc. preference.  ITS ONLY FAIR",
