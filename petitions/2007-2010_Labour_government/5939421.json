            "background": "In the current financial climate we cannot justify having three armed forces.  The Army should be disbanded, their personnel should be divided between the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. Money will be saved by transferring the The Army Air Corps assets to the Royal Air Force.  In addition the ground units can be divided between the Royal Marines and the RAF Regiment.  This will give substantial savings in the command structure with reduction of senior ranks without effecting ground troop numbers.",
