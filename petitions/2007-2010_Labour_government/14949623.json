We note that other states do currently offer alternative arrangements to the use of body scanners and see no reason why the UK should be an exception.\n\nWe understand that measures must be taken to ensure safety and reduce the risk of terrorism;, however, such measures must also be reasonable and proportionate. We are not convinced that the current implementation of body scanners in the UK meet these criteria, and further, we fail to see how offering an alternative screening process hurts either goal.",
