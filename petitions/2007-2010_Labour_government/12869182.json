There are rumours that the byelection may be delayed until the Autumn. THAT WOULD BE QUITE WRONG. If the byelection IS delayed until Autumn, then Norwich North residents will be deprived of an MP to take up their 'casework', as well as of a Parliamentary representative.\nThe byelection ought to be called NOW, so that it can take place BEFORE this summer's Parliamentary recess.\nIt is now good shying away from this contest... Prime Minister, we call upon you to act without delay, and to ensure that this byelection takes place within the next month!",
