            "background": "Professor Julia Brannen and her colleagues asked young people aged 10-12 in England about many aspects of family life, including the hours parents worked. The children in this study wanted parents to be \u2018there\u2019 for them; to provide care, help and emotional support. They wanted parents to spend time with them and to not work too hard.\nOne in two families today rely on both parents working to survive financially. This is wrong!\nFor working mums, it's a never-ending juggling act and search for affordable childcare. This is wrong!\nWomen end up in a predicament, living to pay for child care. This is wrong!\nThere needs to be more help and funding for mums to stay at home and be good role models for their own kids!\nHow do you be a Mum if your brain's fried from working?\nHow do you know where your kids are, or who they're with, if you're tied to someone's desk?\nHelp Mums have a choice - for the benefit of their kids!",
