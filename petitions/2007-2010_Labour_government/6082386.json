This was a \"Claim of Right\", which stated:\n\"We, gathered as the Scottish Constitutional Convention, do hereby acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of Government best suited to their needs, and do hereby declare and pledge that in all our actions and deliberations their interests shall be paramount.\nWe further declare and pledge that our actions and deliberations shall be directed to the following ends:\nTo agree a scheme for an Assembly or Parliament for Scotland;\nTo mobilise Scottish opinion and ensure the approval of the Scottish people for that scheme; and\nTo assert the right of the Scottish people to secure the implementation of that scheme.\"\n\nThe petitioner finds it very difficult to understand how a Minister of the Crown, or any member of the Westminster Parliament, is able to reconcile their obedience to the Claim of Right with their duties and responsibility to act impartially in the interests of all the citizens of the UK.",
