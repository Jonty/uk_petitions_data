            "background": "Wycombe District Council is planning a review of the services it provides to residents in its sheltered housing schemes.  It is looking at cutting resident wardens and replacing this service with mobile wardens who would visit on a daily basis.  This is unacceptable,accidents will happen,the community spirit will be lost and the residents will not have the security of some one on site, just a quick \"hello\" from a visiting warden and a emergency pull cord. This cannot be allowed to happen.",
