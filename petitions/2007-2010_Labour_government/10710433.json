Such a mass participation event could be incorporated into the London 2012 official marathon competition, with thousands of Jo/ Joe Public entrants running the same course, albeit starting a few minutes after the official Olympic competitors. This would be truely unique to the London 2012 Olympic Games.\n\n50,000 entrants would collectively raise atleast \u00a350 million for charities across the UK, generate \u00a32.5 million in entry fees plus merchandising, and invest at least ten million hours of sporting effort in training. What a legacy for London 2012.",
