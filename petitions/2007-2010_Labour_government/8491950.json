Let people know the impact losing it will have if we continue to disregard its value on Climate Change.\n \nCONCERNS:\n- That we are at a tipping point with nature in the UK. \n- Losing birds, bees & flowers \n- This will affect us in the long run & our food chain & ecology/ climate change\n-  I\u2019m very concerned about the lack of knowledge.\n- The widespread concreting going on to create parking & ease \u2013 do we have to loose all hedges & trees to do this?\n-  This leaves us ALL vulnerable to flooding too.  A disaster the last couple of years.\n \nACTION VALUE:\n**This is a small action (preserving hedgerow, trees and gardens 'best we can') which IS something small that ALL PEOPLE CAN FREELY CHOOSE TO DO.\n** IT WILL HELP TO PREVENT CLIMATE CHANGE & GLOBAL WARMING.  \n** IF EDUCATED & SHOWN WHAT THE EFFECTS OF DESTROYING IT HAS. \nWe can all help our carbon footprint.\n \n\nWe the undersigned agree,\nWe need more education, promotion / campaign / action on the government\u2019s part, to educate & make this a priority.\nWe can create space without cutting down & concreting. \nWe need to let people know the difference they could make.",
