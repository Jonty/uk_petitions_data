            "background": "2009 marks the 70th aniversary of Btitain's worst Submarine disaster.HMS Thetis was a brand new submarine which left Birkenhead on 1st.June,1939.Onboard were 103 men,both crew and civilians.Six hours later she was sunk on the seabed of Liverpool Bay and tragically only 4 men escaped leaving 99 to perish that day.Further tragedy ocurred during the salvage of the vessel when a Royal Navy diver died of the \"bends\".Only a stone memorial built over the mass grave where the bodies were interred,in a cemetery at Holyhead,Anglesey exists to this immense catastrophe.A fitting national memorial in the nation's capital is decades overdue.These men died in the service of the crown and hence of the people of Britain and left widows,children and parents almost destitute and fighting the Second World War without their loved one.I urge the people of Britain to support this petition.",
