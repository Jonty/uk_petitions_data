            "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to support freedom of choice and personal responsibility, and oppose prohibition of mephedrone and other \"legal highs,\" and support regulation similar to the regulation of alcohol and tobacco. \n\nThe previous Chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, Professor Nutt, said of mephedrone \"previous claims of fatalities from this drug have turned out to be false alarms. To make it illegal without proper evidence of harm would be wrong and might have unwanted consequences, such as a switch to more dangerous drugs or alcohol.\"\n\nSensationalist news stories in tabloid newspapers have turned out to be false, and should not be used as evidence in any debate on public policy. We call on the Prime Minister to listen to the views of such figures as Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury who said \"Persisting in our current policies will only result in more drug abuse, more empowerment of drug markets and criminals, and more disease and suffering\"; or Dr A.C Grayling, Reader in Philosophy at Birkbeck College who said \"Drugs should be legalised - their prohibition is an intolerable intrusion into private behaviour.\"",
