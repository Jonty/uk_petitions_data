They believe that only they are going to heaven and that everyone else on this world is going to hell because they are part of this church. It is also frustrating to know that in order to become part of this church you have to donate 20% of your income, if you don't, then you go to Hell. Some organisation is profiting from these indoctrinated children. It must be stopped!",
