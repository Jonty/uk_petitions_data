        "background": "For certain jobs throughout the UK drugs testing is mandatory.  Passing this test means that the individual can then work and pay taxes.  These taxes are then distributed as the government sees fit.  \n\nUnemployment benefit is paid out from these taxes.  It is proposed that, in order to receive these benefits, the claimants should also have to take a urine test.  Therefore ensuring that that the taxpayer is not paying for any drug habits of the unemployed.  \n\nAny argument that this is against human/civil rights can be countered by the fact that this would also be true for the people who have to do it as part of their job.  In actual fact submitting to this shows social responsibility on the part of the participant.\n\nIt could be argued that there would be an increase in crime rate, but we should not be prisoner to such threats.  Any saved money from this scheme could be spent on state rehab or more policing to fight the problem rather than paying for it and ignoring it.\n\nPlease sign this petition if you agree.",
