One of the main reasons this occurs is the individual not passing that successfully. \n\nPhysical appearance is a major factor in passing in one's acquired gender role; and I beleive FFS for transwomen and Mastectomy for transmen would lead to a better quality of life those given the surgery.\n\nSurgery would be based on clinical need, and only proceeded with once 2 medical reports had been submitted. One from the gender specialist dealing with the patient's gender reassignment treatment, and one from a qualified plastic surgeon.",
