        "background": "In Scotland, one can marry anywhere as it is the Registar that is licensed, not the venue. In this country, we do not have that pleasure as the law states a marriage ceremony must take place under a roof, in a permanent structure. We live in a beautiful country with breathtaking beaches, ruined castles, parks, mountains and woodland. Why not celebrate that and incorporate our celebrated landscapes into wedding ceremonies?",
