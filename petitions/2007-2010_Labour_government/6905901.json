However a blanket ban is ridiculous, where will it end? This would even be bad for the economy, the modifications & accessories industry is worth an estimated \u00a3320 million p.a. in the U.K. alone.\nSo please, a modicum of common sense, set an upper limit not a blanket ban.\nto prevent very loud and offensive systems being used on the road.
