            "background": "We are experiencing trying times in UK and the world in general. The global economic down turn is resulting in the painful reality of many british citizens and residents losing their jobs. It would get worse when a Prime Minister without a sound understanding of economic problems and a good track record is allowed to occupy Number 10. We need to allow Mr Brown to continue because the current climate calls for someone with the right background and expertise to fix it. Let reason and objectivity guide our decision to urge the Prime Minister to continue. He knows how to create sustainable jobs to jump-start the economy - he has done it before, he can do it again. Saying words that the people want to hear (politics of change) is different from knowing the problem, being able to fix it and actually fixing it, by a mile.",
