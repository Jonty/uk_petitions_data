This is largely due to church abuse while it had sole interpretion of reality.  This reactionary swing has stifled debate about origins and therefore knowledge.  The great presumption that \"nature is all there is and all basic truths are truths of nature\" has nothing to do with science and just as much a decision about origins as in being convinced that there is an Intelligent Designer 'behind', 'above', 'beyond' nature.",
