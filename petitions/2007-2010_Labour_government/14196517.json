        "background": "The administration industry is rife with dodgy practices and administrators just walk over everyone, suppliers, shareholders for their own greedy gains. \nFor example, i have read today that Deloitte has acted as administrator for three of the biggest household name casualties : Woolworths, Waterford Wedgwood and Land of Leather.  \n\nInsolvency partners working on Woolworths charged an hourly rate of up to \u00a3890. \nSince Woolworths collapsed in November 2008, Deloitte has been paid almost \u00a35.8m in fees. Secured creditors, such as the banks, have received \u00a3325m, but their unsecured counterparts have been less fortunate. They are getting zero, zilch, nada.\n\n \nWOOLWORTHS \nCollapsed: November 2008 \nJob losses: 30,000 \nAdminstrator: Deloitte \nFees paid: \u00a35.77m\nPlease vote to regulate the fees in this unscrupulous industry",
