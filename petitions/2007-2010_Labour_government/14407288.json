            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The UK government has spent billions of pounds of taypayer's money and borrowed billions more to bail out large banks and to stabilise the financial system. This benefits even those banks that did not receive direct assistance. The government and opposition parties all plan to make the UK public pay for this, through higher taxes or reduced public spending. This will have a detrimental effect on all our lives and on the economy in general. This is fundamentally unfair. It is a scandal, given the obscenely large bonuses being paid to those responsible for the crisis.\n\nIn the US President Obama has proposed an alternative: an additional levy on all major financial institutions over 15 years, to raise about $90bn. Such a \u201cfinancial crisis responsibility fee\" should be introduced in the UK now. This would protect the public and encourage more responsible banking. If banks are to use the UK taxpayer as insurance against financial crisis then they must pay an appropriate premium.",
