            "background": "Herefordshire County Council propose to merge Fairfield High School with Kingstone High School.  Currently the thoughts are to close both schools and build a brand new school with a capacity slightly less of the two current schools combined.\n\nThis is proposed on the basis of empty places within the schools.\n\nFairfield High School is a unique and highly successful school, achieving 'outstanding' ratings from OFSTED and regularly sits in the top 50 UK state comprehensives.  A merge will bring no benefit to any pupil.",
