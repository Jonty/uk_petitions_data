            "background": "The London University Hospital and Moorfields are carrying out research into dry AMD (age-related macular degeneration) it is called The London Project under Professor Coffey. This research is in danger of stalling, due to lack of funds. The reported shortfall is \u00a34m, a small sum when weighed against the total budget of the NHS. I ask you to support this petition, there are about 300,000 sufferers in the UK alone, gradually going almost blind, only being able to see either side of this black centre of the eye, by which time they will be a drain on the NHS.",
