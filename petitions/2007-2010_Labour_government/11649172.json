        "background": "As a member of the Armed Forces I am posted from unit to unit every 3/4 years, as a result of this my wife and children then have to put themselves on the local NHS dental waiting list. \nIn many cases this can lead to families not having any dental care whilst in that unit, the knock-on effect is that when families are finaly seen many have problems that could have been \"nipped in the bud\" at an earlier stage saving tax payer thousands.\nIn the worst case, a child could never see a dentist until his/her parents left the Armed Forces.\nThe option to go private is not a viabl one due to Forces pay.\nThe dependants of Members of the Armed Forces are posted by the Government through no fault of their own. Many had dentists in their local towns and cities but lost them due to missed appointments whilst serving abroad.\nIf the Government are willing to move the families of Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen around the world every few years then the very least they can do is provide for those families when they get there.",
