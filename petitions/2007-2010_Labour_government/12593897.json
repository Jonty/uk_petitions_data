He has shown total loyalty to his club, has been a wonderful advert for the professional footballer and done amazing works for youth and charity. I'm sure all football fans can look beyond their own club loyalty and recognize the wonderful player/man that Ryan is. \n\nIt would be a real salute for Ryan to be knighted before he left the game so true respect could be shown all around the country as he plays his final seasons by his many fans and admirers.",
