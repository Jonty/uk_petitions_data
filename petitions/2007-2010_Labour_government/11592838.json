The current absentee owners of the building wish to turn it into, two dwellings and to put a house in the car park. We say NO. We feel it is sad to see Historic buildings that proved both a service to the local community and employment for that community to be destroyed for a higher commercial gain.\nThe White Hart is a fully trading Pub and has always through history been as such. Infact the White Hart has always been a public House. \nWe want to stop the unnecessary destruction of our heritage and save this valued community assit!\nJoin our group NOW!",
