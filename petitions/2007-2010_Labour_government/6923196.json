        "background": "It is completely against all principles of British Justice and European Law that those who have contributed to a U.K. Government pension have their right to the winter fuel allowance stripped from them should they happen to be older than  others, and have lived in another European country for more than ten years. Those most in need are being penalised through no fault of their own,\nand fraudulent claim of this benefit is  not unknown. We request that the Prime Minister rectify this iniquity at a stroke  by paying the winter fuel allowance to all those entitled to a U.K. pension. It would seem fair that the amount of the Winter Fuel Allowance be linked to contributions, rather than being a fixed sum.",
