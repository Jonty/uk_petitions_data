            "background": "We the undersigned are tired of hearing how much of our money is being blown on failed governemt IT projects.\n\nWe believe that this is mainly due to the nature in which these projects are firstly procured and then delivered - that of demanding and committing to all the requirements for enormous projects up front, consigning them to failure before they have even begun.\n\nThe private sector has mostly moved away from this failed model to an incremental approach, which allows for changes in understanding and requirements and enormously reduces the chances of failure. It's about time our government did too.\n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to demand a review of the current approach and look at adopting a more incremental and agile approach to Government IT projects",
