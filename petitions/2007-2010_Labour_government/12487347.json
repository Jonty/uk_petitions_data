            "background": "Michael Martin has repeatedly shown nothing but contempt for tax-paying British citizens. Having watched him in his duties as Speaker of the House I conclude that he is utterly ineffectual and neither commands, nor deserves, our respect or indulgence. His incompetence and failure to take responsibility during the police raid last autumn is reprehensible and if the Prime Minister had had any integrity whatsoever, he would have fired Mr Martin back then. Furthermore, Michael Martin has systematically abused the expenses system and has billed the tax payer for visits abroad for the most tenuous of reasons. His role as Speaker does not involve him representing our country abroad, nor does it justify a taxi bill for his wife.",
