        "background": "ISP's have in the past and present have advertised their products as being unlimited, no caps or limitations.   Along comes a fair usage policy which says users get so much for so long then then either we get charged or our 'paid for speed'gets cut!    The internet is new and the potential for it's usage is unlimited.  Tv on demand, movies, voip are only an example of the usage thats evolved from the internet.    Capping or throttling users is a profit tactic where companies want to make profit with the old systems they have in place.   To baffle the situtation the legal jargon thats written into contracts, i feel, is not understood by a vast majority of internet users and ISPs hide behind it!",
