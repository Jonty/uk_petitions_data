        "background": "Building abroad may be cheap for business in the short term but the long-term economic and social effects are more costly than the savings businesses make by building abroad. The tax costs of the social conditions created are a burden upon British business and foreign businesses trading in the British Isles. The Government should introduce base level philosophical changes, using education as a tool, to encourage broader minded decision making processes when exercises in cost-benefit and other economic are used in the decision making process.",
