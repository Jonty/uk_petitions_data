            "background": "Unfortunately, some women agonisingly lose (or have to terminate for medical reasons) their much wanted babies at fewer than 24 weeks gestation.  When this happens, these women, despite having been pregnant for up to 24 weeks, and sometimes having to give birth to their child, are no longer entitled to maternity exemption from prescription charges.  When this devastating loss occurs after 24 weeks, this still allows full maternity exemption for up to a year after the baby's due date. I strongly believe that women who lose their babies before 24 weeks should not have to pay prescription charges in the 6 week post-partum period.",
