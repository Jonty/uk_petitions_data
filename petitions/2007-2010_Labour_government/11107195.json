            "background": "Make the chickenpox vaccine routinely available to all children as a separate voluntary jab at the same time as MMR. There is a chickenpox vaccine that is licensed in the UK (and available routinely in the US) and the disease can be very unpleasant and sometimes dangerous, so we should be protecting our children from it.\nWhen we wait in the doctor's surgery for the jabs that - thankfully - are available, we all remind ourselves how lucky our children are to be protected from the various diseases. It is illogical, then, to have a vaccine for what can be a dangerous disease, that is not being used.",
