            "background": "Her Majesty the Queen is Sovereign of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth realms. Given the high standards of tolerance in the UK and of the various ethnicities of Her subjects across the world, it would be improper for those who discriminate against non-white people to have an audience \u2013 or to be seen to have any audience \u2013 with the Queen at Buckingham Palace.\n\nSome such people have misappropriated the image and legacy of Sir Winston Churchill to suggest that he and they were of a similar political outlook. One group also continues to espouse political beliefs that are akin to those of the Nazi Party against whom this country lost many brave servicemen fighting. \n\nIt is the constitutional duty of the prime minister to advise the Queen against any action which may be deemed in conflict with Her roles as Commander in Chief and as Head of State. The attendance at the Palace of those who show such disrespect to the memory of fallen servicemen and who deliberately seek to alienate British and Commonwealth subjects would constitute such a conflict.",
