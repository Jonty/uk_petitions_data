Make radical changes to the judging system to ensure that exaggerations are not rewarded by judges.\n\n3. Stop the culling of non-standard healthy puppies.\n\n4. Legislate for a legal maximum coefficient for inbreeding as already exists in Sweden.\n\n5. Use only stud dogs over a minimum age that are unrelated, and proven healthy.\n\nLegislation to make the above happen should the Kennel Club not introduce these reforms.",
