        "background": "The UK is one of four countries that contribute money towards the funding of the Eurovision song contest.  When you consider that the contest has become a national joke, and how political the voting has become, it can't be said that the contest is helping international relations for the UK.  Surely this money should be put to better use, something of actual benefit to the country.",
