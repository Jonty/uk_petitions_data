        "background": "Cigarette packets have become a fashion accessory. Branding is used to recruit children and young people to a life-time of addiction.\n\nTobacco companies invest huge sums of money in advertising and marketing their products in order to recruit new customers, who are nearly always children and young people. Two thirds of regular smokers start before the age of 18. \n\nThe UK Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act has been effective in removing overt promotional activity.   However, since the implementation of the Act, the tobacco industry has responded by investing more resources into packaging design (as well as point of sale display) in order to communicate brand imagery and increase sales. \n\nTobacco advertising was banned in the UK because it encourages children and young people to start smoking. A plain packaging law would close a loophole which has allowed cigarette packets to become a form of advertising.",
