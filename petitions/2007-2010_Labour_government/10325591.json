        "background": "In 1974, major county boundary changes occurred and one of the greatest was the moving of two towns, Slough and Eton to Berkshire, from their original county of Bucks. The changes have caused no apparent benefits to local people and have created very awkward boundaries. The towns were in effect 'stolen' by Berkshire and would be better placed in Bucks, re-creating a smoother border and returning cultural and socially important places like Eton College to the county in which they grew up in.",
