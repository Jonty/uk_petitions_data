            "background": "The government should amend the current Law concerning Assured Shorthold Tenancies, and install regulation to protect existing good tenants from landlord exploitation or eviction. Good tenants should be given an automatic right under Law to renew their current agreements with rent increases linked to the rate of inflation. The right of landlords to evict or refuse renewal would remain unchanged for tenants who fail to meet their obligation to pay agreed rent. The amendment in Law would  apply only to professional landlords, and not non-professional landlords who may have let their property on a short-term basis. Professional landlords could be defined as those who rent out more than two properties or who collect rents into a business account.\n\nThis would be fair to both landlord and tenant help redress the current imbalance.",
