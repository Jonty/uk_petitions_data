            "background": "The announcement by the US administration today on proposed cuts to the USA's carbon emissions is as insulting as it is pointless. Whilst most nations around the world are proposing cuts of 20-30% based on 1990 figures for CO2 emissions the US is proposing just 17% based on 2005 figures. Given that US CO2 emissions have risen by c.15% since 1990 this is a complete waste of time! Please stop allowing the USA to get away with this disregard for the rest of the world by doing something more significant than simply voicing disapproval! For preference please take action before the Copenhagen conference.",
