            "background": "Students who are in college studying Performing Arts are required to do many plays/shows a year. The last 2 years at a local college, these plays have been of an adult nature and females below the age of 18 are required to dress and perform inappropriately whilst being classed as a minor. The tutors should think of more decent shows, I'm sure the parents who watch them aren't happy to see their 16 year old daughter in a skimpy corset.",
