        "background": "The East Sussex townships served by these disused railway lines (Heathfield, Uckfield, Hailsham, Horam, Mayfield etc.) have expanded massively since their closure, placing ever more strain on the Wealden road network. Quality of life, road safety, the economy and the environment are incontrovertibly compromised. The reinstatement of the Uckfield-Lewes section of the Wealden Line, and the Heathfield-Eridge section of the Cuckoo Line, would be a relatively simple, small scale project to undertake when contrasted with other recent rail schemes, but may be seen as essential to further economic growth and continued social well-being in this increasingly crowded corner of South-East England.",
