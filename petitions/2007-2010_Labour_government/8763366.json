        "background": "Ugandans are concerned at the increasing manipulation of land law by President Museveni, thinly disguised as Land Reform. The controversial Land Act 1998  has significantly devalued land. The Land Bill is potentially devastating for the poor whose only valuable possession is inherited land.  It   \ni) \tundermines centuries old customary land tenure systems \nii) \tdiminishes powers of traditional leaders from presiding over local land disputes \niii) \tattempts to centralise traditional land rights\n\nLand Reform is designed to advantage two groups: \n\n1.\tEthnic Bahima to the detriment of traditional agricultural communities   \n\n2.\tMuseveni\u2019s unethical land confiscations for \u2018Investors\u2019 who should negotiate directly with land owners. \n\nGrowing anger and resentment results in warning signs mirroring the UN Eight Stages of Genocide. \n\nThis petition seeks:\ni.\tIntervention to avert ethnic conflict over controversial land reform and land confiscations, including 9000 square miles, subject of British Buganda Agreement of 1900.\n\nii.\tAdvocacy for the land rights of ancient communities, against the  excesses of opportunistic politicians",
