            "background": "Every year, in two seaside villages in Japan it is \"traditional\" to gather the dolphins inshore with nets and then proceed to butcher them alive. These horrific events which run from November through December supposedly protect the livelihood of the fishermen. Approximately 22,000 doliphins will lose their lives this year,in the most cruel and inhumane way imaginable, and every succeding year if this is not stopped. I beg of you to sign this petition. This cannot be allowed to continue. Please, please help the dolphins.",
