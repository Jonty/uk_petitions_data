            "background": "This government has put all its faith in speed cameras just to raise capital.  By doing so it has lowered police levels on the road and made it a free for all.  As someone who drives all through the day the change has been noticeable in ten years.  Anyone who speeds know they are speeding and so deliberately looking out for cameras to slow down then speed up again once past.  Roads are now treated as race tracks.  Also speeding 10 miles or even 15mph over the limit isn\u2019t the be all or end all of dangerous driving.  There are many other factors what cause accidents and such as the swerving in and out of lanes and cutting other drivers up and crossing double white lines which these sill cameras do nothing to stop. P.S i am sure most people have had a driver slam on the brakes in front of them because they have mistaked a 40mph for a 30mph camera.",
