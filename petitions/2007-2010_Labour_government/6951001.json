            "background": "It is currently possible to ban pushchairs from buses under 'health and safety grounds' if the operator chooses to do so; based on access for other passengers past the pushchair.  This is despite the fact that they are forced by law to carry a wheelchair, which may be much larger, and restrict access more than, the banned pushchairs.\nThis discrimination against multiple births or small children of similar ages must stop as it has the knock on effect of creating reliance on the car from an early age and may contribute to the childhood obesity problem.",
