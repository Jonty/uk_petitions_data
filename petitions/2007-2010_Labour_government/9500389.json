            "background": "When I take my car on the continent I have to pay a toll on their roads. Every ten miles or so, every lorry, bus and car driver has to pull-up at a tollbooth and pay a fee. Why should we? Foreigners use our roads for free so why should we have to pay to use theirs? Either an agreement is reached with France, Germany, Spain etc, to leave UK drivers alone, or they pay when they come here. Maybe that would be the better idea of the two. You need cash, so take it. Not from us, but from the countless foreigners who come in lorries, buses and cars and on motorcycles to our country each year and use our roads for free. Stop that now and get some cash flowing into the coffers from a direction other than our pockets.",
