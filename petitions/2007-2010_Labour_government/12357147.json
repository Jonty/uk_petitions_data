            "action": "amend local government legislation so that elected mayors are \"weak executives\" with all their key decisions either requiring approval of the full council or with councillors enjoying a veto",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Possibly as an attempt to justify his remote, unaccountable and dictatorial style of governance, Tony Blair introduced the idea of elected mayors for our towns and cities which seemed a good idea at the time.  However, many in practice have turned out to be little dictators with councillors having very few powers to hold them to account and to stop or reverse their decisions.\n\nWe call upon the Government to introduce amendments to local government legislation so that elected mayors have to submit all key decisions, such as strategies, plans and budgets, to the full council and require a simply majority of support to have them pass or they fall.  We also require scrutiny committees to have the power to veto key director appointments and budget decisions, and for bye laws to only be a matter for councillors with no veto being given to the mayor.  We require this to also be the case for the GLA.",
