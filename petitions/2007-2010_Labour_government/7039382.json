            "background": "The present system of Athens passwords\nexcludes readers who may be registered\nas an external reader in a university\nlibrary but who are neither students\nor staff members of that institution.\n\nAs libraries increasingly throw out the paper copies of journals and books with the excuse that these are now available as 'electronic resources', the digital divide increases between those with an Athens Password by virtue of status and interested scholars without this access.\n\nOrdinary members of the public are also put at a disadvantage when wishing to access records held in The National Archives or consult those official statistics held electronically as a\nresult of not having Athens access.\n\nThis petition suggests one concrete measure that would cost virtually nothing to implement but which is\nentirely compatible with the PM's\nrecent speech on liberty. Making\nAthens Passwords available as of\nright to every member of a public\nlibrary is the logical extension\nof earlier campaigns to unchain\nbooks and teaching folk to read.",
