She has already spent more than 13 years in detention and faces another 5 years in prison.\n\nShe is one of more than 2,100 political prisoners, imprisoned just for peacefully calling for freedom. They face horrific treatment in prison, banned from receiving family visits and denied proper medical care.\n\nThe peaceful people of Burma have suffered terribly for too long.  It is time the UK government took action and stopped condoning this disgrace.",
