            "background": "In 1980, Zimbabwe was one of the most promising nations in Africa.  Today, it is economically the worst performer.  Human rights abuses, including the rigging of elections, the arbitrary arrest and beating of political dissidents, and the abuse of prisoners, are serious problems.  Mishandled land reforms give land to inexperienced farmers and cause famines.  This is a country in meltdown, and the blame lies squarely on the dictator, President Robert Mugabe.  Intervening seems now to be the only way to save the people of Zimbabwe from this evil man, and that is exactly what this government should do.",
