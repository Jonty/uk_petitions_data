            "background": "Equestrians are the most vulnerable of road users and need increased access, yet they have not been included in recent access-creating legislation, for example, the access given to walkers in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Over 4 million people in the UK ride horses or drive horse-drawn vehicles. The equine industry is the second biggest land-based industry estimated to be worth \u00a34 billion and to employ 150,000 people.   The current coastal access proposal should be extended to provide access for all non-motorised users thus allowing mixed family groups to exercise together.  This would be consistent with the joint Government/Industry-backed Strategy for the Horse Industry, published in December 2005. Providing access for equestrians and cyclists, as well as walkers, represents better value than just providing access for walkers.",
