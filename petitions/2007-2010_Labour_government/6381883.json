Not to my knowledge, or how about these prisons, let's free them up by releasing other prisoners EARLY!? This is madness, now Gordon Brown is trying to blame street crimes and violence on Violent Games. Name me an incident which relates to video games? He is saying that teenagers should not be allowed to play them. Well if parents were smart enough to take responsibilty for their children, then maybe teenagers wouldn't be going out on the streets, wouldn't have access to knives and alcohol. Gordon Brown is doing a poor job in my honest opinion.",
