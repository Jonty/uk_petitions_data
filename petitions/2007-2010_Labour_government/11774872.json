We the undersigned would like to see Jerusalem made the English national anthem, ans used instead of God Save The Queen at all occasions when the English national anthem should be played, e.g when the English nation are playing at sport (for example versus Scotland or Wales, where the playing of the British national anthem is quite stupid as it's partly their anthem too).  God Save The Queen will still be used when the country of Britain is being represented, but England will always be represented by the playing of Jerusalem.",
