            "background": "There is no proof that forcing all vehicles to have lights on at all times reduces the accident rate, and the very few studies which have been used to support this viewpoint are deeply flawed in their conclusions. \n\nThere is, however, evidence which suggests that the extra unnecessary lighting can mask more vulnerable road users, such as cyclists and pedestrians, thus increasing injuries to them. \n\nIn an age when energy conservation has become a point of concern, the extra fuel which would be used is also a factor to consider.   To the individual driver, this cost would be minimal, but across the millions of miles traveled by all vehicles every day in the U.K., the extra fuel consumption would be considerable.",
