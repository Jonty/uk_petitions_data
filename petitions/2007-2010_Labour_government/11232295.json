            "background": "The British Food and Drink sector requires a coherent, focussed and centralised effort from the UK Central government to help promote this key business sector on the global stage.   It is pivotal to the economy both in terms of underpinning UK employment but is also central to facilitating trade development in all sectors of the economy through cultural exchanges between our trade partners (whether for exporting or FDI) and the UK.  Piecemeal and adhoc arrangements will not be enough in the downturn we need focus, which means funding.",
