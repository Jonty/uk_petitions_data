            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A blanket approach in reducing the speed limit will do little to reduce road deaths, especially if drivers are forced to stare at their speedometer to ensure their average speed does not creep over at 51mph, instead of watching the road ahead. Councils are unlikely to ever request the speed limit to be raised due to potential litigation that will ensure from accidents that may occur. A more pragmatic approach to road safety is required, with reduction of the speed limit on certain roads, a raising of the limit in others, but more importantly, a shift from concentrating on speed alone to driver training. The current driving test is woefully inadequate in providing the necessary skills for a driver to cope in all conditions.",
