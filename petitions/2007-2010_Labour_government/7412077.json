No other employee would be able to defend himself against such a blatant abuse of position. I have had enough of immigration lies, justice lies, political lies, personal lies, gun & knife murders, the soaring crime rates + lenient Sentences  -- the list seems to be endless! If this government had an iota of decency, they would call a General Election at the very earliest possible opportunity. However, such abhorrent, self-seeking individuals will, I suppose, battle on dishonestly to the bitter end.  What hope for the future of this country?",
