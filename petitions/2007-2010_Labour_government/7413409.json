            "background": "Most travel insurance underwriters in the UK all operate under the same cover policy. This generic policy will not cover you for compensation for an accident you have abroad unless you lose a limb or an eye.\n\nThere is no current facility from the UK government or travel insurance underwriters for compensation of those that suffer accidents or injury abroad.\n\nWe want to see travel insurance companies offering policies that cover compensation for victims of injury abroad that are not as clear cut as losing a limb or eye. Accidents happen in degrees of severity. We have stories of people who have been left in a wheelchair, paralysed from and accident abroad with no use of their legs who are entitled to no compensation. The loss or amputation of one or both legs will entitle you to compensation under the generic policy cover, however the loss of the USE of one or both of your legs will NOT be covered.\n\nThis could effect anyone at any time.",
