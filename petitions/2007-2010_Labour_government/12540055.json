            "background": "One of the biggest causes of cash-flow problems for retailers is the delay, usually 5 days including weekends, for receipt of funds from card transactions. This means that by the time a suppler has actually received payment 10 or more working days have passed. If cards were processed immediately, the retailer gets paid, the supplier gets paid and even the manufacturer could be paid all in one day. With the demise of payment by cheque and the low levels of cash payment, this would instantly remove cash-flow problems for expanding businesses, particularly small ones with growing order books.",
