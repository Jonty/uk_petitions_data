        "action": "Introduce Positive Descrimination for Britich Citizens in the Workplace",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is to ask the Government to introduce legislation to encourage UK based business\u2019s to employ British Citizens in preference to EU and Foreign workers. In the same way that business are required to employ a percentage of their workforce from Ethnic minorities with the use of positive discrimination. We ask that in this time of economic turmoil, with mass unemployment on the horizon. Unemployed British citizens must be given the same positive descrimination rights. With some business\u2019s in the UK now having in excess of 60% foreign labor making up their workforce, at a time when unemployment, among British Citizens, is growing this seem quite ludicrous. Foreign workers who in theory are earning minimum wage, if they are legal! Sending the majority of these earnings back to their country of origin. Foreign workers whom after a period of time are also entitled to benefits, such as family credit, Child support and access to NHS services. As a county now steeped in dept we can no longer afford this. Its time to back the people of this country in their time of need.",
