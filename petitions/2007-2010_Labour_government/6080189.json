        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The last time foot and mouth reared its head in the UK, farmers were forced to pay out-of-pocket for decontamination costs, and were also suffering from increased costs for housing animals on their property.  These costs were often in the tens of thousands.  This dealt a critical blow the the UK's rural economy.  The rural economy is essential for our national food supply, and the government must make assurances that they will fully compensate all members of the rural community who are affected by the foot and mouth outbreak, and that they will do so in a timely manner.",
