            "background": "In the current economic crisis and for the sake of urgently needed currency stability within the EU, it is imperative that the UK makes imminent moves to join the euro currency. This will help the long-term economic prospects of the UK, and it will help  shielding the UK against erratic currency moves which threaten the economic stability. The UK's economy depends also on numerous European citizens working in this country, many of whom are negatively affected by the decline of the pound. Eventually the UK risks an exodus of a work force on which its economy depends. UK citizens with assets in Europe will also be aversely affected. The reality of today is that the interests between the UK and then EU are now integrated to such a level that there is no sense any longer for the UK to remain outside the euro zone, and all Mr. Brown's 5 economic tests for joining are now largely satisfied. The UK can no longer pretend to go it alone, as is recognised through recent developments on the global economic stage. The only logical conclusion to draw from this is that the UK now takes its position within the EU seriously and adopts its long-needed role as a full EU partner.",
