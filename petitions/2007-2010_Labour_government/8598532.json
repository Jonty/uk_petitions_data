            "background": "Forcing smokers to apply for a \u00a310 permit to buy cigarettes could help people to quit, government health adviser Julian Le Grand has advised. He said some people would be deterred from smoking if they had to make the effort to fill in a form,get a photo and pay a charge.\"It's a little bit of a problem to actually do, so you have to make a conscious decision to opt in to being a smoker,\" he added.\n\nIt seems that, not content with forcing social smokers out into the cold, certain people want to tax us a second time by issuing a photo permit before we can buy tobacco products.\nThis takes the nanny state that we live in up to status of a bully state that will leave us no freedom of choice or rights of our own.\n\nThis is a continuation of the persecution of smokers, who it seems, have no rights to choose for themselves. Why should smokers be penalised in this way, when it is a legal product. What next? This would be the first step in the issue of licencing for anything that the government decided was \"not in our best interest\". Just a short step away from the issue of the forgotten ID card.\n\nSign your name here, and let's show the government what we really think of their efforts to tell us what to do and think.",
