        "background": "Petition to introduce legislation to prohibit all tobacco product sales from non-licensed outlets.\nTobacco products should fall in line with the sale of intoxicating liquor sales. There should be a maximum 3 year transition period, in which retailers have time to re-direct their sales into other areas. Only licensed on and off trade suppliers should be allowed to retail tobacco products, were they apply for and are granted a tobacco sales license. This would reduce the outlets where many underage persons are able to obtain tobacco products",
