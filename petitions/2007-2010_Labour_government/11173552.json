            "background": "Driving a car is easy and many, including me, already know how to drive a car as we have already driven one abroad, all we need to drive in this country is permission. I don't understand why we have to wait as until we are 17 if the excuse is we are not mature enough and accidents can happen. But, if the instructor finds you able to drive a car and gives the full lisence that means you are safe enough to drive a car because if not the instructor would have not given you the full lisence in the first place. Accidents only happen when you are not concentrating and believe it or not most of the people when they receive the full lisence are aware of everything around them, and then as time goes on and through experience they will get better and better. If you are not 16 yet and want to drive a car before 17 then sign quickly before you turn 16 because someday some change can happen and we will drive a car before 17.",
