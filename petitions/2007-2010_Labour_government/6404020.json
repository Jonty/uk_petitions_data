Whilst the Tomlinson enquiry did much to help some of these students, many others feel that their case was not investigated thoroughly, if at all.  All students who were adversly affected deserve to be recognised for their hard work and to be awarded their orignally predicted grades in the affected subjects as compensation.  We hereby petition the Prime Minister to conduct a thorough investigation and to accept that the original enquiries did not go far enough.",
