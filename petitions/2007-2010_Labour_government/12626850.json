            "background": "Our government has put plans forward to force a tax on all immigrants (from outside of the e.u of course) of \u00a350.  With this I have no problem.  But what does frustrate me is that these are nations which hold common morals, traditions, and above all, we have the same monarch for goodness sake! I'm talking, of course, of our cousins in the Commonwealth Realms (despite what our current government may well dupe us into believing).\n\nThis isn't a petition wholly about a small tax, it's what the tax stands for.  We have a responsibility towards these nations and we should feel a longing and almost sense of desperation that a once great relationship is not lost for ever.",
