            "background": "The goverment are proposing to close The Bradbourne School and The Wilderness School to merge them together to make an academy. This will give children even less choice of schools to attend especially if they want to go to a single sexed school. If large mixed sex academies work why is it grammar schools are still single sexed, also with the finacial situation of the country at the moment, how do the goverment justify spending millions on a project which is neither needed or wanted. Please sign to help us stop this motion going forward.",
