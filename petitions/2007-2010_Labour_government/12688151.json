            "background": "So-called complimentary and alternative medicine has made a steady encroachment into the provision of healthcare in the UK. Unproven treatments now represent a considerable threat to public health.\n\nIneffectual treatments such as homeopathy, chiropractic, crystal therapy and faith healing can dissuade patients from seeking genuine medical treatment. Misinformation spread by proponents of unproven medical claims can have a drastic impact on public health - for example, by reducing the number of people receiving vaccinations such as MMR.\n\nIn addition, alternative treatments can pose a direct risk to patients. Ear candles, for example, have left users with burns and damaged hearing. \nAlternative medicine is not a harmless phenomenon. In too many cases it has resulted in serious injury or death.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister to take steps to ensure that the NHS and other public health agencies in the UK work exclusively with science based medicine. We ask that the government refrain from investing public money in alternative medicine and work to further public awareness of the serious risks posed by dangerous and unproven treatments.",
