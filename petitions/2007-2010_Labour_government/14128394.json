            "background": "Uncounted numbers of people with sickle cell aneamia, thalassemia and lupus are being disciminated against in employment and training in the UK. Misunderstood and labelled as lazy or lacking in commitment they are sacked or thrown off training courses. The struggle to get Disability Living Allowance or challenge discriminating employers is an additional hurdle that many sufferers cannot face. Many already live with NHS services who do not have the skills,knowledge or competency to treat their conditions effectively.  All of these conditions require the focus of a national strategy, competency framework and performance indicators to quality assure the treatment they receive.  They also need to be recognised as having a disability from the point of diagnosis not after years of suffering.  Please lend you support to 'Right Disability' the 'Human Rights at Diagnosis' campaign.",
