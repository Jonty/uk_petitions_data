Its streets are full of toothless ex-slappers, smoking, pregnant no hopers and fight happy chavs. Most cant even string an expletive free sentence together and when they can its usually bigotted rubbish. Friday and Saturday nights the centre is a war zone and to be honest never a pleasant place to visit except from 20,000ft above with your finger on the release of a nuclear device. It appears that human evolution has forgotten this town and the general populous should be protected from what has far overstept a simple case of inbreeding",
