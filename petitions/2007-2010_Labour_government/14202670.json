            "background": "Cardiff City Council propose to close two very successful primary schools (which are not at all undersubscribed) and replace them with a single new school with substantially less places, ostensibly to force pupils to attend other, less successful schools in the area.  The new, overcrowded school may even be spread across two sites on opposite sides of the village.  This proposal is neither good for children's education nor is it the best way to achieve the council's stated objectives.",
