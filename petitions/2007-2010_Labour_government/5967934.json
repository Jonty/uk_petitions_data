            "background": "The blanket smoking ban is, I believe to be contrary to the human right of choice. As smokers we are banned from smoking in enclosed public places, ie pubs, clubs, \"bus shelters\". I believe that this is taking things too far. We should have certain places where we can socialise and still enjoy a smoke. The government still reap massive income from our smoking habit, so why treat smokers like second class citizens. Allow smoking areas in public places where the owner/keeper agree to it.",
