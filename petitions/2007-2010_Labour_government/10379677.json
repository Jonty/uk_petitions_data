        "background": "As a resident of Collier street, I and many of yourselves are sick of the increasing number of \"Sat Nav\" HGV drivers that use the B2162.\nAs residents we have to suffer the pollutive effects of lorries and the dangers of them straddling both sides of the road, especially on narrow bends.\nAnother issue is the vibrating and shaking of our homes as the lorries thunder past at upto 60 MPH, just meters from our front doors, the lorries are damaging the roads that the county council, seem uniterested in maintaining, to any decent safe standard for residents or fellow road users. Potholes are just patched over, until the next heavy down poor, when the potholes just re emerge.  \nThe B2162 was not designed to withstand such abuses as can be seen by the continous damage to the verges and the villages two bridges, one of which is Medieval and KCC and MBC seem to be uninterested in the plight of local village residents and are quite happy to see the flagrant disregard, that local companies display by using our \"quiet streets\" as rat runs.\nPlease do inform neighbours and friends to sign up.",
