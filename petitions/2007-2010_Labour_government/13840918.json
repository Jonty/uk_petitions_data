        "background": "I know it has been a tradition to set off fireworks on the 5th of November, but people are taking advantage of this and also set them off at new year and haloween. Some people do it just for the sake of it. Myself and others would like it if fireworks could be banned for good as they are very dangerous. They are used by youngsters in a stupid way, either it be for hurting animals or hurting others.",
