            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "***Thousands*** of people in this country are allergic to Natural Latex Rubber. Sufferers in contact with NLR experience many reactions, from skin rashes or asthma, to extreme anaphylactic shock which could result in death. For those with a latex allergy, life is severely restricted because latex is not indicated on labels. When they buy products, they have no idea whether any particular \"rubberised\" surface could cause terrible problems that day. When they buy foods, they have no idea whether they have been prepared by someone wearing rubber gloves, or using a process containing rubber. It's believed by experts that around a third of food is contaminated with latex either during processing or packaging. Allergens in food are labelled. Why not latex? It's just as dangerous to those with this allergy. Please act to make this law so that everyone suffering from latex allergy can live a freer, better life, be more healthy, reduce chronic illness  and live longer. No one should have to live in fear of being poisoned by food or normal household items, when a warning label indicating the presence of NLR could prevent this.",
