        "background": "1000s of houses are being converted into flats.  What was once a whole house is now 2 flats for example, however, most times the noise between two flats cannot be avoided due to poor or no sound insulation.  normal noise such as walking and moving around the house can be very disturbing.  As legislation, landlords must install and have tested sound insulation where there is a problem of noise between two flats, also laminate flooring should not be allowed if someone is living downstairs.",
