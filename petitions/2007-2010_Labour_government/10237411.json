            "background": "Isn't it about time that someone looked properly at public spending. Today's story in the Express stated that the cost of a Union Flag is \u00a334.95 each when buying large quantities when within 2 minutes a simple internet search for flags to MOD specification finds flags at \u00a333.20 each. If one company can be found in two minutes a full search is almost certain to find many companies capable of producing a flag to the correct specification.  It may only be a saving of \u00a31.75 or 4.6% but when money is tight everyone must tighten their belts and Procurement Departments must work harder to ensure best value for the public purse. Speaking as a Purchasing Manage I would expect a saving when buying in thousands against the single piece price so the savings should be even higher. It makes my blood boil when I keep seeing prices that are paid by professional procurement departments that bear no relationship to prices that anyone else would pay. Just imagine what would happen to taxes or oil prices if a 4.6% discount could be gained on all public spending.",
