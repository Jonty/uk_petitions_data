            "background": "The tragic case of Scarlet Kealing highlights a common concern in critical incident management - in the UK and overseas : that of the involvement of the press. Commendably with the Caldicot principles and the Human Rights Act the Blair administration made headway in addressing category A offences - but it seems peaceful, law abiding citizens have their private grief invaded by parasitical newspaper editors. This kind of voyeurism on other people's grief and distress makes me sick and makes emergency services difficult to function. Can we as a nation not somehow address this problem - because next it could be YOU and YOUR DAUGHTER ! All completely illegal !",
