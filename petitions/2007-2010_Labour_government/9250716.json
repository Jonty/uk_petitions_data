        "action": "meet the unmet demand of hundreds of schools facing a shortage of teachers under a Government crackdown on the employment of foreign staff, experts have warned.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Rules coming into force in September will stop state schools employing staff who lack official Qualified Teacher Status in a drive to boost standards (Fairy Nuff)... There are many aspects of education policy that also need addressing - take my experience for example - suspended twice, bullied at work and received a poison pen letter ... hardly surprising that you cannot get the staff ! \n\nIf academics at London's Institute of Education (IoE) believe one in six of the capital's school workforce could be affected - the British govt should look at training - whilst I was on a PGCE, I had to stop because my temporary contract was suspended - what kind of professionalism is this ? And, indeed, what kind of supervision of public sector organisations by the state ? This is further justified by today's \nAOL report that over 11,000 teachers - a sixth of the capital's workforce - aren't registered, presumably because they aren't qualified.\"\n\nThe Brown administration is tired from the change over, it seems and needs to get their act t'gether !",
