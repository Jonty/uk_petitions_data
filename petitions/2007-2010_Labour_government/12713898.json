MPs who are standing down as a result of outrage regarding their behaviour should not continue to benefit from generous financial packages.  It is a national disgrace, Gordon Brown should end the pay offs if 'leadership means anything within the political system of this country! MPs who agree to step down should be made to do so with immediate effect the only reason they are not is they continue to milk the system it is hipocrisy. End it now Gordon Brown!",
