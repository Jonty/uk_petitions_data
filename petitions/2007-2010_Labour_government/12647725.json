            "background": "ATV Quad Bikes that are road legal are classed as a PLG, (Private Light Goods), and should be treated the same as a car, they produce very low CO2 emissions and therefore should be exempt from Road Tax or pay the lowest premium under the CO2 emissions section of DVLA.  After all Quad Bike riders/owners are doing their bit for the environment with low CO2 emissions, so we need a better incentive.",
