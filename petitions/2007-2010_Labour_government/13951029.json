Mr Straw's assertion that, if introduced, secret inquests would only be used in a tiny number of cases is either incredibly naive or deliberately misleading. It is inevitable that secret procedures would be justified and used in an ever increasing number of instances.\nThe only protection for our civil liberties is to allow no exceptions from public scrutiny.",
