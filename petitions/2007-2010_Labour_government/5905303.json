I DO NOT pay MY licence fee money every month to pay YOUR fines! It is scandalous! It's nothing more than stealing, we pay for decent <yeah right> programmes, NOT to pay your court costs! Make them scrap the fee and take adverts like the other channels do, then see everyone drop the BBC like a hot potato and \nstop watching the rubbish we have to currently pay for! Disgusting.",
