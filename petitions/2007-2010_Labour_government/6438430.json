The report focuses on the working age population which is women aged 16-59 and men aged 16-64, not exactly the age group you were looking for but fairly close. The data show that 59 per cent of working age Londoners who lived in local authority housing were not in employment (2005). Data source: Annual Population Survey 2005 (Office for National Statistics). Please note: We do not have information about whether this group were in\nreceipt of benefits or not as the analysis did not cover this.\n\nI want the Government to get more council tennants back to work.",
