These allowances for travel have not changed from 2002/03, these being:-\nFirst 10,000 business miles in the tax year and then each business mile over 10,000 in the tax year - \nCars and vans 40p and 25p respectfully\nMotor cycles   24p and 24p \nBicycles          20p and 20p \n\nThe employee should not be required to subsidise their employer when using their own method of transport to do their work.\nPetrol and Diesel have increased substantially as has road tax and insurance.  In addition, depreciation has increase on cars and is forecast to increase especially when they have done more mileage than average.\n\nA change is required now to fairly reimburse the employees and continue simplicity for claiming expenses.",
