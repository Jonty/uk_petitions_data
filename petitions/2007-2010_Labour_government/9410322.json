            "background": "Food products containing carmine-based food dye may prove to be a concern for people who are allergic to carmine, or people who choose not consume any or certain animals, such as vegetarians, vegans, and followers of religions with dietary law (e.g. kashrut in Judaism and halaal in Islam).\n\nIn the past several years, doctors in Michigan, Switzerland, and France have proven that the colorings can cause allergic reactions, including sneezing, asthma, and anaphylactic shock.\n\n\"A coloring that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive individuals should be required to be listed specifically on labels,\" said Dr. James Baldwin, clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Medicine.\n\nAlthough concerns of hazards from allergic reactions were raised, the use of carmine in foodstuffs is not banned in the EU. However, the use of carmine in foodstuffs has been discouraged by European food safety authorities, and although it is predominately used as colouring in alcoholic beverages, it can still be found in foods such as supermarket Indian curries.",
