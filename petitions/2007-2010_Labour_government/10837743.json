            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In view of the current Credit Crunch and the increase in home repossessions we feel that it is about time that people with credit problems are allowed to draw down from their pension fund monies to pay off debts and therefore secure their current quality of life. e.g. a mortgage could be repaid in full and this would allow refunding of the pension or other savings to be carried out because of the mortgage payments being reduced or cleared completely. Currently investors are losing life savings in shares and other forms of investment products as we have seen with the Bradford & Bingley disaster. This move would reduce stress for families and reduce the so called toxic mortgages from the system. As you probaly know, if you have a Self Invested Personal Pension, you are allowed to drawdown cash so it would only take some legislation change to allow people to pay off debts with money that is locked away for a long time.",
