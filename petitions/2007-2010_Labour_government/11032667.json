            "background": "In the wake of two BBC scandals in the space of a fortnight, I would like to see the BBC paying more attention to the views of its licence payers.\n\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t tune in to either show, however if I had I would have been outraged. To think that the BBC produces a variety of shows every month, and not just those that are tailored to my particular tastes is an absolute outrage. I am also shocked to learn that presenters may be making jokes about things on some programs. The BBC needs to consider its licence payers before commissioning a show; I may not watch Gardeners\u2019 world, but a bit less gardening would be nice, and a few dancing girls wouldn\u2019t go amiss. It\u2019s an outrage.\n\nI also urge that Chris Mole MP resigns following his thoughtless comments about Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s thoughtless comments about prostitutes. Mr. Mole suggested to the media that Mr. Clarkson should lose his job, doing so with complete disregard for the feelings of Mr. Clarkson or his family. It is an outrage.",
