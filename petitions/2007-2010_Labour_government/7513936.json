What happened to wanting to increase the numbers of PCSO's by April 2008?\n\nMy application is 'Pending'\n\nThe home secretary rasied the minimum age to 18 on December 1st, but all PCSO's already working who are under 18 will not be sacked and will continue to work within the police service. Unfair?...\n\nPCSO's play a positive role in our communitites makeing our communitites stronger and safer.",
