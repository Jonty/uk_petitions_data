        "action": "Means test winter fuel payments and allow the disabled to receive the same monies as pensioners.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I have believed for many years that the winter fuel payments should be means tested as I know personally lots of pensioners who are exceptionally well off, yet they receive this money, and my husband, who is disabled and cannot work (he is 48) is not allowed this payment.  Why are disabled people not included in this payment system?  How many people are so disabled they cannot get around or are wheelchair bound - are they supposed to freeze or get into debt to pay their fuel bills?\n\nOther benefits are means tested so the government cannot say it would cost too much or take too much time to do this, that would be a feeble excuse.  So please prime minister, think about the disabled in this country also.  You may find also that because so many pensioners are well off, if you means tested the benefit, you could save yourself a lot of tax payers money.....",
