These MP's ahve abused the trust bestowed upon them and committed blatant fraud. These MPS should be investigated by the fraud agency or police and punished accordingly. If a member of public had committed this, not only would we have to pay the amount in question back, but we would also be charged interest and face prosecution and the MPS that have chosen to abuse the publics funds should be made a show of and given harsh punishments. We dont want swimming pools, or barges cleaned or mortgage repayment errors, WE WANT AN HONEST BRITAIN and an HONEST MPS that lead from the front.",
