Instead, they have openly battled insurgents resulting in the deaths of thousands of civilians in the crossfire, and are guilty of serious human rights crimes and violations such as unlawful kidnap and restriction of aid. \nBetween the actions of the TFG and the rebel insurgents, the people of Somalia are dying from unnecessary violence, disease and famine. Sign this petition and give them a new hope of survival.",
