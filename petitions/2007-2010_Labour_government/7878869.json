His music is known and loved throughout the world from early hits \"Gloria\", Here Comes The Night\" and \"Brown Eyed Girl in the Ring\" to his more recent successes \"Whenever God Shines His Light\", \"Rave on, John Donne\" and \"No Guru, No Method, No Teacher\".\n\nThough a friendly outgoing member of the community, little is known  of his charity work and humble community service he performs in East Belfast as a window cleaner.\n\nA knighthood is long overdue",
