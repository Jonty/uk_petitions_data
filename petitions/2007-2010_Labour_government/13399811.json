        "background": "During the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, Britain and her armed forces have been at the forefront. Inevitably, whilst fighting for their country, many have given their lives and mothers have lost their children. To date 395 soldiers have died, up to 14 in a single day. I feel and I am sure others will feel, especially in heavy loss of life, that we as a nation should acknowledge this sacrifice. I leave the government to decide the minimum number of deaths on a given day/week to offer a state funeral but my recommendation would be 3 deaths.",
