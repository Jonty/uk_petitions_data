        "background": "The eminent scientist David Nutt has been removed from his post because peer-reviewed scientific evidence conflicted with government policy.\n\nDespite the Science and Technology committee being in broad agreement with David Nutt and the rest of the scientific mainstream, the Home Secretary and Prime Minister seem to consider themselves better informed than people who have devoted their entire careers to these issues.\n\nOverriding peer-reviewed scientific research when formulating policy is arrogant, foolhardy and in this case sends a message to vulnerable people that crack cocaine and heroin are no worse than ecstasy.\n\nI humbly request that the Prime Minister retract the sacking of David Nutt and base all subsequent policies on evidence.",
