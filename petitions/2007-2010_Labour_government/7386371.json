Government estimates are that there are 175,000 young people under the age of 18 who are engaged in the care of their parents. One in ten of these younsters works for over 50 hours per week in providing care at no cost to the public purse but at great personal cost.\n\nPlease vote to give these children their childhood back.\n\nThe cost of fully financing the vital work of The Princess Royal Trust for Carers in this area from the public purse is under \u00a32,000,000 per annum.\n\nThey provide essential support to, often isolated, children and need funds to supprt and extend their outreach work in support of young people and with schools in helping to identify those in need.\n\n\nPlease support this petition.",
