        "background": "London Midland terminated their service along the Walsall to Wolverhampton line in December 2008.  At a time when we are encouraged to leave cars and move to public transport, a vital service was removed and requires the vast majority of journy's originating from Walsall to travel via congested Birmingham New Street, or use the 529 bus to reach Wolverhampton.  We urge the Prime Minister to return this essential link to the rail network to support the travelling general public of Walsall.",
