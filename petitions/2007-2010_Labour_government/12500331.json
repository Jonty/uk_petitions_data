They, like the rest of the world, need to sort out their own problems.  If the majority of the people allow themselves to be repressed then they should stop putting up petitions on this website soliciting help from the british government and spend time helping themselves.  What is going on in Sri Lanka is nothing to do with the british voter/taxpayer.",
