        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We have limited space for the installation of solar energy in the UK. Railway platforms are in general well exposed to sunlight.\n\nPut out to private tender long term contracts for the installation of solar cells on rail platform roofs. Existing roofs can be upgraded or new roofs installed with solar cells feeding into the national grid. \n\nThe railways will benefit from the upgrade or installation of platform roofs paid for by the winner of the tender. Travellers will benefit from not getting rained on. The cost to the taxpayer may well be zero, or even a net benefit. The environment will benefit from reduced CO2 emissions. And they will not be eyesore.",
