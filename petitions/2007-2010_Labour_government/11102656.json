            "background": "The current criteria for claiming entitlements for returning UK Nationals is open to misinterpretation by the DWP and as a result can lead to severe hardship for those affected.  \n\nDespite many amendments to the original policy, in particular Lord Slynn\u00b4s recommendations following the Swadding case, legitimate residents are still being penalised. \n\nI propose a new test is introduced to determine Habitual Residency which will exclude returning UK nationals, particularly those of pensionable age and those who have been in employment abroad.\n\nCurrently, returning UK Nationals are expected to wait an \"appreciable amount of time\" before being accepted as Habitially Resident. The term \"appretiable amount of time\" is subject to the interpretation of the DWP\u00b4s \"Specialist Decision Maker\" and is  clearly inappropriate for returning UK Nationals.",
