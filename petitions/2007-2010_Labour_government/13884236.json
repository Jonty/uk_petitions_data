        "background": "We the petitioners ask that the following questions be asked of the British people in a referendum.\n\nWe the petitioners believe that we should restore democracy with three simple questions, no rhetoric and a finality that will legitimise our participation in the European project or allow the Nation to remove itself from a Federal Europe we have not yet voted on.\n\nThe three questions we propose that the British public be asked are as follows:\n\n1. Do you wish Britain to be a sub-state of a Federal Europe Y/N.\n\n2. If the British public votes to leave Europe, would you like to negotiate to become a trading partner with Europe Y/N.\n\n3. If the British public votes to stay in Europe, would you like to join the Euro Y/N.",
