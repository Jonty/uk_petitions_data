            "background": "In recent years a number of motorways in the UK have been extended to 4 lanes and had variable speed limits added to them.  Whilst in busy periods the speed limit on these sections are decreased to control the traffic flow, I believe the opposite should happen during quiet periods, such as overnight, when the limit could be increased to 80-85mph.\n\nThe same is also true for toll motorways such as the M6 toll where traffic levels, even during the day, can be very low and make increased speed on these safe.\n\nIn both instances, the roads in question have been recently constructed or resurfaced making road conditions safe for these increased speeds.  Obviously in adverse weather conditions, the speed limit should remain 70mph as is the case on the continent.",
