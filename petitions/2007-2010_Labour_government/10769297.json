        "background": "I have been told by Windsor Life Assurance that they are unable to release to me Open Market Option forms in a time scale of less than 3 weeks. I contacted the FSA who inform me that they have been monitoring this company since February.It beggers belief that I run the risk of a reduced pension because Windsor Life Assurance cannot action paperwork in less than 3 weeks Why is it that organisation set up by this Prime minister will not act on known shortcomings in less than 7 months.\nGiven that their inertia led to the Northern Rock fiasco it would seem that they are unable to intervene on behalf of the public until someone has lost money so what purpose do they serve. The organisation should therefore be closed down.",
