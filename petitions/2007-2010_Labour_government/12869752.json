            "background": "Naomi House hospice which cares for terminally ill children was recently told by the government that it would not be compensated for the loss of around 6 million during the banking crisis. Surely at a time when MPs and bankers have been exposed for siphoning tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds into their own back pockets, they can find the loose change of 6 million pounds to help these children. Go on, make an effort to show us that you can stop playing the system for all it is worth at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer, to help somebody instead.",
