            "background": "SAVE SMALL SCHOOLS\n \nThe policy could mean the closure of some village schools, including ours at Lydbury North,South Shropshire, not for educational reasons but for financial ones. This will have an adverse effect not only on the children attending these schools who will have to be bussed up to 6 miles but also on the wider rural community, both social and economic. We would encourage the County Council seriously to consider their actions.",
