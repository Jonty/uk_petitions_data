            "background": "We petition Gordon Brown to save the Teesside Steel Industry from closure in January 2010.  The government appear to show no interest in the manufacturing sector of the UK economy.  We want them to make available credit on a commercial basis to assist Corus keep Teesside Cast Products open during the time it takes to emerge from the current recession.  Other European countries have supported their steelworks and manufacturing industries through the recession.  It costs less money to keep people in work than to make them unemployed. Alternatively, we ask that they find a buyer for the works or nationalise the steel industry and protect this sector of manufacturing that is always the engine of industrialisation in any economy. We ask that you act now. Save our steel, our jobs, our communities and our heritage!",
