            "background": "The RFA have been supporting the Royal Navy for the last 100 years. Its personnel are expected to spend large amounts of time at sea. Unlike the Royal Navy they are not guaranteed a shore post nor do they retire after 22 years service, often they serve until the age of 65. Yet to qualify for a long service medal they have to serve for at least 20 years, one of the longest amount of service required for a long service medal.\n\nLong service medals for other organisations have the following Criteria\n\nArmy/RAF/ Royal Navy Long Service Medal-15 Years required\n\nVolunteer Reserves Service Medal \u2013 10 Years required\n\nCadet Forces Medal (for Long service) 12-Years Required\n\nSpecial constabulary medal (for long service)- 9 Years\n\nThe amount of years needed to qualify for a RFA long service medal should be reduced.",
