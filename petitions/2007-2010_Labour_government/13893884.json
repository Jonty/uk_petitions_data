        "action": "Abolish VAT on Silver Coins and Bullion to bring equality with the No-VAT position on Gold",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the UK, people have enjoyed being able to invest in Gold Bullion and Coins with no VAT to pay.  However, Silver coins and bullion suffer VAT at 15%, soon to go up to 17.5% in January 2010.  This disparity is illogical and grossly unfair, and penalizes people of lower wealth who have now been priced out of the gold market completely.  We ask to Prime Minister to abolish VAT on silver to bring it into an equal playing field with gold to allow the less well-off to invest in precious metals without the inbuilt-loss of 15% (soon 17.5%) the moment the silver leaves the dealers shop.",
