        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The board of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust have appointed an \"Interim Chief Executive\" on a three month contract.  The UHL NHS Trust board have told the Public the contract is remunerated at \u00a3100,000 and addition to this the Board have agreed to pay the \"Interim Chief Executive\" accomodation and living expenses for the duration of his contract.    The UHL NHS Trust have told the public that the \"Interim Chief Executive\" will be on holiday for 3 weeks during this contract. The UHL NHS Trust Board have told the Public that they made a considerable severance payment to the outgoing Chief Executive.  How has the UHL NHS Trust board been allowed to squander public money on this appointment? The Rt Hon Alan Johnson MP should as Secretary of State for Health, issue a full statement letting the Public know why their money has been spent in this way. Alan Johnson should also give a statement with either his support for the UHL NHS Trust Board or voice any concerns he may have about how effective Government money (for which he is responsible) has been spent by the UHL NHS Trust.",
