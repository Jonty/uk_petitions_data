It would be a fitting tribute to those who served in the conflict and to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice to turn one of the ships that survive into a museum and memorial. There is the memorial at the National Arboretum which names all those who lost their lives but it would be fantastic to have ship that can be used as a museum where people of future generations can visit and ex-servicemen could take their children, grand children and even great grandchildren.",
