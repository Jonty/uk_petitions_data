            "background": "a few weeks ago an elderly woman was killed by an hgv in lanark, scotland. this was the second death in 2 years innvolving lorries. lanark is a traditional market town with parts of the high street that are quite narrow.  lorries get held up and they are too big to see pedestrians crossing between them. local councils should consider whether it is better to force lorries to bypass towns or whether the risk of accidents is acceptable.",
