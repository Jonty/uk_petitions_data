It is a \"hidden\" tax of 8% of a self employed persons net profit. Class 4 is is compulsory and not an accountant in the land can explain why we have to pay it,or where it goes [other than the Treasury of course]. If this tax was scrapped it would have no impact on the overall financial state we are currently in BUT it would greatly assist all the self employed people in the U.K.",
