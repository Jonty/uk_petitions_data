            "background": "Rochdale Infirmary is being down scaled from a district general hospital to an \"urgent care centre\" or \"health campus\". This will mean that any trauma victims that would normally go to Rochdale Infirmary will no longer be taken there; they will instead be taken a further 7 miles to Oldham. Stroke victims from Rochdale, Baccup, Todmoreden and  surrounding areas will be diverted a further 6 miles to Bury. All patients which are suspected to be having a heart attack will be sent either to Oldham, Bury or North Manchester (a further 14 miles). The Silver Heart Unit that was bought by the people of Rochdale through countless fund raising events is to be closed and the equipment moved to another hospital. The Childrens Unit one of the largest in the region is to be closed, any parent turning up at the urgent care centre will be sent to Oldham. Out of hours there is to be only one doctor on site to cover all the patients left in the hospital. We urge the government to re-think these plans.",
