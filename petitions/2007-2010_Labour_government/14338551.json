            "background": "It has been established that the main cause of global warming in Britain is the internal combustion engine. I propose that all public transport to and from a place of work is made free.\n\nVouchers issued from the workplace would make sure that the system is not abused, they would only be valid to and from the workplace during start and finish times. They would be paid for with the money laid aside to combat global warming. Most people will take the option and leave their cars at home because of the cost saving.\nExtend this to include cheap freight and trucks will only have to deliver to and from the nearest rail line.",
