            "background": "The Package Travel Directive, and the UK Package Travel Regulations, are in urgent need of amendment.  Following the Court of Appeal case of R v CAA, and the recent issuing of a Guidance from the DBERR, the rights of the Consumer are at risk.  Travel Consumers face a continued battle to right the wrongs within their holiday contracts, as is evidenced by our report to the EU Commission & DBERR, in October 2007.  The present Guidance on what constitutes a 'package' adds further confusion, and does not adequately protect the consumer from an industry apparently intent on 'de-regulating' the package holiday.  This is a consumer product enjoyed by many millions of working people and their families, only the amendment and strengthening of those hard fought rights, will promote a fair and balanced travel market.  We call on the UK Government to work toward pressing the EU Commission, and EU Parliament, to urgently work toward amending and updating the current Directive, before more consumers suffer detriment within their holiday contracts.",
