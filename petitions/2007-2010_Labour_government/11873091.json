Sign this petition to campaign against the use of animals in circuses and to demand a change in current laws to make the use of these poor creatures illegal.\n\nSee also the RPSCA campaign: http://www.rspca.org.uk/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RSPCA/RSPCARedirect&pg=circuses \n\n\"The RSPCA does not believe that wild animals' needs can ever be met in circuses and that confinement, constant transportation, abnormal social groups and inadequate winter quarters all cause suffering.\"",
