We all want peace in our time, PM, internationally, and locally, safe communities in which to bring up our families and freedom from fear for peaceful law abiding people : Acts for which the perpetrators can be held to account, through legal (ie non - journalistic) legitimate means, brought to trial, prosecuted and imprisoned.\n\n(Please feel free to read this in parliament).",
