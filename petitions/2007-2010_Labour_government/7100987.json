        "background": "The benefits exist because of the tax we have all paid over a sustained period. It is wrong and unfair that people who have made no contribution should start claiming benefits . Once they have worked here for a cumulative period of 3 years (the cumulative factor allows for any time spent out of work) its not unreasonable for immigrants to start claiming benefits. This system would still give them access to greater benefits far quicker than 99% of countries but would be perceived as more fair by the existing citizens.",
