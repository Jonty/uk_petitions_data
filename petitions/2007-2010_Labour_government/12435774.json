            "background": "Bromsgrove DISTRICT council has never been above the poor category. It stopped itself from being administered 100% 6 years ago by the gov't by applying for volountary engagement,this would have meant that they got worse than the lowest grade of poor AND THERE'S NONE LOWER! This year after 6 years it managed to get to the next rung of FAIR meaning they were getting better, but still increased council tax and reduced services by charging it's people for a green bin collection, it also stole \u00a3250K from the salt grit fund for roads and gave it to council workers in bonus's. The council needs complete 100%administration from the gov't, it's at a loss as to how to achieve a better status on it's own, at this rate it will be at least another 12 years to get the excellent status. they feel they should get now?",
