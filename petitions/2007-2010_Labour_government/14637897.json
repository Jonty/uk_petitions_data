        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The tripling of stamp duty at \u00a3250K causes a blight on the selling price of property whose actual value is in the region of \u00a3250K to around \u00a3300K. The inherent value of a property depends on the market in different regions, so this blight falls on a quite arbitrary fashion on sellers.\nFor example, if duty were levied between \u00a3200K and \u00a3300K at [1% plus 0.002% x (price - \u00a3200K)], the duty would rise by \u00a350/thousand at \u00a3201K and \u00a390/thousand at \u00a3299K, to be 2% at \u00a3250K, while remaining at 1% at \u00a3200K and 3% at \u00a3300K.\nThe blight on \u00a3500K+ properties is much less, because the duty rate increases in size by only 33%, not 200% - as it does at \u00a3250K.\nThe formula I have suggested is based on sliding the scale between \u00a3200K and \u00a3300K. If maintaining the present tax income were necessary, these figures could be altered, while still producing a sliding scale over a significant price range to remove the blighting of properties at any price level.",
