            "background": "Rossendale Council are proposing to close two swimming pools in the Rossendale area prior to the commissioning of a new pool. This will leave the Rossendale Valley with inadequate swimming provisions for at least two years while the new pool is built. This leaves not only the majority of residents unable to access a pool but also the minority groups ie disabled, asian community and ante natal to name but a few. The pool marked for closure is the only pool with full disabled facilities and is heavily used by the disabled swimmng club as well as all other clubs and schools.",
