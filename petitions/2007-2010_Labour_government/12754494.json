            "background": "Dear P.M.\n\nI just saw a video for a pop song that glamorized a girl poisoning her boyfriend. What sort of messages are they pedalling to kids these days?\n\nMy point is that people of an impressionable age, which is a large part of mainstream T.V. and music following, Should not be fed this type of 'entertainment' Many themes in these videos/advertisements are entirely adult. There is even a scene in a current pop video video where lady gaga is suggestively being hanged.....since when was suicide entertainment in ANY form? I am absolutely appalled at the bad taste.\n\nI'm not convinced there is a need for this type of entertainment. This isn't what I want a child having access to in the middle of the day on a Saturday which I have  witnessed. There's other ways of portraying  talent.\n\nHave people been so desensitized to what is actually being injected into the public psyche?\n\n\nI feel this is a matter of urgency, what will be on television next?\n\nCensorship laws must be reviewed.\n\nPlease sign this petition and give innocence back to our youth.",
