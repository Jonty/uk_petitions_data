            "action": "demand that UK universities either admit (and treat) students from outside the EU under the same conditions as those from within the EU, or pay corporation tax on what has essentially become a private educational enterprise.",

            "background": "Most universities in the UK pay little or no tax, having charitable status - however, their activities with regard to students from outside the EU do not merit this. They utilise facilities subsidised, directly or indirectly, by the British taxpayer - accommodation, for example - to attract non-EU students, giving them priority because they pay unlimited fees. Surely this system has little or no public benefit, either to the UK or to the EU as a whole - indeed EU students lose out - and should therefore be classed as a private enterprise and taxed accordingly?",
