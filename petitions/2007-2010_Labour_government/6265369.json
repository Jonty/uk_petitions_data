        "background": "This goverment has publicly rung its hands on the issue of binge drinking and inappropriate selling of alcohol but in fact has done nothing at all to change behaviours .When I say nothing it has actually increased drinking hours!\nThis petition insists the goverment starts doing something positive by\na) banning all alcoholic drink advertising.\nb) working with the retail sector and clubs to curb price cutting, bogoffs and promotions involving alcohol which lead to excessive consumption.\nc) to work with TV companies to lay down guidelines to prevent indavertent promotion of excess drinking by the centering of TV output on pubs or alcohol. eg The major soaps should be moved away from a drink based culture\nd) sponsorhip of sporting events by drinks companies should be banned.\ne) the damage to health  and social consequences caused by excess drinking must be actively advertised\nIn short drinking on the street, binge drinking,excessive consumption, etc should be as unacceptable as smoking.\nA culture of sensible drinking must be cultivated and promoted actively by the goverment.",
