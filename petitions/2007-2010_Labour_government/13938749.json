            "background": "Energy companies are now charging extortionate prices whilst making vast profits. Ordinary household customers, particularly pensioners and low income families, are living in fuel poverty, many foregoing switching heating on, in order not to be charged extortionate sums by the power companies. These companies should be forced to return to the old method of proper meter readings in order to produce bills and billing methods changed in order to stop the ambiguity of estimated readings, deliberately misleading print-outs and wildly varying and often inaccurate figures. Energy companies need regulating and preferably re-nationalising to prevent the kind of profiteering ordinary customers are now on the receiving end of.",
