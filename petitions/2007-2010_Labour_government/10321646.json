        "background": "Criminals are costing our Country approx \u00a330.000 per person per year. It is my absolute belief that if we offered any of the old \"iron curtain\" countries the sum of \u00a310.000, per say,to hold the convicted criminals we have here, in their prisons, we would achieve two main objectives which are indeed of great priority to this country: Prisons in those countries are what prisons should be : a place where prisoners do not wish to go back to. We have prisons here in U.K. where there is television, sport, some freedom even, the list of concessions making life easy \"inside\" is not endless but very long, so the first objective, therefore, would be to ease our prison system which is getting blogged up, and achieve a strong deterrent for our convicted criminals who would not wish to go back there hence abstain from commiting crimes. The second objective is simple: the Government would be saving quite a bit of money.\n\nThat is it, in brief.",
