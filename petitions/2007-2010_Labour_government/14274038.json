            "background": "Whilst recognising a basic right to peaceful demonstration, any such protest held at Wootton Basset would be grossly offensive to next of kin of service personnel killed in action, to existing serving personnel and their families and to the broader community of Wootton Bassett and the country as a whole. Furthermore, permitting any such protest would be likely to hugely overemphasise the level of support that these radical groups have, and would be likely to inflame racial tension.",
