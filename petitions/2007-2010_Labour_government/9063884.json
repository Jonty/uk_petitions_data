            "background": "I recently had a son born asleep at 27 weeks due to severe spina bifida.  I believe we could cut the numbers down on how many babies are affected by spina bifida if women were made more aware of how essential folic acid is when they are trying for a baby.  I recently read that half of pregnant woman don't take the advise of adding folic acid to their diet.  Each year around 500-600 babies in the UK are reported to have neural tube defects. It is thought as many as 900 pregancies a year are affected, but many are aborted.  By adding it to flour products such as bread, pregnant women would be getting their daily intake of folic acid and therefore less babies will be affected by spina bifida.",
