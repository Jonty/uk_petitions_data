            "background": "Huddersfield's consultant led & specialist maternity services closed in August 2008. Mums now have to be taken to Calderdale if there are complications during birth. There's a new midwife led unit at the Huddersfield Royal Infirmary but we want specialist and emergency care available too.\n\nThis petition is inspired by the memory of Maisie. \"A BABY girl would have survived if she had been born in Huddersfield not Halifax, her parents say.\n\nAlanna Delahaye and Glynn Bates, of Coombe Road, Golcar, say daughter Maisie would have lived if full maternity services were still open at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary.\n\nInstead Alanna was driven the extra five-and-a-half miles to Calderdale Royal Hospital in Halifax where Maisie was born by emergency Caesarean section.\n\nShe was not breathing when she was delivered but doctors managed to revive her.\nShe was left severely brain- damaged because she suffered a lack of oxygen during the time it took to deliver her\n\nThe couple were told Maisie was likely to die within a few days.\nThey  took the heartbreaking decision to take her off life-support three days later.\"",
