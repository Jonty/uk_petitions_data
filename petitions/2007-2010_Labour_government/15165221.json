            "background": "Surely the government would agree that parents who smoke around their children either in their homes or in their cars are causing harm to their health and should be stopped! We are now discouraged as parents to feed them junk food and if it is shown that a parent is deliberatley feeding them very unhealthy food all the time and making no effort to improve on their diet it is regarded as a form of neglect and yet they can smoke 40 a day if they wish while their child inhales the poison and that allowed!!! We must say NO!!!!",
