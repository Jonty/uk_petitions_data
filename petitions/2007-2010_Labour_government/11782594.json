            "background": "It is widely accepted that any form coercion into providing sexual services to a paying client is unacceptable, particularly where trafficking from another country is involved. Such coercion has frequently been equated with rape, although in reality it is the controller or trafficker who is guilty of rape rather than the client, who might well be entirely unaware of the prostitute's circumstances on receiving their consent. When the charge is the smuggling of goods for gain, trial by jury is automatically an option. Knowingly paying for sex with a coerced or trafficked person is at least as serious an offence as smuggling goods for gain and should be dealt with in a similar way at a Crown Court, where a fair, comprehensive and analytical defence will also be a priority. We therefore petition the Prime Minister to include in the current Policing and Crime Bill the right of defendants charged with paying for sex with a person or persons controlled by another for gain to opt in all cases for trial by jury.",
