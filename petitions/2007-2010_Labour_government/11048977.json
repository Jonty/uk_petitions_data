            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "UK energy companies are unfairly charging their customers high electricity prices. They seem to think that it is up to the consumer to reduce their bills by being more energy efficient while hiking up their prices. There is only so much that the consumer can do to be energy efficient. The simple fact of the matter is that the energy companies in the UK have increased their prices twice as much as other European Countries such as Germany and France. \n\nAlso since August 2008 Oil prices have fallen by 62.3%. So why do these costs not get passed onto the customer???\n\nEnergy trading is a complicated topic and they trade it by forecasting the price in the future. How can this be a fair system and it should be based on the current price of energy. \n\nPlease sign my petition to get the government to force electricity and gas providers to cut their costs related to current prices of fuel.",
