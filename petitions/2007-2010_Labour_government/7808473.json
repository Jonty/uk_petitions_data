            "background": "As a frequenter of drinking establishments, i find the idea of a government subsidised night on the beer intoxicating. After a long, hard week at work, during which our pay is eaten by increasing extortionate taxes and the little left spent on ever increasing bills, would it not be nice to get a little back? Free beer fridays, let the country unwind together! Benefits peoples mental health and the increased revenue in pub snacks, takeaways and taxis would be immense. You know it makes sense. A change in government policy would give the nation the good will factor. This is not a joke petition, but a serious request.",
