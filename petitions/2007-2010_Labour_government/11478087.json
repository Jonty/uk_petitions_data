Israel has shown no political desire to co-exist with Palestine or allow the Palestinian people to build a functioning self contained society.  Either we exist in a society with the 'Rule of Law' or we condemn ourselves to anarchy.  Israel now represents a real and credible threat to both British and global security through it's actions. The global community needs to make it clear that we will no longer tolerate the collective punishment of Palestine.",
