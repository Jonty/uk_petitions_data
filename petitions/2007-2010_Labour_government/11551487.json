            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It saves costs of commuter lateness and help stimulate the economy through utilising our road/motorway network better.\n\nThe idea is to spread the burden of demand for road usage over all 24hrs of the day. Roads in the early hours of the morning are practically empty, but in rush hour and in the day they are cram packed. HGV's take up much space on motorways and are a major cause of traffic congestion. By offering such a tax credit framework you are encouraging business to plan their resources simply in a different way, only that there are benefits to be had for the wider british economy through better road usage efficiency.",
