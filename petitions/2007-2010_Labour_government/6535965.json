            "background": "ipods and portable music players are part of everyday life. Apple alone has sold over 110 million music players worldwide. The design of ipods and most portable music players prevent customers from easily and cheaply replacing internal batteries. These batteries contain harmful toxins and the environmental impact of 110 million ipod batteries in landfill sites must not be ignored. Environmental activists have consistently lobbied manufacturers to make more ecologically sound devices. But the industry has taken small steps, such as reducing packaging.\n Trading laws must be changed to ensure that the future of portable music players does not cost the Earth. We call on the government to require all ipods and portable music players selling in the UK to be recyclable machines powered by non-toxic batteries that can be easily replaced by consumers.",
