            "background": "Town like Spennymoor Co Durham has lost Thousands of Manufacturing Jobs during the past decade. Mainly to Esatern Europe and Far East Economies.\n\nThis has had a dramatic affect on Local Shops and Pubs, due to reduced incomes and family budgets. Many families are also hit by large Council Taxes and Domestic Fuel Charges within Co Durham.\n\nI would ask the PM to carry out an investigation within SW Durham regarding re building our Manufacturing base. I would ask that he directs extra Industrial Grants to boost our local economy and to help the younger potential workers gain employment.\n\n     Many thanks,\n\n       Ben Ord",
