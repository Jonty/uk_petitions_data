            "background": "Despite the narrow minded and unimformed opinion of many, compulsory dog insurance is something that can not and will not prevent dog attacks. Many people, especially those with low incomes, will only be forced to surrender their dogs to shelters, abandon them in public places or face euthanaisa for their pet. The criminal actions of irrsponsible 'status-dog' owners should not be the financial burden of well educated and responsible dog owners. Insurance should remain a voluntary option and on the spot fines and criminal prosecution should be enforced more heavily upon those owning out of control and untrained animals of any sort.",
