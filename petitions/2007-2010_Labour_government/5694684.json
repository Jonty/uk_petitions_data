            "background": "during the spectacular failure of the MTAS selection process for Junior Doctors, Lindsay Cooke set up a support and campaigning organisation called Mums4Medics. This provided great support and encouragement to devastated and confused Junior Doctors, as well as helping those fighting for sensible solutions. She committed nearly all of her time to the campaign and I am sure contributed to saving some at risk lives amongst Junior Doctors.\n\nShe has shown true British qualities and deserves recognition",
