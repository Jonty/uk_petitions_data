            "background": "I am fed up with the discrimination of Goverment funding for children in education. For example why does Birmingham City Council , get more money per child, than say Staffordhsire County Council gets for their children in Staffordshire schools? This is yet another type of post coded lottery funding. Education should be provided for all children on a level playing field. There are enormous financial gaps with what's paid for childrens education through out the UK. This is wrong and the affluent regions always appear better off, with loads more money to spend  per child, than the Shire Counties!\nThe system is wrong and every child should be given the same oppurtunities in education; the best assistance and chances possible. After all, they are our future!",
