        "background": "marijuana is a widly use drug in the use, why the legalization of marijuana has not been passed yet is a mystery as it has less harms to the body than ciggaretes or alcohol and these things are a choice for people to smoke or drink so why not let the people have the choice to smoke marijuana if they choose to do so, so my ask to you is to be the first to legalize marijuana and live the benifits of tax payers money being wasted on police officers arresting and detaining users of marijuana, allow it to go to a better cause and if decided to go further with the legalization of marijuana to sell will high bennifits to the uk in its crisis of economic trade as think of the sales and tax if marijuana can be sold as easily as tobbacco. allowing limmitation to the extent of use is understandable with resticions to the number of plants in a house hold\nlegalization of marijuana a bennift for all and something that should of been done along time ago",
