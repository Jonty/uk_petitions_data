        "background": "For many years, the Catholic Church has enjoyed excessive privilege in schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  From this position, Catholicism has knowingly and intentionally propounded its message of sectarianism and disdain of sexual minorities, in defiance of protective legislation.  There is no place in the UK for religious privilege and discrimination such as this.  Faith schools, as my own education in them demonstrates, can be disastrous to personal development, above all at puberty.  Teaching on sexuality, of whatever kind, then depends more on dogma than demonstrable reality and truth, potentially causing great harm.  Religious tradition has no place in this matter when conflict arises.",
