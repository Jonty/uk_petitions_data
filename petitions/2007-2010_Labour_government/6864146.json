        "action": "introduce no tax measures to encourage marriage except transferable tax allowances and the removal of any tax credit incentives for couples to pretend to live apart",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Tax incentives large enough to persuade significant numbers of people to marry who would not have married anyway would have to be enormous (much larger than historical married persons' allowances), would be very unfair to single people and to other forms of household and would negatively distort the economy. It is not the role of tax policy to achieve social engineering, so it is not surprising that a tax policy in favour of marriage would not work. Personal tax allowances should arguably be transferable within all cohabiting couples and probably wider within larger working households.",
