            "background": "This petition is the result of inconsistent management of the government scheme by Cheltenham Local Authority and Gloucester Housing Association. When applying for low-cost housing the \"homebuy southwest\" project advertises houses by nomination only. Cheltenham council then need to be approached and an application is scored on a needs basis. Housing is ringfenced completely for those in social need. \n\nIn the case of Gloucester, the management is with Gloucester Housing Association who will only consider applications from key workers already resident within the area and currently homeless or renting. One of the key points of the keyworker scheme is that it is open to persons resident in the area and also to those who work within the catchment area.\n\nRepresentation to both agencies has been unsuccessful when seperate complaints were made to both agencies in February this year. \n\nWe believe that the low-cost housing project was to encourage professionals to move to the area. Current management excludes such professionals and discourages their use of the scheme.",
