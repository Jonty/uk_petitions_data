        "background": "The recall of eggs contaminated by the flock eating lead shot demonstrates the continuing health risks of lead in the environment. A large quantity of lead shot is discharged into the environment every year, much of it falling on land used for food production. The negative effect of this on public health is unquantified but, as viable and easily obtainable alternatives already exist, the continued use of lead shot in firearms can no longer be considered acceptable.",
