            "background": "It seems plausible if not likely, that the criminalization of drugs that are widely used and pose little personal or social harm merely serves to turn otherwise innocent people into criminals, lower regard for the law, and cause these drugs to BECOME gateway drugs by forcing the users into an underground black market run by organized crime.\nNot to mention the economic benefits that would come of harnessing that multi-billion pound black economy.\nAll we ask is for an independent enquiry that weighs the benefits against the harms in legalising drugs known to cause little or no personal or social harm when used, with a view to creating a more pragmatic, fairer society where one can make their own lifestyle decisions, so long as they are not harming others.",
