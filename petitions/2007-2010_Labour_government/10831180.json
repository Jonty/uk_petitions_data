This will mean government spending and political will being focused on helping the world\u2019s poor achieve the MDGs:\n\n1 Eradicate Extreme Hunger and Poverty\n2 Achieve Universal Primary Education\n3 Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women\n4 Reduce Child Mortality\n5 Improve Maternal Health\n6 Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases\n7 Ensure Environmental Sustainability\n8 Develop a Global Partnership for Development\n\nIn 2000, the UK and 188 other countries committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Half way to reaching that deadline, not nearly enough progress has been made.  \nIf we can find the resources to fight wars overseas and save financial institutions at home, we must find the resources to achieve the MDGs. We the undersigned urge the UK government to meet all our commitments  to do so.",
