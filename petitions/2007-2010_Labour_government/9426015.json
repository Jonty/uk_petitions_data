        "background": "Since Rangers FC have reached a final in Europe for the first time in 36 years, all Rangers fans thought that our League would help us out.\n\nHow wrong we were, we are now facing playing 7 games in 18 days.\n\nThe team we face in the final, Zenit, have been given 13 days to prepare for the final, with all games postponed, to aid them in becoming cup winners.\n\nWe do not request 'special treatment', we only ask for a level playing field, as almost 5 years to the day Celtic were given 8 clear days to prepare.\n\nWhy are Rangers not given help to prepare and perhaps win the UEFA cup, which would only serve in helping Scottish football as a whole?",
