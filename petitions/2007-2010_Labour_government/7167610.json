        "background": "First saw these in Italy where as you approach a speed sensitive area the traffic light overhead senses your speed and if you are speeding it turns the light to red for about 20 seconds.  A bit like a stop and go penalty in motor racing.\n\nA lot us slow down for cameras beacause we know they are there and with the cost of them these speed sensing traffic lights could be a good and effective alternative.",
