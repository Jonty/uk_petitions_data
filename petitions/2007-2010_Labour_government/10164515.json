        "background": "I consider the current rate of Stamp Duty to be wholly unreasonable and a positive deterrent to those seeking to Buy, either as  as First Time Buyers or those seeking to sell and buy as established domestic property/house owners.\nThe current levels (at June 2008)are completely unreasonable and have absolutely no bearing on the low \"paper costs\" involved in recording purchase transactions.\nIn reality, the current \"grossly unfair levels\" represents nothing more than a Politicians desire to exploit home-owners in order to satisfy Political ambitions.",
