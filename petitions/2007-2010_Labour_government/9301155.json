Please consider,\n\na) funding\nb) the best location\nc) number \n\nbut, I urge you to show how baby - friendly your policies are and consider a better option than the Dickensian practice of leaving unwanted babies on church steps or outside police stations, in cardboard boxes. Something needs to be done about this reproductive right to life. The petitioner is urging the P.M. to investigate the numbers of abandoned babies worldwide and provide facilities for them to prevent their possible deaths from asphyxia and hypothermia.",
