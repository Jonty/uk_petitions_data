        "background": "One of the most important duties of any government is to protect all of its people from persecution and crime. We are concerned about the growing support for far right parties across Europe but most worryingly for us, in Great Britain. A few of these new far right parties are fairly harmless, however one in particular has a number of senior officials with serious convictions for violent crime, many of them for racially motivated violent crime and for inciting racial hatred. We love the fact that Britain is, and dispite the deluded, illinformed ramblings of certain fringe parties, always has been, multicultural. The very real threat that parts of the country could have violent, dangerous racists as local councillors, MPs and MEPs is one we find incredibly frightening and we implore the prime minister to do all within his power to deny these individuals who have proven themselves dangerous the chance to stand for election to positions of power.",
