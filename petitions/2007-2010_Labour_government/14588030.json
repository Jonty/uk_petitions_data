        "background": "At this time some providers will not allow you to use their product for whatever you feel you want to, even though that product is your possession you have no choice other then to install their own proprietary software.\n\nAs long as the installed hardware does not infringe any copyright legislation then the hardware provider should have no say on what you do with the product, and should they choose to forcibly remove the software from your machine this should be viewed as property damage.\n\nThey could very reasonably state that by installing any application (or other software) on this device that is not pre-approved by us you will invalidate the warranty, but having a strangle hold on what can be installed and used stifles innovation and kills small business while only allowing big business to get bigger.",
