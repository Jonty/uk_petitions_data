        "background": "Open source software, if introduced correctly, could save the Government, and thus the tax-payers, thousands, if not milions of pounds. ICT costs are high as it is, but by introducing OSS we can do so much more than just save money. Everything from defense systems to imigration control would be networked on a national scale, this meaning instant access to ANY data stored nationally. We have realised, more so in the past few years than ever before, that threats of terrorism are real. ID cards aren't the ideal solution. What we need is a universal platform. A platform for all data is shared, a platform on which everything can be run symultaniously, a platform which is identical to any other system like it. A platform which can work around us, not make us work around it.",
