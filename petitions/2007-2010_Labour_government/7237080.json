            "background": "Dear Mr Brown, \n\nMy petition is that there should be a three stikes and you are out, i.e. if an individual goes bankrupt three times they are served with a custodial sentence.\n\nWe are currently going through the small claims court to recover moneys paid to a builder who did not complete a job. This builder has gone bankcrupt twice before and have verbally told us, (and the court) that he has no intension of paying us any money. He has said to me, that he will go bankrupt if he looses the case. The builder lives in his wifes house worth over \u00a3750k and as such does not give any regard to the bankruptcy  process. In my opinion the legal system fails to protect customers as rogue traders can absolove responsibility when they instigate bankruptcy, with no recource.",
