            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I, among many UK residents, regularly travel by train. The fares for my journeys are frankly rediculous and I am finding it increasingly troublesome to use the service. With this petition I hope to halve all fares for all journeys around the UK perminantly to encourage more people to use the train service. I believe many people will benefit from cheaper rail fares including students like myself who must travel repeatedly between university and home. Not only that but it will mean less people choosing to travel by car, and thus reducing congestion. Please sign this petition and enable everyone to benefit from sensible, fair rail fares.",
