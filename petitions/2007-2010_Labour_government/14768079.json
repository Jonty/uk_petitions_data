        "background": "Hundreds of thousands of UK citizens are currently claiming incapacity benefits in order to fund their lifestyle even though they are perfectly able to work. It is unacceptable that the government is aware of this problem, yet keeps throwing money at these people. \n\nPeople currently receiving incapacity benefits should be more thoroughly tested to see if they are genuine or not, in particular those that have been claiming for more than 5 years.  The system is very easy to fool, which is why so many people are able to exploit the system to gain access to taxpayers' money. \n\nSimply claiming, for example, to have an anxiety disorder should not be accepted on good faith as it is currently. Customers should be required to undergo therapy to help solve the problem. Customers should take a more active role in getting well again, rather than having the view that their benefits will last forever.",
