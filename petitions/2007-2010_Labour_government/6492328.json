To reflect this (and to test Gordon Brown's mandate outwith Fife) a general election must be held. At the moment Mr Brown and his cabinet have no right to govern, especially when Tony Blair's promises to \"serve a full third term\" are considered. If an election is not held immediately, then the 2005 Labour Election Campaign will be seen as nothing but a collection of broken promises.",
