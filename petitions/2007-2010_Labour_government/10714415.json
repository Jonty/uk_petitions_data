            "background": "The situation of the \"ordinary\", powerless, citizens of Iran is appalling; they can be EXECUTED for the slightest contravention of the most trivial laws.  This applies especially to the women: subjected to extremely strict restrictions, which often change so that they don't know where they are, on what they can and can't wear; e.g. how much hair(!) they can show from their head-scarves.  If they show what is considered to be \"too much\" they can be imprisoned; when they are they are frequently gang-raped by the guards for which  the \"justification\" is that the showing of this hair has (somehow!) sexually \"provoked\" the men who see it!  Why is it the WOMEN'S responsibility not to be \"sexually provocative\" rather than the MEN'S responsibility not to respond to this \"provocation\"?!",
