The cost could be met by a mix of public, private & one off lottery funds and should be built in a British yard so providing employment. It could be used on state and important diplomatic occasions. The cost & maintenance would not be that great compared with the money being wasted on many other projects which do not bring the pride to the nation that this would.",
