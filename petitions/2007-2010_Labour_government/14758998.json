        "action": "make an urgent public statement to explain to the long suffering electorate of the UK why it is that the Swedish government can say 'No' to EU legislation (they have refused to implement the new law on Data Retention et al) when all that our government ever tells us is that 'The EU have made the law so we - the british - are legally obliged to implement it'.  Why is it legally enforceable in these islands while the same laws are not also legally enforceable in Sweden?",

The blind and silent acceptance of these laws and regulations by our government is done only to put THEM in a good position for future employment in the EU monolith and ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the running of this now God forsaken country!",
