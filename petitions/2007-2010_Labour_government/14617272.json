            "background": "Ready meals are very common place in our supermarkets these days and most of us enjoy the convenience of these foods. \n\nIt is understandable that extra salt and sugar may be added to enhance flavour and act as a preservative, however I believe the levels to which these are added are often excessive. Whilst the quality of the packaging has improved giving us more information, the quality of the actual food itself doesnt seem to have improved at all. More needs to be done to try and lower levels of salt, sugar and fat in these foods and find alternative, healthier substitutes for these if necessary.",
