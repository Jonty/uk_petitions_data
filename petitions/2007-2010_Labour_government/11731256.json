            "background": "With the recent targeting of certain road user groups and the blatant unfairness in the current licensing regulations we feel that a review of the regulations is neccessary.\nCar drivers have one theory and one vehicle test and can then drive any vehicle of any power up to a gross weight of 3500kgs. Young, inexperienced car drivers are the cause of a high number of accidents. Lack of road knowledge, lack of skill, and other factors contribute to cause uneccessary incidents.\nMotorcyclists however are forced to take a theory test, a compulsory basic test, AND a road test that has recently been made more difficult. The restriction on power levels for a 2 year period is an unfair burden when this is not enforced across all vehicles.\nThis is unfair and discriminatory on a group of road users that reduce pollution, reduce congestion and have less impact on the road in general.\nWe ask again that the law is made fair and equal for all road users.",
