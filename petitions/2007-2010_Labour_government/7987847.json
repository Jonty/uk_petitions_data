            "background": "North Ayrshire Council are planning on closing Springside Primary School but nothing in their proposals refers to the educational welfare of the children. NAC basically wants to spend an extra \u00a33.245million of Scottish tax payers money in order for them to save \u00a353,000 of their own money. Their proposals are flawed and they are not complying to many of the guidelines laid out by the Scottish Government. \n\nOur school is the heart of our village and without this the village will fall in to decline. We are already a designated regeneration area and many residents cannot afford to send children on buses to school. We need this school for the community and the village to survive. There are other schools in North Ayrshire that need a lot of money spent on them for maintenance which have more empty spaces in them than ours, our school is in good order throughout needing very little spent on it. Children's education surely must come before the greed of North Ayrshire Council. They will kill off the community of Springside if they choose to close our school.\n\nHow can we have a proper consultation when we don't know where we will have to send our children.",
