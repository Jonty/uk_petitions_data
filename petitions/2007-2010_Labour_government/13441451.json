        "background": "TV broadcasters have a tendency to increase the volume whenever ads are shown. They should know that if it gets our attention (how couldn't it?!), it most importantly annoys people and only get them to change channel or turn the volume down, or even off, for the duration of the ads. It would certainly be in everybody's interest (and our health, to an extent), if they were to keep the volume a the same level throughout their broadcasting and this irrelevant of what is being shown.",
