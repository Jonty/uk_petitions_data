This needs resolving before flooding occurs again, more properties and damaged and lives are lost.\nRecommendation 58 of the Pitt report will help to address this risk.\n\nRecommendation 58: The\nGovernment should implement the\nlegislative changes proposed in the\nEnvironment Agency biennial report on\ndam and reservoir safety through the\nforthcoming flooding legislation.\n\nLegislative changes proposed in the EA biennial report are as follows:\n\nBetter risk-based definition of a reservoir within the\nAct;\n\nFunded powers to act at reservoirs with no owner;\n\nMandatory post-incident reporting;\n\nMore flexible enforcement powers;\n\nBetter quality assurance of inspection reports;\n\nBetter enforcement powers for reservoir flood plans; and\n\nBetter regulation of disused mine and quarry tips\nand canals.",
