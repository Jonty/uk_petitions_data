Had it have been any other hard working citizen, the company would have instantly dismissed them for gross misconduct and taken legal action for theft/fraud, therefore we feel that in this case the country that has been cheated on by it's leaders is \"the company\" and want to see those in question being treated as we would, and will not except an apology and offer to pay the money back. YES pay the money back but back into what you took it from, any public funding.",
