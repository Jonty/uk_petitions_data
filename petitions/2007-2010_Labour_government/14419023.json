            "background": "The president of Nigeria Umaru Yar-Adua is said to be hospitalised since 23/11/2009 in a Saudi hospital and has not been seen since. He did not hand over to the Vice President in line with the Nigerian constitution leaving the country in a leadership vacuum. The terrorist incident involving a Nigerian was reported and issues about the Budget for 2009 were left unattended with rumours that the President was dead. Amidst growing calls for Yar-Adua to hand-over to his Vice, the BBC aired an \u2018interview\u2019 with a \u2018President Yar-Adua\u2019 (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8453321.stm). There is no evidence that the person the BBC spoke to is indeed President Yar-Adua. The BBC neither asked \u2018Yar-Adua\u2019 any questions relating to the terrorist incident nor the calls for him to handover to his Vice in spite of \u2018Yar-Adua\u2019 been vague on his return date. Rather a message to the football team is aired which is gross insensitivity to the plight of the people. The BBC must show video or photo evidence of the Yar-Adua they spoke to else the BBC stand accused of using tax payers\u2019 money to stage an ignoble drama to provide an escape route for a power hungry African leader.",
