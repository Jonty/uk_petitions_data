            "background": "The average UK taxpayer has now been forced to lend GBP1,800 to guarantee the accounts of Northern Rock. As I have never held an account at Northern Rock in my life, can I have my money back please? I pay tax - reluctantly - for the \"services\" that the British state supposedly provides. I do not want to risk it on the fortunes of such an irresponsible institution.\n\nThe problems of those who have accounts with Northern Rock are not my problems. I object to my money - and the tax extorted from me by the government IS my money - being used in this way.",
