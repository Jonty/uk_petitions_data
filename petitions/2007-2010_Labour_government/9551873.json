        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Back in October 2007 petrol was approximately 89 ppl and the amount claimable for business miles was 12pp mile. Since then the amount claimable rose to 13 pp mile (petrol) in I think December. Since then the price of petrol has risen to 115 ppl and still goes up alost daily. I believe the IR review the amount that can be claimed every 6 months or so but this is simply not frequent enough currently. At the moment the difference is as good as a stealth tax and it is important that whilst fuel rises are so frequent the IR increases the amount claimable so that we are not subsidisng our companies or the Government.",
