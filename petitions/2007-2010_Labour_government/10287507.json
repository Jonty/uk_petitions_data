            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It seems to be a common perception amongst teenage girls living in substandard accommodation with their families that getting pregnant and having a baby will automatically give them a council flat so that they can move out of home and in with their boyfriend.  They quote instances of their friends having been given council accommodation, and in some cases, the grandparents look after the baby whilst the teenage mum parties in her own flat.  Surely this is unacceptable and is only worsening our appalling record of teenage pregnancies.",
