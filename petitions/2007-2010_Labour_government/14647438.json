The department of culture has stated that it categorically will not interfere with curatorial decisions made by the Director, and that he/she is only answerable to the Trustees, none of whom the public has any say in the appointment of, it seems unreasonable that the public should be asked to fund such bodies, and have no right to answers/consideration/reply from the Directors and the Trustees. We ask that an independent body, aimed at listening to the public over decisions made by these people be set up, and that it have the power to influence events on behalf of the public, should strength of feeling indicate that such influence is appropriate. This is required given that at present there is no voice on such proceedings, and no appeal by the public to any body or organisation that has to give creedence to their opinions.",
