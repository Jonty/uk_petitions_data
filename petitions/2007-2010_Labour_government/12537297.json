            "background": "As a citizen of the UK living in the USA I find it appalling that someone like Michael Savage is on the government\u2019s banned list to the UK.  Winston Churchill (remember him)? He would turn in his grave at this repulsive act.  How can you allow Gerry Adams, Hugo Chavez etc not to be on the list and a talk show host who happens to differ politically from the Labour government be banned?  Someone like Savage who has never caused any riots or violence as your miss-informed Home Secretary states cannot be allowed to stay on the list.  How can any government who is supposedly for the people allow such disgusting behavior from a cabinet minister to continue.  She should be fired.  If the UK has come to the point that anyone who disagrees with the government is banned then half of the UK population would be banned, maybe more.  It is an insult to decent British culture to ban a man who is conservative purely on his beliefs only. When is sanity going to come back to the UK?",
