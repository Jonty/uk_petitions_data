        "background": "Our plight began when a registered social landlord (RSL) purchased the next door property I was presented with and confronted with a bias and unjust condition that prevailed for the next seven years. That RSL were not party to the human rights act or a complaints path way to have them accountable to the public or authorities.\nSpecial exception written in to the accepted treaty by our Government to allow the housing stock to change hands to the RSLs primarily to save local authority's being held accountable in-line with housing standards and antisocial behaviour from the neighbours from hell.\nWhen these conditions were created it gave the RSLs no accountability by local authority to support the public when faced with the unsocial life standards being forced onto to their lives by others being housed in residential areas without warning or change of use to HMO type housing. This forced onto the public lives a socially engineered condition and for unsuspecting public the right to object and democratic pathway to the right of redress.",
