        "background": "Gordon McBroon revels in giving away and promising to give away, in false gestures of concern, oodles of other people's money WITHOUT A MANDATE.  We need a change in the law to stop unelected politicians like him from having authority to do so without first asking the people who are paying for it, in a referendum.  When the people give him an authority to do it them nobody can complain about it.  Until then EVERYBODY who is a taxpayer (and don't forget that Gordon McBroon is now paying less tax and taxpaying pensioners are paying more tax since 6 April 2008, so in effect he is giving away less of his own money and more of ours!) should demand to have a say in who gets OUR money.",
