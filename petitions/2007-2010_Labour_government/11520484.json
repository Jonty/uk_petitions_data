            "background": "Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) although commonly referred to as road tax, has not been linked to road maintenance since 1936, the entire proceeds contributing to central government revenues, and spent as they see fit.\nThe proposal is to replace Vehicle Excise Duty with a small increase in the duty on fuel, this would mean:\n- No more printing costs (paper, ink, postage etc.) for the renewal letters and discs used for Vehicle Excise Duty.  \n- Car Tax evasion would be a thing of the past, thus freeing up resources, and saving money.\n- The more you use the vehicle, the more fuel you will need, thus the more you pay to maintain the roads you use.\n- The more economic your driving or your vehicle, the more you benefit by using less fuel.\n- Tax exempt vehicles contribute to the road and environment that they have an impact on, just like all other vehicles.\n- A percentage of this raise could and should go towards the development of alternative fuels, a truly \"Environmental Tax\".",
