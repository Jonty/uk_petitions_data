        "background": "IT WAS their own greed that got the big banks into the sub-prime lending credit crunch crisis, and now they want us to pay for their mistake. To pay for one of the biggest financial mistakes ever, the banks, aided and abetted by the Government are going to screw the ordinary citizen who is already feeling the pinch with rising taxes, cost of food, fuel prices etc. You won't see the fat cat bankers or investment managers feeling the squeeze or any MP reducing his/her expenses. It will be a good day for all of us to have these crooks in suits behind bars. \n\nDo you agree IT WAS their own greed that got the big banks into the sub-prime lending credit crunch crisis Vote if you agree with this statement.",
