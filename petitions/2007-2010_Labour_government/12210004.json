        "background": "Earlier this month the Afghan President Hamid Karzai signed a law condemned by the country's own senators as being \"worse than during the Taliban\" for women's rights. This law not only mandates that women cannot leave the house, get a job, go to school or visit the doctor without permission from their husband, but also that they must obey his demands for sex, essentially legalising marital rape (The Guardian 31/03/2009, The Daily Mail 31/03/2009 et al.).\n\nIntervention on this issue is not from lack of respect for the culture of others, but respect for the basic human rights of all people regardless of gender. So far this subject has been shamefully ignored by the international community. We urge the Prime Minister to speak out and represent the UK in its support of equal rights for women globally and condemnation of those that seek to prevent this.",
