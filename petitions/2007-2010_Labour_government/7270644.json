Currently the number of scans offered/given depends on where you are in the country.  We believe both the 12 and 20 week scans should be offered to all pregnant women. The uniformity of services should run all the way through to the birth choices that each woman is also offered, and continue through to the equal after care of mum and baby by midwives/health visitors.",
