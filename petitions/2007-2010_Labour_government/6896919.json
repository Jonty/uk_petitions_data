            "background": "The government has, in April 2007, closed the door on settlement visas for any non-EEA who has been maintaining ties with the UK via either studies or employment. The reason is via the rule number 276A in the immigration rules so that any break in the continuity of visas will reset the clock. In the past, short breaks were allowed as long as the individual maintained sufficient ties with the UK.\n\nThe reason this is unfair is that this is a change that could not have been anticipated by anyone living in UK for the past 9 years or so, whereby in the past residents were granted settlement after 10years, and suddenly find that they are not eligible for settlement, may be removed from the UK if they cannot find an alternative visa.\n\nThis ruling is completely unfair, wrong under humanitarian grounds, and must be scrapped.",
