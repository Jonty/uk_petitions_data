            "background": "The rate of 40p for 10k miles and 25p for all mileage after the 10k has been in force now for a number of years but fuel has continued to increase with stunningly high levels on occasions.\nThe rate needs to be increased to 60p and 40p with the 60p applying to 15k miles.\nThe rate has left people like my self paying far more for their vehicles than the people who pay tax on a company car but have all their expenses paid.\nThe scheme has become impossible to finance a vehicle of any resonable standard - at this rate i will be riding a motor bike - i would love it but my customers would not be happy.\nLets make this fair.",
