            "background": "Holiday companies and hotels often double the price of flights or complete holidays during the school holidays stopping many families from getting a well earned break. Why not get your point across once and for all this year sign up to ensure that your next family holiday is up to 50% cheaper. Getting a standardised price will also ensure that the holiday companies sell more holidays so everyone wins.",
