        "background": "On the 6/10/08 ex Plymouth goalkeeper Luke McCormick was sentenced to 7yrs and 4mths in prison for the death of 2 young children, Arron and Ben Peak, aged just ten and eight years in a car accident on the M6 near Keele services Staffordshire. This sentence is a mockery and has not even closely reflect the severity of the crime an the consequences of his actions. Along with the 2 young boys, their father was also left disabled. To add insult to injury he could be out in 3yrs 6mths and allowed to apply for a license again in 4.\n\nI ask the PM to review the road laws regarding this and to impose a new law of 'Murder while in possession of a lethal weapon' as when a person is drunk and \"in charge\" of a vehicle, they do possess a lethal weapon, and should hold a maximum sentence of life and lifetime ban from the roads.\n\nAs in this case, it all to often results in innocent lives being tragically lost through wrecklessness.",
