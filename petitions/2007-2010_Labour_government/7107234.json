            "background": "Why can't we have a simple system where manufacturers are forced to include a recycling symbol on all products with a letter at the centre. Then councils can issue a simple list detailing what catagories of products can be recycled and how they can be collected. eg A=Newspapers, B=Junk Mail, C= Aluminium Tins, D=Steel cans E=Large plastic toys, F=Plastic bags etc. Then all us householders have to do is look for the letter and throw it in the appropriate bag.",
