            "background": "The executive lead member for Children\u2019s Services (education), Cllr David Kirk, wants the Hearing Impairment Unit at Woodcot School closed. He has said 'a statutory consultation should take place to close the resourced provision for deaf and hearing impaired pupils at Woodcot Primary School'. \n\nThe school already has total communication, e.g. oral/auditory and sign language embedded in the school culture. We feel that the closure would be detrimental to the hearing impaired children and to Woodcot School. \n\nThe unit at Woodcot School is a normal classroom - not in a completely separate building, which is the alternative for these children, segregation. Why don\u2019t they consider closing Wallisdean? Also, a lot of the year 6 pupils go on to the same secondary school so there has always been deaf and hearing pupils in unity for the whole of their school lives which would be a great loss for not only for Woodcot School but the pupils and all the parents involved so closely with a superb school.",
