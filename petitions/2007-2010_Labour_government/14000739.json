            "background": "With the current trend of increasing use of the railways, and the governments own desire to encourage the use of public transport to reduce Britains carbon emissions in line with international and EU guidelines, we petition the Prime Minister to consider re-opening a number of high-demand branch lines.  The current administration could drastically cut emissions by removing the number of buses and taxis from the roads, easing congestion and providing affordable, green public transport to a wider community.  The investment in the railways could be a better solution than the costly and highly disruptive road widening schemes currently being implemented - I feel this only leads to more traffic to fill the space created.  This would also aid employment, industry and revenue for the state if it were a major stakeholder.",
