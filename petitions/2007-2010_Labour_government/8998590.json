            "background": "Although the current GCSE in Geography is good, I feel that it does not provide students with ample knowledge of the countries of the world. I propose to create a new GCSE entitled \"Country Studies\", this would require students to know the capital city of each country, its leader, population and other geographical and political information. This GCSE would give students good knowledge of the world we live in, which at the moment is only known by the cleverest of students. This would not be a \"lightweight\" GCSE, it would be in the same league as maths or science.",
