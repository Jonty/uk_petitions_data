Council members are required to \u201cuphold the highest standards\u201d of human rights and \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the council. A coalition of more than 20 nongovernmental organizations from all regions of the world wrote to UN members to oppose Sri Lanka\u2019s re-election to the council, citing its government for a wide range of serious abuses, including hundreds of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, widespread torture, and arbitrary detention.-HRW\n\nMon,9 June: Vigil 1-2pm at Marlborough House, Commonwealth Secretariat for Sri Lankan journalists killed and under threat - supported by AI(UK). \nTues,10 June: 12\u20133pm also at Marlborough House",
