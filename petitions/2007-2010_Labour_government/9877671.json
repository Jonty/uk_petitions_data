        "background": "I would like to see the law changed to ensure nut and other allergy sufferes no longer have to play Russian roulette. A product should state clearly whether or not it contains nuts or other allergens and should not be allowed to use the \"MAY CONTAIN\" as a get out clause. There should be no margin for \"it may contain\", a product should state either \"it does contain\" or \"it does not contain\".  This should also extend to all food outlets.",
