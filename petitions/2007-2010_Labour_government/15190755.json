            "background": "The Ministry of Defence has introduced a policy requiring Armed Forces personnel of all ranks to travel in standard class on the railways for duty journeys.  This is \"about getting value for money\" according to Defence Minister Kevan Jones, regardless of any security or seniority considerations.  If it is appropriate for Admirals, Generals, and Air Marshals to travel in standard class, then it is appropriate for all in public service, including Members of Parliament and government Ministers, to travel in standard class during these tough economic times.  Indeed, it is indefensible to maintain this perk given the complete lack of public trust in Parliament due to the disgrace of the expenses and lobbying scandals.  We therefore call upon the Prime Minister to immediately withdraw the right to first class travel from all MPs, ministers, peers and senior civil servants, to get value for money and to set an example.",
