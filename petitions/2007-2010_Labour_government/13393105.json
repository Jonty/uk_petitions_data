        "background": "Heads, senior staff, teachers and parents are deeply concerned about the drastic cuts to senior staff at schools.  \n\nAll school staff are currently overworked at present.\n\nEd Balls' suggestion to cut the number  of Heads and Deputies, while making a saving, will do deep and permanent damage to education and to the Government.  The Government  cannot expect standards to rise any further without increasing funding to education in both resources and in staffing at all levels.  \n\nRemember that the future of the country is in Education.  Surely no-one wants to undermine the incredible work and school improvement that has taken place in the 21st century?  The best way forward is to invest in education at all times no matter how difficult this may be.",
