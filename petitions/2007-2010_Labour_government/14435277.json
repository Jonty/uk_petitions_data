            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Tha wearing of Burka's by Muslim women is a threat to the UK's national security.  We live in a society that persecuted individuals who wear hoodies or caps/hats on the basis it is hard to see the individuals face.  There are incidents of lesser crimes being commited one example is petty theft from shops by individuals who wear burka's and identifying these individuals is impossible.  Furthermore the burka is a sign of muslim women being opressed.  They wear this item under while saying it is their religion however there is no reference in the Koran that suggests in any way the bruka is part of their religion.  the burka is contirbuting to a divided Britain therehave been countless issues involving the burka again for example with passport photo's.  If a woman travels to Iran they have to wear a burka and cover their face even though it may not be their religion, this is proof that the burka is not a religious thing and instead opression for women. France and Canada are also trying to bring in a burka ban and the UK should follow.",
