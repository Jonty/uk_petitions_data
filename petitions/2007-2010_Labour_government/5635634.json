            "background": "Dear Sir,\nI (Mr.), strongly protest against the motion to construct a mega-\nmosque in the heart of London. I speak from experience - my first wife was from the muslim community, and I as an Anglo-Indian thought that I understood the muslim way of life and culture. I regret to say I encountered very strange and 'bizarre' modes of thought which in the end brought about our divorce. If this project goes ahead, it will in the end cause great distress to the British people as a whole, and I can guarantee at some point - civil disorder. I (as a Christian), am very tolerant towards all religions, but in view of recent events and trends, I, and my English 2nd wife, have to vehemently oppose these plans. To ignore our plea, and that of many others, will tip this country over the edge of everyday tolerance, Projects of this nature BELONG in the Middle East. I'm sure Ken Livingstone will always be welcome there.",
