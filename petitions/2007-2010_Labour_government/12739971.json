            "background": "Jack Straw has, in his own words, accepted \"full responsibility\" for the fact that \"psychopath\" Dano Sonnex and drug addict Michael Farmer were able to torture and murder 2 French students. At least one of the murderers would have already been incarcerated but for a string of failures by the probation service for which he, as Justice Minister, is responsible. Having admitted to catastrophically failing in his role, he should not be permitted to keep it and continue to draw the 6-figure salary attached to it; furthermore, his apology is absolutely meaningless if it is backed by no action. If he will not do the honourable thing and resign, he should be compelled to do so.",
