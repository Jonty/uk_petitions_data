Anyone not talking like a pirate shall be made to walk the plank or eat a parrot (the latter was Paul's idea, not mine.)\n3. The wearing of piratical costume is encouraged but not compulsory.\n4. The drinking of rum is similarly encouraged.\n5. Actual acts of piracy, pillaging and plundering may be tolerated if undertaken in a spirit of harmless fun.",
