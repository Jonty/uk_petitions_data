            "background": "It has been common practice for property developers to discount sold property with \"cashback\" deals and similar arrangements. The price notified to the Land Registry does not reflect the discount.\n\nWhen the purchaser then sells the property they can state the gross price (rather than net) and therefore avoid capital gains tax.\n\nThis petition requests the Prime Minister to instigate an investigation into this type of fraud.",
