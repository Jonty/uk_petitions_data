The man has abused the position of a parliamentary public servant and facilitated material consumption at the expense of tax payer\u2019s money. Mr. Vaz has claimed more than \u00a375,500 in expenses for a flat in Westminster despite his family home being a \u00a31.15 million house just 12 miles from parliament. Furthermore, he has not stated he is willing to pay back the money for superflous luxary items bought on expenses. He needs to go.",
