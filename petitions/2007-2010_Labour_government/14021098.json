        "background": "The Children Act 1989 was intended to place the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration in every family law case and to make sure that the concerns of every child in the family justice system was given due weight. This cannot happen unless those considerations are enforced as of right. \n\nThe family courts currently show a lack of consistency in taking these children\u2019s views into consideration and furthermore those views are being routinely overshadowed by appointed guardians, lawyers and judges, who continue to override reasonable wishes and feelings of the children in their care.\n\nWe urge the government to make autonomy for children who can express themselves clearly a legal right and allow the views of every family member to be given the dignity and due respect they deserve.",
