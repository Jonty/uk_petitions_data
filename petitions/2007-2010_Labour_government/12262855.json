Forcing ISPs to spend huge amounts of additional money to log this data for up to a year, jeopardizing online anonymity for an entire nation, forcing the storage of information that you don\u2019t even realize your giving out half the time, giving them the ability to spy on what you do online (with a simple warrant) for the possibility of catching a terrorist....What?\nWho is with me?",
