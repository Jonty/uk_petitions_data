An example of this was the Report Stage and Third Reading of the complex Policing and Crime Bill on 19th May.\nWe do not consider that such a hurried approach to such important legislation, particularly in the present circumstances, is an acceptable basis on which to form the law of the land.\nWe therefore call upon the Prime Minister to cancel all further legisalation, including that already in progress, until the constitutional crisis facing Parliament has been thoroughly resolved and the result of a general election determined.",
