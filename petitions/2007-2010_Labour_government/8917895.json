            "background": "It is unfair that an expression of love can be expressed if the persons involved are a female and male, but forbidden by law if they are a male and male or a female and a female if they be under 18. However, it is acceptable by law for hetrosexual couples to partcipate in an expression of love if they are over 16. What kind of signals does this send to homosexuals, and why does a country who prides itself on tolerance have such a law in practice?",
