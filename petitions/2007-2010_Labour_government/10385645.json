I heard about this on the news a while back and I'm quite suprised it's not been raised as a petition.\n\nThe government should not allow child benefit (and associated benefit) claims for children that are living overseas.  This is yet another 'PC law' which just increases taxes and provides no benefit to either the British Economy or to the British people.\n\nIt also provides a massive loophole to those people wishing to defraud taxpayers.",
