            "background": "The Guardian 17 Nov 07 reports that DEFRA is planning an emergency package of cuts (\u00a3300m) that will badly affect environmental agencies including those leading developments in recycling, energy saving, carbon emissions and nature protection.  This is incredibly shortsighted at a time when the UK government is attempting to present itself as being in the forefront of combating the adverse effects of climate change. DEFRA's responsibility to ameliorate the effects of 2007's natural disasters such as the recent flooding and livestock disease must of course be discharged, but it must not be allowed to adversely affect its ability to support those agencies that are working to combat climate change in the longer term.  The government must ensure that DEFRA's funding is made sufficient to allow these agencies to continue their good work and develop further strategies to educate and help our citizens and the business community to contribute to saving our environment for future generations.",
