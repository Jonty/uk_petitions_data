            "background": "Veterans Day is a public holiday in the United States, and I feel that we should honour all those who have fought for and died serving our country in conflicts around the world.  As those who served in the great conflicts of the twentieth century become fewer and fewer it is vital to remember their sacrifice and that of others - making 11 November (or the Monday following if that day should fall on a weekend) a bank holiday for National Remembrance day would be the perfect way to do this.",
