        "background": "The beautiful village of Dartington in South Devon is in danger of losing its unique identity as a result of South Hams District Council's plans to develop the nearby town of Totnes.  Not only is Dartington subject to almost all the overspill development from the council development plan document, which could be shared amongst 13 other parishes, but   Dartington could also be subject to even more development when the rural areas development plan is published in 2008. Sign this petition to make the South Hams Forward Planning Team think again.",
