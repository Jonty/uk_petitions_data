The driver of the car was given a 12 month driving ban and a \u00a31000.00 fine.Just after jody was killed another young girl was taken Katie shields. She was killed by someone speeding and all he got was 2 years in prison and a 5 year ban. Then in November Lawrence higgins was killed on his motorbike and the other person involved got a \u00a3200 fine and 6 month ban. In the same week someone who stole some money was given a 21 month prison sentence. Is money and property worth more than a life in this country . If you believe not like us please sign this petition so we can get justice for our innocent victims.thank you.",
