        "background": "Yet again Ormskirk & surrounding countryside is subject of a destructive 'superhighway' bypass proposal that will rip the heart out of the countryside the proposal is a 6km 165 Feet wide Superhighway.  Roads like this should always be a last resort, the councils record of promoting green options is very poor, There are virtually no cycle lanes, school traffic is a problem as there are few school buses provided by the council, The council hasnt promoted better, cleaner, greener options and at the end of the day, is being stuck for a few minutes worth this total destruction of a massive area of our country side? I think we all know the answer to that.  \nThere are many ways you can help and say no to this destructive plan.  The Green Party, Friends of the Earth and Protect Rural Ormskirk are fighting to stop this road being built.",
