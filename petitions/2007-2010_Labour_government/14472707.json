        "action": "implement legislation requiring manufacturers of portable music players which use volume-limiting technology, to remove the volume limiting upon the request of an adult purchaser.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The use of volume-limiting technology in music players is insulting to the intelligence of consumers and renders music players virtually unfit for the purpose for which they are designed. We use music as a stimulant, as a relaxant, as a meditation and as a retreat. We want to plug ourselves into our own musical world and immerse ourselves in it. That's what music players are for. We believe that adult consumers, being deemed old enough to engage in sexual intercourse, drive motor vehicles, drink alcohol, vote in elections, and join the armed forces, should be allowed to decide for themselves how loud to play music through their own headphones.  We therefore demand that manufacturers be legally compelled to remove volume limiters upon the request of an adult purchaser who agrees to assume responsibility for the consequences.",
