            "background": "It has now been accepted that people can rip their personal music collections to a PC for use on a personal music player. But the same is not true for DVD's. This is both stupid and makes people who are normally law-abiding have to break the law if they want to use network media players. It is perfectly reasonable to stop people ripping DVD's and Blu-rays for other people but it makes no sense for personal use in one's own home.",
