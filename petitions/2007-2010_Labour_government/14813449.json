            "background": "As the population ages we face the prospect of an increasing number of aging drivers on our ever increasingly busy roads. My proposal is to introduce a free, but compulsary, driving test and an independent (ie not the drivers GP) medical check on everybody aged 70 or above and then every 5 years after that. This means those fit to drive could continue as long as their health and skills allow.",
