These include:\nthe creation of animal-human hybrids,\nthe possibility for 'saviour siblings' and the removal of the need for a father on birth certificates.\n\nIn the spirit of parliamentary freedom, such issues should not be forced through by a three-line whip. Rather, they should be left up to the individual consciences of members.",
