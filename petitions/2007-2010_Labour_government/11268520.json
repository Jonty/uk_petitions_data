        "background": "A substantial amount, estimated at 200,000 tons, of recyclable rubbish is destroyed rather than recycled. \n\nUntil this amount rises, which it is unlikely to do in a recession when prices paid for recycled goods are lowering, people should be given a general bin which they can dump a certain amount of their waste, dependent on how much rubbish the council burns rather than recycles.\n\nThis could also be tied to times when people are especially busy, such as allowing people to dump all their rubbish unrecycled for a week around the beginning of their work year.",
