        "background": "Please encourage the prime minister to fight the animal rights activists which want a synthetic replacement for the bearskin hat used by the foot guards during ceremonial duties. It is a neccesity that this tradition is continued. These hats can last decades, there are stories of these lasting over 100 years, they are a worthwhile investment. Research is ongoing to find a synthetic replacement, however it is hard to find something which has the resiliance and appearance of bearskin.",
