        "background": "After the tragic events of 20/10/08 which claimed the lives of an innocent family, a solution to closely monitor the activities of Lorries and HGVs is needed. \nExamples include, but are not limited to: \n\n* Indicating then immediately and sharply entering the middle lane without any regard for traffic that may be present in said middle lane\n* Pre-emptively moving to the middle lane to overtake another vehicle that could be as far away as 200 yards, thus forcing middle lane traffic to \"bottleneck\" the outside lane\n* Performing an \"Elephant\" overtake manoeuvre on another lorry or vehicle, often travelling at the same speed, causing both the inside and middle lane to be slow to a mere 50MPH for miles and miles on an otherwise clear and safe passage. \n* Driving far too close to another vehicle, be it a car or lorry in the middle lane, making it unable  to stop in a safe distance\n\nRecent events have proven that something really needs to be done or more innocent lives will be lost.",
