        "background": "Student Loan debt should be abolished for all those who were unable to apply for student grants, for example, between 2001-2004 I attended university but the Government had got rid of student grants and therefore I had to take out a student loan.  And now they have decided to bring the grants back which is unfair for all those unlucky like me to be at university before this time.",
