            "background": "Revise the current FSA bank deposit scheme from the present \u00a335K maximum and follow the lead set by the Eire government to fully guarantee 100% all cash deposits in major banks until confidence in the banking system as a whole is restored.\n\nThe compelling reason being that despite the claim that the \u00a335K figure under current FSA rules covers the majority of cash investments, it most definately does not. \n\nA single but not solitary example is the enormous sum of money that is currently invested in SIPP's that has fled the equity market into cash deposits in recent months. By and large these deposits lack sufficient cover to protect the individual Sipp holder. Furthermore, these SIPP funds are about to be totally changed in size and value, from 1st October 2008, when a large percentage of the estimated \u00a3100BN that is contained in \"Protected Rights\" funds with other providers, who incidently are insufficiently covered at the present time if the funds are in held in cash, is tranferred into existing SIPP accounts.\n\nAction not complacency is required. Ring fence and protect these funds by legislation, its a no-brainer.",
