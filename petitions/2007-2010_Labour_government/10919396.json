I am a British tax payer and so was my wife until the birth of our first son in March.I,like most of the British people am sick to the back teeth of these ridiculous \u00a330+ fines for being \u00a31 overdrawn.Do you not think that as we the tax payers are being asked to bail out the banks(even though it is they who put themselves in this position!)that a condition of this bailout should be the abolition of this crazy practice.As a new family on only my wages for us all i think it is completely wrong for fat cat bankers to effectively steal our money.Please Mr Brown help your people\nsincerly\nKris Copeland\nLarne\nN.Ireland\nU.K.",
