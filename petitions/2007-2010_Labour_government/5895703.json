            "background": "The Government have , as usual, sidestepped a thorny issue citing the planning application procedure as an excuse for them not to say \"No, a sizeable mosque will not be built in the Greater London area\". In the current climate of Islamic extremeists threatening terror, and very little, if any condemnation coming from islamic religeous leaders, then any such plans to create any building that is to rival any of the historical and religeous monuments of the indigenous population should be refused immediatly.Even if the situation should change to one of peace, we are a predominatly Christian contry and as such should only have to tolerate any other religeons in the same way that the Christian religeon is tolerated in countries of other religeons.We should stop bowing down to the ideas and ideals of minority cultures in the U.K., these cultures need to gear themselves to integration into our society",
