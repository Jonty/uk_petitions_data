        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Estimates of the number of Iraqi civilians killed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003 either directly by coalition forces, or in the violence unleashed by the invasion, vary from a conservative 88,000 (Iraq Body Count website) to 151,000 (World Health Organisation, January 2008).\n\nA study in the respected medical journal The Lancet (2004) estimated violent civilian deaths since the invasion at 100,000. This study, which the UK Civil Service reviewed as being 'close to best practice', stated that around half of these civilian deaths were directly attributable to coalition air strikes. If excess deaths due to disease and poverty caused by the collapsing infrastructure are included the civilian death toll may be as high as 655,000 (The Lancet 2006).\n\nA day of commemoration would publicly acknowledge our national regret for the widespread death and suffering that has been caused by the invasion and also serve as a permanent reminder of the human costs of \u2018liberal intervention\u2019",
