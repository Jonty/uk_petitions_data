            "background": "This Government has seriously let the British public down by allowing secure data to be transferred without the appropriate precautions resulting in millions of families being exposed to identity theft. What is even more upsetting, disappointing and worrying is that the average family are unable to risk identity fraud with the cost of living forever increasing. This last blunder is that of a series that have occured under both Blair and Brown and therefore I feel it is only fair to the British people that a general election should be called, and for the present Government to step down.",
