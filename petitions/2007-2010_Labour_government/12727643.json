            "background": "When the requirements for Private Hire (minicabs was decided upon in 2001, there was a rule that the Operator needed to have planning permission to use the base as an operating centre.\n\nThis was set up to stop Operators just setting up offices wherever they felt was appropriate rather than where the licensing authority felt was appropriate.\n\nThe planning permission requirement was written into the legislation as a protection for the public.\n\nIt was therefore surprising when the March 2007 PCO Notice 09/07 removed the requirement for planning permission.\n\nSince the planning permission requirement was abolished it has led to Minicab offices opening up everywhere in London, including nightclubs, restaurants and hotels.\n\nThese offices are run simply by a man with a clipboard taking bookings from the public and a row of minicabs waiting for the work he gives them.\n\nThis situation is seriously endangering the safety of the public as these are clearly not reputable Minicab offices.\n\nOperators also regularly look for work on the street. Any bookings taken on the street are illegal and therefore uninsured.\n\nThe need for planning permission needs to be re-instated to protect the public.",
