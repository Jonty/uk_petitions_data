That is 1 for every 0.916 miles in either direction. Is this wasteful, pointless signage being repeated elsewhere. How much is it costing and why do we have to be more frugal, pay more road tax and fuel duty for the Ministry to spend it all on repetitive unsightly hoardings displaying a motoring message that motorists can't leave or do anything about. Are they intending to show films for in-car entertainment. Did the Minister approve this madness. What is the Carbon footprint of this insane project.",
