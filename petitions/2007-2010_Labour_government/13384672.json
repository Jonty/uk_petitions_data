We are told that we are fighting the Taliban in order to help Afganistan's woman and girls, but when President Hamid Karzai passed a law making it legal for Afgan men to STARVE their wives if they were denied marital sex, we did not see Gordon Brown order an immediate troop withdrawal as he should have done. \n\nWithdraw our troops now and use them to protect our ports and help police and the intelligence services in the fight against home grown terrorists.",
