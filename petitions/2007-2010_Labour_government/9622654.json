        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "By restricting HGV's, and other slow moving traffic such as caravans, to the inside lane on all Motorways from 06:30hrs - 19:30hrs, Monday to Friday, traffic congestion would be reduced.\n\nThe above measure would stop Lorries on our motorways overtaking each other and blocking the middle lane. This would allow cars to use the middle and overtaking lane permitting free flowing traffic. \n\nConvict, via the penalty point system, car drivers that remain in the middle or overtaking lanes when there is no need to do so. Again this will promote free flowing traffic.\n\nBoth the above measures would allow Motorways to be more useable and therefore traffic would not be stuck in hold ups for no reason, everyone would use less fuel and their journey time would be reduced and as such I commend this idea to the house.",
