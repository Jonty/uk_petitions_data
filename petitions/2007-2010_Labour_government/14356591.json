        "background": "UK-owned North Sea Gas peaked in 1999.  This winter we are importing 50% of our supply from abroad. Those foreign fields in Norway and Holland will also peak some day soon. What happens then? N and NL will want their own finite supplies for domestic use. Russia already supplies 50% of EU gas. The only usable heating alternative is coal at this point.",
