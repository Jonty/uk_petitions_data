They are perfect have, 10 tiny fingers and toes, they are a boy or a girl, they have hair and even eyebrows and fingernails.\n\nThey are classed as a misscarrage when they are obviously a baby!  They are born perfect with no problems at all. \n\nThey aint recognised with a birth and death certificate even tho we lower there tiny coffins into the ground.\n\nWe cry a thousand tears. we just want the help our babies deserve!",
