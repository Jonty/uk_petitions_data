            "background": "Equality Minister Harriet Harman has announced a plan which includes positive discrimination in favour of women and minorities. Surely the better route would be to encourage the eradication of ANY discrimination not to encourage employers to hire people who may be less capable of the job in order to tick the correct boxes. In all cases (especially the police/fire sevice etc which require a very specific type of person) the best person for the job should be hired regardless of colour, age, gender or religion.\nNo discrimination is acceptable, not even that which is labelled 'positive'.",
