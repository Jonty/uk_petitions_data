King George III of England and Scotland had no Irish vires to pass into law the Constitutional Act of Union 1800.  He could constitutionally only sign for the Westminister Parliament. Therefore it is important to honour every dot and comma of the St Andrew's Agreement under the Good Friday Agreement Referendum which empowers ERII as the first lawful Westminister Monarch in the Kingdom of Ireland since Dec 1691.\nSo implement the provisions for the Irish Language onto a par with those for Welsh and Gaelic in Wales and Scotland. And let us have no more nonsence with regard to the other provisions either.",
