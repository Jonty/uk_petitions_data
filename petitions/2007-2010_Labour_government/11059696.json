            "background": "I want to raise  awareness on the issues that men go through when having an abortion with a partner. Through experience and research i have found there is   no real outlet for a man when their partner goes through with an abortion. Many feel isolated, do not have any counseling and can neither talk to there partner, because she has just gone through a traumatic experience, get negative help from clinics(even asked to leave or not join in with the process) or cannot simply talk to there male friends about it properly.  there is not enough proper help for men in britain with this subject. I want to raise awarness and hopefully get the government to address the issue properly once and for all.",
