        "background": "We should be outraged to learn that murderer Learco Chindamo has won his appeal against deportation on the basis of \u201cHuman Rights\u201d.\n\nWhat about our human rights? \u2013 Why should we have to have this callous man back on our streets (possibly by next year). \n\nI find it incredible that ANY murderer should only get a minimum of just 12 years, but if he is going to get off light, the least that should happen after that is to get him deported.\n\nThe Home Office have 5 days in which to appeal. Please, please in the name of human decency and for the sake of the victims family, as well as any potential future victims, petition to ensure that they appeal against this perverse decision.",
