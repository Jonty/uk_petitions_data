            "background": "There are approx 39000 heroin users in England, Scotland & Wales.  \nOver \u00a3800million a year is spent on the addiction services, who pass users around from GP's to nurses for check ups and medicals and seeing their drug counsellors for assessments only to be put on medication such as methadone or subutex for many years which does very little in actually dealing with the drug problem.\n\nA detox clinic costs approx \u00a33000 for one patient, which would cost \u00a3117million for all heroin addicts to become 'clean'. \nThat's alot less money than the useles system we have now.\nStop wasting money on methodone for them to sell to buy heroin.\nStamp out the heroin and crime rates will drop.  The majority of drug related crime is to do with heroin users stealing to get their 'fix' or abusing people when they cant get their 'fix'",
