            "background": "In November 2006, just day's after her 3rd birthday our daughter was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia.Within two week's doctor's discovered that the Leukaemia had a rare chromasomal defect known as \"Philadelphia\" We were told that her only chance of survival was to have a bone marrow transplant.After a worldwide search no bone marrow match was found.However, the reason our daughter is still alive today is due to the lifesaving treatment she recieved, a stem cell transplant.The stem cell's were taken from the umbilical cord blood, which was stored in a US public cord bank arter being donated by the parent's of a little boy born in America just 5 months before her diagnosis.This was the ONLY suitable match for our little girl in the world.Last year only 1,200 unit's were collected and stored in the UK cord bank for public use and unless stored privately, all other available cord blood was burned as bio hazzard waste. Childhood cancer is on the increase with a 50% rise over the last ten year's.The stem cell's from umbilical cord blood can save children's lives.The storage of umbilical cord blood need's investment to protect our future generation's.",
