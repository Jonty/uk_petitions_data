            "background": "Middlehurst School is a special educational needs school in Stoke-on-Trent. It is a small school with 85 students on roll. It is situated on its own site and has developed links with two main stream high schools in the local area. The local authority have proposed that all the special schools in the city be closed and 3 open on the sites of new secondary schools. This will result in the loss of 100 places within the city for special needs education.\nIn terms of Middlehurst, this will mean that students from the age of 4 will be placed on the site of a secondary school and with an increase of 35 extra students.\nMiddlehurst is an excellent school, not only in terms of education but also the ethos and nurturing that they develop with their students.\n\nThe students and staff at the school have recognised the need for students to have this specialised education on their own site whilst the links that ARE ALREADY in place which assess each individual student's needs to access mainstream education WHEN it is suitable for them is in place is the best for the children at this school.",
