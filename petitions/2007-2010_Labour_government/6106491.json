        "background": "Where I live in Hereford there is far too much discrimination against people with disabilities. Youths who target and abuse people should be punished more severley because they make peoples live hell. There should be more systems in place to stop underage drinking and drugs as this causes a lot of anti social behaviour in Hereford. There is discrimination against disabled people when it comes to finding jobs so I would like to see more job prospects in the city.",
