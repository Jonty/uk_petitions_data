            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At present not all local authorities will accept all types of plastics for recycling. This requires some consumers to be able to identify different types of plastics. The American Society of Plastics Industry already has a standard marking code to help consumers identify and sort the main types of plastic, and this code is in fact already used by some manufacturers in the UK. It should be a requirement that all manufacturers use this code. Bearing in mind that the government has set recycling targets it is clearly not acceptable for plastic packaging to merely indicate that it is suitable for recycling.",
