            "background": "The proposal brought by the UK to the Copenhagen conference of $10bn from developed nations to all developing nations as legally binding within 6 months is not nearly enough.\n\nOur country spent $65bn on arms in 2008, so a measly $10bn a year - of which the UK will only pay a small part - to go to the whole of the developing world to combat climate change is just not acceptable as short term aid. Atleast $100bn a year would be adequate short term aid. This is the figure that should be legally binding within 6 months. Remember, this is the greatest threat humanity has ever faced.\n\nThe UK is a powerful, wealthy country, and we are one of the very few countries that can say the threat posed to us by climate change is relatively minor. It just isn't fair for our country, with its history of industrialisation and empire, to pretend to be moral by offering a sum as low as $10bn a year.",
