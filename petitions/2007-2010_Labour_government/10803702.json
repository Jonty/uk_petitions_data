            "background": "We urge the Government to issue parents of young children with 'parent/child' parking permits, similar to those for disabled drivers. This would help reduce the misuse of designated parent/child parking spaces in shopping centres and car parks, by drivers without children on board. This would hopefully guarantee extra space for parents to remove children safely from car seats and into pushchairs. This would reduce danger to infants and young children and potential damage to nearby parked cars due to lack of space. This could be administered through the Bounty Pack scheme for new parents which is already in place.",
