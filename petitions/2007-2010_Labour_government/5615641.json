        "background": "This petition is to help launch a European wide emergency child rescue alert system. We are hoping that Prime Minister Gordon Brown can help introduce the motion to the EU council. We as residents of the UK wish to protect our children and all children from across the globe against the dangers of child abduction. The child rescue alert system or its equivalent already exists in England, the United States and Canada and many children have been found using this system. A European wide alert system would act as a notification to the general public, and to all border controls throughout Europe by various media outlets, of a confirmed child abduction. If such an alert system is passed it may, hopefully, encourage other countries from other continents around the globe to introduce similar measures.",
