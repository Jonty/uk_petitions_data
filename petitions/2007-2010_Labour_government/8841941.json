        "background": "This links to the petition concerning OfSTED which is also on this site.  The Information Commission does not regard these false reports published as 'fact' on the internet as being in breach of the Data Protection Act.  I believe they are and that they are also against human rights.  Individuals are easily identified from their position in a school.  The Independent Schools Council, whose members are the independent schools and their managers' and owners' associations, do not allow individuals to appeal.  Only 'schools' may appeal.  Such inspections can then become a tool of management and owners.  The lack of independence of such inspections creates the potential to conceal practices  that the schools do not want to make public. (with similar results to the Whistleblower programme in early March on OfSTED Nursery inspections). This is potentially dangerous for every child in independent education.  Several new 'independent' inspection bodies are proposed.",
