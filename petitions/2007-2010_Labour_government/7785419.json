            "background": "Sid Waddell is darts. Darts is Sid Waddell. In an age where the whole England cricket team get gongs for beating Australia, surely it is about time that Sid was recognised for his part in making darts the sport it currently is. Not only that, he created the hit kids' TV series Jossie's Giants and is currently writing a screenplay about the life of tungsten warrior Jocky \"On The Oche\" Wilson. He has brought laughter, enlightenment and joy to darts fans throughout the world and it is about time not only him, but also his sport, was honoured. In a time when nearly men and also rans get adulation and recognition barely deserved, it is time for this humble Geordie wordsmith to receive what every darts fan in the country would agree, is only just for a man of his talents.",
