            "background": "If the big supermarket stopped the 'buy one get one free' type offers and reduced prices instead this would enable the less well off members of the public to buy food at affordable prices and stopping the waste that 'the by one get one free' creates. Most shoppers would like to 'buy what they need'  not end up with the excess food that these type of offer lead to.  I am fed up with not purchasing (mainly fresh fruit & veg) because I do not want ' 2 melons, 2 cabbages etc. as I know that they will not be eaten before they 'rot' and will therefore be thrown away.  I say to Gordon Brown STOP having a go at shoppers about 'waste food' and do something about the Supermarkets.",
