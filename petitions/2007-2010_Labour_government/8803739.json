            "background": "Funding Nursing home fees privatley cost between \u00a3600 and \u00a31200 per WEEK, yes per week! That means \u00a331,200 - \u00a362,000 per YEAR, to be paid by the person recieving care unless you have have assets of less than \u00a321,000 (including you home) in England and Northern Ireland (\u00a321,500 in Wales and \u00a320,000 in Scotland). \nThe elderly who go into a nursing home are usually are diabled, ill or have dementia, they can not look after themselves, they need nursing and specialist care. Private funders do however recieve a sum per month (on average \u00a387 per week from the government for Nursing care, which is not deducted from the above fees and  is paid directly to the home.\nI believe that everyone who is in a nursing home should not have to pay any care home fees at all.\nDo you????\nI want the government to look into the funding of nursing home fees and consider abolishing them. I also want to look at tax breaks for self funders, bring all care home fees in line with what the council pay which is around \u00a3350 per week. Open up this debate and support this petition.",
