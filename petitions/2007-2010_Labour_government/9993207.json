            "background": "At the moment the court will not give shared residence, so one parent will get overall control of the child and if the divorce was bitter that parent uses the child as a weapon against the other parent, I believe the child should have a legal right to see both parents, both parents should help in the changeover. too often nowdays children get to see their other parent when they can make their own decisions but have lost a parent for most of their childhood for it to never be returned. yes fathers have rights but childrens rights are far more important, court action should not be to try and gain contact but to stop it if a parent is abuseful etc.",
