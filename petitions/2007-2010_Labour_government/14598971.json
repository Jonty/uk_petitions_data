People with tattoos, piercings, unusual hair style and/or colour should be given the same rights as everyone else, and should be protected by the law to avoid mindless discrimination whether they are seeking employment (to include a prospective employer witholding a position) or are employed and experiencing descrimination from their employers (to include witholding promotion or experience of bullying from colleagues) based on their appearance.",
