            "background": "The Battle of Mirbat, Oman took place in July 1972. A group of well armed terrorists ( the Adoo ) attacked the fortess at Mirbat where there was a detachment from B Sqn 22nd SAS Regiment already in deployment. Outnumbered and out gunned the Squadron fought with unbelievable courage to fend off the terrorists from taking over this vital area of land close to the Gulf oil supply route. \nCorporal Labalaba operated a 25 pounder gun by himself even though he had been seriously wounded.Eventually the Adoo were defeated but unfortunateley Coropral Labalaba`s injury proved to be fatal. \nIf the terrorists had won the battle then eventually the  security of the main Gulf oil supply route would have been at risk .\nThe actions of Corporal Labalaba were only recognised with a Mention in Despatches which I see as an insult.\nPlease can the MOD award this man with the Victoria Cross even after all these years. If anyone needs to find out more about this extraordinary soldier then read any Military book about the Special Air Service.",
