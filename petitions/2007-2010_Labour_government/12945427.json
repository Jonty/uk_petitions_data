            "background": "In many countries, like China, it is a very big compliment indeed to the chef if you burp after you have eaten a very good meal they made for you.  It is also 'better out than in' so to speak when it comes to wind because it can be very bad for your body to trap the naturally formed gasses inside when they need to escape.  So if we make it alright to burp it will make you (me) feel better after a meal, it will make the chef feel good about himself and make other people relax when they want to laugh or burp too.  Everybody wins.  You don't even have to make it the law to burp just make it the law not to tell me off when I have.",
