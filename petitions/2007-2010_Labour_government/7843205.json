            "background": "The NHS is currently structured to prioritise healthcare for the elderly. Pensioners pay tax regardless of their health; by shifting the focus on getting people back to work, the NHS would increase funds coming into the Treasury and therefore be able to fund better healthcare for the elderly. A typical example would be the waiting list for back problems; currently the most common cause for time off work and long term health issues. The orthopaedics department are informed to prioritise hip replacements which leads to a knock on non-availability of MRI scans for the whole population. A 20 year old with a minor back problem requiring analysis by MRI cannot return to work, have a diagnosis or have even a minor physiotherapy based course of treatment until an MRI. The Treasury looses income from tax, social services eventually has to fund the person's time off work and because of the lack of diagnosis/ treatment, the 20 year old is then more likely to have long term health problems requiring more resources.\n\nThe NHS should prioritise getting people back to work.",
