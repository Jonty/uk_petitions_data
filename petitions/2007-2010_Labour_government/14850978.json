This ignores the purpose of this site and the purpose of petitions in general, not as a means of clarifying why the government takes specific actions, but as a means of effecting change.\n\nPetitions are one of the few ways in which democracy can be properly exercised in the UK. The Government should respond to them accordingly, highlighting how they intend to correct perceived problems, rather than merely attempting to justify their original position.",
