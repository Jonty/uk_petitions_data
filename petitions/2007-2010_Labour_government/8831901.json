        "background": "Most GP's time is heavily over-stretched and now the government are going to make them do even longer hours. The problems this will cause is that regular GP's will, in time, become tired and ill; then fresh-faced GP's will be sent in who have only limited practitioner skills to replace our dedicated local GP's who know our medical histories. What the government are doing to GPs and staff in all government departments ie, prisons & hospitals etc. will not see their staff as people or human beings who can bleed and become ill if they are over pressured just like us. \nThe public say they need more hours to see their GP in, why? because they want another pint in the pub first or Jeremy Kyle will still be on the telly. It's the public who CAN make changes themselves if they want to. Give the GP's a break they need one!",
