            "background": "Whilst I understand that immigration can have a positive impact on our community, it can not be ignored that the policies of this government have made our once great country an open house for all.  We are seen as a 'soft touch' for those seeking an easy life within our cushy benefits system.  A free house, money and extras await all those that can make the perilous journey through our borders.  And, when you're here whether you get the status granted or not - you can appeal, appeal and appeal again - all at no cost to the individual.  It's a complete joke with people passing through countless other countries just to get to our big cash cow.  This needs serious thought - not just a round them up and send them home approach - but we must do something now to stop and reverse the terrible damage that has been done to our country.",
