        "background": "Nut/seed allergies are the most common in the UK, and the number of sufferers is increasing dramatically.  Research conducted in 2002 showed that 1 in 70 children is allergic compared with 1 in 100 just ten years before.  The 'lucky' ones suffers symptoms including rashes, itching, breathlessness and vomiting: but for some people nut allergies kill.\n\nThe labels currently on most food products are simply not even adequate.  We ask that the Prime Minister bring in legislation making it imperative for companies to display the nut content of their products more clearly, in bigger writing, and in a brightly coloured box (particularly on packets for products which you would not expect to contain nuts).\n\nThis simple action could save lives.",
