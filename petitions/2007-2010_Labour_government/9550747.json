            "background": "The current price of crude oil is not based on fundamentals of supply and demand, but on rampant speculation in the oil futures market. Demand in developing countries is increasing, but it is small in relation to the size of the market. Supply is currently increasing with some new fields coming on-stream.\n\nMost oil is not purchased through the futures market but on long-term contracts. These contracts are however priced in terms of the futures spot price, so an increase in the futures price increases the contract price of all oil.\n\nAs currently structured, when the futures contract expires, the owner is not left 'holding the baby' - they do not have to buy the oil. They can still cash in the contract at that day's spot price. This reduces the risk to only the price manipulation.\n\nThe oil price has a large influence on the economy of this country and the global economy, for fuel and all other oil-derived products including agricultural fertilizers and plastics.\n\nThe Prime Minister should enforce regulation of trades on the ICE Futures exchange to damp down this speculation and reduce the oil price to a level consistent with the fundamentals.",
