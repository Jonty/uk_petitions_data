            "background": "I have felt strongly for a long time that netball should be included in the Olympic games. Netball is an exciting, highly skilled game which is played for  love rather than monetary gain. (Unlike football or Tennis.) It in-corperates the true ethos of the olympics, team spirit and a love of your game.\nWe should be encouraging young girls to get involved in sport. Netball is a game that is accessible to all. It is played in nearly all schools, it is a game that is cheap to play as clubs are inexpensive to join and as long as you have a pair of trainers you can play. I believe that were Netball included in the 2012 Olympics it would inspire more girls to play.\nAlthough in New Zealand and Australia the game is played by both men and women.I am sure these countries would support this.",
