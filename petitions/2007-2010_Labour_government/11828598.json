            "background": "The increase in landfill that this application proposes could lead to significant health and environmental impacts, including increases in odour and pollution.\n\n\nThe application is due to be determined by an unelected quango - the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation - in March 2009, just three months after the application was submitted. The LTGDC's geographical remit does not cover areas, such as Belvedere and Erith, which will be affected by the application. This is a complex application that conflicts with Government policies to reduce waste going to landfill and to improve air quality.\n\n\nFurther details on this application can be found at: on the 'No 2 Odour' website or at the 'No 2 Odour' Facebook group.",
