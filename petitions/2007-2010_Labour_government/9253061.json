            "background": "When we connect to the internet through our ISPs we rightfully presume that we will be able to access anything that is available, with consistent speeds and quality - but if net neutrality (treating all information the same way) is blocked by some ISPs like BT, Virgin Media etc. then we can wave bye-bye to that, and say hello to a refined internet where all content and the providers of that content have to be vetted and charged for access to ISPs' customers. That's not free-flowing information. What could these ISP's censor? The answer: Anything they want without any fear of retribution.\nPioneers like Vinton Cerf and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, always intended the Internet to be a neutral network, don't sit back and watch the collapse of the greatest democracy humans have ever yet invented.\n\nSearch for 'net neutrality' on the engine of your choice - whilst you still can - for more information on the subject.",
