Your Government has sanctioned this law without any consultations being held with the people of the United Kingdom. There is one law in this country and one law only British Law. The implementation of Sharia Law in favour of the Islamic / Muslim minorities living within this country aids and adheres to their culture a culture British people will not live by. The British Government by allowing Sharia Courts to operate within the United Kingdom has placed its citizens in grave danger.",
