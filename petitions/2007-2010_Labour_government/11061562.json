            "background": "The current Government has an overwhelming vote of no confidence from the general public. The Prime Minister himself is both unelected and without mandate. He boasts a personal pride in being responsible for ending 'boom and bust' in this country, yet his policies and actions as chancellor allowed an uncontrolled boom to rage for a decade before ending in an inevitable crash unprecedented since the 1920's great depression. The country is on its knees because of this Government, and their current actions only make matters worse. Elections were avoided late last year, and again at Easter as he did not wish to face the truth of public opinion, but to remain in power is fundamentally immoral - a wreckless driver should have his licence removed rather than being allowed to continue to wreak havoc without mandate.",
