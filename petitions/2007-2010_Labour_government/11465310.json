            "background": "I feel that giving free sweets to the general public on Fridays would increase their working concentration and enjoyment in the workplace. Spirits would be lifted and everyone would be generally happier, causing them to work more enjoyably and perform better. This would, in turn, improve productivity and performance, resulting in an increased level of economic activity in the UK and hastening the end of the credit crunch. Ta-dah!",
