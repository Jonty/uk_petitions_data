        "background": "Companies that pay their work force every 4 weeks, are an example for all companies to follow.\n\nThe 4 week pay period, should start in line with the inland revenue tax weeks. i.e  employers would start their pay year April 6th, which means, employees would receive 13 pay pay days each year instead of the present 12 pay days each year. \n\nDirect debits, utility bills, mortgage payment, pensions, social benefits. council tax and any other regular time payments, could be paid every 4 weeks, in line with inland revenue tax weeks.\n\nThis mean the government and all employers would save computer time and employees could budget for 28 days each month  instead of having to budget for 28, 30 or 31 day months during the year.",
