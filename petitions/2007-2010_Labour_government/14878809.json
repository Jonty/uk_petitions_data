            "background": "Faith schools should not be allowed to teach their beliefs about homosexuality, especially that it is wrong, 'unnatural' or 'immoral'. Using contraception is a choice, sexual orientation is not.\n\nAllowing faith schools to promote their beliefs places young gay teenagers in a vulnerable position; with neither a choice in their sexuality or the school that they attend.\n\nIt allows for the continuation, and even increase, of bullying and persecution of young homosexuals who belong to a faith with real and damaging consequences. \n\nReligions and religious organisations have been allowed to teach untruths about homosexuality, often directly opposing medically proven fact, for too long. The result is continuing homophobia, ignorance, and generations of psychologically and emotionally damaged gays and lesbians.\n\nThe numbers of attempted suicides by young gay teenagers is significantly higher than that of their heterosexual peers - this minority needs to be protected from the psychological impact of 'teaching' religious beliefs in schools.\n\nThis should be reflected accordingly in the Children, Schools and Families Bill.",
