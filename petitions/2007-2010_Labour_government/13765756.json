            "background": "Ormskirk has a real shortage of affordable rented accomodation for families. Many council houses have now been bought under the Right to Buy Scheme and the housing stock has not been replaced.The waiting list for a house within Ormskirk area is long and very slow moving. Most private landlords within the area cater only for student lets.  I would ask the Prime Minister to instruct West Lancs Council to actively seek partnership with developers and Housing Associations to increase the stock of affordable housing within the Ormskirk area.",
