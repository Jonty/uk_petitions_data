        "background": "As you may or not be aware the government is thinking of upping the student top up fee\u2019s for UK student from \u00a33,000 to \u00a37,000 for 2009.\nThis would mean that someone starting a 3 degree course in 2009 could end up leaving university with \u00a341,000 debt and the interest each year on this debt alone would be over \u00a31,000. \n\nThis would mean that for some students the cost of university would outweigh the extra income they earn over their lifetime from gaining their degree, especially art and humanity degrees where salaries are lower.",
