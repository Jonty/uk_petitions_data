But to all my efforts I am still unable to find anyone who wants to recruit me. \n\nI am doing this petition so that the PM will help young people like myself and many others who will or have left school at the age of 16 to get a job. I feel that there is no valid scheme made by the goverment to help young people who leave school at 16 to get into a job.",
