        "background": "The Vulcan Operating Company have tirelessly worked around the clock since 1993 to restore XH558 to its former glory for flight as an historic airshow aircraft.\n\nTVOC have now completed all required restoration and maintenance to allow for a fully fledged first flight since the 14 year restoration began. All that remains is the CAA approval for flight following full flight tests and required fine-tuning flight configuration.\n\nHaving mised the Falklands 25th Anniversary this year, Remembrance Sunday 2007 will provide a perfect  opportunity to showcase the extreme dedication of TVOC and also provide poignant remembrance to all those lost in conflict 25 years ago on the Falkland Islands.",
