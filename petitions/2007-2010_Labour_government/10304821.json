Especially Kerosene used for Oil Fired Central Heating. According BERR or Malcolm Wicks MP the government targets for eradicating fuel poverty are 2016 - 18. It would appear the government advice to Pensioners is to switch suppliers. A one-off \u00a350 winter fuel payment is an added insult to Pensioners integrity. Should not the Prime Minister place himself for one week into the role of a Pensioner, and see how he and his wife can manage with maximum allowances on a total of \u00a3181 per week. Would be interesting to see his prudent budget for this, as Pensioners we would all like to know, after years of forced to choose between Eat and Heat.\n\nDave Coppard\nVoice of the Pensioners",
