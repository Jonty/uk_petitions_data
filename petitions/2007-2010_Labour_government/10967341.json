I am sick of spam originating in the USA and other countries but being chanelled through the UK by various means including radio paging numbers offered by varios companies such as Manx Telecom, Skycom Ltd, Call Science Ltd and Danamere Creative to name but a few. Worldwide criminal activities are propagating using these services and there is no way the public can identify the caller's identity and address without passing the information on to the Police, an already overworked force. Similarly, an email is also extremely difficult to trace for the average person. All email should carry the registrant name and address for the recipient to clearly see. I do hope the Prime Minister can do something to correct this situation and to take this further to the United Nations to arrive at a uniform code.\n\nSincerely\nCharles William Rose.",
