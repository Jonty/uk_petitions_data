BBC Asian Network is an extremely fresh station that promotes cutting-edge debates, important in-depth reports and is on the top of first class entertainment. Music 6 has incredible access to all the BBC musical archives and an excellent choice of presenters, producers and musical formats. It would be a tragedy to loose these great resources. BBC cuts to digital Radio and Websites will be a step backwards when are have only just entered the digital age!",
