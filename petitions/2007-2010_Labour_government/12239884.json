        "background": "Viewers did not deserve to see Danielle's hopes of finally enjoying a life of happiness with her mother completely diminish in the saddening way that they did. Such an ending was traumatic and profoundly distressing, and as the character's death has yet to be confirmed, the programme's plotline should be edited in a way that keeps Danielle alive, so that her journey to track down her mother, Ronnie, is rounded off with the happy ending it demanded.",
