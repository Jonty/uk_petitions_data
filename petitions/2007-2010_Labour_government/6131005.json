            "action": "introduce legislation to ban backyard bonfire burning completely.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As warm summer nights are spoilt by inconsiderate people burning rubbish in their backyard bonfires, it is about time this practice was stopped.  Currently it can only be stopped if it is a nuisance but often by the time it has become a nuisance it is too late.  People also burn painted and varnished wood in backyard bonfires and this causes harmful fumes.  Other countries, like Australia, have successfully introduced a law like this and it would improve the air environment for all Britains.",
