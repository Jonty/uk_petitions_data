        "background": "The British Medical Association\u2019s (BMA) recent Under the Influence Report proposes a draconian clampdown on pubs and alcohol. As a consumer organisation CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale, is appalled that the BMA are seeking changes that will harm all responsible drinkers and pub goers rather than focusing on targeted measures to address the behaviour of the small minority who abuse alcohol.\n\nBMA proposals to increase duty on alcohol above inflation in addition to a new alcohol levy would significantly increase pub prices and price many of us out of going to the pub on a regular basis.  Many thousands of well-run community pubs could be forced to close as a result of these two ideas alone, on top of the growing pressures that community pubs already face. The BMA however wish to go further in their campaign against responsible drinkers and strictly control pub opening hours, which could mean a return to a uniform 11pm, or earlier, closing time.",
