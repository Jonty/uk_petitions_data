            "background": "The 'raison d'etre' of the Labour Party is to re-distribute wealth and help the lower paid working class. In one swift movement Gordon Brown has robbed the lowest paid of up to \u00a3450 a year, most of this bracket is made of graduates who already have to pay back their student loans because Labour introduced tuition fees. Each person's personal income allowance should be increased to \u00a310,000 a year and the next \u00a35,000 should be taxed at 10%, further if these measures are not introduced we will make a stand at the next general election and pledge never to vote Labour again",
