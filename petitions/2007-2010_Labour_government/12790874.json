        "background": "The recently published Report to the Secretary of State on the Review of Elective Home Education in England, which the Government have accepted in full, proposes radical changes to the relationship between the state and the family.  The review is seriously flawed and fails to provide a reasoned and evidence based argument for its recommendations.  It proposes that home educated children have to be registered annually with a local authority and that officlals have a right of access to the child.  The next logical step, if this is implemeted, is that all pre-school children must be registered and inspected annually; even that visits are required of children attending school during vacations.",
