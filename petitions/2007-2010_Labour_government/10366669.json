Reporting the news to people is a moral responsibility, and the obsession with bad news in this country is creating a mentally ill and unbalanced society... The press should be forced to deliver 100% facts to the nation, and the news will never be fact until we start reportion good and bad news in the same proportion as real life... If newspapers don't sell when they print good news, then let them all go bust, because we'd be better off without them rather than continue to allow them to perpetuate depression!",
