            "background": "Ensure that a fairer tax system is put in place. One based  purely on income is much fairer than one based on property as many people inherit property while still earning minimum wage. Why should someone earning \u00a312,000pa pay the same tax as someone earning \u00a3120,000pa purely based on their property? Its time to get this country growing again, instead of the imminenet recession we are all now facing due to failures within the government, or perhaps the rich are still getting favours if they offer funding which would explain the current status of our great country.",
