        "background": "It has been the policy of the government since the Thatcher Era to allow people to buy their council houses. \n\nHowever the sale of housing stock has meant a severe shortage by those seeking to rent at reasonable rates. Instead they are paying inflated rent rates to fatcat landlords. \n\nIt should be the policy of government that council stock remains in council hands for renting. It should fall to the private sector to build houses for purchase. \n\nMore reasonable rates from councils and rental associations would allow individuals to build up deposits to use later in the purchase of a house should they so wish. \n\nRelying on the private sector to build houses would also ensure a more vibrant private market in this downturn. It would also mean there was housing available rather than relying on emergency hostel accomodation.",
