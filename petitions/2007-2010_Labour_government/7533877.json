            "background": "To Invest In The River Infrastructure To Produce Re-newable Energy\nI believe that the rivers is great potential of energy and believe by using the flow of the rivers in this country we could help produce sufficient amounts of local if, not national energy supplies.\nI believe this could be done, by making modifications to the weirs in the country to become micro or small hydro electric dams. \nA small definition:\n\"Small hydro\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nSmall hydro plants may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact .\"My purpose is for you now to imagine all the weirs in the country slowly converted to generate small amounts of energy to the grid.To me the added advantage is that will supply energy to the local communities, towns, and cities for many hundreds of years.I believe this is an example of where you can generate large amounts of energy at not cost to the c02 debate.",
