            "background": "This is a petition to call for National Health Service (NHS) to be disbanded on the grounds that it has become too flabby and inefficient.  \n\nThe petition proposes the following recommendations:\n\n1. That the NHS should be carved up into smaller and more manageable specialist services.  For instance, a psychology service, a cancer service etc, whilst still accessible to all through contributions.\n\n2. A Hospital reconstruction programme to restore disbanded Accident and Emergency Units and the closure of so-called Walk-In/Drop-In Centres.\n\n3. The disbanding of Primary Care Trusts and removal of middle tier-management, to be replaced by direct control from central government.  \n\n4. The scrapping of the NHS complaints procedure through PCT's to be replaced by an impartial system, which addresses consumers needs.  \n\n5. A strict and rigorous English language test for GP's well as greater background checks.\n\n6. The creation of a Government Department geared specifically towards providing better psychology provisions in towns and cities across the United Kingdom.\n\nPlease sign this petition for to put pressure on the Government for better Health Care provisions.  Thank You.",
