            "background": "We would like to see a change to the pricing structure in the soft drinks industry, that would favour drinks that provide 'one of your five a day'. At present fruit smoothies and other healthy drinks are terribly overpriced by comparison to cola (for example). In many places fruit smoothies/juices are sold in 250ml bottles for double the price of 500ml of less healthy drinks. If the prices of smoothies and fruit juice were subsidised then more people would drink them, and the health benefits in the mass populace would be noticeable. It would also help immeasurably in the fight against obesity and encourage everyone to attain their 5-a-day.",
