            "background": "Owners of older cars can\u2019t afford a new car, even with a bribe to scrap the car.    \nThe effect will be to temporarily distort the market \u2013 the slump will just happen later!   \nOver 80% of the cars registered in the UK are made overseas, so the scheme will put UK tax-payers\u2019 money into foreign factories. Even the Germans are complaining about imports from Romania!   \nThe environmental calculations do not add up \u2013 older cars tend to do fewer miles than shown in the calcs, so don\u2019t affect the environment as much \u2013 plus the impact of the production of a new vehicle \u2013 but guess who provided the calculation? The car companies!   \nIt would be better to enforce motorists\u2019 responsibility to maintain cars properly.  That would positively impact road safety, the environment and keep thousands of technicians and support staff in employment; definitely a must in today\u2019s economic climate.",
