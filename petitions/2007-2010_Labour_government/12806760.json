            "background": "The argument that I constantly hear about the advantage of digital TV is that it will provide more choice. I currently have two choices, I can watch analogue TV or digital TV so how can halving the number of options give me more choice. Also, has the environmental cost of the switchover been taken into account. There will be a huge mountain of redundant TVs, video recorders and, in a few year's time, radios to be disposed of. Add to this the fuel useage driving to purchase new equipment and to a disposal site to get rid of the old and the so-called carbon footprint will be huge.",
