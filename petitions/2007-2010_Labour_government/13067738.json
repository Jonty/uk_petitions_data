        "background": "Our last First World War Veteran, Henry Allingham has now sadly died.  However, the Second World War veterans are now in their eighties or more.  Do we not owe those people for all they gave?  Surely the right to be looked after, and not have to sell their houses to pay for care in the last years of their life.   I am requesting that all those veterans in care homes be given free care.  They did so much for us and although we can never repay them, this small thing would go a long way in making their remaining years worry free.",
