Continued under investment in this area directly led to the earthquake of 27th February 2008 and such an event can no longer be brushed aside by this government.\nTHIS IS A PROBLEM ON THE SCALE OF CLIMATE CHANGE (and obesity???)!!!! We call for \u00a3100 Billion investment in earthquake warning systems and the opening of a Earthquake Action Centre to  prevent future Earthquake events.",
