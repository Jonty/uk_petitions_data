            "background": "Gordon Brown has never submitted himself to the electorate since succeeding his predecessor as Prime Minister. Whilst Constitutionally this is perfectly proper, there is no precedent in modern times for such an unpopular, unelected, Prime Minister to cling to office for such a long period of time without going to the country. If the Prime Minister is going to be anything other than a lame duck at home and abroad, he surely needs to secure a mandate from the country. Failure to do so would damage the interests of the country domestically and internationally.",
