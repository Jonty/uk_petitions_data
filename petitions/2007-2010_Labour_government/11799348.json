At present the worry of offending someone by celebrating St George\u2019s day or schools not having a sports day anymore in case someone looses or get hurts - hence why we are not competitive at international sports.  As for Christmas, in this country we celebrate this holiday and if this offends anyone, then tough!  I have no issues with any other religion celebrating their holidays so why should we have some fool telling us not put lights up.  We need the PM to act now before we are offended anymore by these do gooders.",
