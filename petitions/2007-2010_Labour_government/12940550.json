            "background": "Keeping Ronald Biggs in prison and ignoring the parole board's reccomendation to release him on compassionate grounds is unfair due to the state of his deteriorating health.\n\nMembers of the same gang who went on the run in foreign Countries were recaptured and sentenced to less years than Ronald Biggs and were let out in a lesser time than he is currently serving.\n\nIt is therefore, a punitive action that sees a wheelchair bound man who has suffered strokes, brain haemorrages and is unable to walk, talk or feed himself by keeping him within the over crowded prison system.\n\nGreat Britain is considered a Country that the world should look to for moral guidance and we are a Country that asks others to show restraint. \n\nThis lack of judgement by Jack Straw is everything that this Country is not and if a Nation is best judged by the way it treats its prisoners within its own prison system, then a decision to release Ronald Biggs on compassionate grounds would best describe Great Britain.\n\nWe ask Jack Straw, the Justice Secretary, to free him immediately.",
