            "background": "I have noticed in a few cities that had the streets repaved that there are fewer litter bins being fitted than there were previously. For example a street had 10 bins before the refurbishment, now has 8 smaller bins.\n\nThis is a daft idea as the bins get overflowed quicker. The councils don't bother emptying them as much and makes the whole area a complete mess.\n\nThe govt should make sure when streets are repaved that the same number of bins need to be installed on the street before the repaving started. Obviously, they aren't forced to put the bins exactly where they were afterwards. Why make something worse?",
