            "background": "We, the undersigned, call on the Prime Minister to revoke the decision of Romford YMCA to close both squash courts.\n\nRomford YMCA have announced plans to close both squash courts. There has been no public consultation, and this will leave Havering with just 2 squash courts in the whole borough.\n\n      This is shameful. \n\nThere is, or was, a thriving squash community although the YMCA have been running down the squash courts for a considerable amount of time.\n\nThe YMCA are closing one court at the end of this month (Sep 09), and the final one in Jan 10.\n\nThere is a well-established junior squash programme, which has produced many excellent players - we currently have the current number 2 under-15 player in England. \n\nA lot of these players (senior and junior) may well be lost to the game of squash as a result of YMCA\u2019s actions, directly contravening the Governments obesity campaign, especially for children.",
