There has been no public consultation, and this will leave Havering with just 2 squash courts in the whole borough.\n\n      This is shameful. \n\nThere is, or was, a thriving squash community although the YMCA have been running down the squash courts for a considerable amount of time.\n\nThe YMCA are closing one court at the end of this month (Sep 09), and the final one in Jan 10.\n\nThere is a well-established junior squash programme, which has produced many excellent players - we currently have the current number 2 under-15 player in England. \n\nA lot of these players (senior and junior) may well be lost to the game of squash as a result of YMCA\u2019s actions, directly contravening the Governments obesity campaign, especially for children.",
