        "background": "Piercing guns are an extremely unsafe way to pierce which unfortunately many people do not know.\n\nEar piercing studs are dull and tear through the body, causing unnecessary pain, healing duration, and other possible complications.\n\nEar piercing guns are inaccurate and not designed for piercing most body parts, resulting in improper piercing placement.\n\nEar piercing studs are the wrong size and too short for most piercings. The small gauge (generally 20g) and short length are not optimal for healing. \n\nIf you are going to get pierced then you should avoid any 'piercer' that uses a gun.",
