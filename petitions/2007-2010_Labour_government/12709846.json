            "background": "The Government proposes that our rights be linked to responsibilities.  That sounds tempting on the surface but think about it.  It means that if you don't do what the Government feels you should do in a given situation then they can take away YOUR rights.\n\nRights are rights!  They cannot be taken away from us just because we don't follow every Government edict.  They are there to protect us from tyrannical Governments.  Having our Rights linked to responsibilities protects the Government from people who disagree with it.\n\nSomeone commentating on the proposal, pointed out that the Constitution of the old Soviet Union had similar clauses.",
