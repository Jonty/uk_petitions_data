There is no law to say to increase after 10 years.\n\nThe Broadcasting Act 1996 and the Communications Act 2003 mean there is a growing amount of BSL on television, while the Disability Discrimination Act also means that Deaf people will have increased access in BSL with other media, including the Internet.\n\nIslington Deaf Campaign is proposing everyone in Great Britain to sign this petition it is time for all broadcasters, all channels to provide sign language provision on the Television, same as Subtitles.\n\nIDC felt some deaf people prefer subtitles but there are also many deaf people want sign langauge provision, should be treated as Equality.\n\n(The Government need to consider Human Rights Act especially for deaf children and deaf people to access to sign language on television).",
