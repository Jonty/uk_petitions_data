He was lucky - he survived - but felt very strongly to his dying day last year that Bomber Command was ignored because what these incredibly brave young men did is now not considered \"politically correct\". They were prepared to do their duty for their country in order to beat the Nazis. They were on the sharp end of the conflict and death was almost a certainty but they still did their duty.  30,000 of these true heroes still survive, surely it is time to recognise them.",
