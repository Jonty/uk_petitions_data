I believe mostly to warmer climates for health reasons.    Why then, is it that having paid their contributions all their working lives and in some cases still paying taxes to the U.K. Inland Revenue ,a pensioner who decides to move abroad is then expected by the U. K. Gov. to survive for their remaining years on the pension frozen at the rate at the time they leave, wherever they choose to live.     It causes a great deal of bitterness when people who have paid nothing into the system are able to claim an increasing pension untill their demise, simply because they decide to live in the U.K. with its wonderfull benefit system .     It is time the U.K. Gov. started caring more about its indigenous population , in this case pensioners no matter where they choose to live.      When the U.K. apparently can find the money to hand out ,as we all can see , inland and abroad , they can find the very much smaller ammount to take care of the pensioners who helped to make Britain what it once was.      We pensioners deserve better treatment than we are recieving in our remaining years ,surely that is our human right.",
