        "background": "It seems that every time I switch on the CBeebies channel for my children to watch there is ALWAYS a vastly disproportionate number of non-white children and presenters.  Also, whenever there is a news item the BBC always manages to focus on non-white children in schools or the Dr, Nurse, shopkeeper, man in the street etc is always non-white - this cannot possibly be accidental and must therefore be policy within the BBC.",
