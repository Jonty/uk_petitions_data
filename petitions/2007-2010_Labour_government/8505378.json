We are missing out on superior reporting provided by the likes of our local BBC office. It is ironic that William Wilberforce was from Hull but Hull residents are still held as slaves by Hull Daily Mail. The level of reporting offered by Hull Daily Mail is well below par and usually also very biased. Surely competition is a good thing. We want a local choice for our printed news!
