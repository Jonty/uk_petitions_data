        "background": "Upgrade the classification of cannabis to a well defined crime as it is a dangerous drug on the strong evidence of the injustices caused by cannabis to gas and electrical companies, neighbours, public, police, and Viatnamese immigrants. Risks do not onlu affect the gangs and people taking the drug, but all of the above. These risks mainly include respiratory problems, trouble in communities and fire hazards. It is now a far stronger drug than before. Especially to protect the innocent and public sector that cannabis and cannabis factories affect, cannabis should be upgraded to at least a class B drug.",
