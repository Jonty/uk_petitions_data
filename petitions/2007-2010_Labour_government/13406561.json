            "background": "The Baroness Scotland should be dismissed for employing an illegal worker. Her excuse is she omitted to photocopy a document at the time of employment.\n\nAll employers in this country are aware that during the process of employing foreign workers they must submit the appropriate paperwork to validate their eligibility to work. \n\nBaroness Scotland obviously did not inspect the necessary paperwork and omitted to copy it. If she had seen the correct paperwork it would have been blatantly apparent that the prospective worker had no right to work in this country.\n\nWe therefore call for her dismissal as ignorance is not a defence and as the ultimate law-maker in this country she should be above law breaking and is therefore not worthy of her position.",
