            "background": "The cost of food and goods has risen with fuel prices over the past year and has helped increase the rate of inflation to twice the governments target. VAT should no longer be charged on fuel duty and fuel duty should be cut so it can help ease the inflationary pressure, hopefully enabling the Bank of England to cut interest rates and reduce the strain on people with low income.",
