        "background": "Sky News has launched a national campaign calling for a live television debate as part of the General Election, the first of its kind in Britain.\n\nJohn Ryley, the head of Sky News, has written to the Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Conservative leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg to invite them to take part.\n\nHe told them faith in politics and politicians has been shaken, and a debate during the forthcoming election campaign would offer a unique opportunity to re-engage disillusioned voters.\n\n\"There is a chance here, not just to do something that has never been done, but to energise an electorate, to reconnect with the millions of people who have been alienated by politics and the way it is so often covered, to achieve something that is truly democratic,\" Mr Ryley wrote.\n\nSky News is calling on readers and viewers who support the campaign to sign the online petition here.\n\n:: Due to the Downing Street petitions site being closed during the summer, names have been collected on an alternative site since September 1. You can find further information on the Sky News site.",
