            "background": "On the 29th October 2008, Russell Brand resigned from his Radio 2 show after a hate campaign by a group of stuck up Daily Mail readers. The week after the broadcast the BBC only received 2 complaints, caused by Jonathan Ross's swearing rather than the content of the message left on Andrew Sachs' answerphone. Complaints only began flooding in after the Daily Mail decided to run the story. If you want to want to hear Russell back on his Radio 2 show as soon as possible sign the petition.",
