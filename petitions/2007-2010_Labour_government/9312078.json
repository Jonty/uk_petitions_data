            "background": "At present, books overdue taken out on any library card in your name, can incur a set fee - per day. Fair enough, as a deterrent, to encourage people to communicate properly and abide by library rules. But there is little advice prior to taking out library membership on terms and conditions. Local and university libraries should not be allowed to then increase the amount and charge interest for previous fines i.e. past books, especially, if the texts are hired by teachers for classroom use and the reason for their delayed return may not be the card - holders' fault. Please look at this.\n\nSimilarly, is there a limit on the number of fixed penalty and clamping charges that can be made - if not, there ought to be some leniency at least to explain issues - why should I personally fund hospital parking as a govt employee in my workplace ?\nAlso - please advise Local councils on a maximum amount payable in library fines (at my local library, the amount keeps changing without explanation).",
