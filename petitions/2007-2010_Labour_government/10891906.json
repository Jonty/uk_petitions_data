            "background": "With the current economic climate and rising living costs it can be a challenge to afford basic living costs as a student nurse without the additional cost of having to pay for parking while on placement in a hospital. \n\nParking fees for nursing students can also be higher than paid staff as they are not always eligible for a monthly parking permit. This practice does not seem fair and either a complete exemption from fees or a reduced rate for parking is requested.",
