        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Pensions are a ticking timebomb. Establish a full analysis of the costs of compulsory final salary pensions for all companies, and public sector areas, employing 500 or more. If the company cannot fund this, it should be underwritten by the Government with a higher Corporation tax rate, and a slightly higher income tax rate for those in it. Suggest max pension of \u00a350k pa regardless of salary. Those in the scheme will not get an old age pension - i.e. contracted out. The estimated pension fund deficits are less than the banking bail out, confidence would return long term. A full scale costing of this should be instigated.",
