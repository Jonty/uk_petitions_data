        "background": "We believe the legislation the government have introduced to help employees terminate their staff when they hit the age of 65 is discriminatory and greatly offensive against decent hardworking citizens!  As a direct result of this legislation many employers (including some councils) have now introduced policies to terminate employment of their staff when they hit 65 years old, often replaced by younger/cheaper labour. We think this legislation is immoral and counter productive. How can you introduce legislation to support employers rights to sack their staff because of their age? We need new legislation to change this blatant discrimination.",
