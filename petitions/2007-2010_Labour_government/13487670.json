Money is also given to China, India and others. \n\nThis petition is simply to acknowledge that some UK Tax payers would prefer that our money be spent within the UK. \n\nMoney that could be used in job creation through projects, education, policing, health and the general declining infrastructure of our country. \n\nThank you for your time.",
