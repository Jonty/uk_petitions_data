I would like the U.N to sanction an invasion of Zimbabwe in order to remove Mugabe and all other parties involved in the violence, allow the properly elected government to take it's rightful place and for the guilty to stand trial in The Hague for crimes against humanity.\nWe owe it to the innocent victims of the Mugabe regime to take the action that the rest of Africa is too afraid to take, to mete out justice in a worthwhile cause., Mugabe is a despot, he MUST go.",
