        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The digital signal does not reach many homes and is sensitive to both weather conditions and interference from surrounding buildings.  Unlike the analogue signal which became faint, for example, in poor weather conditions the digital equivalent just drops out.  The quality of reception needs a step change in quality and reliabiliy before it may be relied on.  Until this is done the analogue signal should be halted.",
