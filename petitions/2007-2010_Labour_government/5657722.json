        "background": "This governments attempt to police the UK house selling and buying market is a fiasco and has turned into a job creation scheme for failed estate agents now calling themselves Home Inspectors. There has been far too little consultation with actual buyers and sellers, let alone the vast army of hangers-on who take their cut of every transaction (estate agents, mortgage lenders, solicitors). Instruct ministers Blears and Cooper to go back to the drawing board and start again or simply don't fix something that ain't broke.",
