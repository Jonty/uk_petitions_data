        "background": "I want the government to make sanitary items free of charge to all women, or at least to girls up to the age of 18. As women do not ask for periods, so why should they have to pay for them! Men don\u2019t have to pay for condoms or cannabis from NHS prescriptions! But us women have to pay for something we can\u2019t help! This is an outrage. A man once said \"until you start paying for my beer because im an alcoholic, im not paying for your sanitary towels\". Maybe he would be saying something different if he had periods! Those who cannot afford to buy sanitary towels resort to diverse methods, ranging from old pieces of cloth or used blankets to tissue or just remaining indoors to contain the menstrual flow. These methods are unhygienic and a health hazard. People say send the children in Kenya reusable ones, well take a minute to think about it. If they lack clean water to drink then how on earth are they going to get any water to wash the reusable ones! The government has responded by reducing taxes on sanitary towels, but this campaign has to continue because they are still too expensive for most families...",
