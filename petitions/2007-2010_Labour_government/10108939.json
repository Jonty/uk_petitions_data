        "background": "Young and inexperienced drivers are being charged astronomical rates of insurance mostly each policy is more than the cost of the car. If the Government stepped in and made the insurers put a cap on the cost of insuring young drivers then you would find that ALL young people would be insured.They are driving WITHOUT INSURANCE as they cannot afford in the region of \u00a33,000.00 - \u00a35,000.00 per policy PER YEAR. They could put themselves through university for less than that.",
