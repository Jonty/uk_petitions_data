            "background": "Recently a decision was made that, in the interests of 'community harmony' Geert Wilders would not be allowed into the UK.\n\nGeert Wilders is an official Dutch politician.\n\nHis only crime in this PC-world was to make a film which was stitched-together from various *factual* sources of Islamic violence. Most of his film is news footage that has been seen before anyway.\n\nInstead of everyone pointing the finger at Geert Wilders, why don't they expend their energy solving the root cause of Islamic worldwide violence?\n\nGeert Wilders should be allowed into the UK, and should be issued with an apology.  The UK is very quickly making *factual* free speech a crime.",
