            "background": "After reading and article in The Guardian News paper dated 19th January 2010. Stating that Edd BALLs children's minister plans to allow Grandparents access rights to our Children .\nI feel that rights should not be granted to Grandparents because of a Family Feuds, or When Parents feel there is a risk to their Children because of the Grandparents. I feel that the old rules should apply in these situations and would like that to remain the same. So these types of Grandparents are kept away from our children and we as PARENTS  can still protect them from unpredictable  individuals that resides in Our Families. And not let them come to harm at the hands of the Governments actions.\nPlease join me in keeping our precious Children safe,and sign this petition to be delivered to Downing street \n\nThank you  \n\nMRS STELLA WESTERN",
