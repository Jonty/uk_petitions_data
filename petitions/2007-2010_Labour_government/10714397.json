The rationale for this was that since he had been (had been lucky enough to have the talent to be!) in a very high-earning profession the amount he would lose by being unable to practise it would be correspondingly high which does seem, on the face of it, to be fair but I feel it's simply perpetuating inequalities of income which are totally unrelated to the value to society of the actual work done by, e.g., sports stars compared to, e.g., nurses etc.",
