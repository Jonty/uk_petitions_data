            "background": "As the financial institutions seem stabilised and some banks are now generating huge profits the government should ensure all the money lent to the banking and finance sectors during the difficult economic period should be repaid, in full, by Dec 31st 2010.This should mean minimal public service cuts which will almost certainly effect the poor and disadvantaged more than the rest of the general population. The banks we own a stake in should also be mandated to lend money to the public at reasonable rates and make borrowing possible again.",
