            "background": "I beleive that gay rights should be taught to five year olds in primary schools, with the desired result of dramatically reducing homophobic bullying. children at the age of five have very open minds and being told from that young age that ''gay is OK'' could make these children more accepting. young children need to be taught exactly what homophobia is, and why it is wrong. they also need to understand what being homosexual or bisexual is about, and made to understand that it isnt wrong. this should be compulsory in all or many schools because, with enough schools involved, i beleive that homophobia could be reduced.",
