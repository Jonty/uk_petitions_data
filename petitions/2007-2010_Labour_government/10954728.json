            "background": "We the undersigned urge the Prime Minister to offer a \"selective\" amnesty to illegal immigrants in the UK who have no criminal record. It is \"absurd\" to suggest the 500,000 people in Britain illegally could all be deported.Instead after 10 years they should get the right to earn citizenship. At present, we have the worst of all worlds, turning a blind eye to illegal immigration, but making it impossible for illegal immigrants to regularise their status. Doing more to enforce immigration law, while accepting the reality that there are long term illegal immigrants who have settled well, would be far fairer, better for society and more economically efficient. All we need is for policy makers to accept reality",
