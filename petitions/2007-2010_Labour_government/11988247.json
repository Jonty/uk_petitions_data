        "background": "In times of recession we should make sure the opening and closing ceremonies utilize everything we already pay for. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh should head the parade riding in the coronation coach, followed by Charles, Camilla, William and Harry followed by representatives of the army, navy and airforce. Chelsea pensioners, beefeaters and the like would add colour and interest. These people already know how to march in time so rehearsal time would be minimal. The Band of the Royal Marines are pretty adept at all types of music and like everyone else already paid for by the tax payers. Instead of an expensive firework display, give every member of the audience a torch which they can switch on and off as they choose.",
