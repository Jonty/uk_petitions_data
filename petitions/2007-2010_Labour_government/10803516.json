            "background": "Everybody I talk to is fed up of the greed the celebrities of the world have. They spend without thought for anyone worse off than themselves. They then have the cheek to front televised 'phone-in' charity programs asking the general public to part with money they haven't got. We all sympathise with all these great charities but there shouldn't be any need for them as the total value of the world's rich list would cancel out any charitable need without trying. We want to see most if not all of the celebrities in this country giving to these charities before they call on the hard up and make them feel guilty.",
