        "background": "Sim locking prevents users from using other mobile networks with their phones, which results in high roaming charges when abroard, and prevents competition.\n\nWhile we understand that mobile operators subsidise phone costs, we are locked into a contract period when buying the phone, which should be enough to ensure that we use their service so they recover their costs, sim locking is excessive.\n\nSim locking is an unfair practice as it makes your property useless if you leave your provider after your contract period is up, and prevents you from using a rival service.",
