Many people have fought for the Kingdom and it's beliefs and many more have immigrated here because of these same beliefs and institutions. Lets be proud!",

Many thousands of people have fought and died to preserve our way of life and many more people have immigrated here to better themselves and their families. Why are we not showing our pride by flying the Union Jack on every government building? It is always such a pleasure to travel to Paris and see the French flag flying on every corner. We should be doing this here. It is about time our government stops listening to such politically correct dribble that says the flag is divisive and will cause ethnic minorities to feel uncomfortable. These people also came here to excercise their freedoms that exist under the flag of the United Kingdom. So lets FLY THE FLAG!",
