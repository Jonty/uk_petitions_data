            "background": "Royal Mail are almost certainly looking to move Oundle Delivery Office from its current location in Oundle to somewhere in Peterborough. This would cause tremendous inconvenience to over 4,500 residential and business customers who would be faced with having to collect their packets and special deliveries from an already over-subscribed town centre location. In addition, a valuable local service would be compromised and local jobs would be lost. Please lend your support by signing this petition and STOP THE CLOSURE OF OUNDLE DELIVERY OFFICE. Thank you.",
