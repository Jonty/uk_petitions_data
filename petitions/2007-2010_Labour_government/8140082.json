Many people now have sky or cable and do not want to watch anything on the BBC channels, yet we still have to pay for them. I find it very unfair! If you go shopping for clothes you buy what you like, so why force people to buy what they dont like or get a hefty fine?\nIn this digital age I think its time a review of the TV license happened, ask the people what they want, dont make them pay for a service they dont want. \nThank you",
