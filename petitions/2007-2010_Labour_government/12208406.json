            "background": "In last year\u2019s budget, the Government changed the law retrospectively to claw back tax people had avoided paying by exploiting a loophole in the law. They argued that people may have followed the \u201cletter of the law\u201d but not the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d. Ordinary taxpayers are now facing retrospective tax demands, and are also expected to pay interest on the money for commercial restitution.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\n\nThe same principle should be applied to MPs expenses. Where an MP has followed the \u201cletter of the rules\u201d, but not the \u201cspirit of the rules\u201d, they should be made to repay their expenses, and charged interest. Dubious expense claims for so-called \u201csecond homes\u201d should be first to come under the spotlight.",
