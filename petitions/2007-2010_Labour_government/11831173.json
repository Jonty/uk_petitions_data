            "background": "As the rate of abuse and torture of innocent animals increases, the amount of convictions against those  committing these acts remains low. As prisons are full, I propose a new form of punishment for those committing acts of cruelty to animals. When it is proven that an individual has mistreated an animal, a financial sentence anything between 2-5 years with fines up to \u00a320,000 should be imposed. With this the individual will have their wages or benefits garnished for this period while the proceeds go to animal charities such as the RSPCA or USPCA etc. By attacking these indviduals wallets this would be an additional deterent to those involved with such activities.",
