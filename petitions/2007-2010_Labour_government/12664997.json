            "background": "It has been shown over recent events that the current House of Commons has lost all connection with the electorate. The current Parliament is morally bankrupt, and with some members using every opportunity to exploit outdated rules; which they failed to amend in the summer of 2008 of their own accord, I feel that this current session of representative democracy is tarnished beyond measure.\nLeaving the current House to retrospectively pick up the pieces without a mandate or backing of the country is deplorable. The electorate should be allowed to demonstrate its collective confidence in their own MP\u2019s, allowing a \u201cclean slate\u201d. \nHow can those who have been seen to have abused the system, be allowed to influence any new framework of standards and rules?",
