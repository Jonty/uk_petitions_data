            "background": "The current financial crisis has created a hugh increase in the joblessness in the UK. Even though millions are unemployed, more and more work permits and migrants are being given permission to work. I petition the govt to stop issue of \na) new work permits\nb) renewal of new permits\nc) foreign students given automatic right to work in the UK for a period of 2 years\nd) new migrant visa's\n\nMany companies are missusing the work permits to get migrant workers from non EU countries to come to the UK even though they can recruit local residents. The only problem is that local residents want local wages while migrants will take much lower wages and hence this creates an unequal competition in the economy",
