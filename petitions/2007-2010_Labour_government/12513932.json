Stop claiming that this is an anti-terrorism measure because how many people walk around with bombs in their pockets? If the whole intention is to tackle knife and gun crime and to tackle the drugs problem, well come out and say this! \nThe use of 'Stop and Search' is a means of some racist police officers to intimidate young Black and Asian men. It is a humiliating ordeal and plain racist. What kind of message does it give?",
