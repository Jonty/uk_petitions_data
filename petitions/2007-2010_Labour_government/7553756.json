            "background": "They let in San Marino, Montserrat and Andorra but they won't let the Boys from Nuuk play ball..\n\nThe Greenlanders want to be able to play international games without being forced to depend on the Danish Football Association. \nSince 1979 Greenland has tried to develop more autonomy and ways to be accepted as a nation equal to other nations. One of the ways is through sport.\n\nThe Greenlandic Federations of Taekwon-do, badminton, handball, volleyball, biathlon and table-tennis have gained full membership of the International Federations but the two largest federations, ski and soccer, are still denied membership of the international federations. \nIn 1998 Greenland applied for membership in FIFA but was refused...lets get em in this time! Greenland just want to be allowed to play friendly matches not to play in the World Cup! \nFIFA has a monopoly of football and it is not allowed for FIFA members to play matches against non-members.",
