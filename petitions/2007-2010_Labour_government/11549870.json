        "background": "VIOLENT conflict in eastern Congo has killed thousands more people in the past three months and made more than 250,000 homeless and countless women raped and mutilated. With disease rampant and hunger spreading, this is a humanitarian disaster. A United Nations report shows, with irrefutable evidence, how the war is largely a proxy fight between rival militias that are being armed and encouraged by Rwanda\u2019s government. This begs the question of why should UK tax payers fund aid to Rwanda to the tune of a quarter a billion pounds every year. Since the publication of the UN report, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway have withheld any further aid disbursements. The money we pay to Rwanda should go to hospital treatments to help poor women who have suffered the most rather than to a despotic unelected government of Rwanda.",
