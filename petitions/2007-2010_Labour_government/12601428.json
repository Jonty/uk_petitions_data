        "background": "Why should the members of Gordon Brown's government and all the other MP's be able to misuse the expenses system without any sanctions. If this were a commercial company those caught would at the very least be sacked, if not also arrested by the Police and prosecuted. Instead what we see are MP's saying sorry and paying the money back. The only thing that they are sorry about is that they have been caught out!!",
