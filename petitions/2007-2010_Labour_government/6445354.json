        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Arrows, officially named the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, have flown at 4,000 festivals worldwide. But the Department of Culture, Media and Sport ruled last week that the jets were \u201cunsuitable\u201d and \u201cnot in keeping with the event as they were too militaristically British\u201d.\n\nThe government department is running the event alongside organising committee chairman Lord Sebastian Coe. An insider also suggested the Arrows had ALREADY performed at the Olympics \u2014 by doing a fly-past when London won the initial bid.\n\nBut the pilot added: \u201cThe Red Arrows did indeed perform a fly-past. But that was 2005 and was hurriedly organised.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to put on a world-class display for 2012 \u2014 something incredible and never seen before. It would be a showcase of everything that is great about Britain.\n\n\u201cThe Red Arrows are as British as the Queen and London buses.\"\n\nTherefore, why not let the Red Arrows, an amazing aerobatic team, be a part of the 2012 London Olympics?",
