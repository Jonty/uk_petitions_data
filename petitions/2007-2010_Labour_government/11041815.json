            "background": "Following Mr Chris Wheeler's retirement as Chief Officer I suffered 5+ years of alternating hostility, neglect, abuse and downright vitriol just because I am a disabled transgendered woman.  I suffered deep depression and remain unemployed some three years after being ousted from the job I truly loved and was good at (Home Office inspection etc.)  They finally sacked me after causing me so much distress and I lost an Employment Tribunal.  They lied. They connived.  Please! stop it.",
