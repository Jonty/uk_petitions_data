            "background": "120 MP's have backed an Early Day Motion to turn over specturm space on the digital terrestial platform for local TV. This would take the form of a didicated 'Channel 6' which would concentrate purely on local issues. There would be insufficient quality content to justify a 24 hour service if only local or regional areas are covered. We need the bandwidth for future high definition content on what will be the new DVB2 platform, not for more possibly low quality content channels.",
