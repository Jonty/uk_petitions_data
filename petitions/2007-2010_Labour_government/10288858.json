        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many of the people in our hospitals are elderly. The cost of visiting loved ones can be prohibitive for those on fixed incomes such as pensioners. Also, many car parking firms make you decide before you park how long you want to stay for, and if your appointment is delayed there is a dilemma over whether to wait for the doctor, or go and buy another car parking ticket. My 75 year old mother got an \u00a380 fine for being twenty minutes late because the doctor was delayed.Why can't people pay on the way out like they do at the shops? or is it the intention of this government to have pensioners subsidising the NHS through its expensive car parking schemes.",
