            "background": "We are appalled at the news coming from Iraq about the systematic killing, terrifying, and expelling of Christians from their homes in Mousel. It is reported about two thousand Christian families have been displaced from Mousel due to the terror and violence they suffered. They fled their houses with only what they could carry; many fled with the only the clothes on their backs. Moreover, about twenty have been killed thus far, churches have been destroyed or burnt, and the atrocity goes on. So far, we have heard from many reputable voices, many of those voices came from notable Muslim leaders, condemning and denouncing what is occurring in Mousel. However, we have not heard of any definite steps or any plan of actions taken on behalf of these Christians for their safety and protection.",
