            "background": "1. British Naval War graves, which are outside of British Territorial waters, are not protected by the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 or the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 - e.g. the British submarine E3 which was sunk on the 18 October 1914 between Borkum and Schielmonnikoog. The submarine was found by divers on 14 October 1994. It has now been looted and desecrated and items from the boat are on sale ashore. This submarine is a war grave.\n\n2. British Naval War graves which are inside British Territorial waters and which are protected by the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 are not being protected in accordance with the law - e.g. the British submarine M2 - the film of the activities of divers is available for amusement and entertainment on \"YouTube\".\n\nThe British Government must ask our European partners to protect our war graves and stop the desecration of the graves of our seaman for profit. They must also enforce our own legislation.",
