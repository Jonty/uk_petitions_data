The cease in production of citrus flavoured polos has provoked controversy and heated debate, and this clearly shows that they were incredibly popular among the British public, and there has even been a facebook petition created to bring back these popular sweets\n\nNB: THIS IS IN NO WAY INTENDING TO BE HUMOROUS! THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER CONCERNING THE DEMANDS OF REAL PEOPLE!\nAnd also I have no power to tell the people at Nestl\u00e9 what to sell and not sell, but I thought that the government might be so helpful as to try and negotiate something!",
