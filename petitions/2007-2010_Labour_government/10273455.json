        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Under the amendments to the Animal Welfare act in 2007 it is illegal to show any dog with a docked tail, whether legally docked or otherwise, at a show where the public are charged for entry, unless it is to show working ability.  This is unfair to owners whose dog has been docked legally, as it severly limits the activities they can take part in other than field trials, due to entry fees being charged at a lot of show such as Crufts, local fun events and agricultural shows.\nThe docking of working dogs is not done for cosmetic reasons, it is done to prevent tail injuries which are common place in undocked working gundogs.  Why should dog owners be limited to what they can do with their dog simply because measures have been taken to prevent injury to the dog whilst working in the field?",
