If the government set an example and treat minorities as equals, then the public might do the same?\n\nI am sickened by stories of coloured kids calling white kids names, what is the difference between calling someone a 'Brit' or a 'Paki'? 'Ginger' or 'Black'. Speaking to these 'minorities' I can find not one who is seriously offended by these descriptive terms, other than our government, who seems to have a dislike of free and open speech.\n\nTreating minorities differently, *IS* discrimination.\n\nWe petition the government to make it a legal requirement, punishable in law, to treat everyone as equals and putting and end to 'political correctness'.",
