            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is clear that the UK electorate demand the continuance of the NHS as a true cradle to grave care service, and would see the NHS as the first priority for Government spending. As a nation we are proud of the NHS and I believe would be willing to affirm our national ownership of the NHS by becoming true members of an independent NHS.\nBy instituting a bond system a sense of ownership and entitlement would be established, and the use of the NHS by visitors to the country would be put on a different footing. The obligation to be bonded to the NHS would not deny the right to private treatment, but as so often is the case, private cases referred back to the NHS would be covered.\nThe introduction of the bond would be aligned with a significant drop in personal taxation, and the less wealthy would benefit from an assistance scheme. The banks would be under a statutory obligation to facilitate bond finance to individuals, with robust protection afforded individuals and banks alike.",
