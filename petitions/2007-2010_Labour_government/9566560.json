            "background": "Bulgarians and Romanians (A2 Nationals) are allowed to come to UK without the need for a visa and can also get admission into training institutes in UK for conventional study courses (where students attend classes). However they cannot get admission into work based courses (NVQ courses which are assessed by approved NVQ assessor at students\u2019 work place) because they need a registration certificate from the Home Office before they can start work legally for a UK employer. It is a catch 22 situation at the moment due to the existing Home Office rules. \nHome office guidance states that \u201cPlease be advised that while you can apply for a registration certificate confirming your rights as a student at any time, the document will not be issued until you have begun your course of study.\u201d \nTraining institutions can only enrol those students on work based courses who are already working legally and hence A2 Nationals can never start their course of study. \nThe Home Office should change this rule which effectively denies the A2 nationals the opportunity to do work based courses and increase thier professional skills level.",
