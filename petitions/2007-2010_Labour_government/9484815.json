        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Following the disgraceful behaviour of the Rangers fans at the UEFA Cup final, which including attacking police officers, leaving disgusting piles of litter and stabbing a Russian fan, it seems obvious that showing these big games in this way is no longer a viable option. The violence we have seen is inexcusable and the only way to deal with it is to stop showing these matches in this large-scale manner. Furthermore Rangers should be banned from playing in England (and in Europe) for a lengthy period of time (a good few years) to help put an end to this behaviour. This will adversely affect many peaceful, law-abiding fans, but unfortunately it is the only way to clamp down on these yobs.",
