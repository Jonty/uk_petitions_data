            "background": "The Government's handling of the financial crisis has been little short of inept.  The problem of relying on interest rates is that those of us who have money are now in panic - any extra money we receive is going to be put away as savings.  It does not introduce money to the economy.  If tax relief on mortgage payments for first time buyers was introduced e.g. on a sliding scale reducing over 5 years, it would be a real benefit both to people trying to get a start in life, and the economy.",
