            "background": "The Singaporean health system simply works well.  They have the lowest infant mortality rate and among the highest healthy life expectancies from birth, according to World Health Organisation, whilst the Singaporean Government spend just 3% of annual GDP, compared to England's 7.6% of annual GDP.  The system is fair, just and the citizens become responsible for their own health, rather than the UK system whereby you're told what it wrong with you and are not offered any options with regards to your treatment and where this will take place.  Please research the Singaporean system for yourself.  It is complex and will be 'difficult to implement' but it will be worth it.",
