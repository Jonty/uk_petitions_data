            "background": "On Thursday 7th February, the 20 Premier League clubs agreed to look into the possibility of playing an extra round of matches every season - abroad.\n\nI am hoping that the prime minister will look into the many concerns that\u2019s this proposal arises, solely for an increase in profits.\n\nMany teams are already being bought out by foreign investors, who see huge profits in the English club market. This proposal will see their profits soar, and how much of this money will get put back into the game?\n\nThe league is currently balanced, with each team playing others twice, once home and once away. Surely adding a random extra game is simply unfair.\n\nOne major thing to look into should be the affect on the players. Already playing too many games, our English stars are tired and out of shape in comparison to other European leagues that play less games; This issue clearly visible by the team\u2019s embarrassment to qualify for EURO 2008.",
