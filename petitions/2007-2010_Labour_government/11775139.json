Surely if the government paid all debts and take every one with a debt back to zero or make them pay debts with there savings then interest rates will go up and prices will drop, bringing the credit crisis to an end because there be no credit owed to banks. Also don\u2019t give any more lump sums to banks because they WILL just spend it on another party for the staff!",
