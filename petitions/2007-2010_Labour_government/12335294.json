Yet at the same time, our government does not do enough to save them.\n\nWe need to be upfront about our giving.  The Life You Can Save - the book \u2013 asks readers to come to its companion website to pledge that they will meet a standard set out in the last chapter. Will you take the pledge, and in so doing encourage others to do the same?",
