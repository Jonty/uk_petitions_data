            "background": "Closure put forward by Northumberland County Council. As part of the Government scheme is to cut child obesity and 'get teenagers off the streets'. Shutting a leisure centre will not help this matter. The possible closing date for the leisure centre is February. Ashington and the surrounding areas use this leisure centre frequently and it is always busy! With people coming from as far as Sunderland and Middlesbrough to use the leisure centre. Also schools and groups use it for many many sports.",
