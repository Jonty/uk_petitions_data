            "background": "The controversial proposal to introduce 20 mph speed limits in certain areas for safety reasons ignores the extra co2 and other pollutants that will be produced. Most vehicles are much less efficient, and not designed to run, at 20 mph for extended periods. If, for safety reasons, this is introduced, it should be kept to an absolute minimum and not as a supposed green measure.",
