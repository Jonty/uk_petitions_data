            "background": "Currently the road network does not take into account the practical reality that motorcyclists are unlikely to sit in congestion.  They will filter throught the traffic.  In order to make this more safe, why not set aside a narrow lane by the central reservation for the use of motorcyclists during heavy congestion.  The speed in this lane could be severely restricted if necessary (eg 30mph).  It would be much safer.",
