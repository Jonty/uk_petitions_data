        "background": "Inappropriate locations include in the so-called Thames gateway where at present the supporting infrastructure is inadequate, and \"intensification\" of existing housing density is undesirable.  Furthermore much housing is planned for the flood-plane.\n\nOther such places are gardens to older houses, allotments, and other open, but urban spaces, all of which contribute to the pleasant \"look and feel\" of the present United Kingdom - well known for its rose and cottage gardens, and well-tended private gardens.",
