            "background": "Longer Licencing hours do not seem to have curtailed the \"binge drinking\" culture. The customers who over indulge in alcoholic consumption should be fined heavily, and the landlords who knowingly sell alcohol to customers who are over the limit should also be fined, as they are at fault. If three concurrent fines are levied, then the establishment should be closed for a certain time or the licence should be cancelled.\nThe price of any police involvement should also be levied.\nCurrent Licencing laws do not work, and the opening times should be drastically reduced.",
