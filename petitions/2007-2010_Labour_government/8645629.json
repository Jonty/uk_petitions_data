        "background": "We want your help in getting free prescribed syringes for children who need to take liquid medicines.\nPharmacists are only paid to provide syringes when liquid doses are not multiples of 5mls.\nBut we know that syringes are needed to give medicines because \n\u2022Accuracy \u2013 exact measure easy to give \n\u2022Sterile where immunity is compromised \n\u2022Flexible \u2013 they can be made up as exact dosages and sent to school with the child for example \n \u2022Syringes are what a child is used to while in hospital \n\u2022Medicines can be given in more concentrated solutions, so allowing child more stomach room for food! \nLack of free syringes seriously undermines the ability of parents to provide the best care. \nMost children with long term conditions receive their treatment at home.  HeartLine Association has been aware for some time that families suffer much inconvenience and expense when administering drugs to children of all ages.\nWe have found that oral syringes are the most efficient and least emotionally damaging way of doing this.",
