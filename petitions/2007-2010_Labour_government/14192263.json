        "background": "This soldier was falsely accused of showing off to French school children(on September 5th 1944),but due to  translation errors from French to English,it should have been said that the children had pulled the pin out of a live grenade they had found.The brave soldier  took the live grenade away from the children and shielded them from the explosion,saving the lives or serious injury to 20 French children.\nThis soldier should also be awarded a postumous military bravery medal.The Mayor and Villagers of the French town where he gave his life,have named a road after him in honour or his bravery,which they always recognised, since the day of his death.",
