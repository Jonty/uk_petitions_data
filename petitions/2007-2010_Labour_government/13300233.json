        "background": "The internet explorer 6 (ie6) web browser, is a severely out-of-date piece of software, which does not fully support the increasing demands needed of a modern day web browser. It is currently in use across schools and other public services in the UK, and so puts those using it at a disadvantage. Schools and other public services, etc, should be made to upgrade to a more usable, up-to-date web browser.",
