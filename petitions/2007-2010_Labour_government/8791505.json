        "background": "There are around 25 million households in the UK - the majority of which receive 3 to 5 phone books each year in the form of yellow pages, telephone directories etc - the majority of which are never used. In this modern age such \"dead tree media\" listings are redundant and simply serve to clutter up people's homes, fill landfill sites (less than 60% of them ever make it to recycling centres) and waste huge amounts of energy and water in the production and distribution processes.  In general all such distributions should stop with only those who actually request a directory receiving one - and then there should be an option as to the required format; the listing on a CD would be far less damaging to the environment.",
