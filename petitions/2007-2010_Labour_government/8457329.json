I propose that the BBC starts to use external advertising to suppliment the cost of making there own programmes, this is to take the financial burden away from tax payers.  and puts it back onto the BBC.  Channel 4 and ITV use external advertising to pay for excellent TV programmes, while on the BBC and its extra channels all you have are repeats of unpopular programmes.  I URGE YOU TO SCRAP THE LICENSE FEE and let the BBC to fend for themselves financially.",
