This petition is to make the doal seem less luxury. \n\nThe idea is that people on the doal should be made to do tasks which better their community before they can claim.\n\nPeople should use the doal as a last resort, ie. when made redundant or fired. Too often our hard earned 'tax payers' money is spent on paying for people who are too lazy to work.\n\nSign this petition to help make the doal a less desirable place to be.",
