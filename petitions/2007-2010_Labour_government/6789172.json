            "background": "To only allow commuter traffic on the motorways between 7am and 9am and between 5pm and 7pm where a licence has been provided by the employer.  In addition to this, all HGV's will not be able to apply for this license and will be banned from the roads during these times.  Public transport such as buses and coaches will be exempt and allowed to travel at all times.\n\nThis will greatly reduce the level of traffic on our highways during peak times and help ensure the continuity of business as staff will be less impeded to commute.  Other benefits from such a scheme would also include lower emissions, and less fuel used per journey.\n\nOur roads are becoming more and more congested and this is down to nothing but sheer weight of traffic.  You could impose a toll, but what is that going to achieve?  It means that either the poorer people cannot commute to the better jobs or companies will have to foot the bill.  The only answer is to reduce the weight of traffic, and the first realistic place to start is the above.",
