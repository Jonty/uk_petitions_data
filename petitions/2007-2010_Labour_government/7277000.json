            "background": "With the current aversion to the use of plastic carriers issued by supermarkets and shops, allow these establishments to leave out empty cardboard cartons and boxes for the use of their customers to transport purchases.\nThis was the practice until a few years ago when shops were stopped from doing so in the interests of recycling.\nTo allow it again would automatically reduce the numbers of plastic carriers used and the boxes could be recyled by the customer.\nAs the majority of people visit supermarkets by car, boxes are a much  more suitable method of transporting purchases than plastic carriers and are far easier to dispose of responsibly.",
