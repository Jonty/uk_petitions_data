        "background": "I have often noticed that, especially when a particularly heinous crime is alleged to have been committed by an immigrant or asylum seeker, the fact of the alleged perpetrator's status, particularly if (allegedly) illegally so, always seems to be mentioned.  In my opinion this issue is totally irrelevant - the only issue is the alleged crime itself and its effect on the alleged victim (would the effect be any different if the alleged crime had been committed by someone born and bred in Britain?!) - and reporting this can only lead to an increase in racism and possibly even racist attacks.",
