            "background": "Community Radio stations are licensed by Ofcom and are typically permitted only to send a low-powered signal at designated times on a specified frequency to serve a specified locality. Licences are relatively expensive and - in case of emergency such as the current floods, Ofcom is not constituted to deal with urgent requests to extend licences or waive strict compliance with licence restrictions on hours and times of braodcasting.\n\nGiving the PM an emergency power to waive licence conditions for a designated period would be a valuable service to the public.\n\nLocal commercial radio stations are not best able to broadcast the level of detailed community information which could greatly assist communitites to help themselves at such times, as they have to accommodate existing programme schedules.",
