            "background": "For over 200 years the Gurkha soldier has served this country. His bravery and loyalty being renowned throughout the military. It is a public disgrace that these brave men are treated so badly with pension rights and those who retired from the military prior to 1997 having no automatic right of residence in the UK.This is totally ridiculous when others are welcomed into the UK with open arms who have contributed nothing to this country. This matter should be resolved as a matter of urgency.",
