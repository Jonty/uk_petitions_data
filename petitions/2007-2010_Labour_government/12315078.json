        "background": "The UK job centres at present are understaffed and staffed by people with no idea of what it is like to be unemployed. Jobseeker's claimants are lucky to spend 5 minutes a fortnight with an advisor and this is merely to sign a piece of paper which plays to those who don't want to work but does nothing to help those who are actually seeking employment.There are currently no work experience placements available which I think should be compulsory after a certain amount of time, no help with interview techniques or CV creation and no assistance in how to find work.In these harsh economic times the UK needs a Job Centre structure which helps people.",
