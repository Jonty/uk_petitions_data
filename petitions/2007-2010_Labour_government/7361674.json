            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The majority of pre-payment customers have their meters installed to either help them budget or to get rid of an existing debt. It is shameful that the energy supplier can then send out letters to its customers demanding to be repaid for energy the customer has been undercharged for. If the supplier is incapable of calibrating the meter so the customer is charged correctly then the customer should not be liable for this incompetence and inability by the supplier to charge them the correct tariff. This practice is leaving people that already struggle, in even more debt. The current regulations do not go far enough to help and this practice should be banned.",
