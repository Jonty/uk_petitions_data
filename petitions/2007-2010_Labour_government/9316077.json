            "background": "As an owner of 2 preserved vintage buses, the rising cost of fuel is stifling my leisure time.  If owners like me signed up to a government dept. giving Make, model and registration number of vehicle/s, we should then be allowed to pay pre tax prices for these vehicles fuel. Upon signing up, we would agree to on the spot checks with the Ministry of Transport. In other words, why cant we use red diesel like farmers without being prosecuted.",
