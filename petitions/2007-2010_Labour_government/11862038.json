            "background": "Make it compulsory for judges to make orders under sections 38 and 44 of the childrens act 1989 in care proceedings involving domestic violence victims as in America.\nMany children have and still are being put into foster care for 'at risk of emotional harm'.\nDomestic violence victims are now more reluctant to call on public services for help as they fear losing their children.Social services are persuading judges that the abuser or even the victim may not abide by such an order.If the court doubts the abuser will not then surely if the abuser breaks the order he will be dealt with by the courts accordingly eg prison. If there is clear evidence that the victim does not abide by such an order then removal to foster care maybe justified.Give families a chance to keep their children at home with the help of the family courts and exclusion orders. This would also reduce the children in the care system that free's up places and funds for children who are being directly physically,sexually abused and neglected.",
