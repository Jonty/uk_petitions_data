            "background": "It is estimated that 75 percent of all UK law comes from the non electiable commsion in Brussels, and if true is not acceptable as we deserve to make our own rules and govern ourselves.  There has been much talk about how the EU is good for Britain, but many people suggest that when the government say we do lots of trading with the EU and that we simply could not survive in the EU, when in fact, they include any product from any non EU member state passing through the EU as direct trade with us which is how those statistics come about.\n\nWe want a independent review to investigate the effects to the UK on being a member of the EU, with all the pros and cons weighed up and published without being censored to the UK public.  The review should be carried out by a group of 6 people, 3 of which should be considered as pro EU and 3 that are considered anti EU.  The people chosen for this review should not be chosen by any member or minister of the Government.",
