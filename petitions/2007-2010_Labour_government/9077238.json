            "background": "BT have admitted to running secret trials of Phorm technology between 23 September and 6 October 2006 and July 2007.  They have further admitted to lying to the media, press and their customers when questioned about this at the time.\n\nIn carrying out this trial without receiving consent from their customers and the web sites they visited, BT appear to be in criminal breach of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000; as this (as defined by the Act) is classified as an Unlawful Interception.\n\nThe number of counts for this offence potentially runs into millions dependent on how many communications they intercepted over the period of the trials.\n\nWhether the data was discarded or anonymised after the fact is irrelevant and does not alter the fact that all these interceptions were in fact Unlawful as defined by the Act.",
