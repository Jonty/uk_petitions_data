        "background": "The biggest problem with minor crime is that the punishment is very light, this does not deter career criminals because they can continue to commit crime once they have served their sentence knowing full well that if they get caught again they will have the same minor punishment.\nIf all previous crimes committed was added to the sentence imposed by the courts this would be a big deterrent to prevent re-offending. These should be served one after the other.\nThe point of any punishment is to prevent the offence been re-committed, obviously for criminals who re-offend the punishment never worked so they should serve it again in the hope that it will have the desired affect and prevent them from committing further crimes.",
