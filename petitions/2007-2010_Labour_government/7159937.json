            "background": "The BBC sports personality of the year contest should be to recongise british sporting excellence and people who move to places like Switzerland to avoid paying tax here should not be classed as british based for the purposes of this award. Sports stars should not be glorified by a society which they consciously decide they no longer wish to contribute to or be a part of by virtue of their decision not to pay tax there. In a civilised society contribution towards public services through income tax is both morally and economically necessary if it is to function properly.",
