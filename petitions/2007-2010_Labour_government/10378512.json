The remarks are not out of context. They are wrong, pure and simple. Ahmadinejad never said them. Farsi speakers have pointed out that he was mistranslated.\"\nJonathan Steele, The Guardian, 2 June 2006",

This was the point that the Prime Minister was making in his speech to the Knesset.  The Iranians have had ample opportunity to clarify what they meant and yet they have continued to use inflammatory language about the State of Israel'.",
