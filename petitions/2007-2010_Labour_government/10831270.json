It is our country we are far to lenient with our laws of foreign people coming in to the country. They take all of our jobs and homes and even have more money than us. I have heard of cases that polish people come over here to work and claim chil benefit off our government and there children are still living in poland. We wouldnt be welcomed with open arms into there country so why should they.",
