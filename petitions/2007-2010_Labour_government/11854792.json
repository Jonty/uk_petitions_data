            "background": "Britain's history and culture is fantastic and unique. Much like the majority of people detest the Euro as a possible currency for Britain, the British pound is a fantastic part of our sovereignty and of our history and culture. We used to have such a fascinating and historic currency that was ditched for a decimal system (which is, in all fairness, much more practical). I suggest that we return Britain to the wonderfully nostalgic and unique system of half-pennies, farthings, sixpence and shillings. It would be more difficult to grasp, but oh so much more fun and interesting. Plus, oh so very cool.",
