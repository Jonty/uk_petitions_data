        "background": "Prime Minister, As Bible believing Christians we condemn the murder of   Laxmanananda Saraswati in August 2008 in Orissa. The blame for this murder was unjustly placed at the feet of Low Caste Dalit Christians and this injustice resulted in 2 years of Persecution by Hindu extremists against innocent Christians.\n\nFreedom of Religion is guaranteed by the Indian Constitution under Article 25 therefore the Central Government in New Delhi carries the ultimate responsibility for the upholding of this Human Right and Law and Order in Orissa. \n\nApprox 120 Christians have been murdered, 250 churches have been destroyed; schools and orphanages burned down. Fifty thousand Christians are now homeless and thousands are living in the jungles or make shift Government camps in inhumane conditions unable to return to their villages on pain of death.\n\nPlease communicate our deep concern to the Indian authorities and urge them to take all necessary steps to restore law and order; keep relief camps open; guarantee access for NGO\u2019s to bring aid to Christians; and implement the recommendations of The National Commission for Minorities Report January 2008.\n\nCLIO TRUST.",
