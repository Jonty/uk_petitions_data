            "background": "PO Ltd has proposed the closure of this viable and thriving subpost office: The so called 6 week consultation period ENDS on 8TH JULY 2008. Please sign this petition to help us save Rothienorman Post Office.\n\nPO Ltd are proposing to mitigate the impact of the proposed closure by establishing an much reduced and inferior Outreach Service in the local shop, which will not adequately serve the needs of residents of Rothienorman or the surrounding area. This service is unlikely to continue beyond its one year contract.\n\nWe believe that PO ltd has used vague, outdated and incomplete data to try and justify its decision. Rothienorman Post Office is widely used by the residents of Rothienorman and also surrounding villages for many domestic and business purposes. Rothienorman is a growing village with more business units and 100 houses under construction & 40 more houses planned. Very limited bus services make it impossible for those without transport to reach another Post Office. Closure will also lead to an enormous increase in the number of car journeys, contrary to the Government\u2019s policies on global warming.",
