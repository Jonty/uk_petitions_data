            "background": "Britain had, until now, an opt-out from the European Union's use of metric measurements which allowed the use of acres to continue. \n\nAccording to The Telegraph on 21 July 2008, the acre, one of England's historic imperial measurements, is to be banned from use under a new European directive.   \n\nThe measurement, which will officially be replaced by the hectare, will no longer be allowed when land is being registered  \n\nAfter being agreed last week at an EU meeting, the new ruling will come into force in January 2010.  \n\nIt should be a matter of common sense whether we use hectares or acres, and that this should be a matter for England to decide, not the EU. \n\nWe petition the Government to think again and to insist to the European Commission that England must keep the right to use our familiar, traditional and useful measure of land, if we the English people so wish.",
