            "background": "Chemtrails are badly effecting the British Isles. On many days you will notice the trails of planes linger in the sky for many hours, forming a wispy, dispersed 'cloud' cover, obscuring the sky above and reducing sunlight. A large increase in illness occurred in the British Isles around 1993/94 In recent years, there has been a large increase in the incidence of asthma. Also, colds, nagging coughs, flus, and viruses which are very severe and never seem to clear up.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO CHEMTRAILS\n\nAllergies, sore and blocked sinuses; \nDry, hacking, persistent cough; \nNosebleeds, blood in mucous; \nSwollen, burning, teary eyes with mucous; \nFlu-like, fever, sore throat; \nPneumonia, upper respiratory; \nMycoplasma infections; \nMigraine or splitting headaches; \netc, the list goes on.\n\nSo let's stop the Chem trails from spreading and causing more global warming and illnesses. Sign the petition for a healthier life.",
