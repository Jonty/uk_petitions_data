We also ask that the UK Government persuades other nations, through diplomatic channels, to commit resources to alleviating world hunger. \n\nThe UK should particularly use mechanisms within the European Union and the good relations it enjoys with the United States of America to co-ordinate a world wide response to this hunger epidemic.",
