Get control of the do gooders, who have no clue whatsoever about living amongst these youths and their families, and take away their right to interfere, as they have been instrumental in taking away our rights to a peaceful and safe life. In short, if a young person causes trouble, they get to learn how to be men the military way. Lots of these children have never been shown how to live amongst others, lets help them stay out of prison",
