Rather than multiculturalism destroying our national holidays and calling any kind of patriotism 'Racism' due to various offences to islam and other Non-English faith's. I don't want racism. I simply don't wish to be mocked or arrested for patriotism and support of the united kingdoms its flag and all of its glory.\n\nGod Bless the Queen",
