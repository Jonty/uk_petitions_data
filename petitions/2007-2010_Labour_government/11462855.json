Those voters who take the trouble to go to a polling station to vote would be stupid to waste their time by the deliberate vadalism of the ballot paper.  Instead these voters are trying to make a serious point and it would be more accurate to record the vote as an abstention.  However, I do not expect this petition to get very far as it is in the interests of politicians not to concede such a thing!",
