            "background": "A normal measure of quantity, such as the millilitre, would be more logical, accurate and understandable. The 'unit of alcohol' is a patronising attempt to make the issue simpler, but just increases confusion and is not accurate enough to enable calculation of total alcohol intake. In addition, a system using millilitres or grams, as taught in schools, would not require the expenditure of millions of pounds on trying to explain the flawed system of alcohol units to the public.",
