            "background": "We ask for a legislation to be put into effect to protect all Christian believers in the U.K. That by law they can practice every word written in the 'new testament' without hindrance or prejudice.\n As Christians we believe all the Bible to be Truth. In the British court room we 'swear' upon The word as 'the whole Truth', we do not swear on the words of other faiths, nor were we brought up to believe in other gods.\nEveryone has the right to choose what they believe, yet it is noticeable that as other gods come into this country our Christian heritage,\n morality and rights are diminishing.\n In some countries Christians are being persecuted for what they believe, please don't let that happen here, we ask you for a law that will protect all Christian believers in U.K.\n In The name of our Lord Jesus Christ,  Protect our Royal Heritage.\nGod Save The Queen.",
