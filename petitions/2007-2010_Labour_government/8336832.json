            "background": "The income of the Treasury should be fully itemized and accounted for, \nWith the full amount of revenue collected from each source of Taxation, License fee, or Duty, openly published on the Government website for everyone to see.\n\nThe same principal should be applied to the spending of taxpayers money, with itemized accounts again openly published on the government website.\n\nThis system would have everything out in the open, and everyone would be overseeing everyone else, therefore misappropriation of the taxpayer\u2019s money would be much harder to conceal.\n\nThe main government website would outline the funding going to each local council, \nEach Local council website would outline how that money was spent, with each department showing its Itemized funding and expense accounts,\n\nEventually it would come down to the Individuals within the Council or Organisation and they too should have to make itemized funding and expense accounts on their website.",
