            "background": "With the soaring number of people claiming income support on a long term basis and a frightening number of people who have never worked and have no intention of ever working something needs to be done. I propose that people who are capable of working, but have made no effort to find work in a 12 month period, should be forced to work. They should also be centrally housed with no recreational access to the outside world. This would reduce our social costs and might finally encourage the long term workshy to take responsibility for their own lives.",
