            "background": "At age 16, it is legal for a British person to join the armed forces, have sexual relationships, leave school, marry, work full time, become a homeowner and pay taxes, among other things. We therefore believe that it is wrong to not allow these young citizens their right to vote for the government under which they live.\n\nAs noted on a similar petition (which has, unfortunately, been closed);\n\n\"Stopping 16 and 17 year olds from voting and having the chance to be heard sends a signal to them and to society, especially politicians, that their views aren't valid and that they aren't real citizens. At a time when people feel that politics isn't relevant to them, young people need to be encouraged to take part in democracy, not kept out from it.\" \n\n(Link to closed petition with many good points in description: http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/ReduceVotingAge/)\n\nAllowing young people to work for their country and to pay taxes to their government without allowing them any say in who this is? That isn't democracy.",
