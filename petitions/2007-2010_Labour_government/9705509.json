            "background": "Disability Living Allowance (DLA) rules don\u2019t assess ability to walk in a real place, they are based on a theoretical environment which doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nDLA is the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d of other benefits and benefits in kind, concession bus travel, disabled parking permits and car tax exemption, essential for disabled people.\n\nThe walking test is based on an environment where you can sit down anywhere, there are no kerbs, steps, uneven surfaces or slopes. If one can walk 51 metres \u2013 an appallingly short distance \u2013 but ONLY if this surface is flat then one does not meet the threshold for DLA. \n\nThe lower rate mobility component is NOT for people who can walk a little more than 50 metres but not much, it is for people who need e.g. a guide or carer outdoors. There is NO provision for people who can walk 51+ metres, further than between most city bus stops. . \nWe want to see thresholds changed so the lower rate of mobility allowance so that more people qualify for the lower payment and associated concessions on transport. WHICH ALLOW THEM TO WORK AND CONTRIBUTE. These payments pay for themselves many times over.",
