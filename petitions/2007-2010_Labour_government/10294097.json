Despite attempts at obtaining justice through \u2018normal channels\u2019 it is denied. The Prime Minister even ignoring a petition signed by family, friends, past students and past staff of the institution in question as well as a number of current and past local councillors. What are less well placed observers to make of such a system?\n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to ensure that real justice, rather than mere law, rules in the United Kingdom. As a first step towards this we ask him to have a Royal Commission on \u2018Justice not Just Law\u2019.",
