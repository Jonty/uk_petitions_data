            "background": "With an increasing number of high profile cases of child abuse and murder in the UK, many of these offenders are routinely placed into protective or segregated wings to protect them from the general prison population at an inflated cost to the UK taxpayer. These people have taken advantage of vulnerable children, yet the UK taxpayer pays the price to protect them precisely because their crimes are so heinous. If anything, by placing these criminals under protection the prison service only implies a lack of faith in guards to control prison inmates- surely if this is the case the entire prison system is defunct. Since the goverment spends an ever increasing amount on the prison service, we as taxpayers and citizens of the UK can only assume this is not the case.\nIf we are ever to stamp out these sorts of crimes in our country, conviction for these crimes should be something to fear - instead these criminals get the kind of treatment the system has failed to provide for their victims.\nPlease put an end to placing child abusers and child killers into protection or segretation to protect them from the prison population.",
