Even though they are at home it doesn\u2019t mean to say that they are safe. More and more stories have come to our attention over the past few years of young people getting killed; paedophilia and abuse over the internet (possibly leading to suicide). This never used to be a problem but now it is all thanks to social networking websites such as - \u2018Facebook\u2019; \u2018MySpace\u2019; \u2018Bebo\u2019 etc. What I ask is that there should be some sort of an age limit to these sites, so that the younger more vulnerable ages can stay clear of these sorts of dangers. I think that young people have enough things to be concerned about other then worrying about problems they are having with individuals over the internet! \n\nBelow are just a few links to illustrate my point.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1224130/Mother-Ashleigh-Hall-killed-meeting-man-Facebook-calls-ban-false-online-profiles.html\n\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21844203/\n\nhttp://www.digitaljournal.com/article/256115\n\nPlease help stop this before it goes much further.",
