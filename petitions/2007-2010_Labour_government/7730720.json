            "action": "ask the Chancellor to levy a windfall tax on the profits of domestic energy producers",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Competition in the UK domestic energy market is not working.  Most of our energy utilities are now in the hands of large foreign companies, who are unaccountable to the UK government or even private shareholders.  These companies are once again in the process of imposing double-digit price rises in domestic gas and electricity prices early this winter.  Last year following 2 years of price hikes, they waited until the winter was over before cutting prices in response to lower wholesale prices.  In many cases these firms benefit directly from the increased prices caused by their own supply blockages.  This petition calls for a windfall tax to be imposed in the Budget on the excess profits of producers and suppliers of gas and electricity, and for the proceeds of this to be used as tax incentives to the wider industry to (1) build new storage facilities for gas (2)develop new sources of supply for gas, including new pipelines (3) Pursue a balanced energy policy to encourage additional electricity generation, to include [but not soley consist of] sources of renewable energy",
