I feel very strongly that this government is trying its hardest to destroy GP practice as we know it, bringing in poly or super clinics means we will loose our surgeries, doctors and continuity of care and once gone this service will never be put back.  If there is one good thing you can do today it is \"help save your GP Practice\".\n SUPPORT YOUR DOCTORS NOW! Sign today and pass it on, tell your friends.  Your doctors NEED YOU.",
