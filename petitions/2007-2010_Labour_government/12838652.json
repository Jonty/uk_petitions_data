            "background": "How can members of the House of Commons (MP's) still have the affront to refer to themselves as \"The Honourable\" or \"Right Honourable\" Member. \nThe MP\u2019s expense scandal makes this a farce. Using our money to fill their pockets, ducking out of paying tax, paying family members, and claiming for items not relevant to office is far from \u201cHonourable\u201d-The Public are sick and tired of hearing MP\u2019s saying they did nothing wrong or \u201cit was a mistake\u201d.\n\nThe honourable thing to do would be to admit it and pay it all back.\n\nWith the Police now investigating MP\u2019s expenses and prosecutions likely to follow how can they continue to be described as \u201cHonourable\u201d.\n\nConsider this, The Honourable Member was today convicted of fraud and sentenced to 3 years.- The Right Honourable Member was convicted of obtaining public funds by deceit.\n\n\n \u201cHonourable member\u201d should be a term denoting respect and integrity \u2013 Are any of the members now serving in the House of Commons deserving of this.\n\nPlease sign this petition. If this petition gains momentum the Prime Minister and all MP\u2019s will have a wake up call that can\u2019t be ignored.",
