            "background": "I feel that many councils are discriminating against disabled people by not ensuring that they have realistic access to their home, whether they are privately owned or rented from the local authority. Many disabled people cannot even get within a comfortable distance of their own front door, e.g. only being able to park their vehicle away from their property because of lack of vehicle access and/or local authority parking restrictions. Local authorities should be forced to provide realistic access for disabled persons vehicles where a genuine requirement can be shown.e.g. level parking with wheelchair access where needed, driveways where possible etc.",
