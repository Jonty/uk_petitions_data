            "background": "We the British people expect Government, Parliament and our political systems to work in the best interests of the British people. In recent years, events such as two wars, bare faced expediency in international affairs and corruption revealed by the expenses scandal, have brought into sharp focus just how outmoded our political system and culture really are. The British people are largely disenfranchised from British politics due to a disastrous lack of accountability and transparency at all levels and a grossly undemocratic voting system. We continue to suffer toothless enquiries and castrated regulators, dark age Parliamentary systems, the world's most complex and murky taxation system and the interests of political Parties taking precedence over those of the nation. We expect complete and transparent reform with consultation and we demand complete reform to begin without delay.",
