        "background": "Here is an idea to create employment in the deprived area of east Yorkshire :\n\nBuild a ( nother ! ) bridge across the River Humber. Of course the nay sayers, the 'Moaning Minnies' those with a negative approach to life will say that there already is one.\nHowever, when that bridge was built it was the longest single span suspension bridge in the world in 1981, but time, technology, standards have moved along - exponentially !\n\nThe Severn has more than one bridge spanning it, the Thames has  more bridges than I can count !\n\nNow one may object to this suggestion on the basis that there is no possible economic or geographic reason. But to those people I say:\n\n\" bring back Barbara  Castle ! \"\n\nIt never bothered her !!!!!!!!!!!!!!1\nwhen she got drunk in 1966 and said\n\n\" You should have a bridge -- yes - yes - yes ! \"",
