            "background": "The council responsible for fraisthorpe beach have overstepped their legality by putting up signs \"advising\" that natursim on the beach may lead to prosecution even though naturism is not illegal and the beach has been used by naturists for over 30 years. The only aim of these signs is to scare people. This is a way councils have found around central government legislation. A representative from the council recently responded to correspondence on this issue saying \"It is accepted that as an authority we may be unable to \"ban\" nudism [sic][read \"naturism\"] but we can erect advisory notices to the effect that such actions may lead to prosecution by the police. The signs at present are satisfactory in that they achieve what is required.\" This is clearly going beyond their powers and it is not the councils right to lie about what is legal in order impose their authority. The councils are relying on the fear of prosecution to impose their will. Councils which put up signs like this should be forced to take them down, be fined and have to apologise publicly.",
