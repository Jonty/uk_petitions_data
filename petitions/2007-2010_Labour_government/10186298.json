        "background": "The cost of the road tax element of DVLA is enormous. Building maintenance, furnishing, computers, supplies, staff (incl support, admin and maintenance    staff), advertisement, pursuit of tax dodgers incl sophisticated technology and so much more. Scrap the tax disc, put .5p on a litre of fuel. No-one can avoid paying, visitors from overseas will contribute, gas guzzlers will pay more than economical users, reduced queues at post offices, reduced paper  waste, no fines for late patment, and so on. Just .1p per litre would raise more than \u00a3150 per year per average motorist. And we won't have to get time off work to buy a disc.",
