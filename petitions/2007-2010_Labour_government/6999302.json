            "background": "Since the fire at Bradford & the disasters at Hillsborough & Heysel, football stadiums have been improved beyond recognition.However, in many cases it has also been priced out of the reach of genuine working class supporters, who would love to take their families along, but cannot afford to. There is also a rise in the number of supporters standing when their team are attacking, therefore obscuring the view of people behind them, forcing them to also stand up.\nWith the better Policing, improved & brand new Stadia/safety & the banning of smoking in public places, we the undersigned would like to have Standing areas re-introduced at UK Football grounds.",
