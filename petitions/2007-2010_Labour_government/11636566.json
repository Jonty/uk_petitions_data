            "background": "There was once a time when we were proud to be British.  One of the reasons for that was the BBC.  No longer.  Our disillusionment began with the low quality of programming on BBC television in recent years, and this continued with the Ross/Brand affair.  The final straw, though, was the BBC\u2019s contemptible decision not to broadcast the DEC appeal for help for Gaza. In our view, and apart from the more important question of morality, we have absolutely no wish to have our money taken from us by government to spend on what now appears to be a branch of Israeli TV.  We call for the abolition of the licence fee payable to the BBC.",
