        "background": "12 times a year the MEP's migrate from Brussels to Strasbourg to hold a 4 day 'plenery' meeting. This cost us, the taxpayer, more than 120 million euros per year, is rediculous in the extreme when the MEP's have perfectly adequate meeting places in Brussels. Let us get it to stop. If the prime minister will not act then this demonstrates a lack of conscience to our hard earned money and a good reason to seek a different govenment.",
