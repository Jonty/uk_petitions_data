Even though the cost of living is more expensive and inflation is up, those that would and should have access to working tax credit are now finding themseves unable to apply. I want as many people to sign this petition as possible so that these upper limits can be adjusted to take into account the cost of living and are regularly reviewed so that people aren't penalised for getting a small payrise which is still below reasonable limits but still get working tax credit.",
