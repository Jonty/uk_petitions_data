            "background": "Please put an end, once and for all, to the unnecessary suffering of animals through experimentation for the benefit of humans.  Why use animals? They are different from humans. What works for them wont always work for us. How many more animals really have to die at the expense of developing a new product that we don\u2019t even need? Please stop this now. These people, like P&G, only care about the money they are making, not the welfare of the animals they sentence to horrible, painful, unnecessary deaths. Thousands of animals have to die each week just so we can have a new shampoo or washing powder, new make-up or perfume among many other products. This has to stop now!",
