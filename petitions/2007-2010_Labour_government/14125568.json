        "background": "Despite 'Foxhunting' by use of hounds being made illegal in this country 'Foxhunters' are still killing foxes by use of hounds and using the excuse that the hounds are simply picking up on the scent of foxes by mistake.This results in the extremely cruel painful death of these animals. If foxes are continually being killed by hounds let the organisers (knowing it is illegal) face criminal charges and justice and not have the use of excuses that mock the law and the general publics intellect.",
