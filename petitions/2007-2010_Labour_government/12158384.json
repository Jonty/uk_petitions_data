            "background": "Politicians should not require second homes nor expenses to cover living accomodation in London.  The government should create secure dormitories with onsite catering.  These dorms will provide basic, secure accomodation with all facilities and meals, thus reducing costs for expensive hotels, communications and restaurant dinners.  The Olympic village at Stratford is minutes away from Westminster and will have an excess of space post-olympics, including a direct public transport link to Westminster. These should be considered for conversion.",
