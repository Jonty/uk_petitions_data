            "background": "The evidence is now increasingly clear that imidacloprid, the world's best-selling insecticide, created by Bayer CropScience, is a contributor to Bee colony collapse disorder. Bayer itself admits the drug is highly toxic to bees. It is surely time to stop using these chemicals in Britain. Bees are an essential part of plant and animal life because of their importance in plant pollination.\n\nThese pesticides are now banned in France. Lets follow their lead.",
