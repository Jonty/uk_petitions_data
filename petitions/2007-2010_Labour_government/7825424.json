            "background": "it's very simple: a pupil who misbehaves should pay for it. Corporal punishment was banned and has only resulted in a decrease in classroom discipline and respect for the teacher. Schools are not as focussed as they were in the past, and today's youth need to stop thinking they are supreme. Compare an old episode of Grange Hill' and picture it with a 21st Century classroom.",
