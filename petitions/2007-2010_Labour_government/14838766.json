            "background": "Rima is now 17 and has lived with Robert & Alison Swinfen as a family for the best part of a year. She is just starting to recover from the trauma of losing her father in Eritrea and then being sent away by her mother for safety. Now she is threated with being taken away from her new parents, leaving trauma scars so deep she might well never recover, particularly given conditions in Italy for aslyum seekers and refugees.\nA recent Court decision means that deportations to Italy are in general goijng ahead, but we think that Rima deserves special consideration due to the strength of her bond with her new parents and the danger of repeat trauma.",
