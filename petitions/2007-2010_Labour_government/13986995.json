THE COST OF UK TAX DUTY IS DOUBLE THE COST of a litre of the Fuel it taxes. Any reasonable government that loves or cares for its people would do something!, anything! to mitigate this disgraceful situation and relieve the burden of suffering on the people. A PM that is of the people would act without the need of a petition to ensure solace for the needy and the people of the UK at large!",
