            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The law clearly states that front foglamps should only be used INSTEAD of dipped headlamps, in conditions of reduced visibility.\n\nYet on almost all cars, the front foglamps can be on simultaneously with the dipped headlamps, and many people use them thus, either deliberately or negligently.  \n\nLegislation could and should prevent the sale of vehicles on which both front foglamps and headlamps can be on simultaneously and this could be made retrospective to cover all current vehicles, as the necessary modification would be cheap and easy in almost all cases.  Enforcement could be handled by making the front fog lamps an MOT item, which if fitted should work correctly, i.e. not simultaneously with the headlamps.  This would also address the problem of badly aimed foglamps.",
