        "background": "It is always the long suffering public that bear the brunt and cost of Cowboy Builders. They frequently take advantage of the public, delivering shoddy workmanship and getting away with. To even try recourse to law is horrendously expensive, timeconsuming and you may not win even though it is confirmed by experts that the work undertaken was not to a good standard.\nIt is now time to fight back!\nThis petition is to gain support from all communities, local government, Members of Parliament and any other interested body with a view to a change in the law to formally licence all tradesmen, similar to that of Taxi Drivers and Publicans.  If a tradesman is found to have completed shoddy work or has taken commercial advantage they can have the licence revoked and therefore cannot trade.  Trading without a proper licence would be a criminal offence. The licence fee should be set at a level to self fund the scheme and all complaints should be referred to an independent arbitration panel for decision.  The arbitration panel would have the power to appoint Joint Experts whos findings would be bindings on the parties.",
