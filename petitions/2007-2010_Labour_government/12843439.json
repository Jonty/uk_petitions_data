        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "To help those who have worked hard and rely on their pension in retirement years, it is proposed that any income from a pension should be tax free up to the sum of \u00a350,000 per annum. Any pension income above this level would remain liable for tax at the normal rates. This would help alleviate the finanicial burden on those people who have worked to gain benefit from a company pension scheme or have invested in their own retirement funds. Setting a maximum limit on the sum which is free of taxation will help ensure that those on a modest income from pensions are helped in a proportionally greater manner than the very rich.",
