        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With the Government's attempt to stimulate the faltering economy by reducing the financial burden on the UK public, the opportunity to scrap the Tv Licence and fund the BBC from central goverment revenues is one which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe reasons are simple:\n\n1. The TV licence is a disproportionate tax against the lower paid.\n\n2. Figures from a recent as 2003 show that collection cost of TV Licence exceeds \u00a3150million\n\n3. The saving of these collection costs will further support the lowering of taxes and as such aid economic stimulation\n\n4. Court time taken up through cases regarding non-payment of the TV Licence fee will be released, making substantial further savings.\n\n5. Decriminalisation of the non-licence payers will improve this area of society.\n\n6. Further beaurocracy regarding the tracking of members of the public who simply buy a TV set will also reduce unnecessary expenditure. \n\nThere is now an opportunity for this unnecessary tax to be completely dismantled for the benefit of the whole nation.\n\nIt is now time to unshackle ourselves from it",
