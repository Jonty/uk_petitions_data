How many people do you know who have done work for charities, etc and do not get recognised? How many people are risking their lives at the moment for us in Iraq, Afghanistan...? If 'normal' people are getting knighthoods, etc then no-one knows about it as they don't get mentioned in the papers. Let's make them realise that just because they may not be famous, people would still like to be recognised for their dedication",
