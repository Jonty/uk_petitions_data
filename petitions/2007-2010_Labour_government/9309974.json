There are only so many jobs, houses, school places and hospital beds to go around so the powers that be should be looking at some vetting system which would stop the un-skilled untrained EU migrant worker from entering the country. This points/vetting system would allow only the skilled EU workers to enter the country, where they will not be a drain on the system.",
