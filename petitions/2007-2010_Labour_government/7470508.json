            "background": "Reducing our carbon footprint is vital to our survival. We can reduce our domestic footprint by 700kg p.a. or more by replacing our central heating boilers with new condensing ones. However, this will cost each household \u00a32000 or more. The government not only gives no financial help towards this, but actually penalises us by charging VAT on both the boiler and installation. I propose that both condensing boilers and costs of installation should be zero rated for VAT.",
