            "background": "There are several third-party mobile phone companies that claim to provide top offers for mobile phones and contracts. Typical examples would be \"12 months free for a 12 months contract\" \"18 months free\" etc. These companies charge substantial monthly payments for a contract often with a outdated mobile phone. They claim to provide cashback of the basic line rental. However they do this only when the customer posts the mobile bills for those months as required by the company. Such companies provide only confusing terms and conditions such as \"the first bill received after 60 days from the start of the contract or 2 months after initiation\". Their motto is clear to confuse the customers and get away without returning the cash to the customer. Further these companies reject further claims if the first claim was wrongly dated. They threaten to slash our credit rating if we refuse payments for the contract. They do not provide a contact telephone number on their website for assitance or customer support. PLEASE BAN SUCH COMPANIES IMMEDIATELY.",
