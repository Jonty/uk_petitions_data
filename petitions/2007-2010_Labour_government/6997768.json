            "background": "There are far too many children filling up our buses unnecessarily thanks to the government\u2019s introduction of free travel for all under 16 year olds. This is really annoying to anyone who has to get on a bus and is faced with an uncomfortable ride as the bus is so packed full of children who cannot be bothered to walk the two stops to school. There are also really lazy parents piling on all of their kids, sometimes just to go one stop, to take just one child to school, meaning hard working people are often late getting to work as buses sail past the stops. \n\nAnother reason the government should abolish the free travel is it will help us fight the child obesity problem \u2013 they can all walk or ride to school instead and get some exercise for a change!",
