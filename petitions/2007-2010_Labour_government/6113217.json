Many only get allocated 20 days holiday a year out of the hundreds worked.\n\n2007 was hampered by unfair and harsh noise restrictions which were obviously put in place to protect that local population, who seemed to have complained\nAll we ask by signing this petition is that for these two nights of the year please allow those thousands of hard working, law abiding citizens who aren\u2019t out on your streets getting drunk and fighting, who aren\u2019t out stealing cars, who aren\u2019t out spreading negativity of any kind, to have those few hours of decent sound back.",
