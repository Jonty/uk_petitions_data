They create all laws and regulations which we abide by, while not understanding what it takes to control a small island such as ourselves. Britain holds a tiny amount of seats in Belgium, so we cannot effectively change anything. Also, the EU is allowing an unfair dispersal of immigrants into this country compared to France or Germany, for instance.",
