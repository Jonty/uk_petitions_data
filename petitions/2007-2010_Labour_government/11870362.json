            "background": "Obscene pensions, payouts and bonuses for people who brought the best of the British banks to their knees, and quite possibly will still bring the entire country to its knees, MUST BE CLAWED BACK in their entirety. As Fred Goodwin's latest actions show the way he had been enumerated must have influenced his decision making whatever the consequences for the bank.\nThere is no way this can be done within the existing legal framework. The Government will waste a lot of time and money, and in the end will loose if it was to take legal action based on existing legislation. Instead the parliament should legislate to 1) freeze assets of all executives of the banks bailed out by the taxpayers 2) set up a panel with the power to review and alter all compensation/ bonus/ pension arrangements 3) allow the corporate veil to be lifted for the shareholders to pursue executives personally for the losses they incurred 4) pull out of the EHRC temporarily if needed to achieve this.",
