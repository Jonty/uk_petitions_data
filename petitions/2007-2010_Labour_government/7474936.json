Such actions be organisations such as the Stannary \"Parliament\", the \"Cornish convention\" or the \"Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association\" could have profound and long lasting implications for Cornish people, ones we would rather not have. We petition the prime minister to make it illegal for unelected bodies to take actions in court and elsewhere on behalf of the people of the county of Cornwall, without first holding a referendum on whether the people actually want the action taken.",
