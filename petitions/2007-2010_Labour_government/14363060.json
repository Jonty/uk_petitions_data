        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Steven Monieza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga face a maximum sentence of 14 years jail, under Malawi\u2019s anti-gay law, section 153 of the penal code, which was originally imposed on the country by the British colonizers during the nineteenth century for starting the process of a same sex marriage. \n\nThe case of Steven and Tiwonge encapsulates the widespread homophobia that is met across Africa - an infringement of freedom and basic human rights. \n\nPrison conditions in Malawi are harsh, at best.\n\nPlease show your support for the British government to lobby Malawi to free these two young men by signing this petition. \n\nMany thanks",
