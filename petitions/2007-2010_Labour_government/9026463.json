            "background": "'God Save the Queen' is the anthem of the United Kingdom, and in line with the other constituent parts of the UK, England should be allowed her own anthem. \n\nI propose that 'Jerusalem' be that anthem for the following reasons:\n1/ The lyrics actually mention the word 'England'\n2/ The creators were English.\n3/ The words are a stirring evocation of England's industrial heritage and spiritual heart.\n3/ The music builds to a rousing climax (as all the best national anthems do) that puts a smile on the faces of those singing.\n4/ The lyrics take us away from notions of imperialism and the oppression of others (that so many from other nations associate with the english).\n\nand finally...the words and music of 'Jerusalem' allow the english to focus on the positive contribution they have made to the world through their industriousness, creativity, inventiveness and compassion.",
