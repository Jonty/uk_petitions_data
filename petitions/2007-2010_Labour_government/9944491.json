            "background": "It costs more to use public transport such as a bus to go into my local shopping area and to school than to pay for the petrol to get there and back, and with the price of fuel at the moment it is just ridiculous. On the bus it is \u00a31.50 to get there and \u00a31.50 to get back. For school children to get the bus too school it costs 70p and a total of \u00a31.40 if coming back on a bus. Maybe it's the bus companies keeping people off of their buses, but at the moment, in an age where global warming is seemingly so important, it's cheaper for us to cause congestion with our cars than to take the bus.  Something really should be done.",
