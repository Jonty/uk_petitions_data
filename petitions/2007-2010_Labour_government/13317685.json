The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior respresents those soldiers bodies have not been buried. All those families who have a loved one who has no known grave should not have to pay to visit a memorial to remember them. It is also important that those who are not directly involved should be able to remember the sacrifices made for them. However if there is a charge for this memorial people are less likely to come and remember the sacrifies made for them.",
