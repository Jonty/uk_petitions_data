            "background": "Since the government shows that it is prepared to bail out hugely irresponsible banks, with enormous amounts of money, to stop them going bankrupt, a new law should be passed to protect the ordinary humble tax paying homeowner also.\n\nIt would be very simple to set up a structure, whereby if a home-owner reaches the stage of getting into a repossession state, that the government/council steps in, takes over the property, and rents it back to the original owner for a minimum 10 years period, whereby the owner may attempt to repurchase the property if they are able, or simply continue the rental.  After the 10 year period the government/council may sell the property to the general public.",
