            "background": "We used to be a God-fearing nation that has and still does enjoy the blessings of God. To do away with the blasphemy law is just another 'degree' in our seemingly relentless quest to turn our backs on God. Take heed that if Britain turns its back completely on God, we will face judgement. I think the government ought to remain God-fearing and keep the law in whatever way it can to prevent secular British society from reaping every kind of evil that is unleashed when God's protection is removed.",
