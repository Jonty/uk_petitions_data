            "background": "They say shoplifting is a crime; yet Asda alone send over 75,000 tonnes of food a year to landfile, because it is more profitable to over-order and dump the surpless then to run out of stock when sales exceed expectations. This is a crime on an industrial scale. Supermarkets should be made to offer their food to charities and customers for free 6 hours before the sell by date. They should also pay a substantial levy by the tonne for landfil. The environmental and social benefits would be vast.",
