            "background": "This does not mean privatisation of the NHS services but why should money be spent on binge drinkers etc who have got into fights or who require treatment later in life due to excessive drinking instead of cancer patients or other A and E patients involved in situations which they had no control such as being stabbed whilst being robbed. If they can afford to drink thay much they can afford the costs involved in treating them.\nPeople are quick to remember their rights but do not remember their responsibilities. For example, heavy drinkers who repeatedly bing drink after being warned would have to pay costs towards transplants linked to drinking. The more expensive operations may only be charged after a warning has been given.",
