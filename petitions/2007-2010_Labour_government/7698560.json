        "background": "Milk contains potentially dangerous ingredients and this is why i want it banned.\n\nSome of these ingredients are:\n\nLactic Acid Bacteria - although when pasteurized the content is lower it is still present and can cause documented problems.\n\nCasein - which has been cited as being a health risk.\n\nOestrogen - You can find Oestrogen in milk, quite a lot from recently pregnent cows. There are concerns here that this type of non human hormone intake can cause health problems amongst some professionals.\n\nMilk has also been cited as altering the DNA.\nBack in history the production of which was intergrated into cow farming about 8000 years ago.\nThere are some other interesting hi occurances of DNA trates which date back to around that time too but there is no known research linking the two inccidents.\n\nMost of the main components of milk which help health can easily be obtained from other produce and therefore there is also no absoulte need to continue milk farming in the face such possible risks.",
