Whilst I understand the need to reduce somking, I do not feel this should be at society's cost. These people continue to smoke but do so whilst drunk and on the streets, where they cause a public nuisance and waste police time. If they want to smoke and die of cancer let them do so in the dark recesses of pubs and clubs not in front of law abiding families who want to visit the theatre or cinema without being assaulted physically or verbally by drunken idiots who have to be outside because the law says so! What sort of law is this?",
