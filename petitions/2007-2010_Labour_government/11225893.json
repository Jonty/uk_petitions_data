What further proof is needed?  It is illogical that we are outraged at deaths caused at work/home etc if we are not concerned about the huge numbers of PREVENTABLE deaths caused by transport also.  Do you really think its worth it when so many members of families are lost each year...honestly?  People have been sacrificed in wars for freedom - that is honourable, people sacrificed  just because of unsafe driving/driving too fast is not:- \n\n3,172 people were killed on Britain\u2019s roads in 2006. That means that every day, nine police officers have to visit nine families and break the news that a loved one has suffered a sudden, violent death.\n\nThank you very much for looking.  This has nothing to do with cars themselves, just the way they can be (mis)driven.",
