            "background": "There has to be a road safety issue surrounding smoking whilst in control of a moving vehicle. A driver who is either smoking or who is in the process of lighting a cigarette or pipe whilst driving should be treated in the same way as drivers who use mobile phones whilst driving along.It is judged that a mobile phone user is in reduced control of a vehicle whilst it is moving and in the same way a smoker who is lighting up is in a similar position regarding control. In addition if a smoker has a coughing fit, as a direct result of their smoking habit, whilst driving along then a serious accident may occur",
