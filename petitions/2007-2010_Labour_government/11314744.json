            "background": "Thanet District Council is planning to close the Ramsgate Maritime Museum because it says it does not have enough money. At the same time it funds alcoholic beverages and buffets for Councillors after Council meeetings. We call upon it to stop the unnecessary free drink and food for Councillors and to use the money saved towards funding the Ramsgate Maritime Museum. We also call upon Thanet Council to do a full, careful and proper review of its expenditure to identify other monies to save the much loved museum.\n\nRamsgate has lost most of its attractions for visitors. With its world famous Royal Harbour and magnificent history,the Maritime Museum is essential to its future as a town. Thanet Council must get its priorities right and save Ramsgate Maritinme Museum for the people of Thanet.",
