        "background": "PLR\u2019s funding settlement for the three year period 2008/09 \u2013 2010/11 has been announced by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.  The figures are as follows:\n\n2007/08 (current funding) = \u00a37,682,000\n\n2008/09 = \u00a37,432,000\n\n2009/10 = \u00a37,582,000\n\n2010/11 = \u00a37,682,000\n\nA reduction in PLR funding will adversely affect the earnings of thousands of UK authors and illustrators. Many are self-employed, and in an industry as unpredictable as publishing, the annual PLR payment is a highly valued and reliable contribution to earnings. The Government is urged to retain the current funding level (2007/08) for PLR for each of the next three years. There should be no reduction in funding.",
