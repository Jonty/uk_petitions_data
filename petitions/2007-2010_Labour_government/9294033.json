            "background": "the goverment of the united kingdom is corrupt and stupid. gordon brown is about as capable to lead us out of the credit crisis as a headless chicken.\nthey let in illegal immagrants and give them free things. they treat our soldiers like peices of crap when they need there help. they say they have no money to pay for the nhs and the police. and what do they do..... they spend \u00a31 billion on a space program!!\nthey employ there family members so people who actually have the skills to become a good leader dont get a chance. they send our troops off across the world leaving us defencless and then good old gordon announces is it on world television. they make it easy for terrosrists to get in the country. they let people tell british people to take down our british flags. they let the british working class get forgotten. i say we kick off the leading members of the goverment. give the police the right to interogate any member of gov at any time and place. and the ability to kick off any member of the gov at any point and be replaced.",
