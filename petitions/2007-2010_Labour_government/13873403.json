            "background": "I would like to see the criteria for obtaining Home Energy improvement grants made more accessible to include Mr & Mrs Average. Currently, unless you are in receipt of some sort of benefit/tax credit allowance you are ineligible for 100% grant assistance. Grants for 50% Central Heating/Loft & Cavity wall insulation might be permitted depending on further criteria but this is often still out of reach of the average hardworking household. I would like to see the criteria include a household income of \u00a338,000/less. This would include average couples who like us were late first time homebuyers - damn house market!, who work average fulltime jobs, are in receipt of no benefit/tax credit, have yet to start a family & have a house that is in vast need of modernisation & improvement (double glazing, central heating & insulation alone is on average \u00a310,000) for which 100% assistance would be a godsend. I know just from talking in my own community that we are not alone so sign up for change.",
