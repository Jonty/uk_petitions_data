        "background": "This is in response to a petition asking for schools to stop teaching about homosexuality on the (rather absurd in my opinion) grounds that if God had intended people to be homosexual he would have made it possible for men to become pregnant; I'm sure all women experiencing unwanted pregnancies wish he had!  The creator of this petition also asserts that this is a Christian country; doesn't Christianity teach tolerance? (if it doesn't I'd have thought it ought to).  \n\nHe also says that children should be taught about the \"miracle\" of birth; it may be a miracle to people who want a child/children but how miraculous is it to those who don't?  I would be TOTALLY opposed to children being taught that birth is a miracle or even something to be automatically desired; what happens if an individual takes this doctrine to heart, and actually has a child, and then finds that he/she is totally unsuited to parenthood and/or is unable to love the child?",
