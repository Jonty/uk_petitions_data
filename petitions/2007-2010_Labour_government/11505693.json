            "background": "i am the mother of a daughter aged 27 yrs,during her life i have had to work night shifts and jobs unwanted by others.as i needed to work when she was asleep,invalid care allowance was 36 pounds at the time and my work was restricted to 70 pounds.my care was 35 hrs week to get it.why is it not same as minimum wage when you work for it,then direct payments came about and that has to go to carers outside the home.all this gave me an harder life.an many people just never worked again but claimed benifits,which is forced upon them many with other children at home.there should be no need for benefits if ica was the minimum wage and direct payments went to the parent to use desired.it would be much easier to give your child to the state which i presume many give up unable to cope with poverty on top of full time care and getting a job,when a parent is already at a disadvantage in the job market,time goverment woke up and stopped throwing money at systems that are of no benefit to the main carers family members,or society.creating a giro culture does nothing but create deprevation to the minoritys of society.",
