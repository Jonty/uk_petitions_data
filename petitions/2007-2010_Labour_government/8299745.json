According to the RSPB website: \"Peanuts and fat balls are regularly sold in nylon mesh bags. Never put out any food in mesh bags. These may trap birds\u2019 feet and even cause broken or torn off feet and legs. Birds with a barbed tongue, eg woodpeckers, can become trapped by their beaks.\"\nWe call upon the Prime Minister to bring in legislation to ban these mesh bags for bird feed.",
