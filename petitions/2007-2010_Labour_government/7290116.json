            "background": "It has long been established that the health of women improves and that of men deteriorates after divorce.  Despite equal opportunity, underemployed men are not acceptable spouses in the UK, whereas underemployed women are. Britain is being overwhelmed by unhappy lonely old men. This puts a strain on the NHS, pension services, and a general malaise and needless loss of talent.  This can be corrected by willing, often much younger, women from abroad happy to take on our ageing menfolk and make productive and valuable family units out of otherwise discarded members of society, but is being frustrated by obstructive visa refusals, both for residency and for short-term exploratory visits. A Right to Family Life is written under Human Rights legislation, yet this requirement will not be met by modern empowered British women. These valuable foreign ladies should have the status of \"needed occupations\" when applying for visas and encouraged to come.",
