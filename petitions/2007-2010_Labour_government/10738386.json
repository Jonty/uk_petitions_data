            "background": "Airlines make high charges to refund the paid taxes etc. on a ticket which is not going to be used.\nSometimes the charges are more than the taxes etc. on the actual ticket, so it is not worth claiming them back.\nHow come, the airline can charge such a high fee for the change of a name or time on a ticket?\nWe all know how quick it is to make a booking - so why so expensive to make a change?\nAll these charges are totally over the top and excessive.\nThe Banking Industry is no longer allowed to make excessive charges for administration, so why are the airlines allowed to screw us financially???",
