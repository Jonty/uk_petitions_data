            "background": "The RNOH (Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore) is one of the top three orthopaedic hospitals in the world and an ambassador for the country, something for the UK to be proud of.\n\nIt has also provided treatment to thousands of patients from all over the UK, restoring their quality of life. Its range of neuro-musculoskeletal services is unique within the NHS and 20% of the UK's orthopaedic surgeons receive training there, helping ensure a high standard of care for future generations.\n\nHowever, the ancient buildings are falling into decay, causing rain leakages and cancelled operations lists, despite repeated requests and empty promises from governments over the last 20 years to provide the necessary funding and prevent this centre of excellence from its inevitable closure if something is not done soon.\n\nWe would now like the Government itself to take decisive and urgent action to save this pioneering hospital and bring everything to a happy conclusion.",
