            "background": "Stop this blatant abuse of the planning laws whereas homes are extended and sold for vast profits shortly after the extension being built.I propose a compulsory insure bond which has to pay a penalty if the property is sold within ten years.I also propose that stamp duty apply to the increased value of the property as so much revenue is being lost by this method of creeping blight.. Can it be right that anyway can just move in, build and construct a  big extension, and then cash in by selling shortly afterwards, leaving the area blighted for the long term residents?? This is endemic in my postal address of WD23 2LY",
