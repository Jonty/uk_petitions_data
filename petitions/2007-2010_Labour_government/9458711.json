My grandmother is refusing to pay \u00a33 a day for Patientline TV as they don't pay anything for their TV licence plus a waste of money as you cannot tell if my grandfather has a good day or not the following day. Having spoken to his fellow patients' relatives who share the ward with my grandfather, they agree with me. It would make the day go quicker and the mind will focus on other things.",
