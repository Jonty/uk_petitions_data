            "background": "As you all are aware extreme poverty and world hunger are a major problem in the world at the moment. If you weren't already aware eradicating world hunger and poverty is one of the millennium development goals which are to be completed by 2015 this can only be possible when people are made aware of the current situation. Due to the current financial crisis it seems that the awareness of this situation has been undercut and we are only focusing on the \"credit crunch.\" There are over 8 million people out there at living on less than a $1 a day and thousands of children fewer than 5 die every year due to malnutrition.\nIs this how we want the future to be?\nCan we do something about it?\nYes we can and this is how we can help and play an active part in doing something for these people from hundreds of miles away.",
