            "background": "why is my government is throwing away our human rights by asking venues in London to fill out 'form 696' eg  'We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Scrap the\n     unnecessary and draconian usage of the 696 Form from London\n     music events.' - why is this kind of thing even being considered by my government? Does the Prime Minister and Parliament NOT know this is a clear breach of our Human Rights (freedom of expression, right to privacy and others), Harriet Harmon was 'proud' to support when she took the last PMQ's before xmas?\nis this another reason why we should have a General Election come May 3rd 2009?",
