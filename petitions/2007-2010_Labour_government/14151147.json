            "background": "At the present moment, the system seems to be a little bit pear shaped.\nThe proposal is the following, as to consessionary bus travel.\n1: A similar scheme be adopted to that of the Railcard.\n2: Bus passengers whether over age of female retirement (60 at present)or disabled pay a yearly fee which could  start at \u00a325,and be reviewed  similar to railcard, and paid to resepective district/borough or city councils.\n3: Abolish off peak travel.with its introduction, similar to rail travel.\n4: That at a 34% discount is given on Bus Travel at anytime of day.\n5: This would also include those with the card , the chance to use a return or other bus companys money saving options.\n6: This would also stop any need to account for number of journeys made by a  a bus operator, when claiming for passengers on consessionary travel.\n7: Moneys raised locally , could be used to fund better pubic transport links in rural areas.\n8:It also would make consessionary travel more accountable, and maybe avoid debts by bus operators in rural areas.",
