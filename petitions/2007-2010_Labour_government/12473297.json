            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The government of Guyana has stated its desire to preserve the rainforest contained within its boundaries, but has made it clear that to do so it needs financial aid from rich countries. Guyana is one of the last countries in the world to still hold frontier forest and must not be forgotten about. If it does not receive financial aid, their government will have no choice but to grant leases for logging, agricultural expansion etc. Sign this petition to tell Mr Brown of your support for conservation of the Guyanese Amazon, and that you are happy for him to allocate your taxes to such a large and essential project.",
