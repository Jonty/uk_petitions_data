The reduction of the number secure children homes, in particular the Atkinson Unit in the southwest will mean children being placed further away from home. It could mean more vulnerable children going to larger secure training centres, which could place them at greater risk. The closure of the unit will mean that there will only be 3 welfare beds (Beds occupied by young people that put themselves at serious risk of harm) in the whole of the southwest.",
