In Australia & the USA this is classified as a serious crime & imposters are heavily fined or could be imprisoned\n\nThe number of \u201cWalter Mittys\u201d is rising with many being exposed rightly by the media. How many more of these liars, have to exposed before making this a serious criminal offence.\n\nAcross the country, Britains will gather on Remembrance Day to commemorate the lives of Men & Women lost in war and other military operations as well as reflect on the service of our Defence personnel. \n\nEach time a military impostor is left \"unexposed\", it cheapens the value of every true hero, and cheapens the sacrifice that every genuine service-person and veteran makes. The impostor has ruined his own life with his lies. The impostor makes a choice and must face the consequence of HIS or HER OWN actions.",
