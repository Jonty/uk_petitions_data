In the meantime they are expected to know and enforce the myriad of legislation and regulation surrounding employment and to act as unpaid tax collectors. Fines are levied when companies get it wrong.\n\nInstead of penalising, try rewarding - instead of taxing at 8% NI, remove employers NI and let companies retain 2% of employees NI as payment for all the costs associated with employment.\n\nThis would immediately create additional employment.\n\nThis would be more than paid for through the decrease in benefits paid to the unemployed.",
