        "action": "take action to ensure that the Olympic Delivery Authority makes sure that the promised Health facility is built at the same time as the Olympic village for the benefit of the athletes and then the wider local community.  Also to make certain that the Government will commit itself to ensuring a measurable Olympic legacy for the East End of London in skills, jobs, homes and facilities and create an accountable agency to oversee the legacy to the local community.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The London Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) had promised that a badly needed \u00a310 million health centre would be built in Stratford, Newham, East London.  The centre was to cater for athletes during the Games then to be handed over for the benefit of local people afterwards as an Olympic legacy.  A funding crisis is threatening to delay the construction until 2020.  Many fear that once the ODA is disbanded after the games then no-one is legally liable to build the centre.",
