Also to make certain that the Government will commit itself to ensuring a measurable Olympic legacy for the East End of London in skills, jobs, homes and facilities and create an accountable agency to oversee the legacy to the local community.",

            "background": "The London Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) had promised that a badly needed \u00a310 million health centre would be built in Stratford, Newham, East London.  The centre was to cater for athletes during the Games then to be handed over for the benefit of local people afterwards as an Olympic legacy.  A funding crisis is threatening to delay the construction until 2020.  Many fear that once the ODA is disbanded after the games then no-one is legally liable to build the centre.",
