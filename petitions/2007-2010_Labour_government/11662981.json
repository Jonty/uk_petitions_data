            "background": "There are many people and businesses in the UK who get a deluge of cash in one monthly payment. The effect of this is that some of them can spend up to half the month with no ready cash available, which means they have to rely on credit to get by. This can soon spiral into serious debt, which eventually has to be repaid. When these people grasp the nettle and start repaying this debt, they are lost to the active economy, as all their spare cash is going on debt and not on consumption, which is what makes the wheels of the economy turn.\nIf people were to be paid weekly, they might only be skint for one or two days, rather than one or two weeks. One or two days of no money is bearable for anyone, one or two weeks is not. Smaller businesses may well benefit from a more regular flow of cash and even the Banks may appreciate a more even flow of funds.\nThis may only be a small idea, but surely anything that may lessen the need for scarce credit at this time must be worth a try.",
