            "background": "I think children should have proper access to toilet during the full school day and not just at break or lunch times. Children are deliberately not drinking in school for fear of needing to go during lesson times. \n\nAs children now have access to water and fruit and milk then common sense dictates they should have access to the toilet at all times. \n\nDeliberately preventing a child from using a toilet is child abuse but teachers across the country do this on a daily basis just because it disrupts lessons. \n\nThe access to water is a good idea as it re-hydrates the brain but it is cyclic, they also need to be able to void their bladders to remove the toxins other wise there is no point letting them drink.\n\nso I think that teachers should be banned from doing this, the alternative to letting a child use the toilet and disrupt the lesson is having the child wet itself and disrupt the lesson which only leads to humiliation of said child who then needs changing and the mess cleaned up\n\nand all because 'they should have gone at playtime'.",
