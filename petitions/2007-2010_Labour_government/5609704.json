He was then taking in by the police to give his statement during which time his shoes were confiscated for forensic testing. On return to the airport he found that his cab had been ticketed for parking offenses.\n\nClearly this is hardly the way to treat a man who assisted in the capture of two would be terrorists and we ask the PM to use his influence to have this unjust penalty quashed.",
