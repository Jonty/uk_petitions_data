        "background": "We are sick and tired of having to put up with people using their mobile phones to record a concert while we are trying to see the performer on the stage. It detracts from our enjoyment of the event that we have paid to attend, and is frankly anti-social.\n\nThe videos in question are rarely of a watchable quality, and are rarely ever actually viewed other than on the journey home.\n\nWe have a right to enjoy an unhindered view of the event we have paid our hard earned money to witness, and we demand that action is taken against these people.",
