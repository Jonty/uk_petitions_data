            "background": "Every day I see drivers not wearing their seat belts, the current maximum penalty for not wearing a seat belt is \u00a3500 but the usual outcome for people caught is a fixed \u00a330 fine, the current law is clearly not working, I believe that applying a 3 point penalty on top of any fine for the driver might make them think twice about not wearing their belt. In addition if any children under 14 are in the car and are not wearing a selt belt then an extra 3 points should be added.(Maximum of 6 points).",
