            "background": "The Alice project at the Daresbury labs in Cheshire is the first particle accelerator of its kind in Europe.\n\nCuts in science funding mean that it may be binned as early as July, after six years of design and construction.\n\nUK scientists who had planned to use Alice say they may be forced to do experiments in the US or Russia.\n\nTaxpayers' money was used to build Alice (Accelerators and Lasers in Combined Experiments) as a machine that would demonstrate accelerator technologies - but scientists believe it could do much more; it should be used to run an experimental programme.\n\n\"Having spent \u00a325m to build it, it would seem crazy not to operate it,\" said Professor Peter Weightman from the University of Liverpool, who has guaranteed funding to do work that requires a machine such as Alice.\n\nThe machine will cost approximately \u00a33m a year to run.\n\nThe future of Alice is currently being considered by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), which is looking to plug an \u00a380m deficit in its funding.",
