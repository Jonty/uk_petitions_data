This is a one of a kind skate park, the likes that can't be seen anymore, anywhere. It is one of only a hand full of 1970's Skate Parks left in this country, remaining. This is part of extreme sports history and should be saved from being filled in. We would like it refurbished for future generations to use.\nThis is a genuine one off facility and fantastic for Harrow council, London and England and that can't be re-built. It has a great aura and atmosphere that can\u2019t be made anywhere else.\nIt keeps the young and old off the streets and is a great recreation space for all, participants and viewers. \nHarrow Skate Park is a genuine historical park and NEEDS to be preserved for the future generation.\n \nSAVE OUR HISTORY, SAVE OUR CHILDHOOD, SAVE HARROW SKATE PARK !",
