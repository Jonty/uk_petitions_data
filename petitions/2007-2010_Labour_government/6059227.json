            "action": "improve child protection by legalising R18 sex films on satellite TV and limited sales in ordinary shops, thus undermining totally unregulated backstreet sales which include material that would never be granted an R18 certificate and is sold to under-18s.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In reality explicit sex DVDs are widely available without proper controls.\n    It is illegal to show R18 explicit sex films on Sky, cable or terrestrial TV.  It is also illegal to sell R18 in ordinary shops or by mail order. For 90% of people it is impractical to visit a licensed sex shop in person.\n    There is a thriving underground market - local newspapers openly advertise discreet motorcycle delivery via untraceable mobile phones.\n    Unregulated retailers have every incentive to maximise profit and no incentive to observe R18 boundaries or to check the ages.  They are already breaking the law and have no licence to loose.  Some include rape, torture porn and worse in their stock.  Some include religious hate material.\n    If R18 material was widely available, the unregulated market would shrink drastically, and unregulated sellers would go out of business.\n    Allow sales in legit video stores, which check age, limited to 10% by stock level and by \u00a3 sold.\n    This will improve protection for under-18s.",
