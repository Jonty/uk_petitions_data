What happened to the freedom of choice?\n\nThis can range from \u00a32.50 up to \u00a32.95.  Using the later figure that is \u00a335.40 profit a year each company earns from you because you cant use standing order payments or internet payments or cheque/card payments.\n\nThe amount of DD problems I have had where the companies take out the money prior to the pay date or take out twice by mistake is unbelieveable.  Yes it gets sorted but in the meantime the bank charges you bank charges if it makes you go overdrawn then you have all the stress, worry and hassle of sorting it out, trying to claim your bank charges from the company.  In the meantime your bank account gets a black mark against it.\n\nWho monitors these non direct debit charges?  Who agreed to them in the first place?",
