Where parents would be prosecuted along side there child if their child broke the law. Mother/Fathers have a \u201cduty of care\u201d to raise their children with morals, ethics and a decent ethos instilled in them, if they fail there parental responsibilities then the parents', should be equally responsible for what their child has done or does. This is what our society is lacking.",
