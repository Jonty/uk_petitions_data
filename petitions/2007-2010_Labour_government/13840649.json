            "background": "Professor David Nutt was sacked for speaking against the government's policy of classifying Cannabis as a class B drug.  The government should take the advice of independent advisors, especially those backed by scientific research, and not ignore/fire anyone who disagrees with the them.  As Lib Dem Home affairs spokesman said \"What is the point of having independent scientific advice if as soon as you get some advice that you don't like, you sack the person who has given it to you?\".  This will lead down a dark path away from a democratic government if this stands.",
