Why should the Government consider increasing the\nminimum wage to single childless youngsters purely to increase their pay packet without the Government picking up the tab.\n\nIt is time for business owners to make a stand similar to labour back benchers to make the Prime Minister realise    that we will not be pushed around.\n\nWe are paying an increasing share of the tax burden - increases in corporation tax from 19% to 22% so that large businesses can pay less (30% to 28%) and like so many \"tax saving\" initiatives of the past it is our administration costs that increases to\ndeliver these extra payments.",
