It is     clear that the Prime Minister is not listening to the people of      Britain in the fact that he will not give the people a referendum on very important issue that ultimately effect us all. Heads of other countries have shown that their people do matter and have let the people have a vote on important issues; clearly the British Prime Minister does not care what the people of Britain want and therefore has no regard for their views. Dissolution of parliament is now the only way forward for the people of Britain to have their say on important matters.",
