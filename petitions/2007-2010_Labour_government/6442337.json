            "background": "The abandonment of British summertime will give all UK residents the benefit of an extra hours daylight in the evening. This will benefit all UK residents who participate in outside activities after work or in the evening. The petitions by the farming community to maintain or even increase the advent of British summertime are unjustified. Farmers are in the minority and such should go with the benefit of abandoning British Summertime for the majority of the British population. Farmers only want British Summertime for their own convenience. The same amount of daily hours are available regardless of sunrise and sunset times. Vote for an increased quality of life for six months of the year for now and the future.",
