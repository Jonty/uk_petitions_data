Each soldier is given only 30 minutes each week for free to call home. This petition is aimed at making all calls that soldiers make home to be free for soldiers deployed in Afghanistan. The ability to speak to loved ones is essential, and giving them only 30 minutes a week is not acceptable. They deserve better from us.",
