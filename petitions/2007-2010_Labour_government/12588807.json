            "background": "We are contantly being sold at, whether we agree to it or not. In the Post Office, at the front door, in the shops, on the phone, by the service engineer. We can opt out of many forms of marketing (e.g. phone cold calling, email blocking) but there is no process for stopping this when we are being spoken to. I would simply like there to be a legal phrase to allow me to opt out of being sold at so that, when spoken, the seller then has to stop the marketing 'script' immediately. This would save us and businesses time and money. Today I rang my bank to ask for some particular envelopes. First I had to go through security, then had to 'fend off' the call centre worker who wanted to sell at me. Even though I told her not to, she kept asking marketing questions which I refused to answer. Do they really think I will buy anything from them when they don't listen to my needs? I want to be able to say STOP, and I want it to be a legal requirement that they do. Thank you.",
