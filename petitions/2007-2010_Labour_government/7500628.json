Today it was announced that 1.6 billion has been paid in family allowance for chidren who do not live in this country and no checks are done to ensure these children even exist. Yesterday we heard that one Police Force,using tax payers money, were going to teach their officers Polish so that they can make themselves understood when arresting Polish speakers, surely this is the wrong way round shouldn't you be ensuring that all workers who enter the UK are fluent in English. As the Government we entrust you not to waste our money. There have been numerous incidence of Tax money seemingly handed out without thought to how the tax payer feels about it. Please we want this to stop before its too late, use our income tax as it is meant to be used, to benefit those who are law abiding tax payers not those who are just here for handouts.",
