            "background": "Bankruptcy does not always ease  the burden of debt for individuals.  Many will have to labour to repay debts for 3 years, as a result of an Income Payments Agreement or an Income Payments Order.  This consumes 70% of net income (after bills).  This financially incapacitates citizens who are then unable to save, unable to obtain a mortgage, and unable to contribute any wealth to the rest of society.  At a time when billions of pounds are being spent on banks, whose reckless lending contributed to the problem, I petition the Prime Minister to reduce this burden of debt for bankrupt citizens.  They will then be able to contribute wealth and help fuel the economy again.",
