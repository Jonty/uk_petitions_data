            "background": "Many venues now sell tickets exclusively through agencies who add a booking fee to the actual cost, as well as then charging you to print your own ticket. This can often be an additional 10% PER TICKET, regardless of how many are purchased. The credit card companies charge around 1.5%, which is acceptable, but this rip-off is unfair and prevents many people from booking. The admin charge is no more for a \u00a390 ticket than a \u00a325 one, so why the ridiculous increase? To charge you for printing your own ticket is also another means of making money at the expense of the purchaser. This needs to be controlled now.",
