            "background": "From January 2010 pharmacists will be expected to change the brand of drug named on a prescription and replace it with a different generic brand. This is against the epilepsy guidelines from NICE. There is significant evidence from doctors and patients that some people with epilepsy have difficulties when changed between different versions of the \u2018same\u2019 drug. Generic brands have to follow \u2018bioequivalence\u2019 rules. These allow the amount of active ingredient to vary 80 \u2013 125 %; being given a different brand can mean receiving a different dose. Many anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) have a narrow therapeutic window and dose levels have to be finely balanced. A doctor with special interest in epilepsy should change someone\u2019s epilepsy medication, not a pharmacist or health economist. People with epilepsy should receive the same version of their AED unless their doctor prescribes otherwise for medical not financial reasons. The Joint Epilepsy Council is campaigning for an exemption for AEDs.",
