            "background": "We would like the government to ensure that Homeless people within the community are dealt with by housing officers in a fair and justified manner and that they consider each individuals situation properly and in the event of accommodating these individuals supply them with the appropriate accommodation with regard to their individual situation and needs. We would ask that every housing officer is provided with compulsory training around the problems and issues that street homeless and substance users face and the reasons why these people feel a need to misuse substances within their lives.\nThe housing of Homeless substance users is failing due to the lack of knowledge and understanding around this client group by housing officers/staff across the country resulting in needless deaths that could and should be prevented.Street Homeless clients are at the lowest point of the housing chain making them one of the most vulnerable groups, they should be accepted and treated as such.",
