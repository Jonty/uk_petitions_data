            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In parts of the United States and Canada, flashing amber lights indicate that drivers should slow down and approach a traffic junction with care, but can progress through the lights if the junction is clear. As a result, traffic is able to flow freely at off peak times, benefitting all road users concerned and reducing delays at junctions.  Our proposal is that such a system be trialled in the Black Country initially. \n\nAt off peak times in the UK, road users are all too often hindered rather than helped by traffic signals, having to stop at red lights despite a lack of traffic approaching from other directions. This causes frustration for both private and business road users.\n\nIn addition, the artificially induced congestion caused by traffic lights serves to have a negative impact on the Black Country\u2019s road network. With congestion costing businesses in the wider West Midlands an estimated \u00a32.2bn per annum, a solution whereby congestion can be mitigated must surely be welcomed due to the benefits it would provide for our region\u2019s economy, and for road users around the UK. We urge the government, therefore, to give its full backing to our Chamber's campaign.",
