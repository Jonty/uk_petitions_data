Smuggling in explosives in large parties who are not being security checked is a well used method of achieving access and scoring a 'spectacular' by terrorists and this abuse of Mr Speakers authority is putting our seat of democracy at risk and should be reversed.  If Mrs Speaker doesn't want to be inconvenienced then she should avoid going to the place.",
