            "background": "The bank charges are charged without giving any option to the customer to recover or remedy the problem.  E.g. a cheque is returned due to insufficient fund because it was presented in irregular pattern, the customer made every attempt to put this right - all claims were rejected and charges applied on the same day. Since not enough funds to pay the charges, it now becomes unauthorised overdraft which is then charged at \u00a35 per day. It was unable to be resolved by calling the bank, as they blame their system and nothing were allow to be done to help. It increases the problem. Many problems resolvable with minimal efforts e.g. the bank charges could be reduced or withdrawn if the person is facing financial difficulties - as it is not a difficult for the bank to analyse individual\u2019s circumstance in very short time. A new system must be in place to put right any unintended personal mistakes to reduce their bank charges. Also whoever pays the charges must get real value rather than applying charges without even an attempt to contact the person by phone, email, text message, letter or other means 'before' the charge is applied! You will be helping many people in this difficult time",
