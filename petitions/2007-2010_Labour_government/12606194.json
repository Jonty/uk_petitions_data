            "background": "My partner and myself run our own wildlife rescue charity in SE London. We recently came across a situation which caused a problem, due to the rules and regulations regarding wildlife in Royal Parks.\n\nWe received a call regarding some ducks and a duckling that were being harassed on the boating pond at Greenwich Park. People were driving over them in the the boats, and killing them.\n\nWe wanted to move them, but were told by the Royal Parks staff that this was illegal, and if we did move them we would be prosecuted.\n\nWe were shocked by this, and finally got permission from the Police to move the ducks and duckling. Unfortunately, it appears that this has come too late, as the last surviving duckling appears to have now died.\n\nWe are petitioning to allow wildlife rescuers to move wildlife where the animal's life is in imminent danger.\n\nPlease join us in agreeing that this law needs to be amended.\n\nThanks.\n\nThe Wildlife Lodge",
