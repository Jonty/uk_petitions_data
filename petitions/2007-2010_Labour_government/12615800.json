After a series of shocking revalations, it is apparentthat the public has lost faith in MP's. A total overhaul of the system is radically needed; it is outdated, serves only those who seek to exploit and is far from transparent. But for some clever investigative journalism, the issues surrounding the expenses claim may have never come to light. How can the people of a nation, engulfed in a recession, ever trust MP's again.",
