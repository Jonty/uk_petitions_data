        "background": "The current incapacity benefit is \u00a384.50 per week (2008/9 tax year) but if you have any other income such as a private pension which is over \u00a385.00 per week, the incapacity benefit is reduced by 50p for every \u00a31 your private pension is above \u00a385.00.  The \u00a385.00 rule has been in place for a good number of years and is not increased each year, so once you fall into this trap, every time you receive an increase in your private pension, the government take 50p of every \u00a31 increase you gain, thus eroding your net income drastically.",
