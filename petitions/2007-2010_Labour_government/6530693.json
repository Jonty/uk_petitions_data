The purpose for the venue is to help get our cildren off the streets and help them to be able to socialise freely.  The Rink would also offer 5 a side football and have a creative space.  This project has been set as not-for-profit.  I have spoken with our MP and local councillors about this.  Tony Lloyd hs been very helpful I just wish I could say the same about the Councillors.  Our aim is children and not money so why is it so difficult for people to help us?  The children have taken part in fundraising events as they really want this, can you help?",
