            "background": "Our Government are failing the families of Britain. Despite the name change - the Department for Children, Schools and FAMILIES - nothing is being done for families. Their remit includes the wellbeing of families, they say they are investigating what to do to support their new Children\u2019s Plan. In this plan Ed Balls states \"parents want more support in managing the new pressures they face such as balancing work and family life\". Every family can learn easily how to respect each other and create harmony in the home. This will change society. Every day headlines tell of family breakdown: teenage murders, binge drinking, anti social behaviour, pregnancy - it all starts to go wrong in the family. But there is nothing wrong with parents, they are doing the best they can with what they know. Young people are different these days and parents need new skills. Don\u2019t let the government get away with it \u2013 demand the support they promise. Be part of the change we so desperately need in Britain.",
