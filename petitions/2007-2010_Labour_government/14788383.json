            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We believe that Banks branches should be allowed/enforced to open for business on Sundays and Bank Holidays in line with other retail outlets. Then to also abolish \"working days\" (mon-fri) restrictions to movement of funds, so that Sat & Sun are included. Also to enforce banks to be flexible on Direct Debit dates. These measures would ease the flow of money, allowing the economy to function more effectively and dynamically, and take pressure off people struggling with debts/finances.",
