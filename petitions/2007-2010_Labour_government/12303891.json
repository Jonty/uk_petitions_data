        "background": "The local council's are cherry picking the posh and sought after areas for protectionism against outsiders. People who don't have a family connection in nice areas are banned from applying for properties. This practice is deeply prejudice against people from neighbouring towns and villages and againt people from near and far. The council's don't protect rough areas that also have housing shortages. In Leeds the council protect Wetherby because it's a lovely posh little town. In Calderdale the Housing Association protect Hebden Bridge because it's the best place in Calderdale... But it's totally wrong, unethical and unfair that a person from Hebden Bridge can apply for a property in Todmorden, just down the road, but a person from Todmorden can not apply for a property in Hebden Bridge... Every property should be available to every human being on the housing list without prejudice!",
