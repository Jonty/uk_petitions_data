        "background": "Despite strong public anger over the controversial \"safety cameras\" the councils have still gone ahead with the scheme. The limit is extremely slow for the road, raising journey times and creating a irritating distraction to drivers who constantly have to re-check what speed they are doing. \n\nThe main point is that the locals mostly do not want the cameras there, and are fed up with a government/council nanny state intervening and forcing us to behave like we were children. We are adults! Start treating us like it!",
