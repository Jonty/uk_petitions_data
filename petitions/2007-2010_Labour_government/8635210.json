To date the Government and the financial regulators have refused to reveal this information.  The public have a right to know - we will be paying for it.\nIn December 2007 Goldman Sachs paid out an estimated \u00a3100 million pounds in bonuses, their profits for the first 9 months of the year were $8.4 billion.    The overtaxed, under pensioned citizens of Britain should not be expected to further fill their coffers without full disclosure of the facts.",
