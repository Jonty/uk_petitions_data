If like us you have a child who has always been off the growth chart since birth and is currently age 10, but having to wear men's clothing and shoes, then you too will be having to pay VAT on clothing for a child.\nAs a general rule our children are becoming larger/taller than before and this current guideline is outdated.\nIt would be comforting to know that our Government took the age of childhood seriously and decided that a child is a child whilst being dependent upon its parents (and that children\u2019s clothes are still not luxury items).",
