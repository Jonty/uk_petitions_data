        "background": "The conflict has taken many lives, displaced hundreds of thousands of people - many of whom live in the U.K - and has come to head of the last few months. The media have covered very little of the extent of the damage done to the country, nor have they covered the amount to which the U.K provides the Sri Lankan government with arms and weapons used against the civilian population. The US government has defined the LTTE or Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a terrorist group, as do many others, but we- through this petition - ask our government not to tar the relatively peaceful population of Tamils in Sri Lanka with the same brush, and endeavour to bring lasting and sustainable peace to the region. For more information on the civil war seek the relevant pages  on a reputable news site.",
