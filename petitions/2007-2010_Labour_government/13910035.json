        "background": "There are so many complaints about the standard of children\u2019s education, and the like, which would lead to the assumption that it is better to allocate all 'in-term' time to children.\n\nEvery term 1 to 3 days are lost due to the staff using our children\u2019s time to 'paint walls'.  Make these activities in the extended holidays mandatory and teach when school would/should be open.  Use to be called \u2018Baker days\u2019 after the minister who came up with the idiotic idea.\n\nThis would also ease the burden on parents by not making them find extra childcare or take time off after a 6 week holiday; this making the stats better and the economy stronger.",
