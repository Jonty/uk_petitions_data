DASL has been a supportive safe area for many to work through their battles,fears & to gain & stride in life without alcohol. People realise they actually have a vaild life whilst working the programmes. Alcohol is not just one package,but also,depression, suicide,break up of families,homeless...alot of pain that can not always be fixed.\nDASL has become a close family for all with their structed groups, therapeutics sessions,dedicated keyworks & other users are the main core...the heartbeat,for their recovery. This major cut in funding means that there will be no alcohol recovery follow up care services available. Over Newham and Redbridge,thats alot of people,their families, employers,friends effected also with knock on effects. Alcoholism can creep up on anyone..your family, your peers, even your children....please help us keep this service....lives are truly at risk here.",
