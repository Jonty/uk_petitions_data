By minor criminals I mean people who in most cases do no harm, yet are either well oiled or a little upset about any given situation, and before they know it their on the floor with 7 police officers ontop of them, having hancuffs fitted which would be too tight if applied to the likes of Guy Faulks! Special PC's (the ones who don't get paid) are also abusing their powers. For some reason they feel the uniform they wear makes them invincible and in some cases cause trouble just to exercise their powers! This is obsured and should be addressed at the highest possible level! I work with a SPC and some of the stories he tells me are absolutely outrageous! Do something about it Gordon!",
