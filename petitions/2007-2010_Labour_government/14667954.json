Thousands of people have already queued to see this important part of our heritage.  It would be a great shame if the government were to let this national treasure go out of the country.\n\nThe Government should give the remaining \u00a32.7 million needed to keep it in Britain and here for the education and enjoyment of its future generations.\n\nThere are only two months left to save The Staffordshire Hoard, so decisive action is needed.",
