            "background": "My aim is to reduce the number of young homeless people whether it is sofa surfing or on the streets. Apparently if you are young and single you are able to cope on your own no matter what the situation are at the moment the  guidelines you have to meet to become priority homeless are practically unapplicable to young homeless people and need to be changed\nleaving every one who doesn't meet those guidelines stuck. I am currently homeless for the 2nd time in a year due to circumstances out of my control and due to these government guidelines i cant get anywhere to live unless i rent privately which is practically impossible.  There are hundreds of young adults on the streets or sofa surfing. Some of which like me work full time and live decent respectable lives. I have written to my local major, gordon brown and prince charles in the past and came to no solution maybe they will listen to the needs of young homeless adults if enough people stand up to make them aware of the dangers they are putting young adults in (especially females)",
