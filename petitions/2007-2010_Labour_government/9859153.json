It is opposed by the usual selfish \"NIMBY\" crowd from the villages, who will oppose anything. We are where we are with the current UK population and the Government should consider the best interests of the many rather than the vested interests of a few. If for example the Government gave way to this type of protest we may never have had Heathrow Airport and Wembley Stadium to name but a few in fact I bet back a few years a small minority opposed the building of St Pauls Cathedral because it would spoil their view.",
