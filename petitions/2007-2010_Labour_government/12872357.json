There should be Parent and Baby parking spaces in the town's also.\n\nIt is very difficult and sometimes even painfull for a heavily pregnant woman to get in and out of a car in regular spaces! \n\nWith creating more spaces, more pregnant women and parent's with small children can use these without having to be stuck with smaller regular spaces!\n\nWe also ask for people who are not pregnant or who do not have small children with them to be fined or have their vehicles clamped when parking in the Parent and Baby parking spaces!",
