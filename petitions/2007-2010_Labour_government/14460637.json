        "background": "Dear Mr prime minister, I have been unemployed now for nearly six years due to ill health and employers will not take me on as i do not have the required skills. what i would like to see happen is to see more employers doing apprenticeships for those who are 24 to 35 yrs old as most apprenticeships are for those who have left school and most schemes now have been scrapped just leaving private taught lessons that people like myself on benefits cannot afford. I remember 4 years ago that you used to be able to do driving lessons via the job centre but the people on the course use to just mess about which isnt fair on respectable people like myself as most jobs require you to be able to drive. Im 31 this year and time for me i find to get myself employed is getting harder. With this i urge you to please help people like myself and make it easier to get into employment.",
