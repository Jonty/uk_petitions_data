            "background": "The current laws protecting birds of prey are being widely flouted and prosecutions, few as they are, are resulting in minor fines. \nWe call for the law to be changed to make gun licenses conditional on continuing responsible behaviour.  Any killing or injury of birds of prey in the wild should lead to the suspension of local licenses until the criminal comes forward and conviction should lead to an invariable custodial sentence.",
