        "background": "The hospital has one of the highest death rates in the country.\nIt scored just 4.8 out of 100 for patient safety in a report by Dr Foster - an independent body which collects information on health services.\nAn unannounced inspection by a Government watchdog recently found two breaches in the hospital's infection control.\nPatient groups say they are being inundated with complaints about failings in basic care on the wards \u2013 particularly for older people who don't get the help they need to eat, drink, wash and go to the toilet. We believe  an independent investigation is  necessary to restore public confidence in the hospital services.",
