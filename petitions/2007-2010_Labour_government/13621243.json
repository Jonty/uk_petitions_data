            "background": "britain has many national parks spread out accross the nation. National parks are a vital way to protect the beautiful british country side for us, for future generations and for the planet.\n\nwith the worlds pupulation increasing and urbanisation still continuing at a worrying rate national parks seem one of the only strong, solid sceme to stop brtain turning into one giant city. I hear you say 'ah but we have greem belts!' however the sad fact is planninmg permission is still being granted for developments to be built on green field land. this must stop but at least the goverment are alot stricter on national parks.\n\nwhat i personally love is being able to go somewhere where it is totaly natural and where you cant see any other human activity. Also when places are left wild, animals thrive.\n\nplease sign this petition and help the goverment realise that we need more protected land.",
