            "background": "Chuka Umunna, Labour\u2019s Parliamentary Candidate for Streatham has, in July 2009, obtained confirmation that Mayor Johnson and TfL exploring plans to extend the Bakerloo line southwards to Lewisham and the feasibility study of such a scheme is at an advanced stage.\n\nWe demand to know why an extension of the Bakerloo line to Streatham has not been considered. Streatham is in greater need of improved transport links and, areas such as Lewisham are already well served by various transport connections, including (since 1999) the Docklands Light Railway.\n\nA southward Bakerloo line extension from Elephant & Castle should run through Camberwell and Brixton to Streatham. Such an extension would relieve the extreme congestion on the Streatham High Road part of the A23 (aiding the ingress and egress to London from the South) and on the Northern and Victoria lines.\n\nAlternatively (in concert with other projects) the Victoria line could be extended South from Brixton through Streatham.",
