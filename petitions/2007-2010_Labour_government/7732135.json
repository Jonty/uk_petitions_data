As well as the threats from hot water, sugar, milk and the horrible wars of the ripping open of the tetley boxes, Teabags face commercial exploitation by humans who deny them their fundamental rights to protection...\n\nThis is the worst kind of cruelty, an act of vampirism, we pour boiling hot water all over these poor bags, then strain them to get their blood out. This is a sad new, modern world...\n\nDrink Coffee instead.",
