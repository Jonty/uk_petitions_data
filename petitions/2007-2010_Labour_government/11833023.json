You have not departed from these same policies and continue with this old, outdated Old Tory/New Labour ethos.\n\nI respectfully suggest that you will find at the next general election that many long-disenchanted Labour supporters will not bother to go to the Polling Station.\n\nUnless you enact a return to an ideals-based Socialist agenda, we will see the Tories in for another long term, causing yet more damage to the country.\n\nPlease, be brave and speak out for Socialism; it really is our best hope for the uncertain futures ahead.",
