        "background": "Tony Blair alienated every Labour voter who helped him into power by declaring that he was intending to continue the policies of the preceding Tory government.  You have not departed from these same policies and continue with this old, outdated Old Tory/New Labour ethos.\n\nI respectfully suggest that you will find at the next general election that many long-disenchanted Labour supporters will not bother to go to the Polling Station.\n\nUnless you enact a return to an ideals-based Socialist agenda, we will see the Tories in for another long term, causing yet more damage to the country.\n\nPlease, be brave and speak out for Socialism; it really is our best hope for the uncertain futures ahead.",
