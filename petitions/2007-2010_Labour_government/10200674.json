            "background": "With events of 9/11 and even our own bombings a few years ago, there seems to be an increasing vigilante mob in official jobs stopping, and searching people who photograph anything in a public place. This has lead to the enjoyment of many who watch trains, buses, planes, boats etc loose there freedom in this country to take pictures for there own enjoyment. This in turn had lead the authorities to label these people as \"Peadophiles\" and \"terrorists\" by the authority. I urge the government to make it clearer to the authorities how to use there powers of stop and search ,and the law reguarding photographs within this country and that people who are very open about there actions have no intention to harm anyone. \nLaw inforcement authorities are using the blanket label that everyone is going to plan an attack on this country and therfor even the tourist to this country falls into this category. \nContinuation like this will help loose the UK there tourist trade, and the country for its own residents is becoming more a communist state not allowing anyone the freedom to take up there hobbys.",
