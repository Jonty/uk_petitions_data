            "background": "We are a campaign group highlighting bad and dangerous drivers thru our website We think that a temporary ban is not a harsh enough deterant and that if a motorist thought he/she would loose their licence forever they would slow down and our children would be safer.  Within 3 years all the bad drivers would be on buses and trains, public transport would recieve a much needed boost in sales and the roads would be less congested and alot safer. Co2 emmitions would be drastically reduced and the drain on the emergency services would be holted. Leaving police officers to police the streets and NHS budgets to be used on upgrading hospital standards and developing research into cancer.  All these benefits can be realised by simply removing the people from the road that have prooved they do not deserve to be there So please remember speed kills children. \nThank you",
