            "background": "HARINGEY Council has finally decided not to sell off Alexandra Palace. For 30 years this local council's control of our Charity's Trust Board has been a disaster. \n\nMuch time has been lost. The building is deteriorating as more consultants are brought in to produce reports at great cost. In one corner, AP was the birthplace of television broadcasting in 1936 and in another corner is a huge, hidden Victorian theatre.\n\nMost observers recognise that the roles of councillor & trustee are irreconcilable. After the two excoriating Walklate Reports, even Haringey accepted that the chronically dysfunctional Trust Board needed governance reform. After a well-attended & positive Stakeholder Forum in October 2009, the momentum was for The Ultimate Solution: an Independent Trust. \n\nIndependent Trustees would be expert, creative, competent, committed & experienced. But there is determined foot dragging by Haringey. Release our People's Palace from the dead hand of municipal control. Independence Day Now!",
