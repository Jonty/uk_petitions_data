            "background": "Since the introduction of the smoking ban pubs all around the country are closing at a rate of around 39 a week.  This is a disaster for many communities where the pub is the hub of the community, for many small specialists breweries, landlords and their staff.\n\nI propose that the Government lift the total smoking ban in all pubs and allow the introduction of allocated smoking rooms.  It would be up to individual publicans to decide if they want a smoking room or not rather than the current outright ban.\n\nSuch a move would help many pubs to survive and staff to keep their jobs.  As a none smoker I ask all those who want to protect a long standing part of our British culture, the pub, to sign this petition whether you are a smoker or none smoker like me.",
