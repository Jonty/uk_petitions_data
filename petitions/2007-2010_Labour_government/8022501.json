        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For some while now there appears to have been stringent interviews in place for those wishing to adopt a child \u2013 the exact process can be lengthy and quite daunting.  This is a good thing and will ensure the adopted child is placed with the most suitable parents. Should there not be a parental suitability process that ALL adults/young adults wishing to become parents should be subject to. Becoming a parent is life changing and in some cases not fully understood by the parent to be. The process would not  mean the person would lose any natural rights to child birth but I believe it would highlight how difficult being a parent can be. All parents should be monitored post natal. This would ensure pre-natal comments notes and expectations were being met by both authorities and parents. Parents needing extra help would receive it and so ensure the new born child's interests were being upheld at all times. Real family planning for parents with real expectations.",
