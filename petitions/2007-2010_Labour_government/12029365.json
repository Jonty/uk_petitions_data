            "background": "On March 17th 2009, the Government has responded saying that tuition fees could rise to \u00a37000 per year, therfore decreasing the number of students. As a British student, I would like to see the student fees lower than \u00a33000 per year, as anything higher gives the government more money from student loans containing interest. By preventing students going to university, only the working class will suffer, and mostly those who don't qualify for government grants such as myself. I believe I have a right to education, just the same as everyone else, and our currupt government should not be stopping this.",
