Many of these relationships last longer than the average marriage yet the partners lose out financially in many ways, particularly inheritance and tax.  It should be automatic that they have the same rights. By recognising, and rewarding, the difference between long standing and stable relationships and short lived  or casual relationships you also encourage more stable family groupings.",
