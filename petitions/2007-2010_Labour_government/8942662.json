        "background": "Low income people who cannot get on the housing ladder have no security in private rental as the law offers little protection and prices can be three times higher than with association or council housing and conditions are often far below acceptable standards. Also people in private rental often have less disposable income than those that qualify for assistance. My question is simply...should those that contribute be considered first? as opposed to those that have not or do not contribute to society?",
