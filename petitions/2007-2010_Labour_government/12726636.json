Both my carer and I are disabled and use electric wheelchairs.  With the support of Courts by Court Orders, who do not dispute our disabilities, that since 1996 have tried to get the property repaired/adapted.  We don\u2019t have access to; a toilet, shower, bedroom, we eat, sleep excrete, urinate in commodes or urine bottle in the living room. Our personal care needs are met by a plastic bowl.  Despite having assessments for personal care, a.m./p.m., ironing, shopping, housework etc\u2026 we do not receive any of these. The property is damp and temperatures have dropped below 5 degrees Celsius and dont have carpets. North Tyneside are withholding repairs and adaptations unless Pat signs a waiver/disclaimer that NO-ONE accesses the property.In 2006 NTC contacted Quicksilver to remove household, then in 2008, Quicksilver disposed of these contents via Thomas Miller Auctioneers and disposed of 2.7 tonnes on a skip, because Quicksilver say Pat was liable for storage costs!!!",
