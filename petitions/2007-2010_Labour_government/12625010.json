            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Police are to stop monitoring hunts in a policy change that effectively marks the collapse of the hunting ban.\n\nNew guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers says that forces have more pressing priorities than spending valuable time clamping down on hunts and suggests that monitoring should be cut down.\n\nIt brands the 2004 Hunting Act 'cumbersome' and 'unenforceable' because gathering evidence of illegal hunting has proven difficult.\n\nIn order to ensure that the rule of law is respected and the electorate's wishes respected, the hunting with dogs legislation needs to be re-written in favour of the law.\n\nIf horseriders are wearing formal hunting attire whilst on horseback or accompanied by more than two dogs then there is clearly the intention to engage in an activity with the potential to result in the death of a fox or other animal. If these activities are banned with the threat of a prison sentence then it will be easy to gather evidence and would act as a strong deterrent.",
