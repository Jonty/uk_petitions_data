            "background": "In April the government is scheduled to increase the current entitlement of 24 days to 28 day. However during the time of extreme pressure on companies to keep afloat it seems a unfortunate time to bring in new legislation on statutory leave. This will only increase the chances of companies failing or result in companies shedding more jobs to cover the extra cost inflicted on them. So I would urge the government to delay this for a year or cancel it completely until the country is in a better shape. I am sure that when it comes down to it employees would be more than happy to help secure their employers future than risk losing their job.",
