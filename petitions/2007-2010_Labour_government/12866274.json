        "action": "allow legitimate sign written delivery vans 10 minutes 'grace', whilst delivering to businesses in restricted city centre areas",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I run a florist shop just outside the City Centre and have many deliveries of single items that require City Centre delivery. We are not covered by 'loading' guidelines under parking regulations; the local council requires \"continual loading or unloading activity to be seen\". It is not always possible or practical to find a legitimate parking space close to the delivery point. We are able to obtain access to the city centre before 11am, however we usually receive orders requiring delivery after that time and therefore cannot gain access. A delivery is normally completed within 10 minutes.\nI therefore propose that 10 minutes grace, and/ or a 'delivery vehicle' permit, should be given to legitimate sign written delivery vans. This would enable delivery vehicles to park up for a maximum of 10 minutes to conduct their business, without fear of receiving a \u00a370 PCN, providing they are not causing an obstruction to other road users or pedestrians.",
