            "background": "My name is George and I live in Bolton. The reason that I am writing this petiotion is that I feel that the opportunities for british young people to gain employment and training in a respectable career in this country are pathetic. I myself am a trained joiner and plasterer of 25 fully qualified and remain unemployed due to the recession, which might I add has been caused in my opinion by the open gate policy of the UK. I myself am now considering emmigration to Australia or Canada as being young and british and recently unemployed seem to exclude me from all schemes which are only applicable for the long term unemployed or the like, which might i add, are proven to stay unemployed and leech the benefits system. Do I want to unemployed? No! I can't receive help due to the fact that I haven't been unemployed for 6 months or more, nice incentive I say. Proud to be british? I don't think so. No wonder the youth of today has no respect. Want to correct the youth problems with crime and the fact that they are running rampage? Give them something to work for Gordon!",
