This is because of the negative portrayal of certain Muslim populated cultures and presented as a factual package about Islam. The true fact of the matter is that Islam is misunderstood by everyone excluding a small handful of Scholars. The true experts should be consulted on matters pertaining to Islam rather than the use misconceived opinions of people within the media.",
