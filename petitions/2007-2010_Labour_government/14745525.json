            "background": "The smaller trades which come under the HPC 'health proffessional council' we also come under the Agenda for Change and in the NHS are paid the same as nurses e.g. Operative Department Practitioners which are educated the same and do exactly the same work as theatre nurses qualified in surgery, recovery and anaesthetics. We feel because we are such a small trade currently 90 personnel thats including 20 in training and only 2 commission officers we feel we are being overlooked and frankly tired with the poor respond the AFPRB that seems to be influenced by the huge powerful Nursing Corps which has obviously has a greater influence on the AFPRB. We are experiencing lots of newly qualified ODPs leaving the services after 2-3 years because we do not get recognition like the nurses which means we are losing experienced personnel.\nWe want to know why ODP's and other Allied Health Professionals have not been recognised by the new pay spine increase given to nurses corps and yet we get nothing.",
