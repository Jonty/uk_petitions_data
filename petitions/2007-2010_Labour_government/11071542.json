        "background": "This tragic story has affected all those who have read or heard about it. Baby P has been failed by all those around him. \nSocial workers who are put in place to protect children and prevent these horrendous crimes are still being allowed to work with families and who knows when this will happen again. \n\nWorst of all, the people who should have protected him have shown no remorse or guilt for their failings. The GP who sent him home to yet more abuse and the social workers who left him in the care of his evil mother and step-father. \n\nWhy should these so called professionals be allowed to stay in their high paid jobs when they are making so many mistakes, leading to severe consequences. Policies and procedures are not being adhered to therefore they should not be allowed to carry on in their jobs.",
