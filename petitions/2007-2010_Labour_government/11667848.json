This means British pork costs more to produce and cannot compete with cheaper EU pork. \n\nIt is unfair that our British Pork Farmers are told they have to produce pork to stricter welfare policies, and yet still have to compete with cheaper Pork produced in countries with lower welfare policies.\n\nIt is an unfair playing field and it's killing our Pork industry.  \n\nUntil the foreign Pork farmers meet the same standards as British Pork farmers, the UK should not be importing their Pork!",
