            "background": "As evidenced by the atrocity of Baby P. the current laws, policies, interpretaions and application are complete failure.  The system now in place aids and abets those who are hell bent on evil towards the most vulnerable.\nThe Law needs to be changed to Zero Tolerance - if in doubt, there can be no doubt that the child be removed to a place of safety.  Infants, babies, toddlers and young children cannot speak for themselves if they could it would be clear that they would not wish to stay with the abuser.  To attempt to keep children with parents/carers who have been identified as child abusers is not an option.  Change the Law to Protect the Child.",
