            "background": "A number of companies such as NDFA marketed fixed income and growth products. The literature contained specific reference to the protection for up to \u00a348,000 provided by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume this protection existed for their products. However, NDFA took the investments outside the scheme with Lehman Brothers as the final provider. With the demise of Lehman, thousands of cautious savers stand to lose their savings.\n\nWe ask whether this is a case of misselling and whether the FSA should have provided more protection to savers.",
