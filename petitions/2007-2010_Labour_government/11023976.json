        "action": "introduce legislation to change the law to ensure that where foreigners are denied entry into the EU by one member state they cannot then be allowed to apply for entry into and asylum in the EU via this country because of the sickening propensity of our judiciary towards applying the human rights act to the detriment of the indigenous population of this country and the EU in general.",

        "background": "A member of Osama Bin Laden's family has been denied entry to the EU by a judicial ruling in Spain and will now, no doubt, apply for entry to the EU via this country.  This should NOT be allowed.  This country is far too lax in applying common sense and the rules of natural justice to the Human Rights aspect of EU law and what happens in one EU country, such as the refusal of asylum or the issue of a deportation order, should be treated as setting a precedent which CANNOT be overturned by a judge in this country.  The judiciary in this country have notoriously less interest in the sovereignty of this country, than Spanish judges (as well as judges of other EU members states) have in maintaining the sovereignty of their country.",
