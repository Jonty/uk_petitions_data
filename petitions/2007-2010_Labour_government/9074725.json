            "background": "The number of 'yob' related murders of innocent people is becoming an increasing problem and must stop. If people were given the right to defend themselves and others at ANY cost then I feel there would be more intervention from the general public when such incidents occur. The nation lives by a rule of 'not getting involved' due to the fact that they will then become implicated if an attacker is injured or killed. British residents should have the right to help protect other british residents in such cases of assault, bullying and other related violent crime.",
