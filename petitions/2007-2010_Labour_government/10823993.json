        "background": "over 60's use public transport to socialise, which is a PRIVILAGE, school children use it to go to school, which is a RIGHT.\nwhy should we pay for our rights but not for our privileges.\nalso over 60's use it about once a week, school children use it 5 times a week which is worth giving us free travel because if over 60's get free travel, our fares go up, which means it costs more to get school.",
