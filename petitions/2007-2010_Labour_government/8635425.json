            "background": "In modern football there is so much money these days, and there are still clubs in lower leagues struggling to stay in football because of financial problems. The Premiership clubs have so much money in their club, and so do the Football Association, so I believe there should be a way to help the likes of, Rotherham United, Bournmouth, Leeds United, Hull City and so on. I'm sure many people agree with me about this topic, and I\u2019m sure many football fans around the UK will sign to try and make this happen.\nThank you.",
