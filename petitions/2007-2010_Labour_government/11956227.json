            "background": "Respected Prime Minister,\nWith the recent statement of changes in the immigration system, a lot of students are at a risk of being affected. International Students have always been a good part of British society by contributing towards taxes, university expenses. With the recent announcements that Post graduate diploma and certificate will not be a part of the qualifications eligible for post study work visa, thousands of students who are already studying in these courses in a hope that after the end of their studies they will be previlged to get a good job for 2 years will be affected. In addition to this, it will leave adverse effects on the finances of universities in a way that change in immigration rules every now and then will shake the trust of students and they will be reluctant to join the British universities in future. Some of the people might think it an assumption but the facts show that each non Eu student contributes towards the fees of 2 EU students. We humbly request you to re consider these changes as these should just be for those who have not yet enrolled for these courses.\n\nthanks",
