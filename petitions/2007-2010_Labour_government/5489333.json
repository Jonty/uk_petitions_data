            "background": "The BTP are understaffed and over stretched to be fair, every time I call them out they do not respond or they get someone from another force to turn up who do not have the specialist knowledge on railway by-laws that the BTP have. Previous home secretary's have looked at this but have either been sacked or resigned before any concrete plans were made on the issue. Regional forces are better equipped as they have more manpower to deal with local railway issues and faster response times would soon show along with huge savings budget wise as we would no longer need to fund the HR side of the BTP. Train operating companies can still input financial support as the currently do but give it to the local forces instead.",
