My mind is not worped in any way.\nMY point is to let us have that choice. What is next the banning of horror the news or even tom and jerry oh and farie tales, just look at some of them, wolfs trying to eat a child, step mother attemting to murder her step child and so on.\nLET US HAVE A CHOICE !",
