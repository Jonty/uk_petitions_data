        "background": "England lags far behind the rest of Europe in the number of bank holidays we get. We get 8 days, but some countries such as Spain get 14 days.\n\nA bank holiday on St George's Day would be a great opportunity for everyone living or working in England (regardless of colour, religion or sexuality) to recognise the things that bind us together. It would also give new arrivals to this country an opportunity to join our national celebration.\n\nEverything from cricket to curry could be celebrated on our national day.\n\nNorthern Ireland already has a bank holiday on St. Patrick's Day, the Scottish Parliament is making St. Andrew's Day a bank holiday and the Welsh Assembly agrees that St. David's Day should be a bank holiday.\n\nThe 23 April should be a St. George celebration!",
