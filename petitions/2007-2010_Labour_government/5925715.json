        "background": "Women can suffer very badly when menstruating. If they have to have a day off work then it either makes their sick record look bad, or they have to use up their holiday entitlement.\n\nWhy is there no \"official\" option for women to have a day, or half a day off work when suffering form a particularly painful period? In some women it can cause sickness / the runs. \n\nIn many workplaces it isn't taken seriously because the industry is male dominated. Being male isn't an excuse for ignorance; there is scientific proof of the illness or pain that some women experience.\n\nSome workplaces have adopted \"duvet days\" which can be used for this purpose. But it's not a legal obligation so many women still suffer.\n\nI strongly believe that women should be given a minimum of 6 days per year, separate from holiday entitlement, for this purpose.",
