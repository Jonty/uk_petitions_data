            "background": "Children start school too young. This particularly appears to effect summer birthdays and boys. The reception year does concentrate on play but there is an emphasis on complying with formal education and of course the discipline of school. As our primary belief systems is in formation at this point younger children are disadvantated to later education, as they start to believe at an early age that they aren't any good at school. (When often it is about physical ability to do something, e.g. hold a pencil, which is difficult forsome younger children or to concentrate for periods of time). Children are assessed at an early age and are often put into sets by year one which serves to reinforce the childs one beliefs (that they have picked up from the adults around them) about their own ability. The current system does not play to the childs strength and allow them to develop at their pace. Changing the age to six would enable a child to develop at a more realistic pace, work from a belief of can do rather than can't and support whole child development.",
