        "background": "In the aftermath of a bull terriers attack on my two small children, which left my elder son with a head injury and stitches to his ear, we as a community wish to ensure that the likelihood of further attacks is minimised by the separation of St Georges Park Easton, a large Victorian space, into a dog-walkers area, and an area solely for the general public.  This can already be seen to be working successfully in neighbouring St Andrews Park.  Whilst it is clearly difficult to legislate against irresponsible dog ownership, it is relatively simple to take a pro-active stance in safeguarding the lives of vulnerable citizens in the light of increasingly prevalent reports of dog 'park-fighting'.  More positively, St Georges Park is a huge and beautiful space, whose division would not inhibit anyones enjoyment and freedom to roam.  There is already a refurbished library and scope for a cafe concession and so on.  We need, as a community, to reclaim and protect St Georges Park and its reputation. Please join our collective voice to provide a separate space for dog walkers from that of other park users so that we can try to ensure safety and confidence for all.",
