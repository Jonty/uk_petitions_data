            "background": "Every person who has a job is working for a good life for their family and friends to pay the bills and maybe own a house and have a decent standard of living. \n\nService personel are on 24 hour call, they have to be away from their families for huge chunks of time and spend the time they are away in dyer situations. \n\nEveryone person who serves thier country should be able to rest safley in the knowledge that they will be able to afford a house or the cost of living. \n\nAt a time where troops are spead so thinly and job roles are not being filled due to bad pay causing service men and women to have to work for days longer then the normal healthy time. \n\nThere needs to be changes to how our personel are treated. \n\nWe need to let the PM know how we feel so that changes can be made and every service man and woman and thier families can have a standard of living that they deserve. \n\nIn a time of big bonuses and huge pay offs for people who have torn the country apart and widened the divide between rich and poor it is time to have a re-think and pay the people who deserve it not only the respect they deaerve but make financial restitution for the years of disrespect and lack of respect.",
