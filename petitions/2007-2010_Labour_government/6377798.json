        "background": "The last time the Wisbech to March Train was used for passengers commercially was in the 1960's. There is currently a scheme that is a charity, to reinstate the route as a historical rail route, but this does not include the rail link at March to keep the same train to London. Nor will this be operated on a basis for daily commuting to London.\n\nThe track still exists, though the station was demolished years ago.\n\nGiven the road network problems in The East of England, surely it would make sense to re-open the Wisbech to London properly as a commuter route.\n\nThis would not only reduce congestion on the roads, reduce pollution, but also bring valuable investment into the Wisbech area.",
