            "background": "I am a working single parent.  Why is it that because I have a mortgage on my home I am not entitled to any help with my mortgage payments, yet if I was in rented beit council or private, I would be getting help towards my rent!  Whats the difference???  In private rented the rent money is inflated mortgage payment for the landlord to pay his mortgage if he has one.  I will have money at the end of my working life should I need to go into a care home, to pay for my care yet if I was in rented I would have nothing and be a burden on the state.  Why are we being singled out for helping ourselves???  So lets get as many people to sign this as possible and hopefully we might be counted for changed and recognised for working to support our families and helping ourselves.",
