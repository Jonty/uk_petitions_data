            "background": "There have been cases where the british government cannot deport people suspected of terrorism because of a stupid law made in another country that states it would be against their rights as humans if we sent them back to a country that is war torn or has no infrastructure to sustain a specified standard of living.\n\nThis for us is madness, keeping these people here is putting our lives in danger and sending them back should be as simple as putting them on a plane. Like the australians do!\n\nWe should not be wasting \"control orders\" on people only to have them abscond which then leaves us in more danger.\n\nIf you know who/where they are, go and get rid of them and stop endangering your own people.\n\nAs for the Bill of Human Right's. We should be able to excersize when, how and to what extent this law is applied. regardless of what \"brussels\" says.\n\nPlease sort this out, or on your concience and with the lives of your own people will the consequences be payed.",
