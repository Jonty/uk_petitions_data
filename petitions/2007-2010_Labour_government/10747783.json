This Prime Minister has led our economy into a huge downturn, robbed the pensions of working people to far greater effect than Robert Maxwell. This Prime Minister appears to have lost the trust of his party and cabinet. If he wins an election then he will have been given the confidence of the electorate and can then get on with the business of government and not fighting a rearguard action against his own people.",
