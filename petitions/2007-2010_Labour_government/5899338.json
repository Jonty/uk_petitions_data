        "action": "Abolish company car tax being applied to district nurses and other healthcare community workers who lease cars through the NHS lease car scheme.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "District and community nurses pay a company car tax on vehicles they lease through their employers. Most of these workers lease cars so that they have a reliable car to enable them to carry out their vital community work. Many do not see it as a 'perk' but as the most sensible option to ensure that they have reliable transport. Without a car most community workers would not be able to do their jobs and serve the patients belonging to their communities. It is felt among many community workers that they are 'paying' to do their job and as such are being penalised for choosing a healthcare profession. The government should not treat the NHS healthcare leased vehicle as company vehicles with which the public is more familiar with.",
