            "background": "I believe that the recent flooding events have been caused by rising river beds. Heavy rain is constantly washing thousands of tonnes of stone/rubble from the hills into lower lying rivers, thus reducing the volume capacity of the river channel each time it rains heavily. No-one currently removes this stone/rubble and I believe that the recent flooding problems, (which have caused thousands of people to be displaced from their homes), are a warning to us all. These floods will only worsen and spread to other districts if we sit back and leave the river channels to fill with debris. We need to be cleaning river channels out now! Do we really want to see even more catastrophic floods in the future?",
