            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I agree that some vehicles with large engines should have a higher road tax, but this should be irrespective of whether they have 4x4 transmission or not. My Freelander only has a 1.8 litre engine and it passed it's emissions test so is no more dangerous to the environment than any other 1.8 litre car. A RAV4 is only small but is charged an extortionate amount of road tax for being a 4x4. This is becoming a personal vendetta against people who drive 4x4 cars and has no real bearing on the damage being done to the environment. They cause no more damage than any other car and its about time the government realised this.",
