            "background": "In the U.K public fear mounts as reports escalate around Britain's Gun and Knife Culture.\n\nOften, where youths have been raised in deprived areas, often have never had any sense of authority instilled within them, often heralding from broken families, or families which have drug, or alcohol abuse.  In such cases, these youths have never been shown what an adult can offer, but may rather than been shown a resentment of Britain's Policing, or worse still, abuse in many forms from those who are supposed to protect them.\nContinual run-ins with the police escalate and prison may ensue, but this leads to a new generation who become desensitised to authority.\n\nWe the undersigned propose that a period of National Service would:\n\na) Provide the offenders with a sense or respect for authority.\nb) Relieve some strain on our prisons\nc) Instill in offenders a loyalty to each other and their country\nd) Develop men and women of purpose with skills rather than 'ex-cons'",
