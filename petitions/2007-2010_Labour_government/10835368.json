Parents should be issued with permits, to work the same as the permits for disabled drivers, the offender who abuses the bays get clamped with a fine or penalty to have the clamp removed, with the proceeds of the fines to possibly go to a childrens charity. \n\nThe parent and child bays should also include pregnant women who are past a certain stage in pregnancy, i.e. get a permit issed on the strength of producing a MATb1 form, or issue by their midwife and to be valid until the child reaches a suitable age. \n\nIn the instance of more than 1 child this should be based on the age of the youngest.",
