            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The small number of earners falling into the proposed bracket makes it a comparitively valueless proposal - \u00a32bn is a small sum compared with any part of the economic recovery package - yet the new tax will do considerable damage to our economy, and perhaps even reduce the very revenues it seeks to augment.  Again and again, excessive taxes targeting the wealthier sections of society have been proved only to lead to an exodus of talent.  It will not help the economy to add a further reason for the people we most need in the battle to right the economy to move elsewhere.  The governement must accept that this tax, aimed seemingly at satisfying the undiscriminating popular dislike for bankers, is a step back to the Politics of Envy and no way to deal with the recession.",
