            "background": "since we are supposidly PART of europe then make work rights equal all over the europeian borders. maybe thats why foreign workers here cause they cant get equal work rights like we have in britain.\n\nwe are all born equal, naked and have to be cut from our \"EQUAL\" life line. wat we build and our ancestors have built and fought for should remain independent and proud.\ninvest empty buldings into training grounds and make them readily available and have a \"walk through\" style.\nwhere as to attain the fact of being not a buisness for another worker person to live the high life and look at the non-achievers but as to be a buisness for the future, run by non-achievers and people who are mature enough to train others.\ntrades and labour departmets (work agencys for labourers who help build the economy physically) should be watch dogged. they exploit workers and pay them less then the minimum wage when worked out from the net total of pay, after deductions. this should be illegal as they sit in an office and steal construction work thus taking jobs of british citizens who build the places we trade and live in. this would not happen in a \"normal office\" work enviroment.",
