            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The scrappage scheme announced in the budget could seriously undermine much of the classic car hobby.  Many popular classics are worth less than \u00a32000, as are worn-out but restorable examples of more rare and exotic cars.  These cars are generally well-maintained, do few miles, often have better fuel consumption than modern, heavier cars, and so their envirnomental impact is negligible.  However, the scrappage scheme could see many perfectly good historic cars needlessly crushed.  By limiting the scrappage scheme to cars between 10-20 years old, these classics will be saved",
