            "background": "This bill or its amendments could permit open access to abortion which is the intentional destruction of human life at almost any stage of pregnancy. It could abolish the \"safeguard\" in the 1967 Act which required signatures of 2 \"independent\" doctors. It could permit abortion to be recommended and performed by a nurse, without serious counselling. It is thus a bill which takes no cognizance of the sanctity of human life from conception (fertilization). I ask HM Govt to abandon this immoral Bill.",
