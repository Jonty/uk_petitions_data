            "background": "Ten years ago the BBC covered 79 days of horseracing; this year it\u2019s 27; by 2010 it will be only 14 unless  the BBC can be  reminded of its obligations as a public service broadcaster and scraps plans for emasculating its reportage of a sport which appeals to  the widest demographic of all. The consequences go well beyond the leisure preferences of the six million TV licence payers that annually visit racecourses. By cherry picking the dual purpose \u201csocial\u201d events such as the Derby, Royal Ascot and the Grand National (which attracted viewing figures of 10 million this time) the BBC  is reckless as to the future of the supporting tier. Any reduction in terrestrial exposure will hasten the contraction of the industry, jeopardising  20,000 full-time jobs and the racing industry tax contribution of \u00a3280 million a year.",
