        "background": "The BBC should be made more accountable & independent. The BBC \u2018Have your say\u2019 scheme is corrupt and operates a back-door method of censorship. The censorship comes in the form of delaying, the release of comments which they do not agree with, and then only release them moments before the voting closes, so the comments cannot be recommended. In addition, it would appear they break the own rules (publishing comment\u2019s that have obviously been copied) in order to promote their own point of view. \n\nAt 12:59 on Thursday 13/11/08 submitted a comment on \u2018Should UK troops withdraw from Afghanistan?\u2019 Now  it\u2019s 11:00 on Sunday 16/11/08 my comments are \u2018awaiting moderation\u2019 The number of comments published 1140 of which 60% of these were written after mine had been submitted. In addition looking through the last 45 comments published 8 (17%) had copied material contained within them! This is not an isolated incident. I have tried to complain on several occasions, but each time met with a wall of silence.",
