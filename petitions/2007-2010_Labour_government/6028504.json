        "action": "Stop our local councils charging excessive fees for sports facilities.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Council Tax bills continue to rise at unprecedented rates and we repeatedly see our facilities being sold off or cut back. One such group of facilities are sports fields, pitches, courts etc.\n\nThis week I watched children being asked to leave local tennis courts or pay \u00a36 per hour to stay. Presumably our council WANT to see today's youngsters hanging around on street corners or becoming obese in front of TVs and computers? I doubt many children or parents could afford these fees on a regular basis.\n\nAs tax payers we have paid for these facilities including those in schools which are now laying dormant for the summer holidays. Fenced in and deserted for the best summer months.\n\nCome on Government - stop selling us that which we have already paid for and keep our children healthy and off the streets!",
