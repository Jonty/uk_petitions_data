            "background": "We would like the opportunity to petition against the proposed plans to allow a so-called Eco Town from being given the green light by the government.\nIt is absolute madness to replace five working farms and 465 hectares of lush Cheshire countryside and replace it with 7000 houses, 3 new schools and a trendy town centre with cafe's and bars in such a rural location.\nThe local villages that adjoin the proposed area only became aware of the proposal on Friday 15th Feb 08, thus giving us very little time and opportunity to mount a serious campaign to fight the plans. we have been told, a decision will be made week commencing 25th Feb 08 to narrow down the 50 or so Eco-Town applications throughout the country to a shortlist of 10. Obviously we would like the chance to veto any such development in the heart of rural Cheshire.  Therefore we would like to raise an E-Petition to strenghten our campaign and show just how much opposition there is to this mindless proposal that pretends to be an Eco-Town.",
