            "background": "The British supporters feel cheated by the way Gordon Brown 'assumed' his role as leader of the Labour party. In doing so aquired the title of Prime Minister having never been elected by the British Public to serve them. Having been given the choice the British voters may well have supported Gordon Brown, however when you remove the option for the Voter to show their support or lack of and aquire a significant position this is where the insult occurs. Labour are in grave danger of losing the next election. Not because another party is more equipped to take care of our once wonderful country. But because the best party is being led by a man who appeared to cheat his way to the top.",
