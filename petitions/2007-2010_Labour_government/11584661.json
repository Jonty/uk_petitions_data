            "background": "It has been made known that the majority of the Coventry After School clubs are to be closed as part of cost cutting measures, putting leaders out of work, and hundreds of children with no where to go after school.\nParents only pay 80p per child per session but they are due to close in a matter of weeks, with no obvious consultation.\nWe ask that these clubs remain open, to preserve jobs, and to keep children off the streets.",
