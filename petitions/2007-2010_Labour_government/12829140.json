            "background": "We, the British public find it totally unacceptable for large sum's of MP's expenses to be blocked out. Parliament tried to stop the Daily Telegraph to not publish MP's expenses claiming that it was going to be done in June 2009. These have since been released and it's been a disgrace. MP's expenses have been so badly blacked out that the true nature of their expenses is still not known. We demand that this is released in full. Whilst we admit that their is sensitive information in there expenses such as address, we believe it is right and just for the British tax payers to have a full audit off all expenses claimed by MPs.",
