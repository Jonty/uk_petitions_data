            "background": "Currently, the benefits system actively encourages some people to do many things which are a drain on the economy, such as feigning illness and having children they cannot afford.\n\nI propose that all benefits paid be put into a loan that must be repaid, with a generous interest rate like student loans. People who need the benefits could take the money when they need it most and get back onto their feet, whilst there is far less of an incentive for people to do something just to get money from the government, since everything must be repaid.",
