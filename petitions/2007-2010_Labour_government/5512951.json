Because I had been paid for part of February, I could not qualify for carers allowance as I was advised that the pay I received during February had to support me and my husband during March.  Why???  How many employers pay one month in advance? My husband died on 2nd April and I was awarded \u00a346 allowance for the week he died.  This has now been taken off me as, 3 months after he died, I have been granted widows pension.  Also, \u00a346 is less than the minimum wage - why?",
