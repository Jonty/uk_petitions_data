            "background": "the content of antenatal classes is out - dated and often ad hoc. The UK has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe and many girls are going into labour unprepared and frightened. Is there a way of encouraging people to attend parentcraft ? encouraging people to attend ? Do focus groups or individual sessions quel anxieties better ? The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to give guidelines to antenatal units on the content on these sessions - midwives do a great job - but it is sometimes unclear what the public want - what does the rest of the nation think ?",
