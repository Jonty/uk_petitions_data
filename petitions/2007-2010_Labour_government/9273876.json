        "background": "There are several parents that split up during pregnacy of the child and the birth of the child i have done up this petition for school age children to be allowed to choose which \"parent\" the child wants to live with as long as there is an adquiptable home for them to move into. Children can choose who they want to live with at the age of 14 but that can be parents or friends ect but i think it's only right they have the decision whilst in the younger childhood but only allowed for parents. At school age they are able to notice where they feel more conftable and as there are so many school aged children getting abused but too scared to speak out this would be a way they can get away from physical andf mental abuse without feeling threatend to have to speak out in depth about there childhood.",
