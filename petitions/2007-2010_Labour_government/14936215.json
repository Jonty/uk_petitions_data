            "background": "Since 2009 the overhead street lights on the A413 road between Chalfont St. Peter and Tatling End have not been in use during hours of darkness. \n\nThe A413 is a dangerous stretch of road with a high accident rate, resulting in both serious and fatal collisions. A majority of this stretch of the A413 is fitted with street lighting, with the exception of the area between Tatling End and the railway viaduct.  \n\nBetween 1st January 1999 and 31st December 2003, 23 collisions were recorded on this small section of road alone, 11 of which were during hours of darkness, 8 of which were serious, and 2 fatal. \n\nDespite a safety review (www.buckscc.gov.uk) and the Council acknowledging that this is an area of concern, the street lights are now switched off during hours of darkness, presenting an avoidable increase in the risk to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nThis Sunday (28/02/2010) during hours of darkness there was a further collision on this stretch of road, leaving 3 people with serious injuries and 1 in a critical condition.  Please help us to try and reduce these tragic events by turning back on our street lights.",
