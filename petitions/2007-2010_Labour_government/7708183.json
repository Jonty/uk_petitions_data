        "background": "Whilst in Thailand I witnessed a traffic light controlled junction which had a countdown timer informing all waiting traffic how long they have to wait before their green light appeared. This would be big enough so the line of traffic waiting at the junction would be able to read it, and displayed as seconds or minutes and seconds.\n\nNot only would this be useful information, but hopefully also encourage people to turn off their engines which would promote greener driving, and even use the parking brake rather then riding the clutch.",
