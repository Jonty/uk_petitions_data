            "background": "Petition about banning childrens content that contain homosexuality.\n\nChildren should not be taught about sex or homesexuality.\n\nA book I read that my little sister got from the library promoting homosexuality.\n\nThe book states that it is about penguin-lovers, meaning people who love penguins, but it clearly is not about this. The main story is about homosexuality, they just use penguins to cover up the truth. This is very crafty and misleading to children.\n\nI am not homophobic, I don't really care what people do with their lives. Every person has their own choices in life, but please keep it to yourselves and don't brainwash other people or children.\n\nIf homosexual people want to publish books out like this then do it with adult books in the homosexual section of a library or bookstore not childrens books.\n\nChildren should not be exposed to these types of content.\n\nBook details:\n\nTitle: And Tango Makes Three\nPublisher: Simon & Schuster\nAuthors: Justin Richardson, Peter Parnell",
