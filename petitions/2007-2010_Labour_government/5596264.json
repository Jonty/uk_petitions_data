            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently civil servants are granted 6 months maternity leave on full pay; they\u2019re in talks to increase the leave to 9 months (full pay).  Individuals working for the private sector are entitled to 6 weeks leave at 90% of their average earnings.  Both public and private sector individuals are entitled to statutory pay.  \n\nI request that those working for private companies are given either the same rights as civil servants or that the entitlement for both public and private sector employees is set to 6 weeks at 90% pay.\n\nThe difference in pay is unnecessary and unjust; the pay & benefits civil servants receive is on par with those working for private companies.  Private sector individuals are forced to return to work earlier than their counterparts, no doubt their taxes is used to fund the mother\u2019s who are enjoying 6 months (maybe 9) maternity leave.",
