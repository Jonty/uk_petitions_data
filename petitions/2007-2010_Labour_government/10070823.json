        "action": "support amendment to the National Rail Conditions of Carriage to allow for increased compensation in the event of delay",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Compensation for any delay by rail companies within the UK is severely restricted by Condition 42 of the National Rail Conditions of Carriage. Compensation for consequential loss is excluded, and any compensation is paid by way of rail travel vouchers. In a country which operates a privatised rail system, compensation should be regulated, but should also not be fettered. The Conditions of Carriage should be amended to reflect how delay/cancellation is dealt with, for example, within the aviation industry, with payments being made once a passenger has been delayed by a certain amount, depending upon the nature of the journey, and if necessary subject to proof of any losses incurred as a direct result.",
