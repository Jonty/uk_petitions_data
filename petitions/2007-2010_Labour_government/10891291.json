            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Despite being illegal, 15 million British people have tried cannabis, and 6 million are regular users. Prohibition is ineffective, and needlessly ties up the resources of our police and courts. At the same time, our country is fighting a war against the Taleban which is unwinnable without the support of the Afghan people, many of whom rely on poppy farming to provide employment. \n\nAttempts to halt the farming, without providing a replacement cash crop, turn the Afghan people against us, losing the war for hearts and minds. We should encourage the regulated farming of cannabis for export to the UK as an alternative cash crop, supporting the farmers, whilst simultaneously undermining both the opium trade and the financial base of the Taleban. \n\nThe health concerns are no greater than alcohol, which causes 80,000 deaths a year, and which also has a correlation between abuse and mental health problems. Dutch people (legal cannabis) show no greater incidence of these issues than the UK.",
