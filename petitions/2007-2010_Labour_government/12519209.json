            "background": "The Government has provided a 100% guarantee to savers in Northern Rock and, by implication, to other 'banks' such as Alliance & Leicester. On the following day Northern Rock investors (i.e. shareholders) saw their investment rise by 8.22% and those investors in Alliance & Leicester by 32.17% as a direct result of the Government guarantee. Shareholders, by definition, know and understand the risks of investing in equity. They are aware that share prices fall as well as rise. Investors are risk takers.\n\nSavers who deposit their hard earned funds into such organizations are not risk takers, which is why they chose 'building societies' rather than themselves buying equity directly. It would seem inequitable that Government is prepared to provide guarantees which bring benefit to shareholders but refuse such guarantees to savers such as those who deposited money in Equitable Life.",
