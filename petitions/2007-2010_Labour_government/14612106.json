            "background": "This year my local supermarkets had Halloween, Fireworks and Christmas goods in the shops at the same time.  Straight after Christmas we had Christmas good and Easter Eggs side by side on the shelves.  There is no need for Christmas goods to be in the shops in August or Easter goods in December.  Shops should not be allowed to have such seasonal goods on their shelves until three weeks before the event at the very most.  The way it is now means that by October most of us are completely fed up with Christmas and does anyone really buy Easter Eggs in early January and keep them until Easter Sunday?  Let's keep these celebrations special and less commercialised.",
