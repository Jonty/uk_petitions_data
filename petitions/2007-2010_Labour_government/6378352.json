            "background": "At the moment in the United Kingdom people accussed of crimes are allowed topick any solicitor for legal advice and representation they want at the tax payers expense.  Whilst victims of crime are forced to accept the CPS.\nThis creates an unfair balance and means that criminals get a better service than victims of crime and it pays better to be a defence solicitor.\nWe propose that a CDS criminal defence service is set up similar to the CPS with similar resources, so if people cannot afford a solicitor then then get a public defender like in america, reducing the burden for legal fees on the tax payer and ensuring a more equal defence and prosecution service",
