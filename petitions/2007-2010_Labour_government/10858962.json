            "background": "For this petition I would like the govenment to make the student bursary more financialy viable for all nursing students. In addition make the degree bursary non-means tested so it is fair between both qualifications. Due to the current finacial climate, the bursary doesn't seem to cover all all outgoings if it is your only income whilst at university and placement. The bursary for a diploma student is around \u00a36500 a year which is not enough! Please sign this petetion!!",
