            "background": "I propose that the government cancel the plans for the Edinburgh Tram system in favor of a public ownership of Segway's.  The current bus infrastructure is sufficient as a public transport system, but the aim is to reduce the number of cars being used in the city.  The Segway is an ideal (and potentially cheaper) alternative to implementing trams.  It is also far less disruptive to the city.  The segway produces nearly zero emissions and the running costs are far less than a car or any public transport system.  Segway's also have the option to carry cargo.  Perhaps a three/four wheeled option could be used for slightly less able individuals.\n\nIn short, the people favor convenience of their own transport over any public transport system.  This alternative provides the best of both worlds while at the same time, being very environmentally friendly.",
