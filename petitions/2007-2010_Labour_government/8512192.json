            "background": "The transportation of young male calves to Europe for slaughter is unacceptable.  They should be farmed here in the U.K., allowed a good level of life outdoors before slaughter, and it should be encouraged that male calves be allowed to live to adulthood as pets or similar, on farms or on private lands.  This should be promoted as an alternative to the existing system of them being killed after birth.",
