You and Tony Blair have failed the british public ever since the Year 2000 and it is now time for you to provide us with a General Election.\n\nIt is time for the country to have a new leader which will make Great Britain better than it is now.\n\nEvery time I go to the shop, I hear customers complain about how bad the labour party has made the UK. \n\nBy signing this petition, we can together make the UK a better place to live on.\n\nShould you refuse to call for a General Election, you should at least tell us the truth as to why you are not going to provide us with an election.",
