            "background": "The economy is in a poor state. Inflation during May 2008 alone, measured using the CPI, was 0.8%. It stands at 3.0% annually; however, this is certain to rise as the year draws on. Unemployment stands at 5.3% and the UK has a balance of payments deficit of \u00a38.5 billion. Despite the global economic climate, better management of UK monetary and fiscal policy, as well as immigration, would result in the UK being in a much healthier state. Only a more apt Prime Minister would be able to change this.",
