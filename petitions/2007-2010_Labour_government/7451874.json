        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Fundamentally a bank (or building society) should not be allowed to raise charges (administrative or otherwise) on overdrawn accounts belonging to people who are receiving Disability Living Allowance (all / any catagories), or Incapacity Benefit, as so often these types of benefits can be stopped in error by a Social Security Tribunal, and may not be re-instated again for months or even years whilst a usually lengthy appeal process is gone through, by which time the person gets into debt, and bank charges continue to mount up.   Any back-payment of benefit (when received) is then wiped out by bank charges.   This cannot be fair or even reasonable to those on such benefits, especially so, when benefit has been stopped as the direct result of an Error in Law by the Tribunal.",
