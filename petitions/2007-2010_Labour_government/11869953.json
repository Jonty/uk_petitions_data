            "background": "Today\u2019s mortgages are nothing more than licensed robbery.  We appreciated that we borrow a large lump sum from the mortgage lender and that they want their interest on this loan, however, the interest that they charge is unfair and a rip off.  We borrow a sum of money and initially all we pay back is the interest to the lender with only a small amount going towards the capital value.  A mortgage loan should be just like a car loan with a fixed rate of interest and a fixed payment for its loan term.  The payment should be for capital and interest with the interest being fixed throughout the loan term.  The lenders should be capped on how much interest they can obtain from these rip off mortgages and the interest rates fixed for the full term of the loan.  The home owner should be paying more capital to the property than interest every month, thus ensuring that they have more security in the event of any repossession.",
