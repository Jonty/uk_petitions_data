        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For many tenants, having their Housing Benefit paid to their landlords helps them to manage their finances. Next April, most tenants on Housing Benefit will be denied this option. For some, temptation will be too great and they will spend their Housing Benefit on something other than their rent. In some cases, drink or drugs. Apart from infringing their right to choose, this will lead to homelessness on a terrifying scale among some of those least able to access decent housing.\nA report published by the DWP on a trial of this scheme in nine \u201cpathfinder\u201d areas, states that, because of the new legislation, 56% of landlords were less likely to let to Housing Benefit tenants, 28% had actually declined to let to a new tenant on Housing Benefit and 23% had even gone as far as not to renew an existing tenancy.\nSo, almost a quarter of landlords had made someone \u2013 maybe a whole family, with children \u2013 homeless because of the change. Whether you think these landlords are acting reasonably or not, is not the issue: the concern is for the people who will become homeless. Despite the findings of their own report, the DWP is determined to press ahead. Please stop them, please sign this petition",
