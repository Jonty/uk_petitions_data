            "background": "It is time for football supporters to be treated as equals in society with supporters of other sports and those who attend other events.\n\nThe banning of the consumption of alcohol within sight of the pitch simply leads to those who wish to drink, drinking alcohol more quickly before a game rather than pacing themselves.\n\nThis can result in people getting drunk more quickly and lead to disorder problems.\n\nThe Government brought in 24 licensing in order to stop exactly the same problem in our towns and cities yet continues to keep this draconian law when it comes to football.\n\nIt is time that football supporters were given the same respect as other members of society.",
