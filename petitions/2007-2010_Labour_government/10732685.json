        "background": "Building upon the English sense of fair play and an historical precedent in moral matters, to celebrate England day as a series of helping ones neighbour. The intention would be to provide one focal point activity e.g. clearing Hyde Park of litter and use this to launch a celebration of being English to help others without financial reward. This could range from gardening for a neihbour, or fetching shopping. The idea would be to exclude charitable donation and only include activities that result in human contact. Preferably with those outside the usual close cirlce of friends and family.\n\nWe belive that this would be a practical start to create a social glue to mend what we belive the move from an industrial heritage broke in England.",
