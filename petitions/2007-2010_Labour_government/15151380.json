            "background": "We should make an example of Sir Alex Ferguson by stripping him of his knigthood as his behavior is totally unacceptable for a man in his posistion. After all he won his knighthood for his contribution to British sport but yet he continues to conduct himself in an unsporting manor while using his knighthood to bully  those around him to his advantage.\nHe should be a role model to so many but only succeeds in being a shocking influence especially to the young. \nFinally he needs to learn how to chew with his mouth closed.\nA disgrace of a man not worthy of his Knighthood.",
