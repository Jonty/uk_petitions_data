            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There is an urgent need, to increase the sentences for Dog Fighting.It should not be left to the RSPCA, and a few specialist Police Units. I have put on No 10 a seperate petition, about Pet Theft, as small dogs, cats, and rabbits have be stolen, to use as training bait.pet-theft-law. The USA are updating their laws, and we should follow. This barbaric pastime should be imediatly addressed, as, the Dangerous Dog Act has been a failure. The RSPCA admits this, so someone with more teeth should be allowed to overseeing it. I feel the best way to stamp it out, is to resort to the new goverment practise, of giving rewards \nfor wistleblowing. The RSPCA are calling for more microchipping, do they not realize, anyone can, get hold of a scanner even stealing it and mutilate the animal by removing the chip. This practise is already happening. The Police must set up special units, and receive the training needed to bring successful prosicution. Or , the next thing will be Stallion Fighting, as is already seen in Third World Countries.\nPlease sign my petition and lobby your MP.",
