        "background": "MPs have been abusing the allowance system for far too long at the expense of the taxpayer.  The excuse that it is all done within the rules has worn very thin, members of the public would be sacked and maybe prosecuted if they behaved like MPs.  MPs should only be able to claim the expenses any other person is able to claim from their employers in the course of their employment, I cannot think of many employers that would pay for second homes, treating dry rot, moat clearing, big screens tvs, cleaners, gardners, toilet seats, stamp duty, mortage payments etc etc.  The whole system should be publicly debated and overhauled in accordance with the voting and tax paying public\u2019s wishes and managed and administered by an independent body and all control and influence over the system should be removed from MPs.",
