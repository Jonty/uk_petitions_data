        "background": "Gordon Brown sold a large proportion of the National Gold Reserves, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. The  moment these Reserves were sold, was the exact bottom of a 25 year Bear Market in Gold. This would appear to be an act of economic ineptitude and vandalism, as, since this sale, the price of Gold has traded at four times the value of this sale price, and is now considered to be in a multi year Bull Market.\nIt is requested that the Prime Minister explain fully to the Country, the  reasons why he perpetrated this apparent act of economic vandalism, and, if it was a direct result of incompetence, that he apologise to the nation and consider resigning.",
