            "background": "The Food Supplements Directive requires the European Union to establish maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The levels will apply throughout the whole of the European Union. Whilst this may remove barriers to trade between different member states, there is a real risk that the levels will be set so low as to make illegal many safe, popular and effective vitamin and mineral supplements that are currently available, and have been for over 40 years in the United Kingdom Market place.    The European Commission has delayed publishing its proposed figures to avoid causing panic to British and Irish consumers in the run up to the recent European Parliament elections and the forthcoming Referendum in Ireland, but they are expected to be published later this year.   We would urge The Prime Minister to personally intervene to lobby Europe to ensure that UK consumers do not lose their higher potency supplements, and a whole industry comprising of High Street shops, suppliers and manufacturers do not go out of business.",
