            "background": "We the undersigned believe that the level of monies paid by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) is disproportionate to the pain and suffering caused by criminal acts.\nA full review is needed when a system allows a criminal such as Peter Sutcliffe to receive a higher level of compensation than innocent people, such as Rob Thornton and Nick Horobin, suffering acts of violence while going about their day-to-day business.\nWe call upon the Govnernment to rectify this and allow fairer compensation for the innocent and stop payments to convicted criminals.",
