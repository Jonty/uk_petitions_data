            "background": "i found out today that the goverment has scrapped the bonus payment of \u00a3100 when students return to study at college. i belive that is unfair as many students in my college use the money for christmas presents and due to the credit crunch it will make it harder for students to pay for them. many students find it hard to get a job due to college hours so therefore getting an income is difficult. Students who only get \u00a310 a week will find it hard as well. eventhough they get so little money it doesnt mean that the parents will provide money for the students. thank you for reading i hope you can take this into action.",
