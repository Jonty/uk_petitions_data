            "background": "The People of the UK are being denied their right to have a say in the future of their county by this government by the refusal of this government to give the people of the UK a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. The people ask this government to take notice of the polls that show clearly that the people WANT a referendum. Therefore the signatories to this petition ask this government on behalf of the people of the UK to have a referendum. Such a referendum was promised by this government in their manifesto but is now being denied. The people also ask for this government to explain fully why they are withholding such right of the people of this country.",
