        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The River Aire is situated at the heart of Leeds city centre, and runs past many things such as student accomodation. This is a high risk to students and local residents as there aren't railings all the way along the side of the river. This needs to be changed. So far three accidents have happened in this river, ending in death. One of these accidents has deeply affected me so I am determined to make sure this doesn't happen again. Railings need to be put in place for the safety of people in Leeds. We can't let anymore accidents like the ones that habe already occured take place again. I am proposing that better safety precautions are put into place such as placing railings along all of the River Aire.",
