            "background": "i feel the time has come to go back to having standards values  respect for ones self and others i  feel the children of today don't have these, making them go to national service will get them off the streets teach them about humility respect self worth and team spirits they will  get paid, the dole money they get now for doing aboslutly nothing, but abuse and offend others is not helping.asbo's don't work this will get the lazy lot off the idea that the state owes them a living. abolishing the dole means more funds for the army, if people want dole money/ social services, they can do community service and help elderly people/ disabled , around their homes, eg, gardening,outdoor painting and all the stuff they can't do, this will give lazy people/ people with no thought for others a sense of comunity.  help to keep their comunity tidy, clean, crime free and fear free. i am 48 yrs old i feel the time to act is now, i don't want to see my grand children or children being killed or fightened by hooligans all parents it's okay for your kids to hate you whether you give them bounderies or not, and it's okay to feel guilty when you feel your always saying no! it's part of their growing up",
