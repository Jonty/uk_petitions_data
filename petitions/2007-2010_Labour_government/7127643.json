Physiotherapy plays an obviously essential role in her recovery but she tells me that she received only 3 visits from an N.H.S. physiotherapist and now pays privately (at \u00a340 a time!) for this.  She herself seems reasonably content with this arrangement but it has left me wondering what happens to people who (due to low-paid jobs - because they lacked the personal qualities to be considered for any others - or unemployment etc) CAN'T AFFORD this?  Quite apart from the effect it would have on the individual's recovery it might cost the N.H.S. more in the long run due to further treatment being needed as a result of lack of physiotherapy.  This is only one example; I'm sure there are many others.",
