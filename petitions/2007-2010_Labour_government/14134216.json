        "background": "There are thousands of people are currently unemployed due to the lengthy and inefficient CRB checking process. We appreciate that it is important to get people checked before employing them but it does not mean that people will have to suffer from this process. If you are living in Metropolitan Police area your CRB will take longer than others even some cases up to 5 months. This is absolute abuse of power and so frustrating for the people. We do not understand why does it need to take even 8 weeks before it become a priority? In this 8 weeks time people will lose at least two months pay, their family will suffer and they could even lose their property.\nWe would like to urge the PM to have a look at this process and get people out of their nightmare with the CRB checking with a more efficient and workable system.\nMany thanks",
