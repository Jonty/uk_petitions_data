        "background": "As it stands, women are not permitted to receive such an honour of 'Freeman of the City'. At this time, this is only carried through the male bloodline and misses women completely. As I believe Britain to be a nation of Equal Opportunities, why is this still the case? Women should be allowed to follow that tradition and carry the honour as a direct descendant of the first Freeman in the bloodline. Please sign this petition as it seems only right.",
