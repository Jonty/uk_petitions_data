            "background": "All other members of the United Kingdom have their own parliaments. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish. This means that they can look after their own issues. However, the English do not. This means that the UK government who are not neccessarily looking after the interests of English people are our only level of government. Therefore I ask for the creation an English Executive with the same powers as the Scottish Executive.",
