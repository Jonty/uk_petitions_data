            "background": "My son, along with 331 other children have been failed by Hackney's Learning trust. They have created an easily avoidable situation where they do not have enough secondary schools for their inhabitants. The consequences of their failure means that each year, an ever increasing amount of children have no access to local education. The councils solution to this is to phone up other boroughs to see if they can find schools that nobody in those boroughs want to go to.",
