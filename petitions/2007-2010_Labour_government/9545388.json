            "background": "Currently the imported New Zealand Anchor butter company is describing itself as \"The Free Range Butter Company\", and has hoardings with the mendacious statement \"Only Our cows are free to roam\".\nThis statement is wholly untrue. British farmers do not prevent their dairy herds from grazing freely. In New Zealand intensive grazing methods are in vogue, whereby cows are contained in a relatively small area, and moved on after a few days when that area of grazing is exhausted. This is done to be \"efficient\". It is not the same as free range because it is not free!\nBritsh animal wefare standards are without doubt the highest in the world, and British farmers and dairies do deserve slanderous allegations being levelled at them.",
