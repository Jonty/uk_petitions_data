            "action": "introduce a mortgage grant scheme for British home owners. This will produce a boost to the economy by giving the banks much wanted cash from repaid mortgages, consumers extra money in their pockets and provide a boost to the ailing housing industry.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If the government were to introduce a scheme whereby they would give grants to British tax paying home owners to pay off their home mortgages this would give the banks a lot of cash which they could then start lending to the small, and other, businesses that are finding it particularly difficult to get credit. The home owners would then not have expensive monthly mortgage bills and could spend and save more. This spending would boost the British retail industry. Savings would give the banks more money to lend. Having no mortgage would also enable people to improve their homes and to move house and this would revitalise the building industry. This would bring about the end of the recession.",
