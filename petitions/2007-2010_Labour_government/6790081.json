        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "RAF Ternhill is a small Royal Air Force station at Ternhill in Shropshire, near the towns of Newport and Market Drayton. The station, home of Volunteer Gliding Squadron 632, was a helicopter base but is now principally used as an outpost for the tri-service helicopter training establishment at RAF Shawbury. Training flights use the airfield (as do gliders at the weekends) but many of the buildings and some local Ministry of Defence housing (much of which was sold off, some people queueing for days to buy a property) are now part of the army base known as Clive Barracks (after Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive).\n\nIt is currently a military airfield but I would like to see it re-opened as a Civil Airfield\nThis would prove popular with aviation enthusiasts all over the country. And it would be very good for tourism and the local economy.",
