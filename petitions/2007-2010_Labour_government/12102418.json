            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "McKillop was the Chairman of RBS as it caused the biggest financial disaster in banking history. Before he left, together with Bob Scott, he approved an increase to the pension of the failed outgoing Chief Executive Sir Fred Goodwin from \u00a3416,000 to \u00a3703,000, a year. While similar behaviour may be welcoming to BP directors in similar circumstances, it is not in shareholders' or the country's interests. While McKillop's re-election is a proposal for BP's AGM on 16 April, it is unlikely that large shareholders, all mates together in the 'City', will vote against it, hence the call to the Prime Minister.",
