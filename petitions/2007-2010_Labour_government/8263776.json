There may have been a time when we could rely on MPs sense of honour to prevent them from ripping off the public.  The recent case and other undisclosed cases prove we no longer can.  It is time for the Prime Minister to bring this aspect of politics into the 21st Century by abolishing this shameful practice - applying to all MPs including existing members and their relatives with immediate effect.",
