New housing is going up everyday without bungalows for families with disabled people or infirmed pensioners. As we are all living longer surely we should build more suitable accommodation for our aging population. A housing association where I live has recently sold most of it stock of bungalows to pay for the new houses they are putting up but nothing has been planned to replace these bungalows. Why is it not law to build some bungalows on new housing estates to help the social housing with their aging and disabled population",
