            "background": "Ashchurch for Tewkesbury station used to have many direct train services to Birmingham , but currently , it is mainly served by a 2 - hourly service from Great Malvern & Bristol. Passengers wishing to travel to Birmingham usually have to travel south to Cheltenham Spa , change onto a northbound train , then return northwards , passing through Ashchurch without stopping. From December 2006 , some direct services to and from Birmingham were reintroduced , but the new Arriva Cross Country Franchise proposes to CUT these on weekdays from 7 to 4 northbound services and from 4 (5 on Fridays) to 2 Southbound services.\n\nWith a large car park , a wide catchment area and a bus service EVERY 15 MINUTES to Tewkesbury , doesnt cutting the already sparse train service make a mockery of your government's policy of encouraging integrated transport and taking more cars off the road?\n\nI call on you to use the DfT's powers to require Arriva to provide MORE , not LESS stops at Ashchurch for Tewkesbury station in the new Cross Country Franchise. With passenger numbers at the station rising already , along with the likely population/development growth , I believe that the demand will justify it.",
