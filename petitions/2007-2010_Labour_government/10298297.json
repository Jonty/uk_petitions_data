        "background": "Some cash rich companies are looking to reduce their staff costs by making redundancies and in turn paying the statutory minimum redundancy pay. \n\nFor those under 40 is one weeks pay for every year worked. So this can be a cheap way of reducing staff numbers.\n\nIf they were required to pay a greater and fairer amount e.g 1 months they would then think twice about throwing people on the dole queue.",
