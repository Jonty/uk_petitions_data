        "background": "I request the government to make people who are not citizan's of this country to pay for medical treatment when in this country, or provide insurance as we have to do when going abroad. To get back the 30 million in uppaid medical expenses that they have already had.\nRefuse treatment if they cannot pay or their country of origin refuses to pay. The NHS was designed for the British Citizan and not for universal use therefore they have a duty to protect it for our own citizan's and money should paid for treatment when other people from other countries use it. Only emergency treatment should be allowed the same as most other countries allow under agreed deals. No money no treatment should be the aim.",
