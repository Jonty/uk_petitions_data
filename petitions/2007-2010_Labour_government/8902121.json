            "background": "The government wants to cut child poverty but as far as I can see the only way you can do this is by halving the amount of tax the low-paid have to pay.\nSupposedly the average weekly earnings is just under \u00a3500. This figure is a complete joke as most low income families have to rely on their family tax credits to live and these seem to decrease year on year but the cost of living goes up and up.\nFamilies that earn under \u00a330,000 pounds per annum would fall into this category.",
