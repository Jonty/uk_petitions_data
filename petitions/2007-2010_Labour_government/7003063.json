            "background": "Following the recent murder of the mental health care worker, it is time for the Government to accept that the Mental Health Act needs to be amended. Many others have been murdered and will continue to be murdered unless people with paranoid schizophrenia are monitored more closely. The law should allow these people to be detained in a secure unit if there is any risk whatsoever that they may be a danger,either to themselves or to others. This should be done without their consent if necessary. Many of these murderers had committed violent crimes in the past. It is time to put the safety of the public ahead of the rights of potential murderers.",
