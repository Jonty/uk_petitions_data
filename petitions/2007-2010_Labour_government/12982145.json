        "background": "Recently Newquay, Cornwall has come under a lot of critisim over its groups of teens that flock upon the town every year. Local bars and off licenses work hard with the Police to stop them accessing alcohol, and yet they are being blamed for a number of alcohol related deaths that have happened this year. This is of course very sad, however blame should not be placed entirely on Newquay! Parents willingly send their youngsters down to Newquay knowing full well what their intentions for their stay will be -- binge drinking! It is also common knowledge that a lot of these teens are bringing their own booze with them, supplied by family before their journey down!It has been well televised that they bring their booze, I have seen footage of suitcases filled with booze alone! This must be stopped!",
