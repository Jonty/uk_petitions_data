            "background": "We are a non-profit organisation and with your help we aim to make a difference. Join us to petition for a 'Worldwide Remembrance Day' for animals that have been killed or have passed away so that they will never be forgotten.\n\nOur first goal is to rally your support with our petition with the government.\n\nWe are petitioning for a calendar day, a day where all of the wonderful animals that have passed away due to abuse, natural disasters, natural causes, in the line of duty or illness can be commemorated and cherished.  Our chosen day would be September 4th, an annual day of remembrance.\n\nSeptember is the month for World Animal Remembrance, November the 11th is National Remembrance 'poppy day', today, the birth of our association is St Patrick's Day. We deserve our day.  \n\nWe would like to be in a position where we can bring new Sanctuaries, Vetenarian Facilities, Pet Cemetries, Pet Rescue Centres etc to our communities thus creating new jobs and helping young people get involved with animals.\n\nHaving this day on the calendar will enable people all over the world to pay their respects on that given day.  We would also like to petition for the right to lay blue poppy wreaths on Remembrance Sunday.",
