            "background": "In December 2007 Brunstrom was widely reported for breaking in to N Wales police HQ. His actions were in clear breach of health and safety legislation. A short time later he appeared on the Today programme seemingly supporting the use of class A illegal drugs. This man is a disgrace to all honest, hard working police officers and brings the force into discredit and disrepute. He should be dismissed immediately.",
