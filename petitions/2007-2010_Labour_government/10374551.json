        "background": "I am sick and tired of having to read up on more fatalities on the deadly A1307. Although the road itself is not dangerous we need to bring awareness to the government that these deaths need to stop. By putting in speed cameras and bollards to narrow the road, it will deter users to exceed to speed limit and overtake dangerously. Sign today to make every bit of difference to lives of road users in Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex.",
