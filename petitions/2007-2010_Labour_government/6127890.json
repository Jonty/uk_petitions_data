        "background": "In July 2007 in Heage, Derbyshire a little boy aged 4 was killed by a runaway trailer which hit him as he walked with his Mum along the pavement.  His Mum was very seriously injured too.\n\nThe law currently does not require compulsory road-worthiness testing of trailers and does not require for a braking system on so called \"small trailers\" which can be just as lethal as \"big\" trailers.  \n\nImagine a trailer coming away from its towing vehicle at 60mph on a motorway and imagine how many lives could be lost as a result.\n\nWe believe the government must introduce a compulsory braking system and brake-away cables to activate the brakes in event that a trailer and its towing vehicle become disattached.\n\nA badly maintained trailer can be just as lethal as a badly maintained car or van so we believe that compulsory road worthiness testing should be carried out on all such vehicles.  \n\nThank you for your support.",
