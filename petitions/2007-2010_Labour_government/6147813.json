            "background": "Tom Harris awarding National Express the GNER franchise is utterly ludicrous as anyone who has suffered the indignity of travelling with National Express will testify. I'm not saying GNER wasn't ripe for some improvement but GNER's range of fares was starting to work well and I along with others use GNER constantly. The thought however - as from December the 9th - of having to suffer the National Express 'cattle herd mentality' is too awful to contemplate. GNER should have beeen supported. Tom Harris should be made to review his decision. \nPeter Woolnough",
