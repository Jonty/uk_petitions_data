            "background": "To tackle the increase in Obesity the government should provide a free pedometor to every school child in the UK.  Having once weighed 45 stone, I found walking was the only exercise I could do and it was FREE and low impact in nature. Measuring and recording my progress was a great way of losing weight and keeping on the move. Children love to be competitive and free patometers and in school schemes and inititives to encourage their use will be a step in the right direction to getting children moving and getting us all moving out of the obesity crisis for this generation and the next.",
