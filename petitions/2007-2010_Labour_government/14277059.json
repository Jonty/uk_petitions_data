            "background": "I had acute myeloid leukaemia in March 2009.  After treatment and remission I have had a relapse.  I was told that Azacitidine would put the cancer back into remission which would eventually save my life. My doctor has advised me to appeal and the relevant paperwork has been submitted. I have been told that this is my best chance of getting my cancer back into remission to enable a top up of my bone marrow and rid me of this disease. If this drug was on the NHS, then myself and others who are going through the same trauma would benefit from it.  I have been told that this drug will cost \u00a33,000 a dose and in my case I would need 4 doses.  \u00a312k is a small fee for a drug which can save my life and the life of others.",
