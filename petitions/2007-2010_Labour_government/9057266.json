            "background": "Having seen many petitions regarding local post office closures. Knowing each are a small business that contracts to the Royal Mail services. I simply ask that any public money (Taxpayers) be withdrawn from all aspects of a company that is about to be a 100% PLC and that any money that taxpayers used to subsidies such a takeover should be given back to the people. Lastly I ask that all representatives that have been involved in this think tank to fully disclose their personal gains and losses from this deal.",
