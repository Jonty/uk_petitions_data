            "background": "There are lots of different prices of fuel on our forecourts. Those that are cheap such as the Supermarket chains and those such as private suppliers on the highway. Those on the lesser travelled roads take advantage of this and charge a higher rate. The cheaper forecourts are causing a more aggresive atmosphere and cutomer causing safety issues, a packed forecourt causes traffic to wait on local roads causing bigger safty concerns. Sign this petiion for action on this and prevent these issues getting futher out of control. A petition to regulate or watchdog our fuel suppliers to giving a base price. I'm sure if one company can sell at this cost the others can to. Many thanks.",
