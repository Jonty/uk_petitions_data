        "background": "Having seem the announcement of this in the News on 7th October I am VERY concerned that cuts in public services will be inevitable - how else is this bail-out to be funded? - at a time when many people are facing financial uncertainty anyway.  It seems obvious to me that the main beneficiaries of this move will be those with substantial amounts of savings (since the first \u00a335,000 in savings has already been guaranteed) so in my very strong opinion it would be only fair for those in this situation to lose out as a result of any public spending cuts necessitated by this and for those of us, like myself, with few or no savings to have OUR right to these public services safeguarded.",
