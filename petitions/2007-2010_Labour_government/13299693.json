            "action": "request the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to write to the BBC Trust pointing out that many English are finding the institutional anti-English racism of the BBC offensive and unacceptable.   Further, the Secretary of State should be asked to call on the BBC to examine its corporate conscience, its values and its editorial judgement to help it understand why it has such a problem in treating the English with proper respect.   The Prime Minister should via the Secretary of State ask the BBC to stop treating the English as second class citizens in their own country.  The BBC should be reminded that we English constitute the majority of both its licence fee payers and of its domestic audience, and that our interests and concerns should as a matter of both principle and policy, be treated with priority and respect.",
