            "background": "Running a furnished holiday let business, such as static caravans, needs a great deal of hard work, especially when the business has several holiday units and such businesses contribute substantially to the economy. It deserves the same tax status as any other trade. If changes are imposed by the Government/EU they should at least only relate to those who operate no more than one unit. If the changes are introduced several businesses may cease trading.",
