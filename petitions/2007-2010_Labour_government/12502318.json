            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Spitting in public has always been a dirty and disgusting habit, but with the recent swine flu outbreak it really is urgent that the Government outlaws this filthy and unhygienic practice. Sadly it seems to have become a common site in our streets now. It is unclear if spitting in public if already an offence, but if it is, it certainly doesn't seem to be enforced by the police. Therefore this petition seeks to clarify if public spitting is already an offence - if it is, the petitioners call for all police forces to be ordered to enforce the law immediately and thoroughly. If is not, then this petition calls for urgent legislation to make it a specific offence and for police forces to be made to enforce it immediately it passes. In the meantime, the Government should consider if spitting could be covered under existing offences and if so, to order police forces to enforce it urgently. This is a matter of public health as well as anti-social behaviour and it needs addressing.",
