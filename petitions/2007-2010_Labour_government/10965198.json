            "background": "The Tyne and wear metropolitan area used to have all its bus services under the control of Nexus. It had one of the worlds best integrated transport systems. You could travel on all buses and metro trains with just one ticket. Furthermore, buses were designed to act as feeders to the metro system, with buses transporting passengers to the metro station, and bus schedules tightly integrated with metro schedules.\n\nHowever, along came Thatcher and de-regulation of the buses. Now, buses compete with, rather the complement the metro system. To travel on both a bus and a metro requires you to buy two tickets, or pay a premium for a ticket which is valid on both forms of transport. Buses do not meet with trains, and the bus companies constantly cut services which do not produce their desired profit margins.\n\nIt is obvious that de-regulation does not work- bus usage has in many cases fallen drastically since deregulation, whereas in London, where buses are still regulated, usage has increased by 55%. \n\nFor once, we ask the government to listen to the people of Tyne and wear, and give us the integrated transport system we deserve!",
