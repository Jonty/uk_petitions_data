The EU does not cover the whole continent, it does not represent the whole of the continent and the British Government's Europe Minister doesn't form policy on the whole continent of Europe.\n\nThe Prime Minister, the British government and the EU itself should stop claiming the whole continent for the EU.  The EU should not be referred to as \"Europe\" and the Europe Minister should be called the EU Minister.  Similarly, the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights should be known as the EU Court of Justice and the EU Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe Prime Minister should issue guidance on the use of the word \"Europe\", rename the Europe Minister to the EU Minister and petition the EU to name their institutions appropriately.",
