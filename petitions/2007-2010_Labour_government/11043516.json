        "background": "On November 10, 2008 news broke that Britain's only specialist police human trafficking unit is to be shut down after two years because of a lack of funding.\n\nA Scotland Yard spokesperson said \"From April 2009, that money will no longer be available, and the Met does not have the additional funds to keep the team running in its current format whilst meeting other existing policing requirements.\"\n\nThis unit saves lives! It helps to rescue trafficked victims who are often held in violent situations and raped in brothels.\n\nWhy is it that the government can aid greedy banks from the credit crunch but it cannot help to keep this extremely important unit open. We will not sit back and allow trafficking in the UK. \n\nPlease please help us to keep this unit open. If it means more resources, funding, fund raising, re-organising - whatever means possible. \nSave Britain;s only specialist police human trafficking unit.",
