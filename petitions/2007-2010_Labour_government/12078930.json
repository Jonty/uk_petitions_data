As it stands you can easily make out brands and styles of clothing, hairstyles, hair colour, entering/exiting private residencies, identify what store you shop at from the bags you carry & identify you from the group of people you are photographed with etc.\n\nWe can clearly understand the need for this technology to assist travel, but question additional use of innocent bystander's images. Technology such as this is open to abuse and simply blurring or blacking out the ENTIRE individual would solve the problem. \n\nIt would be more suitable to not be able to identify sex, race, age nor any of the above mentioned identifying features. Currently invasive but easily fixable.",
