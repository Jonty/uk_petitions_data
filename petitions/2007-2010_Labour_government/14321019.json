            "background": "As gritting salt is currently the only means of de-icing our roads and pavements, it seems dangerous to send 30 tonne lorries from hundreds of miles away down roads which are currently icy or covered in snow causing majour delivery delays because of the limmited amount of lorries that can be filled at anyone time. \nSalt Union who is currently the UK's only suppliers is situated next to the Westcoast mainline in Cheshire. With trains standing a better chance of getting through in the current weather conditions can also be filled and under way with mnimal distruption, distributing salt at maybe 750 tonnes in one go to key locations around the UK would seem the far more sensible option. \nSign this petition if you agree that the Govenment should put plans in to action to change the way in which we get our gritting salt.",
