            "background": "NHS Tayside stopped running a full-time maternity unit at Perth Royal Infirmary a few years ago. It has been replaced by a midwife led unit, which is great, but why should mothers travel 22 miles for the care they require during childbirth. They are transferred to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, away from their family, their home and THEIR hospital. The board of directors stated at the time it was to centralise all services to Ninewells but it was only to cut costs.",
