        "background": "mr brown, i would like you to table a motion to make it illegal to claim any benefits for more than 1 wife if you are in a polygamous marriage. This practice is illegal in the UK and I would like you to table this motion asap and remove the option for immigrants being able to claim benefits for up to 4 wives in our country and that this practice is not allowed to continue. My money, as a British Taxpayer, should not be used to subsidise an islamic marriage that in the eyes of UK law is illegal.",
