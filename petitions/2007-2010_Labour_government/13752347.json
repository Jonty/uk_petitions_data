        "background": "Several statistics show that libraries are in decline with many branches being shut down to curb costs.\n\nPlan' has been set up as a platform for the public to voice their opinions and mould their libraries to better suit their needs to prevent libraries needing to be shut down and confirm them as an information hub within the community.\n\nIdeas have been sectioned into three categories: expand, reinvent and reinstate. This will ensure that all views and opinions are accommodated and nobody will be left unheard.\n\nOn the 14th December all categories will be analysed and presented to give an accurate account of what the public's idea for the future of public libraries is.",
