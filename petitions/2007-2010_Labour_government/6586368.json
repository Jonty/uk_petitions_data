            "background": "Despite the fact that it is illegal, live cats and dogs are being used as bait for shark-fishing in many places throughout the world by fishing communities who believe they are above the law.  \n\ne.g. on the French island of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean, fishermen use live dogs and cats as bait for sharks.  The dogs and cats have hooks passed through their snouts or through the tendons in their legs and the hooks are attached to lines and rods. The hapless animals are then tossed into the water where their struggles attract sharks.\n \nI ask the British Government to publicise this appalling cruelty and condemn it as an outrage, and impose sanctions on any country where this takes place.",
