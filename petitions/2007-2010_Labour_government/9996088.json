            "background": "Petrol stations accross the country are taking advantage of what is an extremely bad economical time for the price of oil. Many garages are charging up 10p more per litre than others to gain a quick profit and as each day passes the prices are starting to spiral out of control. We need petrol prices to be capped at a certain amount above the oil price so that whilst garages can still make a profit, they cannot take advantage of british motorists.",
