            "background": "Sir Thomas Legg's excellent enquiry and report found 373 MPs had overclaimed or misused expenses, and were ordered to repay money back.  The projected income is just over \u00a31million, but the cost of the enquiry is approx \u00a31.2million.  Therefore, it has cost more for the enquiry at the expense of the UK taxpayer.\n\nThe enquiry was meant to clean up the Houses of Parliament and give greater transparency and accountability of MPs.  Given that the expenses fiasco was due to their claims (some illegally), then MPs should pay the full cost of the enquiry and report.  The 373 MPs should pay the costs in proportion to their share of the \u00a31million excessive expenses.",
