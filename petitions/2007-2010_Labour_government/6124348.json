            "background": "Planning permission has been given by Birmingham City Council to a developer to build (currently) two blocks of flats on the site of the old Tower Ballroom on the water's edge of Edgbaston Reservoir.  This land is currently designated to be used only for leisure purposes and is within the natural boundary of Edgbaston Reservoir which is a historical location and SINC - Site of Importance for Nature Conservation.  There is no other housing within the boundary of the site.\n\nThe Friends of Edgbaston Reservoir believe that building flats or houses on the historical and tranquil site is wholly inappropriate and instead, the plot should be cleared and grassed over as it originally was, or alternatively used for a visitor's centre or other public amenity.  \n\nIf you support our campaign to stop housing development on the edge of The Reservoir and would prefer the site to be returned to nature, please sign our petition (and pass it on to your friends).  Thank you",
