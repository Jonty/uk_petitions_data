            "background": "I strongly disagree with the early release of two men who comitted such abhorrent crime. The child suffered so much before they killed him they should stay in prison until the sentence has been completed.\nI am angry that the government feel it is right to use taxpayers money to fund a new life for these men in Austrailia!! No hardship there! I totally object to my taxes being used for this. I am very happy to continue to pay for these men to stay behind bars.\nGod Bless Jamie Bulger.",
