        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We acknowledge Lady Thatcher\u2019s achievement as the first woman to serve as Prime Minister, but feel that this is insufficient to accord her a state or ceremonial funeral.\n\nWe draw attention to the economic destruction that Lady Thatcher\u2019s policies wrought on our country, including record inflation, high interest rates and devastating rates of unemployment. \n\nWe also note the decimation of communities across the country as a direct result of Lady Thatcher\u2019s policies, and we note that many communities have still not recovered the economic prosperity they enjoyed before her intervention.\n\nGiven that others who have received state funerals have defended working people from conquerors and that Lady Thatcher sought only to conquer working people, we believe that any state funeral for her would taint the value of the state funeral.\n\nWe particularly note that Lady Thatcher claimed there was \u201cno such thing as society\u201d, and as such we believe that society has no place in formally acknowledging her death.",
