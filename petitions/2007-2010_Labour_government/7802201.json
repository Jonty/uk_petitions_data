            "background": "I must object to the reported suspension of Robert Kazinsky, the actor who plays Sean Slater, from Eastenders. \n\nThis is ridiculous. Most 20-somethings will have a story in their closet that is far worse than this tame story. The BBC and Eastenders need to modernise and accept sexual drive, a sense of adventure, and a sense of humour. It would be ABNORMAL for a man of his age not to have such a story in his closet. The girl who sold her story to the People was clearly happy that this has happened. Robert must be realising he has to be seen to act as a saint by the media from now on, his life in a goldfish bowl - that just isn't natural. I will miss his character - one of the most interesting. I shall boycott Eastenders unti his character is reinstated and encourage others to do likewse.",
