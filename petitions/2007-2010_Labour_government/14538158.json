            "background": "Religious belief endows the believer with rights in law above those of the non religious (witness faith schools, employment law, Bishops in the House of lords etc.) with no requirement for the religious to produce evidence that the beliefs are based anywhere in fact, or even rational philosophical thought.\n\nReligion should have the same status as belief in Fairies and alien abduction, given the zero evidence.\n\nBased on this, and our traditional tolerance of religion, we (Britons) would of course not discriminate against anyone's belief more than anyone else's, but would be free to \"treat those impostors just the same\". We can then have a good mock about the wacky things some gods enjoy or recommend, such as genocide, rape and avoiding shellfish.\n\nThe government should either allow anyone to declare any bizarre personal belief, on an equal footing and enjoying the same protection as religion, or remove all such protection from all such personal beliefs where these are based on no evidence.",
