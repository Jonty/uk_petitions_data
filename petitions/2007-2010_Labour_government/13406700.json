This is not a far right-type protest or an anti-islam one however I can say that our children are becoming evermore Americanised. I hereby call on Gordon Brown to bring back Britishness. I would like to add that I think that to avoid a far right-like take on Britishness then our children should be educated one our country, past, present and future. This will give them an educated view of their country and also they would have more respect for others around them, young and old. \n\nThankyou",
