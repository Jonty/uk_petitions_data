Please supervise the recruitment practices of independent companies and faciliate greater ease with which money can be paid back. Many people have different schemes and having recommended that the public take out their own funds to provide for old age, the British government should still have some vicarious liability in ensuring those schemes are legitimate. What happens if individuals do not make it to old age ? What happens if the advice is wrong ? What happens if you wish to change your mind ?",
