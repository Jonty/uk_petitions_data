            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current licensing scheme does not go far enough. It still allows private vehicle clampers to charge individual fees- before a clamped motorist can appeal. It also allows vehicles being removed at non transparent costs before a case can be reviewed. An independent review is also not required. Appeals are mostly dealt with by the clampers themselves.\nI therefore propose to include in current legislation to:\n# limit clamping charges to the maximum fine that would be charged in a similar situation by public traffic enforcement\n# require an independent appeals procedure (outside the clamping industry).\n# prohibit clamping companies to charge motorists before an appeal has been rejected by an independent body (in line with public traffic fine procedures). This could as a result prohibit clamping at all. Therefore:\n# if vehicles *have* to be moved as part of parking management activities, companies must be required to only incur minimal costs (e.g. by moving a vehicle to the nearest alternative space). Costs must be fully transparent.\n# Illegally clamped motorists must have a statutory right to reclaim all first and secondary costs within three weeks.",
