        "background": "After becoming unemployed I had to wait 39 weeks before the government stepped in and undertook to cover the interest payments on my mortgage.\n\nAs it turn out the difference between the interest payments and the rent for a similar property is no more than \u00a310 a week.\n\nIf I was in the renting market them my housing costs would have been met from the moment I signed on as unemployed.\n\nThis policy is  effectively increasing the debt burden on people and is unjust.  How can someone that is getting \u00a360 a week be expected to pay \u00a3300 a month in order to prevent them form becoming homeless when a council or private tenant can have a similar sum paid.",
