So of course the public should, at the very least be warned of the side effects of these products. This could save the NHS a fortune and make the UK a healthier place. (When I was at college cleaners were spraying an air freshener in all the rooms which contained the warning \"If this product comes in contact with eyes seek immediate medical advice\" !)",
