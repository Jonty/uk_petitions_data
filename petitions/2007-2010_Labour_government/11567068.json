            "background": "Many vehicles imported into the UK are from countries where they drive on the right, so their cars have a left-hand-drive configuration to suit their roads. When they are officially imported and sold in the UK, obviously they are converted to right-hand-drive to suit our roads. However some manufacturers are failing to adjust the windscreen wipers at the same time, so that they are still set up for a left-hand-drive. This means the windscreen in front of the driver has a large section which is missed, which is very dangerous. There are major manufacturers who are selling current models with this set-up in the UK - this is unacceptable and dangerous. Please make it law that all cars sold in the UK have their windscreen wipers set up correctly so the driver can see properly.",
