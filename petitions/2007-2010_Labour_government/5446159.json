        "background": "With the country being at its highest alert to terrorism yet again,we should now ban the wearing of the burka and niqab in public places for security reasons. It is all becoming too prominent in this society today, and sometimes I and I\u2019m sure the majority of people do wonder who is behind that veil. When you think about one of the 21/7 bombers who managed to flee London wearing the burka after failing to blow up an Underground train, it\u2018s quite frightening really.  This could quite easily happen again.",
