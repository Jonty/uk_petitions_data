This should refer to the original and core values and direction promoted by the Qu\u2019ran itself and it\u2019s originator Mohammed. The debates should be free to make frank assessments that seek to preserve western values relating to democracy, personal freedoms and should make judgments and lead to recommendations and if necessary laws which are in the interest of the British people; in particular the indigenous population.'",
