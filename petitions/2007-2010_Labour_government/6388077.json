            "background": "The Appointments Commission rules state that nominees must have a strong and personal commitment to the principles and highest standards of public life. They should also demonstrate outstanding  personal qualities, in particular, integrity and independence!\nHas Tony Blair ever demonstrated any of these qualities in support of the country?\t\t\nBecause of his arrogance and resentment to the House of Lords, the British Judiciary, his total disregard towards the British  people and the absolute loss of respect by the electorate of most politicians, has he really done enough for this country to merit this automatic award?\nUnfortunately, writing this article is insufficient. Have I totally misjudged the situation, am I alone in the foregoing, or, are there other like minded individuals who feel the same?  \nComplaining and/or moaning about his award after the event is too late as he will be beyond reach by then.\nIf there are other like minded people out there, well, how about it, do you agree with me. Don\u2019t just sit and do nothing: do something. This could be your only chance to improve the standard of politicians. \nDoes Tony Blair deserve a Knighthood/Peerage? \nSupport a NO AWARD action",
