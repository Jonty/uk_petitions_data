            "background": "At present fathers expecting a baby are only allowed two weeks paid leave and two weeks unpaid. The first few weeks of a babies life is very vital for bonding to occure between parent and child. Often it is the father who misses out on this and the mother who needs that emotional support from her partner has to do without. Both mother and child need that support, which could help to cut down postnatal depression dramatically and thus creating an even sronger bond within the family unit,which is strongly needed in todays society.",
