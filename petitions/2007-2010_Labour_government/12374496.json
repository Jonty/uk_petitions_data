            "background": "This issue came to my attention when following the sad death of my Daughter\u2019s first child in childbirth she and her husband recently went to purchase a headstone for their son\u2019s grave.  They were surprised that they were asked to pay VAT on the price as am I.  Vat is 0% on children\u2019s clothes and on School meals but bereaved parents have to pay at the full rate for funeral expenses and memorials for their lost children.\nTo me this would seem an anomaly, given the exemption for other items and I wonder if consideration should be given to making funeral expenses and memorials for under 16\u2019s being zero rated.  Cost would be an issue but the total amount of revenue loss involved would be relatively small.  I feel that the Vat on memorials and funeral expenses is unfortunate, an extra expense at sad and emotional time for those involved.",
