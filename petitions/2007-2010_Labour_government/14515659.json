            "background": "Judges are servants to their communities; they are in place to ensure criminals are given just sentences, and to make their communities feel safer and united; however all too often this doesn\u2019t happen. Too many judges make decisions that do not reflect what their local communities or the wider UK society believes to be moral. Giving UK citizens the right to vote in judges they trust to represent themselves and UK law, will engage people more with law and order, giving communities a sense of pride in their judges and further develop democracy at a time when people are feeling more and more disconnected with the decision makers.",
