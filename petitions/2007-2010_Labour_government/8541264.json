            "background": "We need to rethink our prison strategy and go back to basics. No perks or comforts.\nBasic but functional accomodation, and by that I mean earn your mattress with good behaviour, not earn the use of a playstation 2 with good behaviour. Get what I mean? plain boring but nutritionally balanced food, take away little luxuries like sugar for instance. Only cold water. Early starts each morning, followed by hard graft. You know, make the place minus 10 stars instead of the current 5 stars they get now. You get the idea. Take away ALL comforts. Make prison life very difficult. Make it the LAST place anyone would want to end up.",
