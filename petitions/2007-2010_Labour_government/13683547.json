Neither houses nor people  can be built on sand ~ the inevitable outcome of this Government's position in totally subjugating children in favour of the 3Rs. Children need to be secure and safe ~ look at Maslow (with a social conscience.)  Acknowledge that no amount of market forces, competitive sport, prescriptive curricula, targets or market forces have ever or will ever lead to what the Government should be about.  Ask yourself: Why do we have so much misery, teenage pregnancy, loutish behaviour and general under-achievement as a nation?  It's ultimately down to teachers who daily engage in unarmed combat with children - in the sheep and goats game that is \"education.\" For God's sake Wake Up!",
