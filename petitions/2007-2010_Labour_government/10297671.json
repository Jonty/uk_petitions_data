            "background": "Nursing students already work up to 40 hours a week on the wards for a small bursary that is well below the minimum wage.  Those who are not helped financially by their parents (the majority) have to work additional hours to make ends meet, leaving them exhausted. This is neither safe for them or the patient's they are caring for. This is disgraceful giving the fact that they are providing a vital service.",
