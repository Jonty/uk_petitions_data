            "background": "this is to lift the unfair ban on cold calling sales in the personal injury market. This ban was introduced without consulting anyone who used cold calling and only affects P.I. companies the rest of the world is allowed to carry on and this is unfair and a restriction of trade. There is also the fact that more than 80% of claims go unclaimed as the average person in the street is unaware that they are entitled to be compensated, by banning cold calling which was informative to the general public these people are no longer being informed of what they are entitled to. also we believe that this ban is a basic infringment of civil freedoms and is discriminatory as it only applies to one type of industry.",
