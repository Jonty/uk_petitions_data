            "background": "Riding on the public highway is very dangerous for 2 wheeled\nvehicles anyway, having to stick to a 31MPH speed limit makes\nit even more dangerous, when you travel on a 40MPH limit it can be terrifying, \n\nwith this scaryness comes the surprise of another speed breaking car to push you around.\nwhen the 50cc engine is restricted the Ryder is giving it a lot of throttle and the engine is reving 8-12RPM and only going 31MPH because thats how fast they can legally go, if you were\nallowed to unrestricted it the engine would be going 8-12RPM and doing 40-60.",
