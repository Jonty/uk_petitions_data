            "background": "MANY Personal search agents who carry out property searches knowingly provide false information, charge clients for searches that have not even been carried out, charge clients for insurances they don't need, (by lying on the reports about issues that do not relate to the property in question) but appear to be 'untouchable'. Property searches should be carried out by the Councils and Utilities companies ONLY as Personal Search Agents are dishonest and should be banned. The Government does not care that people are being ripped off by PS Agents.  The OFT, TS and police are not interested in stopping this fraud, despite much documentary evidence I sent to support my claims. MAKE SURE YOUR HIP searches have been compiled by the COUNCIL as they are far more honest. SIGN TO BAN THESE FRAUDULENT COMPANIES and protect YOUR interests and not their huge profits from dishonest means",
