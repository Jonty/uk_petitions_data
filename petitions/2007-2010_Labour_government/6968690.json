Becouse the minority have to much political control, they make mountines out of mole hills, costing the taxpayer and the country millions, and at the same time pulling apart the fabric of our society. Just becouse a few nut-cases know how to use the media to their advantage should not mean that the majority should suffer. Us normal folk are holding a lot of confussed feelings at the moment, and are finding it harder and harder to express our feelings. Stop this political correctness and bring back some common sence in to goverment.",
