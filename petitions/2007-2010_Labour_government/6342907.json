            "background": "Certain disability allowances such as the Disability Living Allowances are not paid to UK residents who move within the EU.  \nA relative of mine has developed a terminal illness called M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease which prevents him from walking any great distance without receiving severe dizzy spells and falling over. One cause of a dizzy spell attack is poor lighting levels such as grey cloud, a condition our country is well known for and as such he relocated to a hotter country within the EU to aid his quality of life only to find he is no longer entitled to the benefit.\nIt is wrong that life served contributors to the welfare system have benefits removed just for relocating out of the UK but within the EU.",
