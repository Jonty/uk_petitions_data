            "background": "rumours and news have been heard about government plans to introduce an even larger class of HGV onto british roads. this will only increase motorway congestion and cause chaos on more minor roads. by encouraging heavy haulage firms to switch back to using the (nearly empty) railways, and re-opening closed sections of track, pollution and congestion would be reduced and efficiency would increase (how often to trains get stuck in traffic jams?). each loaded cargo train carries the equivalent of up to 100 lorries and goes directly from terminus to terminus without adding to road congestion, whilst creating far less exhaust emissions than 100 trucks",
