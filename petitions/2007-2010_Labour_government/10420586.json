        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The A43 Northampton to Kettering is a serious safety hazard where dozens of people have been killed or seriously injured, more dangerous than the M1.  A uniform speed limit for all vehicles will reduce the frustration and confusion - making the road safer and increasing capacity.  The speed limit should be enforced by averaging cameras and a double white line to prevent overtaking.  These measures are quick, cheap and simple - dualling the road will take ten years and be enormously expensive - dozens more preventable deaths and injuries will occur while dualling is going on.",
