            "background": "While living at many residences throughout my time I have had a series of interactions with many internet services providers. While being promised one thing and in almost every case being given something different its about time these corrupt companies are brought into Line. Lord Mandelson wants to crack down on internet piracy but these companies are just as to fraudulent in their practices as many of the internet pirates. If you want to sort something out this needs to be handled. I urge you for your support.\n\nIts about time this issue is drawn upon, many have tried before including the Gadget Show, trying to make ISP's admit their foul practices. Improper speeds and sleezy marketing tactics including things such as cheap first 3 month introductory offers then large price increases.\n\nHelp make the net a better place for everyone.",
