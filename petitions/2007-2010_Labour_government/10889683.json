            "background": "Because insurance is assigned to both car and person these rules are abused by insurers. \nLet's say You have one car but 2 drivers - You need to pay almost twice and one policy at any time is not in use [can both drivers drive same car at the same time??? NO]\n\nInsurance should be assigned to CAR whilst it covers for damage caused by it - regardless if anybody is driving it or not [i.e. car parked on a slope moved and hit something due to handbrake failure whilst nobody was inside].\n\nIn this system car owner [who get discounts for no claims] is responsible in terms of these discounts if car is involved in collision whilst somebody else driven under his/her permission.\nThis will persuade people to let their\ncars driven only by responsible drivers [i.e. if somebody drive to a pub and let to drive back the person who did not drinked alkohol or in case of long journeys drivers can change to improve SAFETY]",
