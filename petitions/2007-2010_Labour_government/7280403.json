        "background": "65 to 70 pence per litre is fuel duty, this is over an 100% taxation rate, of which only a small fraction is used to improve road systems in the UK. This is one of the highest levels of fuel taxation in the world and is unacceptably high. Reducing fuel tax by 15 to 20 pence would make this tax more acceptable to the everyday motorist who views today's fuel prices as ridiculous.",
