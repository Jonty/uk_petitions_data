            "background": "Having just seen \"power to the people\" programme on t.v(I know, it's a shame a t.v programme had to do it), I realised that this country needs a drastic shake-up in how we treat the older generations of our society, (esp, as our international counter-parts find it a duty to look after their own), really should make us ashamed, that firstly we have an institution of \"care\" homes(how ironic!), and secondly, we would choose those over caring for our own.\n\nI ask the government/P.M to seriously think about having a day to celebrate our elders, who, lets face it, none of us would be here if it wasn't for them.\nAnd furthermore, consider introducing some kind of community scheme to get younger generations to mix in with the more mature of our communities, as I'm sure both parties would benefit.\n\nI know this may seem like some dreamt up idea, but seriously, the youth in society need to learn respect and need practical/educational opportunites, while elders need a helping hand.",
