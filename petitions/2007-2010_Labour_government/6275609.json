Today a \"goth\" from Bacup Lancashire has died after being in a coma following several \"youths\" assaulting her and her partner. The youths were all aged under 18 and while the trials have not happened a lenient punishment is bound to be handed down instead of murder. This needs to change so that children understand that they ARE responsible for their own actions.",
