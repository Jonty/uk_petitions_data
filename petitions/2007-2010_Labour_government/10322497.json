            "background": "We all see people who have never worked in their lives living the \"good life\", with expensive cars and homes etc. Give the police more powers to stop these people and ask them a few simple questions - for example, \"where did you get the \u00a350,000 to buy this car, where did you get the \u00a31,000,000 to buy the home you live in?\" Bottom line is the police know who the crooks are, they just don't have the power to confiscate assets and question people the way they used to, because of all the do-gooders out there. Crime could be drastically reduced if a few simple rules were followed. If you have never worked, have not inherited a fortune, never won the lottery etc, then your assets (obviously gained through crime) are taken away from you. To hell with their human rights",
