            "background": "To promote a UN Treaty amongst all its members prohibiting the use of mass military weapons such as rockets,airbombs,aircraft machine guns,mines and artillery or mortars against or among civilian populations or areas ;that all these weapons are only licit when used against armed forces of another state or organised army, and never to be used against resistance in predominantly civilian inhabited areas.Weapons to suppress guerrilla resistance may only include hand anti-personnel weapons and no high explosives.\nWe are horrified by the willingness of a government such as Israel to use deliberate disproportionate force in Gaza or South Lebanon where innocent bystanders are inevitably if not deliberately killed in large numbers through sheer proximity and inability to hide or escape the violence.",
