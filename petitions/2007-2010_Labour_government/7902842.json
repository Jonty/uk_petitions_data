Waste incinerators are known to produce fewer stack emissions than many industrial chimneys (checkable on the Env Agency website), and are one of the cleanest and most sustainable methods of disposing of non-recyclable household waste.  When combined with district heating systems (e.g. Sheffiled, Nottingham)the environmental benefits are significant.",
