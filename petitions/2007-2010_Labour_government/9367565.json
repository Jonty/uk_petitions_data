            "background": "Daylight Robbery of low paid working people by the Norwich Union endowment cream off, condoned by the government who allow this to go unchallened. The government should step in now & make these companies pay up. Why were you voted in to government? To ensure things like this do not happen! Where do you expect people to find the shortfall in thier endowment policies. I am disgusted and have lost the little confidence I had in our government when they sit back and do nothing. Whilst we have to look for ways to cut our shopping bills even further. Please join the real world for five minutes and see what we see and feel what we feel. We need Robin Hood to step in around now because we sure are poor and getting poorer by the minute as employers are NOT keeping up with the cost of living contrary to what you might see on TV or read in the papers.  You wouldn't last the week between mortgage, car, utilities food, insurance, and as for going out or holidays Forget it you can't afford it! Want a healthier happier Nation ensure fresh produce prices are kept in check and allow the working people enough money to exist!",
