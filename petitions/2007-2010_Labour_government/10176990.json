        "background": "We want the recognition that the unitary  areas around Greater Manchester are in the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire for historic and ceremonial purposes. We want the traditional boundaries re -instated and this to be recognised on maps and the abolition of the notion of Greater Manchester once and for all. However we still accept that the metropolitan area would exist to provide services such as the transport infrastructure and the emergency services; and that the unitary authorities exist in a similar way to the old county boroughs, but recognise that these are in Cheshire or Lancashire.",
