I have a lot of ID, and feel that in future years, I shall have to update my PASSPORT, DRIVING LICENSE, and probably  MY ID CARD, another item to update.  I have enough ID, and I feel it is the governments fault that this is happening, and we are being penalised for it.  Get some control on who you let in this country, and is living here. Then we wouldn't need all this ID,and photo updating.",
