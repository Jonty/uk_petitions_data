The driver who the police have identified as the driver cannot be prosecuted because of the time restrictions under the current law.  \nThis is appalling and this piece of legislation needs to be changed.\n\nIt can take the police several months to gather their evidence to bring a prosecution and when that time limit has expired it leaves the family devastated that no action can be taken even though there is overwhelming evidence.\n\nThe Law needs to change.",
