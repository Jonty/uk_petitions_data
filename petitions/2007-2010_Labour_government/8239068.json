            "background": "There are more and more immigrants coming into the UK to live and work.\nIt becomes a problem when they can not speak and read and write the language.\nFor health and safety in the workplace the prime minister must make it \"LAW\" that for anyone to work and live in the UK they must be able to read and write English. They must be able to understand the safety signs and procedures in this country. We have one of the best health and safety cultures in the world. Safety in the workplace is the responsibility of each and every person, if some of the people in the workplace dont read and speak and most importantly, understand the language, they then put the lives of their colleagues at risk, making them a liability. We urge the Prime Minister to make this LAW that any company, employing foreign nationals, have a duty of care to their employees to make sure everyone understands and speaks the language to read and understand the health and safety implications in the workplace.",
