            "background": "There is no firm proof that compulsory seat belts save the number of lives claimed, and statistics which are used in support of the laws are flawed and subject to influence by other factors, such as variance of drunken driving.\n\nThere is, however, a large body of evidence which shows that in many types of accident a seat belt actually CAUSES injuries and death, and there are many incidents where an occupant has survived or escaped serious injury only because he was NOT buckled up.  \n\nThe government does not have the right to play Russian Roulette with people's lives, mandating the use of a device in the hope that it will save more lives than it takes. \n\nEven if seat belts were always beneficial and never detrimental, it is not the government's place to force them on people \"for their own good.\"  \n\nIn a free society, people have the right to decide for themselves what protective measures, if any, they take for their own well-being.",
