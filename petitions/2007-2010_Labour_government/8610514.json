            "background": "Rather than setting boundaries from parent's pay rate, use an on demand system allowing fairer payment with a justified reason. For example, at the start of the year, students can apply for \u00a3275 for bus fare and \u00a325 for books. Later in the year, they could apply for art equipment. This would be instead of the weekly payments, of which spending can not be controlled (The Scottish Government found in the pilot scheme, 63% of EMA goes to leisure, hardly \"books, travel or equipment\"). \u00a32780 is a bit much for \"being short of cash\" (that's 2 years of EMA at \u00a330, with bonuses of \u00a3500). That or change the EMA name to 'A bribe to keep you in school'. While it is still possible to abuse this system, some control could be retained while giving more students access to EMA. P.S. I am not against payment for leisure entirely, but all \u00a32780... That's a lot of PS3s.",
