        "background": "Things are becoming rediculous and something needs to be done to save Britain. The people of Britain are becoming EMBARASSED to call themselves British, due to immigration problems and over-zealous political correctness. I do not have any personal problems with immigrants or anything of the sort, but we must remember what Britain stands for...a Christian society, a free country, regardless of how other people find it. I am scared of where this country is heading. We must stay true to ourselves, and the goverment must think about it's own British citizens, above and before anyone elses, and ESPECIALLY consider this \"parallel shira law\" issue. We cannot celebrate CHRISTMAS because it offends others...that sums up how rediculous it is becoming, surely... Please do something, or our country is finished. I'm losing all faith.",
