            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This would be a very high speed road that would enable to take you car to its speed limit if so desired. With no speed limit then it would only need around six places of exit and entrance onto it. It would be similar in effect as the German AutoBahn but with diferences, ie, in lane one there would be a minimum speed limit of 90 MPH, lane two would have a minimum of 130 and lane three would have no limit. With lane one being restricted to 90 this would help with entrance onto and exit off the motorway. this then could enable someone to get from say Manchester to London in maybe an hour or less. and from Glasgow to London in around 2-3 hours this would definately beat any train journey and make The UK a great place to be.",
