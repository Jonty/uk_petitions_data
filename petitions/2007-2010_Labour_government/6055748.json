            "background": "This e-petition system is a complete sham.  It is cynically designed to let people think this government cares what it's citizens think when in fact, they palpably don't. They have decided that \"Nanny knows best\" and will continue to ride rough shod over our desires and demands. It is high time that the Prime Minister remembered that he may be running thing but he does so on behalf of his employer the Great British Public.",
