By definition they have obtained money from the public purse by deception. To say sorry is not enough this is criminal activity under the protection of rule manipulation by people in a position of trust. Once abused the said trust is broken the amended rules are not valid excesive claims are criminal. As prime minister you are herby called upon to ensure criminals are prosecuted and the public are protected. If you fail to do this you are complicit by association. Any political party allowing public purse abusers to cotinue in public office are clearly unfit to serve.",
