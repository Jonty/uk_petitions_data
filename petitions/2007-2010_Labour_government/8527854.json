Instead of getting more young people online as is wanted, there will within months be drastically fewer. Great economy boost there Gordon! Stop pandering to to the behemoths of the industry and understand many artists are happy for the exposure. It is not 1973, and the result of this will be more information for the rich, less for the poor. The alternative for most people to downloading is, contrary to the belief of the wealthy at Westminster, not BUYING the material, but rather NEVER accessing it at all. Nobody wins.",
