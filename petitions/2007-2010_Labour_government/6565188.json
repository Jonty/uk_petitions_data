            "background": "My daughter's school was flooded in June, and the local Council (East Riding of Yorkshire) have provided a double decker bus, without seatbelts, to transport her to another school several miles away.  We have attempted to get the Council to provide seatbelted transport, as most of the children are unable to even put their feet on the floor, which makes it potentially very dangerous in the event of an accident, or even an emergency stop.  They have refused to do so, citing excessive costs as their main reason for rejecting our request.  We are now taking her to the temporary school ourselves.  I believe it is wrong to allow Primary School children to be transported to school in vehicles provided by a Local Authority which are not fitted with seat belts.",
