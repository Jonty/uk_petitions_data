            "background": "Under the current system, if a patient is signed off from work and has to claim incapacity benefit, they can be sent for a medical examination with a (and I grudgingly use the word) doctor. This \"doctor\" then asks the patient a series of questions that have no relation to their illness or incapacity. A decision is then made on the patient's capability for work based on this 5 minute interview which results in a significant number of genuinely ill people being declared as being fit for work.\n\nThese medicals should be scrapped and the DWP should be made to accept the word of the patient's GP who sees the patient regularly and has a much better idea of the patient's capability for work. If a patient is given a sick note by their GP this should be all the proof the DWP needs of the patients illness",
