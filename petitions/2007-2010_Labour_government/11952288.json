We appreciate your very thoughtful gesture and gift of historical significance.  We should have been equally thoughtful.  Of all things American, we would hate for our best representation to be a couple dozen Hollywood hits.  Is that really what America has been reduced to?  Cheap toys and bootleg DVDs from China?\n\nWe value your friendship and camaraderie.  You are our most important ally.  Please accept this petition for forgiveness on behalf of all the embarrassed Americans.",
