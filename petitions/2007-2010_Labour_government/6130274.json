            "background": "I applied for Disability Living Allowance (D.L.A) in July 1996 but did not receive a favourable decision until October 2000; even then payment of the actual arrears, for this very long period, was not received until December: almost 4.5 years after the original claim.  The amount of arrears I eventually received did, of course, reflect the total I would have received if payment had started as soon as the claim had been assessed (if it had been approved at the time) but the fact that I had to wait such a long time (and go through a number of appeals processes) means that the money was in Treasury coffers, rather than paid to me, for this period; so the Treasury benefited from it instead of me.  I'm certain this applies to many other claimants; especially for D.L.A. which is very difficult to claim and, as I understand, is almost always refused on first application (plus a sort-of post-code lottery(!) as to whether or not you get it at all!)",
