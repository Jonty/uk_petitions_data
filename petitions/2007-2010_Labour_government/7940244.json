            "background": "The age of drinking alcohol should be raised to 21 to stop \"Yob Culture and Binge Drinking Britain\". In recent years, there have been countless incidents,(most worryingly murders of innocent victims) increasing all the time, and fuelled by alcohol/drugs consumption in the young, not to mention the increased strain on the (already under-pressure) NHS.  I fear this problem is escalating up and down the country, and must be tackled as a matter of urgency, before it spirals out of control.  As a parent, I fear for my own children's future if the law doesn't change.",
