            "background": "This petition concerns the well-publicised case of two children which Edinburgh Social Services would not allow their grandchildren to adopt, choosing instead to place them with a gay couple. When the grandparents objected they were threatened by Social Services with never seeing their grandchildren again. This appeal is for the Prime Minister to intervene so that a case apparently determined by ideology might be reexamined with a view to reuniting the family.",
