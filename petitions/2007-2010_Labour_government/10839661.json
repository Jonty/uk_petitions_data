            "background": "In basic words, this petition is about refusing to become a mere ROBOT- SLAVE to the NEW WORLD ORDER. We say no to the micro- chipping of the population, whereby all personal records are recorded onto a tiny RFID chip. Not only that, but Paper money becomes non- existent and the populations wealth is run electronically through this device. If you want bread, you go to the shop and buy it with your chip. They can even turn off your chip and make you starve. DAVID ICKE and ALEX JONES go into it in more detail. They have already started micro- chipping animals and immigrants. Also they micro- chip ex- convicts leaving prison. We will refuse to be sheep in this society, it is all coming into place, all you have to do is piece together the jigsaw puzzle the mainstream media are projecting.",
