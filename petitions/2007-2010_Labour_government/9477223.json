            "background": "It is morally wrong that one housewife who does NOT contribute to the tax take of the country is entitled to use, with impunity, those taxes contributed by everybody else to pay for shopping trips by taxi while taxpaying housewives are deprived of that facility.  The government needs to, at least make the playing field level.  Where high profile spongers like Mr and Mrs Speaker can use the taxes we pay into the fund (against threat of criminalisation) then we should be able to set the same expenses allowance to be set against our annual income tax bill.",
