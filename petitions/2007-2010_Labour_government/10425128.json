Having paid over \u00a3300 + VAT only last November 2007 I find this disgusting, especially that when buy-to-let landlords, from October 2008, will only have to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) which will only cost \u00a380 & last for 10 years. So I am asking the Prime Minister to scrap HIP\u2019s or at least make them valid for 10 years as for landlords. Is you agree with this then please \u2018sign\u2019 my petition.",
