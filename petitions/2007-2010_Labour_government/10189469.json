            "background": "Took my 11 year daughter to the emercency dentist in the evening.  We were luck and got an appointment. They did a temporary messure and told us the tooth would need to be taken out.  Went back to the dental hospital next day and spent 4 hours for them to only do a second X-ray advise tooth needs to come out.  Emergency appointment with own dentist, another X-ray advisce tooth needs to come out referal to another dentist why he could not do the extraction I do not know.  I telephoned the referal dentist, and was told that  her appointment was booked for 17th July  and this was for a check up.  A check up, why? when I had been told by THREE dentists in less then 24 hours that the tooth needed to come out.  We are not talking about an adult, this is an 11 year child that is in pain.  \n\nI am not happy with my dentist, we have regular checkups every 6 months as recommended by the government.  The last time we saw the dentist, 3 people were in and out of his surgery within 15 minutes.\n\nWe do not have a dental service even in London.  It is clear that dentist do not want to do NHS work.",
