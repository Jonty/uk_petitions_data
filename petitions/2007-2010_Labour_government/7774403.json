            "background": "For some reason Sky consistently refuse to allow paying customers to use their own router to access their Broadband service. Instead, customers are told that they 'can only use the supplied router' and that any other router cannot use the Sky Broadband service. As the supplied router is only a normal (but custom branded) ADSL router, there is no reason that other routers cannot connect to Sky Broadband. Customer Service and/or Technical Support assistants will refuse to hand customers their login details, so they can't even try. Users who would rather use their own router would probably not need technical support, so there would be no loss for Sky. Surely, this can be seen as 'anticompetitive' behavior against router companies.",
