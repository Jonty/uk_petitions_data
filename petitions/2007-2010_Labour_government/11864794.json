            "background": "Royal Bank of Scotland has not only announced the biggest loss in British corporate history - but it's also being shored up in what some will see as Britain's biggest ever bailout.\n\nThe Treasury has announced that we as taxpayers will provide insurance to Royal Bank against future losses on \u00a3325bn of loans and investments. \n\nFirst losses of up to \u00a319.5bn on those impaired assets will be taken by Royal Bank.\n\nBut to prevent the losses wrecking the bank, we as taxpayers will be injecting up to \u00a319bn of new capital into it, in the form of non-voting shares.\n\nAlso, losses greater than \u00a319.5bn will be born by us - by taxpayers. In a prolonged severe recession, those losses could be substantial. \n\nThe taxpayer is basically taking all the risk so we should as taxpayers now own RBS fully.",
