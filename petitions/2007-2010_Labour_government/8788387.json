        "background": "We live on a B road in Dagenham Essex. This road has houses either side half the top A13 end of the road. Police sirens are very loud and are as regular as every 10 to 15 minutes throughout the day. I have monitered that these police cars are whirling their sirens at 2 and 3 pm up and down the road when the road is empty and there is no traffic on the road. This is inconsiderate of the police as we as families have young children who have to get up for school and people have to get up early for work! In my view the Metropolitan Police use their power to the extreme even when unnecessary in the early hours. It is against the law for a taxi to hoot after 11pm, whats the use of this when the police cars are allowed to blare their sirens out all night long even when they don't need to? We have lived in the same house for 9 years now, and find that unless something is done soon, we will be forced to move elsewhere.",
