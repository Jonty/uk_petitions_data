            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Bromsgrove has been forced to drink fluoridated water since 1985. We were told that a public consultation took place before it was added, but clarification under the FOAct from West Midlands Strategic Health, states that no such public consultation ever took place.\nFluoride is a poison, proven without a doubt from hundreds of research papers, but the Health Minister points to a York report that he states says otherwise. The report stated that there was insufficient evidence to show that fluoride gave any assistance to children in looking after their teeth and only two samples were ever supplied for analyses. In America this year, a scientist has now proved that young males are contracting cancer from fluoridated water....and women have been connected to breast cancer through fluoridated tap water...a balanced diet and regular tooth brushing is all that's required for children up to 12 years of age. In the Isle of Mann in June this year, the population was asked do you want fluoridated water, the answer was no, but here in the UK we are never asked and this is undemocratic, considering our very administration is supposedly based on democracy, for the people and by the people.",
