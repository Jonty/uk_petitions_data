            "background": "If a person is falsely accused,arrested and brought to trial, there is a likelyhood of the Judge throwing out the case on day one of the trial after 'legal arguement.'\nThe case, being seen to be flawed, is not put in front of a jury, so by law, the victim of the false allegation remains guilty of being falsely accused and retains his criminal status, despite the Judge seeing through the false allegation and freeing him/her. \nThis law must be remediated to allow an innocent person to automatically regain their liberty, rights and their innocent status to which they are entitled. \nThus the person would be able to return to a normal life, as in the case of those judged innocent by a jury.",
