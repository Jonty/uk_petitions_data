        "action": "discuss with the sports minister the idea of approaching the International Olympic Committee (IOC) with a view to allowing, only, amateur tennis players to take part in the tennis event at the Olympic Games as the Games are for amateurs, only. It will boost amateur tennis aspirations throughout the world and encourage more interest in the sport.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is just too ridiculous for words to see the very famous and well known names in tennis who earn massive amounts of money taking part in what is supposed to be a world event for amateurs, the Olympics.\n\nThink what it would do for amateur tennis the world over. Amateurs will be inspired world wide to work harder at their game knowing that they could, one day, represent their country in the Olympics.  Tennis clubs will flourish everywhere and a healthy pass time for amateurs will grow.  It is the dream of any sportsman/woman to represent their country in the Olympics but if the sport they're particularly good at happens to be tennis they know they haven't got a chance.\n\nWe've got four whole years before our very own Olympics and it will be good for Britain to set another standard and another first.",
