            "background": "The savers of the UK demand that they are protected from the losses they are suffering from reducing interest rates. Savers outnumber borrowers by a factor of 6 to 1 and have the right to withdraw all funds from the UK  financial system and place it in a system possibly outside the UK that will recognize their value and pay a reasonable rate of interest whilst protecting their interests. This petition is a warning to the government that this group will be created and will bring home the message from all savers and create a very powerful and influential financial institute that will demand that the members are treated fairly.",
