            "background": "The EU is currently negotiating a 'blue card' scheme to enable skilled and educated people from across Asia, Africa and Latin America to work and live in the EU. The world's poorest countries are located in these regions where they desperately need their own talented nurses, doctors, engineers and scientists etc to stay where they are. This is a double blow because these countries have used what little money they have to train these people. The world's richest countries should be training their own people for these jobs at their own expense. This is a form of colonial theft of the world's most vunerable countries. I would ask the prime minister to call for the ending of this exploitation to be agreed with the EU and all wealthy countries.",
