            "background": "The Government did not support the 'wounded petition' for a specialist military hospital on the basis that: \u201cThe principle behind the decision to move from stand-alone military hospitals to facilities which co-operate with the NHS was the right one, from a clinical, administrative and financial point of view.\u201d The decision has therefore been based on the view of clinicians, administrators and financiers, whereas the recent NHS Next Stage Review states that it is patients that should be at the centre of such decision-making. I therefore call upon Government to complete a full military patient-centred review on the need for a specialist military hospital.",
