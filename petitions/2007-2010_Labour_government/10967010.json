        "background": "Have you ever been a victim of a young person with nothing better to do than commit a crime against you? It could be anything, a smashed car window, theft, abusive behaviour, intimidating behaviour. Anything which is a young person showing no respect to the hard working people of this country. I wish to petition than young offenders no longer get ASBOs (which they all think is like a medal), I think a better punishment would be to send them to the army to learn some respect for other people. Sign here if you agree.",
