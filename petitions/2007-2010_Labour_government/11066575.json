            "background": "Recently there have been a number of harrowing murders, these include: \n\u2022 The sickening murder and persistent cruelty of Baby P.\n\u2022  2 year old Ainlee Labonte was murdered, covered in 64 scars, scalds, cigarette burns and bruises.\n\u2022 The murder of Clare Bernal who was shot by her former boyfriend on the shop floor at Harvey Nichols.\n\u2022 The murder of Nicola Morrin, stabbed to death after years of abuse from her ex boy friend.\n \nThere are huge benefits to re-instating the death penalty in the UK:\n(1) It guarantees that the murder will not murder again. \n(2) It provides assurance and comfort to victims family and friends that justice has been served.\n(3) It saves approximately the tax-payer approx \u00a335,000 per year \u2013 which could pay for 2 nurses and save lives.\n\nYou must ensure that the \u2018murderer\u2019 is absolutely guilty, however where there is overwhelming conclusive evidence and the murder is sufficiently cruel to deserve it, we believe the death penalty is the only appropriate solution.",
