Something most barely even come close to getting, many suffer pains and/or symptoms so bad, they're bed/house bound often/all the time, many were previously fit, busy, able-bodied workers/students and would love to be so again. But now live a life, that could be described as regularly torturous, suffering so bad often, were we animals, the person/s allowing it to happen would be severely punished. Please help by allowing more research into cause/s, so better treatments conventional/natural can be provided to remove the torture we endure 24/7/365. So even the severest among us, can have a much better quality of life than we currently have. Invisible conditions should be publicly made very visible so they can be better understood and accepted by all. There by increasing research into them.",
