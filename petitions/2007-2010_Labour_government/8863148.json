            "background": "Many speed limit signs are positioned right at a junction, making them hard to spot even by the most attentive of drivers. It is important that a driver make clear and safe decisions when negotiating junctions, and hence the drivers attention is focused on traffic movements and conditions. Having speed limit signage positioned right at the junction makes for one more bit of information to be collected and responded too. A far better solution would be to move such signage a short way from the junction to a position where the information could be viewed in relative isolation. I suggest this be a minimum of 20 metres from any junction.",
