        "background": "I strongly believe that the Prime Minister should pay for all travel costs himself so that he can make a valued judgement on the state of taxation on average people in this country. He should then claim the mileage back at a reasonable rate which industry would pay eg 20p per mile for business. I aslo believe that he should pay road tax, congestion charge and should stop at all red lights. If his entourage uses more than 1 vehicle then Mr Brown should also pay for those too and should be made to pay for all fuel using his own funds. I am sure that then Mr Brown would indeed 'Feel our pain'.",
