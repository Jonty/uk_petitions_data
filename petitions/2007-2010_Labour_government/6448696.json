            "background": "The world is reaching a tipping point where the only solution is to drastically reduce the global population.  This could be done by enforcing limits of one child per family, possibly by compulsory sterilisation.  No one country has a big enough stick to enforce this, so it must be done through a global body.  If we don't do this voluntarily, nature will do it for us in a horrific manner.  The huge human population caused by exponential increases is depleting the resources of this planet and destroying our coexisting species.  In a short period from now, this will prove disasterous for all of us unless we act NOW!",
