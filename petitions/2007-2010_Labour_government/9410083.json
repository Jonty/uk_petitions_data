On Friday 2nd May 22.25pm while I was talking on the phone my door was knocked off its hinges, my handbag stolen and I was left in a state of shock. Because of early release these thugs have no fear of capture,they laugh at the police,they laugh at the prison guards and have no respect for law and order.I want punishment to fit the crime, I want 'do-gooders' to come and ask me what effect this attack has had on me!Justice for the Victims not sympathy for the criminals!",
