            "background": "The laws relating to dogs and other animals are outdated and urgently need to be reviewed and updated. Animals are being destroyed at RSPCA and SPCA facilities all over the UK, through no fault of their own. Documentation should be provided and be available to the public to prove that All methods of contacting the rightful owner have been used before an animal is PTS. The current practice to hold a dog for only 7 days is wrong and totally inadequate. We, the undersigned request that the 7 day rule be changed to 28 days. This petition has been set up in memory of Sal the 8 year West Highland terrier, from Liverpool that was sadly put to sleep at RSPCA HALEWOOD when her owners were on honeymoon and for all the other dogs who have suffered a similar fate. I have set a 3 month time frame so that action will have to be taken sooner rather than later.",
