We like many others clubs provide a valuable community service . We have over two hundred junior members whom we coach but more important help to provide a good start in life for. We are non profit making but are classed by the utiliy companies as a business therefore liable to these exorbitant charges.We feel that sports clubs should be catorgised under a new heading giving them relief from these charges.
