            "background": "As oil prices drop the price of Biodiesel cannot compete as its manufacturing costs are higher.However biodisel is a UK product  environmentally friendlier than  normal mineral oil diesel but has the same tax rate.Reducing the tax would allow it to compete  thus more people would be tempted to use it with the knock on effect more production jobs ,more use of farmland to grow the crops v needed thus helping the troubled farm industry.And at the same time less  UK  cash being spent abroad to buy oil.\nIn the current economic climate what can be better than UK job creation and saving money?",
