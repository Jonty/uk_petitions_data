            "background": "We believe that the Video Recordings Act was a misjudged act that should never have been introduced and that the BBFC should be solely a Classification agency. Also it should be possible to to release and sell unrated DVDs in the UK. This would open up the Pan European trade in DVDs which would allow consumers to get the best value for money and not be held ransom to UK only versions of video recordings. \n\nThe VRA has produced some oddities in rating. (I.E. you must be 18 to purchase The Terminator, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life and The Last Temptation of Christ on VHS but can purchase the on DVD if you are 15). This makes a nonsense of the classification system.",
