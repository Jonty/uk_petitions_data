In locations where the police have decided to allow brothels to keep to their bargain and to refrain from arresting and charging brothel owners with keeping and or managing a brothel and to maintain a dialogue with all the public concerned with same so as they all know clearly what the current rules are...and for the police and cps to adhere to the warning system in that any so called breeches of the 'rules' are met with merely a warning (to correct ) before any suggestion of action. To much public money is being wasted by malicious prosecutions and stress and damage caused needlessly to the brothel owners concerned.",
