        "background": "Gordon Brown states that he 'feels the hurt' of ordinary people faced with mounting cost of living. Actions speak louder than mere words, PM. Prove you do by ensuring that all MPs pay their own bills - council tax, mortgages etc and end subsidies in Parliament buildings on food, alcohol etc. Until you do, so long as MPs are exempt from the realities of life faced by the rest of the country, you cannot claim to 'feel the hurt'.",
