            "background": "The 18-21 minimum wage should be removed and there should only be 2 minimum wages. The 16-17 and the 18+. I believe this because it is rediculous to be making a living off \u00a34.60 an hour and why should you be considered an adult at 18, be allowed to vote, buy alcohol and cigarettes, drive, have sexual relations all by the age of 18 and not be allowed to earn the same as someone aged 22+? This is yet another act that should be overturned in the name of common sense, a lot of people i know view this as discrimination against the younger adults.",
