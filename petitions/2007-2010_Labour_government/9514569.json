            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Over the past year shortages of dry milk combined with the so called economic credit crunch have led to a sharp increase of the price of cheese.   According to Milk Development Council figures, the wholesale price of mild cheddar has risen by \u00a3600 per tonne since April, from \u00a31900/tonne to \u00a32500/tonne.  This hits all sections of society especially pizza makers, farmers and many cheese Enthuists with Domino's pizza reporting high losses.  Therefore i suggest that the government working closely with cheese farmers and reatilers can provide cheaper cheese by merely providing an extra 2% provision of cheese regulations.  So sign this petition if you feel the price of cheese is unjust and totally unfair.",
