            "background": "After setting up the support group \"Justice for Parents Awaiting Overdue Child Support Payments\" on a well known social networking site, it became abundantly clear just how many mis-handled Child Support cases existed. \n\nThe catalogue of mistakes made over the years by the CSA/C-MEC, often discussed by group members or read about in the media and even admitted to by the CSA/C-MEC themselves, is horrifying. \n\nWith many Child Support cases dragging on for years due to, for example, blunders, poor communication between staff members, understaffing and general ineptitude, it is the tax payer who is footing the bill.\n\nWe believe that if we, as parents, had the right to compensation due to our mis-handled CSA/C-MEC cases, they would be resolved much more quickly and accurately and at a lesser cost to the Tax Payer. This would insure a less stressful and more amicable experience for all family members involved.",
