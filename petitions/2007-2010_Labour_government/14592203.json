        "background": "The use of electric convulsive therapy is a practice that should have been left in the dark ages. Though it is said to be different to the images seen in the film 'one flew over the cockoos nest' giving patients muscle relaxants does not excuse the sheer horror of such a treatment. There are no defined benefits and no clear understanding of how the therapy even works. The list of symptoms the the ECT actually causes outweights the benefits in alot of cases. \nWe want the practice banned until it is fully understood and is proven to help.",
