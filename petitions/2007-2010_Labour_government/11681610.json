            "background": "We think it is highly unfair that graduates on second degrees cannot access tuition fee loans. This means graduates are expected to find up to \u00a315,000 over the course of their degree to fund their education. This burden could be eased by the government allowing access to the tuition fee loan for graduates as it it is a loan, which by definition is repayable.",
