The list goes on and on.\n\nWhy do black boys fail at school?\nWhy are black people underr epresented in senior positions in both the public and private sector?\n\nI accept that many faults can be addressed by the black community (is there one?) but this failure doesn't explain our lack of achievement in the UK.",
