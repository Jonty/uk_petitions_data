            "background": "The combination of speed and excessive traffic is ruining the quality of rural life. This is exemplified by Selborne in Hampshire, the birthplace of Gilbert White, whose innovative 'Natural History has been translated into many languages. The village of Selborne is on a B road and has 10,000 cars a day and numerous heavy lorries passing through it. The present speed limit of 30mph is widely flouted and the ban on heavy lorries disregarded. The pavements are narrow or non-existent.Wing mirrors of lorries,at head height and projecting across the pavements,are a constant hazard to pedestrians. In wet weather pedestrians are deluged by spray from passing vehicles. The village suffers also from noise pollution and air pollution caused by the traffic. We maintain  that no community should be so inflicted and we therefore ask that a speed limit of 20mph be applied to all rural villages and that through traffic also be directed to A roads.",
