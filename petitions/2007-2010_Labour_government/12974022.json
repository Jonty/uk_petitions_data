            "background": "we are all familiar with the case of the moors murders, and the 12 year old boy (keith bennett) who has never been found. this petition is to get the manchester police to restart the search of saddleworth moors. i think i speak for many people when i say that keiths mum has gone through enough heartache trying to find keith, and then the police say they are not going to search anymore! would this still be the case if it were a politician's son or daughter who had been lost for many years? no i dont think so, the search would go on. so should the search for keith bennett. lets get this little boy back to his mum where he belongs, and give him the burial he so rightfully deserves. please ask yourself what you would do if this was your son or daughter! \nplease sign this petition to restart the search for keith and spread the word, tell everyone you know!!!\n\nthank you very much!!!",
