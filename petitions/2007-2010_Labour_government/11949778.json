He must stop giving tax payers money to all and sundry abroad, while here in the UK, the people are monitored in every shape and form, and he has plans to increase this even more, which he must stop.\nHe must slow immigration to a trickle, and deport every illegal person in this country now. We want our rights and country back, now! we are the forgotten people of this rudderless nation. He has got to remind all mp's that they are to serve the people, and to stop claiming as much money as they can.",
