We accept that humour can be adult and there is a time a place, however this was well in excess of what is acceptable. There is also the question of those who monitor these matters and the response of the BBC which has been totally ineffective. Are certain presenters allowed to do totally as they wish? If the BBC cannot put its own house in order, then someone will have to do it for them.",
