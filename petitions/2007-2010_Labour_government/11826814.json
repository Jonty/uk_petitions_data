            "background": "Why should British taxpayers be forced to pay compensation to known terrorist sympathisers. This is a mockery of our country, our judicial system (that passed the anti terrorism bills to protect the British public), and an insult to the victims and their families killed or injured in terrorist attacks, many of whom are still awaiting compensation.\n\nThe 'disgusting'Compensation awards totalling nearly \u00a323,000 for a group of foreign terror suspects including Abu Qatada. \nThe European Court of Human Rights handed Qatada - once described as \"Osama bin Laden's right hand man in Europe\" - \u00a32,500 and similar sums to eight other men. \nStrasbourg judges ruled the Government's policy of detaining the men without trial in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 had breached their human rights. \nOur Government should reject out of hand this disgusting, obscene ruling for payout.",
