        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Queuing for Dartford Crossing tolls routinely adds an extra hour to journey time during peak rush hour. Queues tail back up to 17 miles (junction 27) every week. It is  faster then to divert from the M25 through Central London (Blackwall Tunnel) or rural rat-runs parallel to the M25 for queue-hopping.\n\n100s of 1000s of business hours are wasted weekly, residents of Essex and Kent suffer toll-generated rat runs, Central London traffic is swelled and 30,000 vehicles at a time needlessly chug greenhouse gases into the air for an hour for peak period queuing. The DfT should start to get a grip on this problem.\n\nRemoval of the toll would of course be too easy. The DfT could increase the number of toll booths to 650 which should reduce the queuing time to 5 minutes max or build a second Channel Tunnel from Southend so that commuters can get to work via France instead.\n\nPlease avoid the smug and patronising response that \u201cit's alright most of the week\u201d - most of us have to travel in rush hour.",
