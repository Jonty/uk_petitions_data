            "background": "Make central London free again.  Scrap road pricing here.  Scrap the road tolls.  Scrap the tax on travel.  No government bribes to coerce travellers onto inconvenient and expensive public transport.\n\nCongestion charging is very inconvenient for the user.  The London scheme only makes a profit due to penalties.  Other schemes could lead to unexpected large debts with no way to dispute them.  How is the driver to know in advance even roughly how much a journey would cost?\n\nRoad pricing is not about reducing congestion, but pricing private cars off the road.  It damages business, commuting and social activity.  It hurts most those least able to pay.  It requires a vast expensive system to monitor every journey.  It is an intolerable interference with our freedom.\n\nIf the Mayor of London and TfL are unwilling to scrap their scheme, then let the people of London decide in a fair referendum whether they want congestion charging.",
