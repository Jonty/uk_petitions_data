Peacemakers then, as you should, recognsied it's potential for religious, political, international border and ethnic strife.\n\nWe the undersigned agree with EU officials - which Turkey hopes to join some day - that \"the kind of political issues referred to in this case (should be) debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box, not in courtrooms\".",
