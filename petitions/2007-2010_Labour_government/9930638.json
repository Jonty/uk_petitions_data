        "background": "A petition has already been created asking that aid should not be given to countries in which homosexuality is a capital crime.  DENYING AID to such countries, however, would penalise NOT the people/person with the power to make this decision but the \"ordinary\", powerless, citizens of these countries; including homosexuals themselves and also heterosexuals who are opposed to this legislation.\n\nI DO agree with the STANCE of the previous petition; just not the proposed targets it aims at.  In my opinion it's absolutely appalling that a person's sexuality, which (as I understand) is not within his/her control, should be a capital \"offence\".  Even the life-style choice to PRACTISE this sexuality should surely be as accepted in exactly the same way as the life-style choice of HETEROSEXUALS to practise OUR sexuality is accepted.",
