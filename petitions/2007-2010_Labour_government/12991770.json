The costs of such experts in criminal and civil trials are included in solicitors\u2019 legal aid costs.\"\n\nThe Petitioners therefore request the removal of interpreting and translation costs from the solicitors\u2019 fees to be paid as disbursements (as is now done in asylum cases) keeping the present payment structure and scales in place as interpreting and translation fees have not increased for a number of years.",
