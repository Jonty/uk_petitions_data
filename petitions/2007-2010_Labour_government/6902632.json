            "background": "As you are aware, Mr MacKenzie showed his true, racist views, last week by ridiculing the nation of Scotland and accusing the people of Scotland of lacking the entrepreneurial skills that people in London and the South East have.  This is not the first time that MacKenzie has offended such a group of people. As well as calling Scottish People 'Tartan T***ers', he has offended the city of Liverpool in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, falsely accusing fans of urinating on policeman and robbing dead fans of their possessions as well as storming the gates.\nHis rants in the last week about Scottish people have been racist and there should be no platform for such behaviour  in this country of many cultures and beliefs.",
