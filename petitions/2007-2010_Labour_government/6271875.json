        "action": "Abolish the Scottish Parliament if any further attempt is made by that institution to declare Scottish Independance from the UK",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Scottish Parliament is in itself only a secondary legislative power. To break from the UK would cause a huge political power reduction for both countries and destroy both (particuarly the Scottish) economies. Scotland is part of the UK and most Scots are proud of that heritage as are the rest of Britain. We are one unified nation and far stronger economically, politically and socially that way. Scottish Parliamentary attempts to foil this should be met with strong opposition and a reduction in their power as a result until logic and common sense are once again restored.",
