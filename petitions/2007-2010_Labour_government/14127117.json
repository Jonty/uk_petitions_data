They will not take no for an answer and have often left me feeling stressed, upset and angry. They will not take no for an answer and on occasions have tried to follow me out of the store. I go shopping regularly and I do not want to go home feeling harassed. I myself am disabled and cannot do with this pressure. I can't be the only one to feel like this can I?. Maybe a petition will stop them? I really hope so.",
