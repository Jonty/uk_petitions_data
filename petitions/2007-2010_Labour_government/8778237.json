        "background": "If BBC managers can afford to offer GBP400m for programmes which were eventually sold off for GBP120m proves to me that a, they have far too much money and b, that they have no idea how to act in a commercial environment in the interests of the people who pay the money they are handed BY THE BUCKETFUL with no accountability or independent external oversight.  If I wish to own a TV receiver (even if I don't want to use it to watch TV company transmissions) I have no choice but to pay this tax, against threat of criminalisation.  How come these managers are not charged with fraud when they misuse the payments I am FORCED BY LAW to make?",
