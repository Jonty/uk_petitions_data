        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the renting sector you may claim immediatly on being made redundant, this covers those in rented houses by the benefit system. Currently the private individual sector has no such protection until a year has lapsed and the mortgage interest is covered to a \u00a3100,000 limit. This is stacked unfairly against the private sector and those families who have a main contributor facing financial difficulty.",
