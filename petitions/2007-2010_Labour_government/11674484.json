            "background": "Bees are dying rapidly, especially honey bees.  We ALL need them to pollinate our plants for food and other important things. Most plants and food crops need pollinating. If we lose our bees we will have to do what happened in a part of Japan, where people pollinate pear trees, which is costly and very time consuming. The bees carry out this service admirably, and for free. Can you imagine a world without them? So it is absolutely crucial we make a big effort to help the bees. MORE FUNDS ARE DESPERATELY NEED FOR THIS.",
