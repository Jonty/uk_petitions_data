        "background": "Assess all visitors at port of entry (e.g. airport) from countries most at risk (currently Mexico & US but needs to be extended as necessary). Test anyone with signs of Swine flu and quarantine them if test proves positive. \n\nPrevent unrestricted entry while there are still very few cases in the UK.\n\nAll visitors to be assessed including lorry drivers arriving by Chunnel etc..\n\nThis will buy time (a few weeks?) to understand severity of this disease and increase preparedness with minimal economic impact. \n\nQuickly relax assessment if disease proves to be 'normal' and no cause for alarm.\n\nGoods should also be held and tested where transmission of the virus is possible via contact",
