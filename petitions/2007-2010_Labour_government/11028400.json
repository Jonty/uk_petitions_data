        "background": "The PMQs on Wednesday 5th November made me ashamed. I saw the leaders of the three main parties - equally pathetic and childish - in a low-level mud-slinging contest regarding who shared the most values with Senator Obama.\n\nI urge the PM to recognise that PMQs play a vital role in our democracy and in the accountability system, and that using them for particularly lame poaching of other parties' political capital is an abuse of Parliament and the resources spent on preparation for Question Time. It is for discussing issues of the day, how they affect the public, and how the country is run. Not pointless bickering.",
