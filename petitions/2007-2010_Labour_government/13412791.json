            "background": "I put forward a new initiative for the development of the UK's internet infrastructure. The phone networks are woefully inadequate for data transfer and thus major investment would be required to bring the speed of access in the UK in line with the rest of the world. But here is my point: DO NOT GO BACKWARDS WITH TECHNOLOGY! At the moment most homes connected to broadband use a router which is connected to the phone lines and broadcasts a wireless signal to devices in the home. Why not just remove one step in this chain??? Rather than use government investment money for upgrading cables and exchanges half-heartedly, do away with the idea of cables for the internet. Start from scratch and leave the phone lines alone. The UK could be covered in a powerful Wi-Fi signal which is broadcast over large urban areas that people just connect to using their PC's or laptops or phones, just need to log in and you're away. I know it is not a large leap in advancement. Weather this is a state owned service or privately run, it would revolutionize our entire internet network and certain put the UK first in the world of Information Communication Technology.",
