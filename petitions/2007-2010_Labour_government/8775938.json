            "background": "The electoral commission has recently announced that David Cameron, Nick Clegg and 12 other MPs have declared donations and gifts late to the electoral commission. This is exactly the same offence as the one committed by Peter Hain and should be punished equally. This petition calls upon the Prime minister to ensure that the electoral commission refers the cases of the fourteen MPs, including David Cameron and Nick Clegg to the police in the same way they referred the case of Peter Hain. If this is not done it shows distinct double standards and favouritism within the electoral commission that must be dealt with if electoral law is to be fair.",
