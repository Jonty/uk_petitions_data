English Heritage made it into a Scheduled Ancient Monument, so the property developers who own the land cannot build on it.  However, the developers are looking for a buyer of the Sergeants' Mess plus garden (which includes the entrance to the Roman Circus).  This unique Roman site is part of our heritage and needs to be on show and secured for the Nation.",
