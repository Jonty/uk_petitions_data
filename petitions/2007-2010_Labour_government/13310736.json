        "background": "Over a number of years, the BBC's soap 'Eastenders' has become an increasingly poor role model for todays' society.\nThe soap, shown during peak viewing hours during the week and repeated on BBC3, has shown many instances of gang related violence, domestic upheaval and street crime. Some of the material shown would be considered unsuitable for pre-watershed transmission.\n\nDespite attempts by the BBC to revive falling viewing figures, a majority of messages on the BBC's own Points Of View website (about Eastenders) appear to reflect the poor quality of programming. Yet, the corporation have dismissed such comments, insisting it 'addresses important issues that affect our society'.",
