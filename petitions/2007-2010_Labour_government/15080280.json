He makes no apparent attempt to find work, and instead uses his time campaigning against our democracy and our Heritage, instead allegedly spending time in Radio and TV Studios and on the streets 'Rabble Rousing'. \nIn contrast a frontline soldier, fighting Choudary\u2019s alleged taliban allies in Afghanistan, takes home \u00a317,004 for risking his life.\nShould that soldier be killed in the line of duty, his widow would receive significantly less from the state than what Choudary currently receives.\nThis is just one example of Benefit abuse.",
