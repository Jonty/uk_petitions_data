            "background": "The issue of a defence medal for ex service veterans who have served this country and who have no official recognition. The veteran badge which has been issued is fine for every day wear, but for special occasions such as remembrance day veterans want to wear a medal. This would stop the purchasing of so called \"bling\" medals.\nCost should NOT be a factor as I am sure that if a medal was available people would purchase one and wear it with pride",
