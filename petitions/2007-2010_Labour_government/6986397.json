        "background": "The central NHS has commissioned the Audit Commission to audit the clinical coding of activity charged under the Payment by Results(PbR)in acute NHS hospitals in the UK. Rhe aim of these audits is to verify that the correct charges are being levied against Primary Care Trusts.There are plans to extend these audits to activity carried out in Outpatients units, such as minor ops, diagnostic testing etc. \n\n My petition asks that this not be extended to Outpatient units as it is uncecessary and bureaucratic and a waste of NHS and taxpayers resources",
