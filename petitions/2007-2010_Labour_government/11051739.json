            "background": "Various (perfectly legitimate) companies sell tickets for anything you want, be it for a concert, a train, or a sporting event. Each of them will add a booking fee on top of this, some will also add transaction fees as well. These can be anything up to 30% of the original ticket price, to be added on to the ticket itself. This differs from site to site and is frequently higher than it should be - I do not believe that paying potentially an additional \u00a310 on top of a \u00a330 ticket is necessary, especially when it has been bought using an internet-based system.\n\nI do not disagree with booking fees to cover administrative costs, I am asking for there to be a cap on the amount that can be charged for a booking and transaction fee.",
