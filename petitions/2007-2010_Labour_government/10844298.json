            "background": "The Bradford and Bingley Bank building in the centre of Bingley is an eyesore. It is in state ownership and is also unlikely to be required for the bank's operation. This presents an ideal opportunity for it to be donated to the people of Bingley. This land could then be included into a redevelopment scheme for the whole of Bingley town centre and solve the problem of the shopping centre at the same time.",
