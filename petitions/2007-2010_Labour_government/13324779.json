            "background": "Dear Sir,\nI am a British citizen and married to a non-EU national. We are currently living in Dublin, Ireland as UK has changed its law and age requirements for a spouse visa has been changed from 18 to 21.\nMy wife is currently 20 years old and therefore she can not apply for UK visa and we have no choice except living away from family and friends.\nThanks to Irish authorities that they had no issue in giving my wife visa but I am really disappointed that I cannot go back to my own country as my wife is 20years old.\nCan I please request that this age requirements should be removed so that we and many other British citizen can live happily with their families in their own country.\nThanks and Regards,\nAbbas Khan",
