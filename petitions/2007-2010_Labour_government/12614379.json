He sub-contracts to a larger, family owned award winning contractor, who has a full order book, but cannot commence their new contracts for 09/10 due to lack of financial support from their bank. We will go out of business if he has to support his staff much longer, with no work and no income, resulting in another five people on the \nunemployment register.",
