Also figures show that only 2 out of 10 people in the UK voted for Labour in the last general election. A PR voting system would increase turnout by making each individual vote count. If PR had been in place previous perhaps such things as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq could have been avoided and the plan to introduce ID cards could be more adequately opposed.",
