            "background": "Funding for student loan repayments would significantly reduce student debts.\nResearch by Push, the independent guide to UK Universities states; \n\u201cStudents are expected to owe more than \u00a321,500 by the time most graduate in 2011\u201d. \n\nAs employers scaled back their hiring plans for 2009 as a result of the economic downturn, the level of unemployment reached an all time high meaning graduates spend longer time looking for work whilst interests on their student loans continue to rise.\n\nAccording to latest figures released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the average salary for graduates six months after graduating was \u00a319,300. With a rise in UK\u2019s cost of living, graduates in employment contributing to National Insurance tax, Income tax and Student loan repayments are struggling to maintain a decent standard of living. \n\nIf the government is willing to subsidise loan repayments for NHS and the Army why not fund repayments for all graduates.",
