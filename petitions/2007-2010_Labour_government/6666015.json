        "background": "I am a mommy, noone can tell me any different.\nI had my baby at 20 weeks gestation on 4th July 2006, that baby is my daughter Shannon. \nUnfortunatley I went into early labour and she was still born. Although Shannon was born so prematurley she was perfect in every way. She had all her features, toes, fingers, nails etc.\nI was treated badly by the hospital staff, they told me i had a miscarriage and my baby has no certificates to say she was here. only a grave at a cemetary.\nTo me a miscarriage you have before the stage where you give birth, not when you hold and see your fully grown baby.\nI wish for all babies still born between 16 and 23 weeks to be acknowledged in some way. Please sign this petition even if this has not happened to you.",
