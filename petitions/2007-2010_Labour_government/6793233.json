        "background": "In England, Scotland and Wales, the amount of council tax you pay is determined by which house band you live in.\n\nIt fails to take into account your income.\n\nPeople on pensions and those living in housing association houses who pay a reduced rent due to earning small wages are amongst those who can't afford to pay council tax at its current rates.\n\nI propose that the amount of council tax you pay is determined by your income, making it a far more balanced, fairer and affordable tax.\n\nCouncil tax is also rising - when wages aren't, making it an even more difficult tax to pay.\n\nIt simply cannot increase when wages don't.",
