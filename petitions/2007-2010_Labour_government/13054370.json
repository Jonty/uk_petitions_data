I am sure you will agree it is high time that we have to be recognised for our services.\n \nAfter all it is the government who require us to work in these areas for them, yet still it is the same government who do not recognize these services, without us the work would not go on.\n \n\nThe war in Iraq for example would not have been won without security contractors.\n \n\nGod bless all the the men that have died serving there country and as private security officers, our deepest sympathies go out to their families.",
