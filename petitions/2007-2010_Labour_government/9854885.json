This would allow parents to observe how their children are being taught. The government statement about the teaching of R.E to educate about religion does not fit with the \"collective worship\" that is part of the primary school doctrine. Collective worship should be an opt-in option in schools, not an opt-out. This would leave a child feeling excluded.",
