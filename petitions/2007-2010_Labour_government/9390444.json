            "action": "\"Go mobile, go global !\" - halt the warned increase in drug resistant TB cases by establishing early detection screening programmes, (mobile clinics in the UK) starting treatment regimes in immigration centres and co - ordinating health follow - up between Home Office and community services.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "2008 resistance trends show the proportion of cases resistant to any first line drug rose from 5.6% to 7.9%. Outside London a significant increase in resistance to one drug, isoniazid, was linked to immigration, an AOL report suggests.\n\nMany of these patients came from sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent where they may have developed immunity to the drug, said the study authors writing in the British Medical Journal.\n\nTo date it had involved more than 300 cases, including many prison inmates and drug users. The isoniazid problem in London was blamed on poor transmission control.\n\nMultidrug resistant cases showed a small increase from 0.8% to 0.9%, a similar incidence rate to that in other western European countries.\n\nMore than 8,000 TB infections were reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2006.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr Michelle Kruijshaar from the Health Protection Agency in London, concluded: \"The observed increases highlight the need for early case detection, rapid testing of susceptibility to drugs, and improved treatment completion.\" In a more global mobile world, the petitioner is calling for a worldwide database of health records.",
