            "background": "Ever since the new A130 link road was opened some 5-6 years ago, joining the A13 to the A12 via the saddlers farm roundabout there has been more and more vehicles using the A13 to join the A12.  As a result congesting the saddlers farm roundabout on a daily basis taking on average 20 mins to approach the roundabout this is causing congestion to everyone living on nearby Canvey land, Bowers Gifford, Southend and people living in chelmsford. I would propose a link between the A13 and the A130 so to avoid the saddlers farm roundabout altogether and easing cogestion for everyone that has to use this roundabout.",
