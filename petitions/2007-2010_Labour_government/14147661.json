            "background": "Recently it was announced that an extra 500 troops were being sent overseas to Iraq and Afghanistan, we hear so often that our young men/women are being killed in horrific circumstances and shipped home to their famillies in boxes. Wives, Children, Parents & Grandparents whose loss I cannot even comprehend. These very brave men and women deserve more! This government earn 3 perhaps 4 times the amount of these people and just for sitting in Parliament deciding our heroes futures or lack of. Bring the salary of every serviceman/woman up to a relevant level in line with serving MP's as soon as they are posted abroad to places where the enemy is well equipped and a  determined force. Every serviceman/woman is worthy of a footballers salary each week, sadly this will never happen. We would all like to see our men & women home for good but in the mean time until this has been decided, up their pay.",
