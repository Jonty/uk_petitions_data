            "background": "The purpose of this petition is to have more done for the prevention of the bullying that goes on in our country, & to raise its political importance, whether it is with words or it is physical.I want the Government to allow schools greater powers to discipline those responsible.Abuse of all kind hurt, it all scars for life on the inside.Kids suffer the worst, they can't stand up against older, bigger & more charismatic kids, they get put down, their work suffers and they\u2019re hurt.It is not viewed as a problem, & yet it affects the self confidence of millions.Its time the government stopped the red tape around the police & schools in order to put a stop to such intimidation.Actions needed:Come up with new systems to prevent bullying.Work with schools to bring the bullying rate down.Listen to the kids who\u2019ve been bullied & put their views into action.Work with social workers & youth parliament to prevent bullying outside school.Make sure every work place has a system to prevent bullying.",
