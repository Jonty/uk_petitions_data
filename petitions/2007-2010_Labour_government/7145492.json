            "background": "Norwich is the only city in the UK which is not connected to the Capitol and the rest of the country by at least a dual carriageway.  A 7 mile section of single carriageway road including a set of traffic lights exists between Mildenhall and Thetford which causes delay and frustration every day. Dualing of this final section has been delayed until at least 2011. Given the lack of other options as far as alternative routes and public transport go this project should be started as soon as possible to improve the economic fortunes of Norfolk and surrounding regions.",
