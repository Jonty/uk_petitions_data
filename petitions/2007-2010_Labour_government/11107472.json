            "background": "On 23rd October Jim Knight announced the Government\u2019s decision to back the recommendations of \u2018experts\u2019 (the government appointed SRE Delivery Review Group) and make sex and relationship education a statutory requirement for children in England aged five and over. This hugely controversial decision was made without a general public consultation with parents and was as such wholly at variance with Gordon Brown\u2019s commitment, on entering Number 10, to listen. It suggests that the Government does not trust parents and thinks it knows best. Not only have parents been excluded from the decision, but the effect of the decision to place SRE on the National Curriculum actually erodes the potential for input they currently enjoy with respect to the determination of the SRE curriculum in their child\u2019s school. This petition calls on the Prime Minister to put the decision on hold until a full 12 week public consultation has been conducted on the question of whether or not sex education should be made a statutory, National Curriculum requirement for children aged five and over, so that parents \u2013 the primary stakeholders - can contribute to the debate",
