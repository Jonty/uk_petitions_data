            "background": "Currently while there are recognised ways such as Remembrance Sunday to remember the loss of members of our armed forces in conflict, there is no formal day or national way of recognising the deaths of civilians killed in armed conflicts including ones the UK is party to. \n\nWe urge the prime minister to show that deaths of civilians killed in conflicts including ones that the UK is part of such as Afghanistan or Iraq are not merely statistics or  \"collateral damage\" but people who's deaths will be felt by their families and friends whether as a result of direct or indirect enemy action or  inadvertently as a result of the UK and it's allies. This could be done by designating a day where a two minute silence could be held or through construction of a memorial ,amongst other ways.",
