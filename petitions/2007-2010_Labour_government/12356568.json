            "background": "The people of the Bradford Metropolitan District never had the opportunity to vote on whether their local authority should be governed by a directly elected mayor.  With frequent changes to the political leadership of the council, including with the same party running the administration, and the difficulties of governing under minority administration circumstances, the stability of a leader for at least 4 year and a clear separation of executive and scrutiny/quasi-legislative powers would be ideal.  Bradford also needs a strong leader to unite its socially and ethnically divided communities and set a vision for all to rally around.",
