            "background": "The Gov intends to stop analogue radio by 2015 (6 years).  This will 1. make millions of radios obsolete creating waste, 2. force people to buy expensive digital radios to replace these 3. only provide coverage for 90% of UK (1 in 10 will loose radio!) 4. force changover of car radios to a scheme which doesn't work well in cars. 5. Force the elderly to embrace a technology with which they are unfamiliar. \nThis is so that the government can free up airwaves to sell.  We want to keep analogue radio, which is easy to get, cheap to buy, and universally understood.\nThis change is detrimental to the UK population and needs resisting",
