            "background": "There is a Criminal Records Bureau check scheme already in place for professionals which is already faulty: every school has to have their own and it can only be requested by organisations, and they make ID mistakes.\n\nNow the VBS, which requires yet another CRB check to be fulfilled but will not replace it, and will target anyone in contact \u2018regularly\u2019 with children (more than once a month). One of the direct results of this will be the closure of many after-school clubs from lack of volunteers: no one wants to be on a government database or fill out a long intrusive form just to ferry children about occasionally.\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to amend the scheme already in place rather than add another layer of bureaucracy. To help protect children while not intruding heavily into people\u2019s lives and building yet another government database.\n\nWe also petition to let parents use their own judgement to make decisions on the informal transport and supervision of their children.",
