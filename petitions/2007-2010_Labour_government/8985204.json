When they married, they worked together to continue to support the needy, world-wide.\n \nA statue to Leonard Cheshire and Sue Ryder would remind us of heroism in war (particluarly of RAF Bomber Command), the importance of dedicated voluntary support of the needy and of the value of a stong marriage - an inspiration to us all.",
