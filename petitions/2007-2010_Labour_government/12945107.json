        "background": "The government has a duty to resist the calculated dumbing down of publicly funded entertainment implied in the replacement of an expert judge on BBC's \"Strictly Come Dancing\" by someone with no expertise in ballroom dancing.  There are enough silly programmes judged by celebrities and Strictly must not be added to the list.  Therefore either Arlene Philiips must be restored to the panel or she must be replaced by someone with expert credentials.",
