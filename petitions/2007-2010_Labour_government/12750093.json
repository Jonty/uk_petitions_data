I am an \"average\" citizen and both myself and my husband have confidence in you.People are fed up with politicians not with you! People DO realise that people are resigning before they are asked to go to try to distract from their own mistakes. The loses in the elections yesterday were because people are disillusioned by MP's not by you. I believe it would do you no harm to actually stand up and say this. Ordinary people can see what is happening and you need to connect with us.Every day I hear the same thing being said by the people I work with. I believe as do many others that if you connected directly to ordinary citizens you would still have their support. It would be nice to see a politician actually start to answer people's questions again honestly and directly. If you did this you could completely reverse the current situation. Trust the people because believe me whatever the papers say the people do still trust you. \nbest wishes\nKaren El-Shirbini",
