        "background": "The 1p & 2p coins are redundant, there is little if anything which costs such a small amount now and it cannot be cost effective to produce these coins anymore.\nMany people just throw them away, even supermarkets are now ditching the .99p price tags in favour of the 'round pound' and everything could be priced at .95p if required.\nThe 5p coin is almost the same in size as the old 1/2p which was abolished back in the 1970s and can now take it's place as Britain's lowest monetary denomination.\nIt is time for the copper coins to be banished to history.",
