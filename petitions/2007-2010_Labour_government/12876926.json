Becoming Prime Minister is a great achievement, but his has been a poisoned chalice, and somewhat of his own making.  He has but little time to turn this around, but he needs to be better advised.  There are many apolitical people in this land who only care for its success.  Support them, not the spin doctors.  The public are crying out for this, but they don't really want the moat-cleaning Tories in whatever form they take.",
