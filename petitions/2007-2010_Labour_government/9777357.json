        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Some people campaign for such material to be on our televisions on the following grounds: \n\n1) it would give viewers more personal choice but even soft-core pornography, let alone hard-core, can lead to rape; what about the \"personal choice\" of (mostly) women not to suffer this appalling crime?!  (The reason I say pornography can lead to rape is that it presents (again mostly) women as sex objects; i.e. objects to be used for sex in the same way as this computer is currently being used as an object to create this petition).\n\n2) It would, apparently, lead to a more grown-up attitude to sexual entertainment; what's entertaining about seeing someone being exploited for various appalling sexual acts?  And it seems the REVERSE of \"grown-up\" to want to see such images.\n\n3) Apparently soft-core pornography falls short of what responsible adults want to see; if they're THAT responsible shouldn't they consider the possible CONSEQUENCES of viewing such horrendous images?\n\nI personally am opposed even to \"soft-core\" pornography since even that seems to me to degrade and endanger women. And I am TOTALLY opposed to ANY extension to hard-core.",
