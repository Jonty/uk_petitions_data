            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Tonight, at Full Council, Lambeth Labour Group will push through a 15% rent rise for council tenants as well as a 5% increase in depooled service charges whilst reserving the right to further increase rent during the financial year.  Meanwhile, council housing stock continues to deteriorate in quality and services to tenants have been slashed.  We call on the Labour Government to countermand this iniquitous proposal which can only lead to increased worklessness, child poverty and fuel poverty and will particularly impact those on fixed low incomes, the disabled and key workers who also face below inflation rises in income due to the recession.",
