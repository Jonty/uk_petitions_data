            "background": "It can be reasonably assumed that it is acceptable for the government to curtail the freedom of speech of people who wish to stir up hatred against people who do not share their beliefs. As such I would like to propose a ban on Anti-Tobacco campaigning on the grounds that it often promotes hatred towards tobacco companies, their owners and their customers, as well as other groups whom do not share their views.\n\nAnti-Tobacco campaigners often intentionally cause me and many others a great deal of alarm and distress by placing under threat our ability to conveniently purchase tobacco products (which would thereby cause us to suffer from withdrawal symptoms) and telling us we are going to die. It is unacceptable for someone to intentionally cause another alarm and distress. Anti-Tobacco campaigning must be banned.",
