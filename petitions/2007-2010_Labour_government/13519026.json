It will put practising herbalists out of work. It will render degree qualifications in herbal medicine worthless.\n\nThe consultation ends on November 2nd. \n\nWe, the undersigned, demand that the Prime Minister intercedes on our behalf to ensure properly trained and qualified practitioners are allowed to become \"authorised persons\" and continue the delivery of herbal medicine.",
