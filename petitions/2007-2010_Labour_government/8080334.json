            "background": "Medulloblastoma is a specific kind of brain tumour that usually affects children. Approximately 20% of brain tumours are Medulloblastomas. \n\nMedulloblastomas are treated using a combination of Surgery, Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy. In the UK, this treatment approach is only 20% effective, which means that 80 out of 100 patients die of Medulloblastoma within 5 years.\n\nParents of children who suffer from Medulloblastomas are looking for alternative options and some are taking their children abroad for treatments. Many parents however, such as the parents of Callum Kaye, whose story was shown on BBC News, simply cannot afford expensive treatments abroad and have to go through time-consuming channels to fundraise, while their child's health continues to deteriorate. \n\nFurther research in the UK is vital for children who suffer from medulloblastoma tumours. \n\nThe requested duration for this petition is short, because the time that these children have is short. I am sure that the number of signatures will be large nonetheless.",
