        "background": "Barclays Bank have demonstrated the disdain in which they hold the taxpayer of the UK by the totally insensitive expenditure of over half a million pounds on a training junket and party in the same week as hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer money has been pumped into their organisation.  The people need to be given an opportunity to say whether or not they are prepared to allow our government to continue to deal with Barclays Bank.  I for one will vote that they should no longer be eligible for any taxpayer funded contracts or other taxpayer funded financial dealings.",
