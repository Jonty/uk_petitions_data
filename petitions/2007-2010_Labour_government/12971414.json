            "background": "Its written as part of the licence of Global Gathering Festival at Long Marston Airfield, that no alcohol can be taken into the event site. All other major festivals allow alcohol to be taken into the campsite, but not the area where the music is. I petition the government to intervene and allow the customers of Global Gathering a level playing field with customers of all other major festivals. \n\nIn times of a recession its madness that people camping have to pay over inflated prices for alcohol, or even water and soft drinks at a festival. \n\nAll we ask is that we can take a reasonable amount of alcohol into the campsite, so that we can enjoy the festival without spending hundreds upon hundreds of pounds each once we arrive.",
