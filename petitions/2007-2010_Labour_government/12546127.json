            "background": "Darren Fletcher, a man who sums up all that is great about this country, was dealt the harshest of blows. The unjust red card he received robs him of his chance to play in the Champions League Final. If Gordon Brown doesn't turn his attention from this so-called 'financial crisis' or these phoney wars he's fighting to campaigning for justice for Darren, then it's a very sad day for this once great country. A very sad day indeed.",
