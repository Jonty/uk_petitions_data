        "background": "The government has failed to tackle the spiralling costs and benefits of the public sector pension schemes, with final salary schemes being a huge financial burden supported by the tax payer, and the retirement age/service legnth minimums favouring those in public service, again at the detriment of the tax payer. \n\nAll new public sector employees should come into line with the private sector as pay scales have clearly equalised over the years and therefore they are no longer justifiable. Final salary schemes should no longer be offered.",
