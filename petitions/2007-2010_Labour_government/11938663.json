The promises of improving Midlothian sounds all very well, but underneath these promises there is a very sinister scheme called \u2018Single Status\u2019 this new status will see many council employees loosing hundreds of pounds from their salaries.  Many Midlothian Council employees are already on poor wages and many just meeting above the minimum wage. Ironically, the Council\u2019s top earners (Chef Executives and so on) are to be excluded from the new \u2018Single Status\u2019scheme.",
