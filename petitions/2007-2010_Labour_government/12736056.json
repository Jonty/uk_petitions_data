            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The hard working members of society have gladly contributed tothe welfare system for those who genuinely require support toreceive their basic needs. However, there are some on StateBenefits, who receive the benefit of council properties - hard working families do not receive similar benefits on mortgage payments. The tax payer also funds the MP\u2019s expenses for their second homes, which is of a ludicrous amount and waste of tax payers hard earned money. While the tax payer struggles to pay their mortgage and the ever increasing costs of living. I would like to see legislation that provides an income tax rebate/relief on the monies we pay into our mortgages. The rebate could be paid directly into our mortgages as an overpayment or directly into our bankaccounts. The government claim they wish to encourage more people to purchase their own homes. They also claim to be doing more for hard working families, with the failing Working Family Tax Credits scheme. This proposal will provide an incentive to own your own home. This would give back something tangible and noteworthy to the hard working citizens of the UK.",
