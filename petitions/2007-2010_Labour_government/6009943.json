        "background": "It is indefensible that our water supply, which should be a service, now has to make a profit, first and foremost, for it's shareholders. It is neither fair nor just that a commodity as basic as water should be subject to the vagaries of profit for the few, at the cost to the many. Baroness Young has stated that water rates will have to rise to pay for the infrastructure our water industry badly needs, but this should be planned and dealt with centrally, not piecemeal to the lowest bidder, with an eye to the highest profit margin.",
