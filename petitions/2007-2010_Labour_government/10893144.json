            "background": "We have all been affected by the credit crunch and  stock market. This is in spite of long established and experienced banks, our Government and the Financial Services Authority. The folly of these instutions in allowing collossal loans and paying mouth-watering bonuses in spite of poor executive performances leaves the common man reeling and aghast.\nThis is a plea for a Commission chaired by and composed of the men/women-in-the street. We are the ones who have subscribed to these financial institutions and now as taxpayers we are to bail them out.\nAny commission which contains bankers, FSA members or politicians is already stained with the financial blood spewing from the various sources.  It will undoubtedly attempt to 'protect' custom and practice which has led us down Melt-down Alley.\nSo, let the People decide the controls they wish to see invoked. Never again should we see loans/mortgages of nonsensical proportions handed out.(Whoever heard of a 125% mortgage!)\nGive me your support.",
