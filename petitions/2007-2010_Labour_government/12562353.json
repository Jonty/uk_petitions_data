        "background": "It has become clear both the taxpayer and the ministers of parliament have an interest in abolishing the current expense claim system for ministers of parliament. Addition to the MP's fixed salary of an average of all current expense claims should suffice to operate both from London and from a constituency. To give the over expending MP's time to change their lifestyle the measure is proposed to take effect in 2011.",
