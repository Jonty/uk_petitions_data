        "background": "I find it unbelievable that we can work for a company for anything up to a year and be dismissed even if you have done nothing wrong with no course of action open to us due to this moronic law.I have worked for several employers who after using my services for just under a year have then just terminated my employment because they knew of the rights I would be entitled to after 12 months. It is unjust that an employer can use your knowledge,skills and experience then fire you without warning or explanation.The one year rule should be reduced to three months.",
