        "background": "We the undersigned wish for the government to drastically reduce the Duty on UK Petrol costs, and drop the increase on road tax. The high costs are driving us all into a financial mess.\nI myself drive a long way to get to and from work each day, and the cost of petrol each month is starting to match the cost of my rent! So we wish the Duty to be reduced, otherwise before long, it will force us into a credit crisis as we would need to fund our petrol costs for travelling!\n\nFailing that, create an incentive allowing people to afford to buy hybrid cars.",
