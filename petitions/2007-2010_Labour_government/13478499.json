            "background": "I think it IS ridiculous that the government or any government body should restrict access of BBC TV programmes via Iplayer on the Internet to solely the UK , when UK TV licence payers can and do travel abroad and should have the right to view that which they are already paying for through their TV licence fee , ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD , where they have access through the Internet. The facility and technical ability already exists to allow such a thing to happen , the only thing stopping it being the UK government apparently....FREE OUR TV !!",
