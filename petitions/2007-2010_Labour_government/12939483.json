            "background": "Given that the two largest radio platforms in the UK are analogue AM/FM and computers (via Internet Radio and BBC iPlayer and podcasts), we call on the Prime Minister to stop wasting money building the national British Digital Audio Broadcasting 'Digital Radio' infrastructure. Both the existing analogue radio network and the internet already deliver superior sound quality and programme choice, and are also now ubiquitous in homes, businesses and cars, so there is absolutely no need for an another digital platform based on obsolete 1990s technology, contrived at a time before internet radio was possible.",
