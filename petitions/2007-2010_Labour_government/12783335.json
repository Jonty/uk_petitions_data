        "background": "Scientists are agreed that all today\u2019s living organisms have evolved over millions of years from simpler organisms. This evolution is best explained by Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection and its subsequent refinement. Natural selection is the most powerful tool for understanding living things.\n\nThe current draft curriculum includes living things but omits evolution and natural selection. These ideas are needed to lay a foundation for later studies and to help children see their place in the living world and the universe.",
