DSA are proposing a \u00a320.00 hike in the current motorcycle test fee to meet the capital costs incurred. This increase will act as a real deterrent to those wishing to obtain a licence to ride a motorcycle. The petitioner believes that capitol costs incurred in developing new test sites should be funded from other sources and not passed on to users.",
