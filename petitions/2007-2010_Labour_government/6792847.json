            "background": "The local authority has allowed for a significant level of new housing and commercial building to take place over the past 20 years with no matching improvement in the road infrastructure. The local authority also has plans to build another 8,000 new houses in the locality with nothing specified as to how people will be able to move about with a reasonable level of fluidity. Stoke Gifford is also the location for a mainline station (Bristol Parkway) and has a number of educational establishments in the immediate vicinity. The problem of extensive traffic chaos is a  cause of avoiadable pollution.",
