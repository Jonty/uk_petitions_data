            "background": "Many organisations have registered as a CIC as an alternative to becoming a charity, thanks to the promotion of CIC status by Government.\nWe CICs now find ourselves being squeezed out of many charitable funding streams that were supposed to remain open to us. Government legislation for rates relief states it is only for organisations registered with the Charities Commission, which excludes CICs.\nSo this is the dilema I am asking you to petition Government to resolve: Currently, we are trading for charitable purposes, with a charitable asset lock, existing on diminishing funds whilst trying to increase company income. What we need is for government to do what they said they would at the start of CIC registration i.e. make public the status of CICs to all statutory bodies to enable all organisations, registered with the CIC Regulator, to access the financial gains allowed to organisations registered with the Charities Commission.\nIf Government has a problem with this, let them check the Management wages bills of large and National charities and see where a lot of funding goes!",
