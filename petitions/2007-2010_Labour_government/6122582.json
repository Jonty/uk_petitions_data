You won't have this ability until 2034 and it wouldn't be right for me to try and educate even the most eminent physicists you have today. This time I am only here for a fleeting visit and don't know enough of the technology regarding the machine, I am just here to pick up data. I urge the governments of the world to release information into the public domain so that time travel will become widely accepted and not feared.",
