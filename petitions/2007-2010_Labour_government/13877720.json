            "background": "Time and time again are children are victims of Paedophiles. Young lives, there families and loved ones have there lives wrecked because of the actions of one individual. This happens to often with no change in site. There is a simple reason for this the law is wrong. What is the good of a sex offenders register if us the parents aren't aloud to know when there is a paedophile in our area. How can we protect are children from them? why are these people given new identities, places to live and all the protection they could ever want when all the majority of them will do is re offend again and again? What protection is there for our children against this? When an allegation is made whether these people are innocent or guilty, should they be released on bail with no form of monitoring at all? aright some get falsely accused and that's a fact with any crime but more stringent measures should be adhered to until the truth is determined one way or another. Please support us.",
