            "background": "I have just come back from Taiwan where in Taipei city they have 3 rubbish collections a day . Two collections are for the public and one at night is for business's . The great thing about these collections is that they have 2 or 3 vehicles collecting different types of waste , separating the recylced waste into different containers. Residents know the drill and it becomes a very enjoyable communal  thing ! Being daily assures that food can be reused and rats and flies have less to live and breed on .",
