        "background": "The current information provided to students and their parents is misleading. It is suggested that the loan is interest free and only increases in line with inflation.\n\nAlthough true, it does not make clear that a student leaving university with a \u00a320k plus loan will see their loan increase by around  \u00a3100 per month (compounded).\n\nThese crippling increases are further \"hidden\" by examples suggesting that a newly qualified student earning \u00a318k p.a. pays off their loan at a rate of around \u00a330 per month.\n\nSuch a \"payment\" does not even service the interest and their loan will continue to increase by around \u00a370 per month under those circumstances\n\nInformation given to prospective students should clearly identify the annual salary required to service a maximum loan so students can make an informed decision about whether the costs of obtaining a degree are sustainable and worthwhile",
