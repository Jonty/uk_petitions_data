            "background": "Motorcycle laws are tough enough and forcing pillion riders to undergo training, incurring more cost to tax payers, motorcycle owners and pillion riders should not be enforced. The motorcycle owners should be held completely responsible for minors riding pillion. Adult pillion riders fully accountable for their actions and willingness to ride pillion. Dress codes forcing riders, pillion or therwise, is an infringement of freedom of choice. While I understand the need for protection while riding not everyone wants to look like a power ranger in full leathers or other matching riding gear. Individuality and freedom of choice should not be ignored.",
