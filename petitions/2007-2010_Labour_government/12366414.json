            "background": "Tenbury Wells was flooded a number of times in 2007 and again in 2008. This historic small market town, with a population of less than 4,000, cannot be expected to fund its own flood defences. \nParticularly during an economic downturn, it is important that Central Government undertakes public sector works that will produce benefits that last for years. Flood defences fall into this category.\nThe town has been badly hit by so many floods in such a short time. Funding for permanent flood defences should be provided without further delay.\nA Flood Defence scheme has already been drawn up. The projected cost is \u00a35 million. While this would be a very large amount for the residents of such a small town to raise, it is an insignificant amount when compared to total government spending.",
