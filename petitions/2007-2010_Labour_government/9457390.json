            "background": "The govt & the advisory council on the misuse of drugs fail to offer equal protection to persons using drugs. Property rights that exist with alcohol and tobacco indicate incorrectly these are less harmful than many drugs which carry no such property rights to manufacture/distribute/possess. The responsible use argument is applied to alcohol but not drugs such as cannabis without justification. This discrimination against persons choosing less harmful drugs over alcohol and tobacco causes harm to all by misguidance to unscheduled drug users and persecution of scheduled drug users. This discrimination isn't recognised by the Equality and Human Rights Commission which entrenches a contemporary narrow understanding of what is, and what is not, discrimination. The equality issue is an evolving process where yesterdays common practice is today's criminal activity (see discrimination against blacks, women and gays).\n\nI advocate the responsible licensing of all such drugs, and any controls should be strictly evidence-based, not to \"send signals\" and consistent.",
