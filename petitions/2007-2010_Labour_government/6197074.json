A site owner is allowed to divide his/her bill equally between the number of homes on the site. This means that a single occupier will pay the same as a family for his or her water even having used only a fraction of the amount used be a family. It also allows a site owner to pass on increased charges due to leaks in the park water system. Thus the occupiers pay for water that none of them have used!",
