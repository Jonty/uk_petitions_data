        "background": "A child crashed his bike into my car badly scratching the paintwork. The parents refused to pay for the damage and the child was too young to be prosecuted. \n\nTherefore I propose:\n\n1. Damage caused by children's cycling accidents is covered by household contents insurance.\n\n2. If the parents do not have household contents insurance then they are fined \u00a31,000 plus the cost of repairing the damage. The child is then banned from cycling on public property for a period of one year. If caught cycling whilst banned, the parents are fined another \u00a31,000 and the ban extended a further year.",
