            "background": "I urge The Prime Minister to push through a private members bill by Mr. Nigel Warterson.\nSummary of the Bill\nThe Bill would make provision for residents of care homes and sheltered accommodation to keep domestic pets. It stipulates the  circumstances in which operators of care homes and sheltered accommodation could refuse permission for domestic pets to be kept, and the right of appeal by residents against such a refusal.\n The beneficial effects of allowing old people to take their pets with them when they have to be placed in a home is patently obvious. It is also obvious that the bill is a cross party bill, therefore I urge the PM to assist in any way he can.",
