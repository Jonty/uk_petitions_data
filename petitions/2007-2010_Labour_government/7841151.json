        "background": "Caravans would be allowed to travel only between the hours of Midnight and 6am . This would reduce traffic jams. Make the roads safer as drivers wouldn't be tempted to take risks by overtaking them.  This would make car and lorry drivers calmer and less likely to make driving errors. If caravaners got tired they would be able to pull over as they had their bed with them.\nIt would impove caravaners image of being kindly to other drivers.",
