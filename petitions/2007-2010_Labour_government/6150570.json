            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition is to allow firearms certificate holders to buy or sell air cartridge guns.\n\nSince 2004 no one (even with an FAC) is allowed to buy or sell an air cartridge gun, which quite frankly is unjust as people prior to the date were allowed to register their Brococks under FAC.\n\nThis means there are hundreds of air target shooters who are not allowed to own an air cartridge gun. Whilst a lucky few are.\n\nConversion problems under FAC would be non-existent and you would allow a large amount of law abiding shooters to enjoy the quality, reliability and experience of air cartridge shooting.",
