            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "S.139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 includes an exemption for carrying \"folding pocketknives\" in public places.\n\nLater, it was decided that a folding pocketknife with a blade that locks open is a fixed bladed knife, and not covered under the exemption. This is a very hard piece of legislation to find, and I fear there are thousands of people who regularly carry a locking knife (with no intention of using it as a weapon) that are unaware they're breaking the law. \n\nI believe the judge's interpretation goes against the spirit and intention of the law, and places unreasonable restrictions on the public with regard to the choice of pocketknife they can carry for day-to-day chores.\n\nAny knife carried with the intention to be used as a weapon is illegal under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953, so overruling the judge's interpretation shouldn't have a detrimental affect on combatting those who carry knives as weapons.\n\nIf it is decided that folding knives with a locking mechanism are to keep their legal status as fixed-bladed knives, I would at least wish this to be made clear in statute law, rather than remaining obscured in some case ruling.",
