If people come to live in our country they must accept our laws. Our laws have evolved from a Judeo/Christian root. Treating different people in different ways sets a very dangerous precedent. Stop pushing us down a multiculturalistic pathway. It certainly is degrading towards woman as in sharia law, woman are worth only half what a man's worth. God forbid.",
