I suggest a need to set up a panel of parents who have used and are still using the tax credits system. The panel can give Ministers information first hand at what can be done to change the system for the better. Surely it would only be fair to listen to both sides of the story and not just receiving advise from the tax credits teams. Suggesting a solution I hope is better than simply complaining. In Business companies look to take feedback in order to change things for the better,",
