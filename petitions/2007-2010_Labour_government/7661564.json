            "background": "Throughout mainland Europe it is possible to travel without hinderance from one member state to another, this makes life a whole lot easier when it comes to commerce or holidays, freight can move freely within the EU and is only delayed when entering or leaving the UK. It is necessary in todays climate to be vigilant when it comes to national security so I propose that vehicles and persons are stopped and searched randomly but all passport formalities for EU citizens are recinded as is the case in mainland Europe.",
