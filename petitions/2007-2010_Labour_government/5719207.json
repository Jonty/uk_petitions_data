Recently public developers (Modus) have decided to take away one of Newport's biggest pieces of history! This history is known as the Chartist Mural and is one of artist Kenneth Budds best work ever.It took him ages to design make and move it and his son Oliver Budd wants to scrap it and create another one.This is ok but the thing that really annoys me is the fact that when he makes the new one it will cost more money to pay him than it would to move it apparently!",
