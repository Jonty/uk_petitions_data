            "background": "Have you had enough of being intimidated by groups of young louts hanging aroung(in ALL areas of the UK)?. \nWhere are the new community support officers after 7.00pm, tucked up in bed?\nGet them off the streets after 8.00pm, take them home and make the parents aware that hanging aroung smoking,swearing and annoying good hard working paeple is NOT on!!!\nI'm sick to death of the stupid softly, softly approach that does NOT work with these people and there kids, they have to be taught the right way to bring up kids with a social concience and to respect your neighbours.\nBelieve me, kids that hang aroung the streets are the ones who will end up doing petty crime through boredom and with no authority to teach them will end up with the knives and guns, they are not scared of anybody including the police!!!. Tougher sanctions needed NOW or this place(the UK) will become desperate very soon. \nIf you think this is too strong have a look around next time your out at the graffiti,smashed bus shelters,etc. Also after dark the yobs hanging around.\nPeople are scared of 13yr olds and this can't be right can it?",
