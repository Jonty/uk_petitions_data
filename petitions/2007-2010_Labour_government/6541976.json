        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "456,000 or one in every 131 people in the UK has epilepsy, with more people diagnosed each day!\n\nEach time someone has an epileptic fit they have to wait a minimum of a year, some times two years to get their driving license back.\n\nFair enough, some people it will take that long to regain stability, others will be fine the next day but still have to wait a year to drive again.\n\nThis not only changes someone\u2019s life in that they can no longer go out or they need to move home to continue a normal life. This can also seriously affect someone\u2019s chances of normal career progression and singles people out to be the person \u201cnot to get the job\u201d in a job interview.\n\nI therefore ask for this petition to consider allowing doctors the right to choose, on a case by case basis, when a person with epilepsy can drive.\n\nThis will increase the chances of someone\u2019s road to recovery and progression with a normal life.",
