            "background": "Bowel cancer screening is given to men and women aged between 60 and 69 years of age. \n\nIf people have been diagnosed as having colitis or crohns disease, that doctors generally agree as increasing the risk of cancer, there is a problem.\n\nPatients are disqualified from having the test on an anonymous basis by the system.\n\nI believe that if a person has a long standing bowel disease they should be given a cancer test when they want it.\n\nThe National Asociation of Colitis and Crohns Disease have confirmed that people with IBD are excluded from the bowel cancer screening programme, and so has the NHS.\n\nPlease support this petition and lets cut the 16,000 bowel cancer deaths in the uk, using a simple test that can be done at home.",
