            "background": "We believe that the most ageist employers are the public sector(government departments,local authorities, emergency services and quangos). To change this and put the anti age laws into practice we need to know what the current situation is. The best, easist, cheapest way to start is through an audit of each public sector organisation's employees and recruitment over the last year, broken down into those under 25, 25 - 49 and 50+. This would show how far their employment policies result in equal employment opportunities, regardless af age, It is easy to carry out and publicise and will provide an opprtunity for good employers to promote their best practice and shame ageist public sector organisations into changing their approach to recruitment, retention and employee diversity. It should also encourage other employers to follow suit.",
