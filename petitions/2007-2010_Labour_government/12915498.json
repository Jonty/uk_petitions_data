            "background": "Britain needs to adapt laws regarding spaceflight, so that this unique opportunity is not missed. The President of Virgin Galactic has stated:\n\n\"Lossiemouth would be an ideal location for polar injection of satellites. It could give Britain its own responsive space capability. But the one thing that America has that nobody else has - although the Swedes are close to it - is the legislation which allows our system to be built and operated. That was the vision the United States fulfilled with the Commercialisation of Space Amendment Act, and a vision [the UK] is failing to fulfil at the moment. \"\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister/Government to adapt UK law to entice Virgin Galactic to build their spacepoint in Great Britain. This would be a huge boom to the tourist and manufacturing industry in the country.",
