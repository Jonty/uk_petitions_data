        "background": "As we all know Terry Wogan is one of the only reasons why people tune in to watch the Eurovision song contest but he cannot commentate forever. \nWhen he leaves it will be very hard to find an adequate replacement but there is one specimen that might just do the job, that is the amazing Dustin the Turkey.\n\nThis year he was unfairly and unjustly booted out of the Eurovision song contest at the semi final stage. His song was moving and inspirational and really highlighted the problems surrounding the political voting in the competition. To give Dustin the appreciation he deserves he should be the next commentator of Eurovision for the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.",
