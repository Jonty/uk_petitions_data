Such a tiny thing does get votes but when it comes to things like...\n\nThe war in Iraq and Afghanistan,\nthe Lisbon treaty, the European Union and even who our actual prime minister is!!  These things are not important enough for the public majority but a simple congestion charge is?\n\nPrime minister LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE!\n\n1, Hold a general election.\n2, Pull the troops out.\n3, Give a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.",
