            "background": "Drug experts have advised against changing this inspirational drug to a class B but the government has chosen to ignore this advice. The number of people taking Cannabis has fallen since its legalisation and putting the drug up a class will simply mean that it will be associated more with crime and harder drugs such as cocaine, making users of cannabis far more likely to use these harder substances. Nothing more than a higher crime right will be achieved in this decision to make a drug that is little if at all more harmful than alchohol or tobacco.",
