        "background": "It's easy to spend too much and leave yourself short on a debit card and rack up more spend than you would have liked on a credit card. This is due to users often not being exactly sure of their current balance on a use by use basis. People should have the option every time they use a card to see their remaining balance after the transaction has taken place on a chip and pin device in order to better manage their finances. This could work with a simple \"Please remove your card or press 1 to see your balance\" message that would clear as soon as the card is removed. Reducing overspend reduces debt.",
