        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I would like to ask the prime minister to abolish parking fees on meterd parking places everywhere in the UK. This would encourage people to come back to the city centres and begin shopping again. Parking fees for short trips into town centres only serve to discourage shoppers bothering at all. This would have a greater effect on kickstarting consumer  spending than the 2.5% reduction in the VAT rate at a much lower cost. Most shoppers hate paying for parking. Allow everyone a maximum of 2hours with the same fines for exceeding the time limit. This would have the effect of increasing the \"turnover\" of shoppers and thereby increase consumer spending and perhaps add a little to the \"kickstart\" that the economy so badly needs. Sometimes it's the little changes that make the big difference and so often go overlooked.",
