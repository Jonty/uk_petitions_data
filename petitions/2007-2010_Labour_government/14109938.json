            "background": "Virginmedia have demonstrated they are unable, or unwilling to invest in their cable infrastructure resulting in extremely poor service for its customers.\nWhilst there are other Internet Service Providers in the market, these use an existing BT circuit.  We would like the Prime Minister to extend this facility to Virginmedia\u2019s  fibre-optic network which in our view would provide two clear benefits.\n1. An easy means of switching suppliers should customers wish to move away from Virginmedia  without having to use the BT network.\n\n2. Open the cable network inherited by virginmedia with the takeover of NTL to investment and companies willing to invest in the Country\u2019s data networks",
