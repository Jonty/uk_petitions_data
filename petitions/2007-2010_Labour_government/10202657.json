            "background": "My Labrador Puppy, 'Tinto', demands that she be granted at least 1 hour per day of tummy tickling by law. She is likely, should her demands not be met, to organise a general strike of all Chocolate Brown Labrador Puppies; ths causing general mayhem and economic woe to the country (so she argues). I therefore urge the citizenry of the Country to unite behind Tinto's demands.",
