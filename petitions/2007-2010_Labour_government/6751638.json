            "background": "We are deeply concerned about proposals to close our local Post Office in Brackenborough Road, Louth, Lincs, which gives a valuable service to the local community with unfailing courtesy, humour and friendliness.\n\nMany regulars use the Office for pension payments and Post Office services. Also, for those who are disabled, the ability to park close to the Post Office is important. While pensions can be paid into bank accounts, this removes the direct access to cash which the Post Office provides, and which many people need.\n\nShould the closure happen, the only Post Office in Louth will be further away, in an area notoriously bad for parking, and with queues frequently reaching out to the street, with attendant delays in service.\n\nIt is understood that like the others in Louth, Brackenborough Road is a profitable Post Office How, therefore, can closing it save money?",
