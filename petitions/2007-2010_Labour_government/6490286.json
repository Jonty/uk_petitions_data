            "background": "As proved by the recent womens world cup the game needs to be a paid profession if we are to stand a chance of matching the likes of the USA or the old enemy Germany. As well as they did,if the England ladies were professional then they could have been the first England team to win a major trophy since 1966. I think this country is underachieving in sports, and it's simply due to no support from organisations and the fact that these athletes have to devote their time between their sports and jobs.",
