            "background": "Dear Sirs\n\nWhen are we going to receive a realistic amount in relation to Jobseekers Allowance the amount is impossible to live on.  I receive \u00a3128 a fortnight and live in a \u00a3900 a month privately rented home for which I receive \u00a3600 housing benefit.  I have tried and tried to get a job and yet there is nothing to help people who are born and bred in this country.  I am a British Citizen who has lived in this country all my life and yet I am treated like a second class citizen.  When are you going to realise that charity begins at home and pay people an amount they are able to live on.  It is totally ridiculous that people like me have to suffer from your bad leadership skills.\n\nSusan Metson",
