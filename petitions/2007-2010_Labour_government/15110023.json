            "background": "Too many non resident parents are able to get away with paying the minimum amount of child maintenance because they are falsifying their income and not providing a true account of their financial situation.  The onus is on the resident parent to provide evidence to the CSA that the non-resident parent's lifestyle differs to that of their provided income.  It is impossible to provide evidence if the non-resident parent is absent, has no contact with the child and the resident parent is not aware of his whereabouts.  How is this fair?  \n\nAll absent parents should be expected to pay a minimum of \u00a350.00 per week if they are employed or self-employed.  The resident parent supports their child/ren on a low income so why is a non-resident parent only expected to pay \u00a35.00?\n\nChange the rules now!",
