            "background": "Currently companies charge a premium which can be 50% or more for holidays outside of term time.  This only encourages families to holiday during term time due to tighter and tighter family budgets.  It is unfair to crimilise families in these circumstances.  Holidy companies should be enforced to ensure that the price diference is no more than 10% for the same holiday over the year.  An  exception could be made when the holiday is sold within 4 weeks of departure. where the difference can be more.",
