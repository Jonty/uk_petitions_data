            "background": "With the Digital Switchover happening in many areas of the UK already, I think that the Government has a basic right to provide us with free Freeview Boxes (so we can receive Digital Channels) to everyone paying their Television Licence. I believe this because we are being forced to buy these expensive boxes and at the same time paying for our TV Licences. Therefore, if I do not have a freeview box in the future, yet am paying my TV licence, surely I'm not being provided the service I'm paying for if I can't receive these channels?\nLets Make Freeview truly Free.",
