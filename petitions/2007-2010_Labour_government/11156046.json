            "background": "In order to prevent a repeat of the current financial crisis take careful heed of the Yale Economics Professor's advice as aired on You & Yours this morning 27 Nov 08.  In addition outlaw the reposession of family homes, except as a last resort after an arbitration system. Mortgagees should be required to approach their lender in the earliest stages of financial problems but on the missing of just one payment the lender must be obliged to call in an independant arbitrator to negotiate a solution involving an affordable rate and schedule over a 2 or 3 year period or until normal payments can be resumed. Alternatively the property may be rented to the incumbants.Outstanding monies from this period would be paid in additional months added to the loan term.  Only where it is impossible to reach any reasonable solution in the arbitrator's view would the lender be able to reposess and even then must allow the family to pay rent until the property is actually sold. The profiteering currently at the expense of the poor and disposessed is unacceptable in a modern society. This measure would ensure no more sub prime lending.",
