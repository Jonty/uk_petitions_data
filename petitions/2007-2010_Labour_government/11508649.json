        "background": "Due to the enormous strain being placed upon animal rescue shelters, and the lack of real accountability of animal breeders.\nI seek to ask this government to raise a means of vetting persons or organisations who seek to profit from animal breeding.\nFurthermore, I would urge this government to license all persons who would seek to profit from such a trade.\nI feel it would restrict the growth of \"council house breeders\" who only seek to earn an illegal income whilst claiming government benefits.",
