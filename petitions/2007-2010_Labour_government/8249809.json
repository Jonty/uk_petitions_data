        "background": "Let's face the facts:\n- Pastafarianism hasn't started any wars. Other religions have.\n- Pastafarianism is as likely to be true as any other religion.\n- The Flying Spaghetti Monster teaches us to treat all others equally. Many religions don't, including Christianity.\nYet it is still discriminated against simply for the apparent humour wrongly associated with the concept of a carbohydrate-based deity. This has to stop. I propose that Pastafarianism in the UK gets as much recognition and governmental funding as the other religions.\nDoes the age of a religion make it any more or less true? Of course not.",
