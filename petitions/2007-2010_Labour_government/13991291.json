As a result, many tenants now feel badly let down.\n\nThe Decent Homes programme has improved the lives of tenants in some of the worst housing in the country. It has also created and sustained many jobs and apprenticeships. Diverting funding will put many of these at risk.\n\nALMOs are calling on the Government to stand by its pledge to council tenants whose housing conditions are amongst the worst in the country.",
