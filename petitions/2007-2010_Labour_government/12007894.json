            "background": "We would question why Ryanair are able to charge per person rather than per booking when you use a credit/debit card to make your payment. \nI believe it is not right and would question why the FSA have not picked up that individuals are being charged for how many seats they have booked and not the fact it is a single transaction. Surely there must be something in the consumer credit act that only allows one fee per transaction.",
