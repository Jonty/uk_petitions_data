            "background": "Over the last 5 years I have had to have the police involved in my life through other peoples actions towards me and my family. On both occasions there has been a strong case built against the perpetrator and each time the CPS has either decided not to prosecute or to drop the charge down so that the punishment no where near matches the crime.  I want people to be able to have the power to say that is simply not good enough, at this moment in time the perpetrator has more say in the cases than the victim and this is wrong.  Victims should have a chance to ask for cases to be looked at again.  Victims should be able to feel like justice is being done, often people feel they have been let down by the CPS but there is no where to go and no one to talk to. Victims need rights too!",
