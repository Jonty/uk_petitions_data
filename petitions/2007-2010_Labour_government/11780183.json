        "background": "The preventable deaths of Baby P & all like him are a clear indictment of Britain's failure to protect vulnerable children & too frequent over-lenient sentences for child abuse & related deaths convey that as a nation we tolerate such abuse & murder.\n\nEffective measures need to be adopted to recognise & tackle child abuse at its earliest stages. Lord Laming's recommendations excluded how Social Workers could better perform their jobs on the front line when visiting children at risk, where improvements & clear nationwide guidelines are urgently needed!\n\nThe ongoing abuse of a child culminating in their death is far worse than outright murder. So all child abuse related deaths should carry a discretionary life sentence & all participants are equally responsible regardless of who did the abuse & who allowed the abuse to go on unchallenged.\n\nAs a nation we wish to say that we will no longer tolerate these heinous crimes against our youngest & most vulnerable.\n\n*Abuse includes neglect",
