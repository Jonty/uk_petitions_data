Lord Laming's recommendations excluded how Social Workers could better perform their jobs on the front line when visiting children at risk, where improvements & clear nationwide guidelines are urgently needed!\n\nThe ongoing abuse of a child culminating in their death is far worse than outright murder. So all child abuse related deaths should carry a discretionary life sentence & all participants are equally responsible regardless of who did the abuse & who allowed the abuse to go on unchallenged.\n\nAs a nation we wish to say that we will no longer tolerate these heinous crimes against our youngest & most vulnerable.\n\n*Abuse includes neglect",
