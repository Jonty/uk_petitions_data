            "background": "The forced sacking of drugs policy adviser David Nutt is an abhorrent move. Mr Nutt was employed to advise on UK drugs policy and to be independent. He fulfilled that role admirably, being a lone voice of reason on a subject mired in political expedience over common sense, scientific evidence, and fact. To ignore sound advice is foolish, but sacking an adviser for refusing to modify the facts to suit a political stance based on appearance rather than evidence is a development that must be challenged, and reversed. David Nutt must be reinstated, and politics must be removed from drugs law to be replaced by evidence-based policy-making.",
