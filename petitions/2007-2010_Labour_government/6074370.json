If we lose this so called war on terror your grandkids WILL suffer. Bring on a world goverment or body and scrap the United nations as it stands right now.\nGet talking to Russia and China and publically ask them to join NATO or start another military branch which the world could be part of, were not war mongerers we just want a stable and better future for the world. \nWE NEED TO JOIN UP AS A PEOPLE.",
