            "background": "Most Petrol forecourts today record car registration numbers to prevent fuel theft. This system should be expanded so that car registrations are checked against the DVLA database and Motor Insurance databases for valid tax and insurance before petrol can be dispensed. It should be a civil offense to provide fuel to an untaxed and uninsured vehicle. Making the supply of fuel difficult for such vehicles would reduce the number of them on the roads.",
