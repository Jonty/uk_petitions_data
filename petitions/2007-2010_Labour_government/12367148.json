            "background": "This allows people that don't use their car often to save money. So if the car has week-end only use, then you would pay little tax, because you are hardly polluting. If you do alot of miles and pollute alot, or have a vehicle with high fuel consumption, then you would pay more, as expected. This would encourage people to buy more economical cars, to reduce the amount of fuel they use therefore saving money, and it would encourage others to use the vehicle less, because they rather save money.\nGet rid of the yearly tax renewal and include it in everyday petrol use!",
