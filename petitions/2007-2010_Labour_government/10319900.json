        "background": "Due to the ever growing knife and gun crime in this country, we are all eventualy going to be too afraid to step outisde. The youth of this country are slowly becoming out of hand; and parents are not permited to discipline thier children as they once were, due to child cruilty etc. We have have seen due to the lack of discipline Britains youth has got out of hand is growing ever worse. If this continues then we will see more stabbings in our newspapers. I think i can say this for every one, we have seen one too many killings. We need to sort this problem before it gets worse.\n\nSo i propose that we bring back one years National Service for every child, and for them to be then enrolled in September.\n\nI ask you again, do you really want to see more young people being killed? Soon enough it could be your own children.",
