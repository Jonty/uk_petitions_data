She would have now been 14 but suddenly the day came when her life was taken away from her. She was ran over on a London road and the whole point of the petition is to get as many people as possible to sign it so we can take it to our local council to get something done. If you believe you can help then please sign our petition.\nThankyou Fredi Moore and Kayleigh Walls",
