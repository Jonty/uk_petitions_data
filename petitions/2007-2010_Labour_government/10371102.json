This is the woman who destroyed British industry, communities all over the country for generations and created the absence of social housing that exists today as well as the privatisation of our cherised public services. If she has a state funeral it should only be allowed if she is buried alive!\"\n\nLink to Facebook Group: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=19640827930",
