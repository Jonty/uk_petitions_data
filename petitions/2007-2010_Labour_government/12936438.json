            "background": "Many women can spend years suffering excruciating pain, remaining undiagnosed or misdiagnosed by doctors who do not recognise or understand the symptoms of vulvodynia. Vulvodynia makes physical activities difficult for many women, and renders sexual intercourse almost impossible. The cause of vulvodynia is as yet unknown, but the impact on sufferers is clearly visible, ranging from extreme physical pain to depression and relationship breakdowns.",
