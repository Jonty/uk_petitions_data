            "background": "Sentences for prisoners is currently too lenient in all areas. Rapists, paedophiles , murderers and all of the other criminal types that are out there get light sentences so as not to harm their human rights. Well what about the victims of the crimes, at present the country seems to care more for the criminals feelings than that of the victims and their families.\n\nHarsher punishments for crimes, and with life in prison meaning exactly that, is what is needed to deter people from committing crimes. \n\nIf criminals will not abide by societies laws then they should not be released back into the society that they themselves have shunned.\n\nNo luxuries should be provided such as TV, computers and the like.  Prison should be a punishment and not a holiday.",
