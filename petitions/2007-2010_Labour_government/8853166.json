            "background": "Should Britain become the first Western nation to issue bonds approved by Muslim clerics in line with sharia law, which bans conventional loans involving interest payments as \"sinful\". \n\nThe scheme would mark one of the most significant economic advances of sharia law in the non-Muslim world.\"\n\nThe Government is now proposing to do this. However Can I suggest it could prove very dangerous for this country in the long run because the threat of removing money from this country could be held over our heads at any time. With this sort of money it would give Islam a lot of Political clout in this country,would threaten our foreign policy,and then where would our laws be. It could also prove to be very divisive.\n\nIf you agree please sign the petition.",
