            "background": "What are the benefits of Bioethanol? \n\nBioethanol has a number of advantages over conventional fuels. It comes from a renewable resource i.e. crops and not from a finite resource and the crops it derives from can grow well in the UK Another benefit over fossil fuels is the greenhouse gas emissions. The road transport network accounts for 22% of all greenhouse gas emissions and through the use of bioethanol, some of these emissions will be reduced as the fuel crops absorb the CO2 they emit through growing. Also, blending bioethanol with petrol will help extend the life of the UK\u2019s diminishing oil supplies.  By encouraging bioethanol\u2019s use, the rural economy would also receive a boost from growing the necessary crops. Bioethanol is also biodegradable and far less toxic that fossil fuels. \n\nPlease sign if you would like to see this fuel type more widely available and would like our government to help promote it by offering the British road user an incentive to convert.\n\nThankyou for your time and your signature.",
