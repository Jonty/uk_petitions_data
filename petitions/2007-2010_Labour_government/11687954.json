Costs of repairing or replacing traffic lights are high, and cause traffic jams.\n\nLED bulbs save a lot of energy.\n\nSensors can be implemented to dim the street lights slightly if no motion has been detected for a certain period of time.\n\nLess light pollution means we could see the stars at night again. When it's not cloudy that is :)",
