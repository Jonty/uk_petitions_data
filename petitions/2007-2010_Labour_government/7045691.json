Bus and rail companies providing unnecessary servies during non rush hour times.\n3. Government money is spent on ineffiecient roads rather than expansion of heavy rail and construction of light rail systems.\n\nThese are just a few reasons why prices are high and we would like to see the PM do what ever is in his power to reduce fares and expand services.",
