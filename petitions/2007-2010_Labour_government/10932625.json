        "background": "Education can be just too hard for some people. We live in a world of bullies and too much work. A good option is ban homework, but who will allow that! Shortening the school day or week would work. But alas, adults just don't want to listen to childrens pleadings anymore. They don't know how difficult school is for us students.\nSo here is my theory, Make school non-compulsory.\nIt's genius! You go to school when you feel like it, But if you're worried or doing something, just don't go.\nStudents, you know whats right.\nAdults, help your kids out!",
