            "background": "Develop a package of policy measures to provide fairer support for middle-income couples, and mitigate against the emerging culture of developing large families\u2019 on-the-taxpayer (and with the intent to do so).  This brings the benefits system into disrepute. \n\nThe government has said previously that it is not its role to \"influence family formation\".  Perhaps, but it certainly should be incentivising work-ethic as this fundamentally underpins society and the economy.\n\nThe existing system allows those who don\u2019t work to develop fully-funded families as large-as-you-like.  Whereas Middle income families, who do not have riches or substantial benefits to draw upon, are unable to develop such huge families, are not entitled to free housing and would risk losing the roof over there heads to achieve it.\n\nIn summary, the benefits system needs to be fairer for middle incomes (costing many millions) or needs to change promptly to control the emerging culture.",
