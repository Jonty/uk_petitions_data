            "background": "Even though, as a society, we are striving towards gender, racial and disability equality, sometimes, it still seems as though sexism is tolerated (sometimes even encouraged) within our day to day lives. This 'positive' sexism has many wide ranging impacts, from the seemingly innocent men's and ladies' nights at clubs, to outright employment bias. It is wrong that one sex should get preferential treatment over the other, regardless of intention. Women's and men's only clubs are an unwanted leftover of a less enlightened age, as are men's and women's officers(in the absence of a counterpart) within institiutions. We need to recognise as a society that the problem of discrimination cannot be solved with more discrimination, and the problems of 'positive' sexism are a very pressing matter.",
