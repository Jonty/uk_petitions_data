If the MP receives a 2% rise (more likely to be 5%), then the amount of money that constitutes the 2% (e.g \u00a3750) should go into a fund for good causes, lets get our MP's supporting good causes, and show that they are here for the good of the country, not personal gain.\n\n(all figures are estimated)",
