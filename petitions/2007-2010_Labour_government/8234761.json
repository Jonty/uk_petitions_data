        "background": "One of Mr Brown's last acts as Chancellor of the Exchequer and boss of the Royal Mint, was to decree that Britannia had to go. \n\nIn August 2005, the Royal Mint promoted a design competition for new UK coinage designs. In December 2007, it was announced that all the normal circulation coin designs were to be replaced by new ones. \n\nWhat's wrong with a patriotic symbol, a symbol of our heritage, our history and tradition? Should we let political correctness, and one man's desire for needless change deprive us of our identity?\n\nSign here and make yourself heard.",
