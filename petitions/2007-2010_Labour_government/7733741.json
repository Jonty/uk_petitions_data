            "background": "In my belief HGV's cause the biggest amount of problems on British roads and motorways. They cause delays because they are going so slowly, and often do not have the power to overtake the vehicle they are trying to pass so then two lanes of motorway are blocked by lorries and other veicles can't get around them.\nI think that if they were taken off the roads from midnight on Friday till 11pm on Sunday it would make the roads clearer at weekends, which is when most families are travelling. The only wagons that should be allowed to travel are ones with special licences for perishable goods for example such as fruit and veg.\nAlso wagons should have restricted travel over xmas and new year. This works very well on the continent so maybe it is time we adopted it here? Even if only for a trial period.",
