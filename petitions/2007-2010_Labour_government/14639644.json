            "background": "I would like to propose that a new law be passed to protect the countryside with respect of fire hazards in relation to moors.  As it now stands due to the public access laws large areas of moors are available for ramblers and rightly so.  Unfortunately, at times during summers these moors can become tinderboxes and prove a ticking time bomb concerning the threat of fire.  I hereby propose that at such times smoking is prohibited from such areas under such times (*1).   Whilst this will not negate all potential instigators of fire, it will at least remove a common artificial inducer of combustion. \n\n(*1) The times being defined by a permutation of local borough/landowner/National Trust/Local inhabitants within a 5 mile area or would be directly affected by a fire scenario at the designated site.   Exceptions being were an area of no less than 20 m3 is available and safe disposal of spent smoking products can be assured to the satisfaction of the aforementioned group.",
