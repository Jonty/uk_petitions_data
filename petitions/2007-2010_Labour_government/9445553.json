        "background": "I would like the opportunity to petition against the proposed plans to create an \"Eco Town\" in the Selby District. \n\nThe Selby District which is made of largely of rural villages does not need a new town as it already has large settlements in Selby, Tadcaster & Sherburn in Elmet.\n \nThere is considerable opposition locally and the need for a new town does not exist and there are neither the jobs nor infrastructure required to make such a huge development sustainable.\n\nI therefore call upon the Prime Minister to do what he recently said he would do.. and listen to the people.. and put an end to this scheme.",
