            "background": "As it has been considered appropriate to arrest Damian Green for allegedly leaking information that some would consider to be in the pubilc interest, all resources possible should be given over to finding the person or persons responsible for leaking the pre budget report for which there could be no legitimate public interest, bearing in mind the information was due to be announced in any case a day or two later. The Government should make it clear that they expect the leaker or leakers to feel the full force of the law in the same way that Mr Green has.",
