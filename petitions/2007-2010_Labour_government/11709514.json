            "background": "Although voted for by only 50.3% of the 50.1% of the Welsh electorate who turned out in the 1997 referendum, the National Assembly has now been elevated to the status of a Government.  In addition, the Government of Wales Act 2006 was placed on the Statute Book despite the fact that the specific details were not presented to the people of Wales at the General Election in 2005. \n\nWe in True Wales call for an early referendum, either to ratify or to repeal the Act so that the Welsh people can be allowed to influence their own constitutional future in an open and democratic manner, rather than having their destiny decided by the political elite.",
