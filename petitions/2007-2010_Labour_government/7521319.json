        "background": "Many youngsters who join the Air Training Corps have the ambition of becoming a fast yet pilot, yet there is one aspect of flying which is used daily in the RAF but never in the Air Training Corps... Synchronised flying! The Air Cadets fly in Grob tutors wit little chance each flight. But I think now it is time to give them a better chance of selection in the RAF by developing the synchronised flying skills. For the more experienced cadets this type of flying should be on the syllabus, it would adapt their mental, leadership and team building skills, as two/three tutors could take off together, and achieve a sortie etc set out. \nBefore flying they could have a brief just like they do in the RAF, and set a sortie to complete in their 0.5-1 hour flight. This would make AEF flying much easier as well as really giving them the incentive to fulfill their career.",
