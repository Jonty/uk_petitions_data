            "background": "I recently had the pleasure of joining a Cross Country train at Stafford bound for Manchester. The train was very busy and a number of us were stood up in the end of the carriage. Two soldiers in dessert combats were also stood up.\n\nA conversation ensued and I understand that these two soldiers were on the way home on mid tour leave. They had just arrived from Basra, Iraq and clearly were very tired indeed.\n\nThese two people are doing what the country asks of them, and it would not take much for the train companies to be asked to recognise this fact. They could have been upgraded to First Class as a complimentary gesture.\n\nThis simple act would cost nothing but would show a small amount of gratitude to those doing our bidding.",
