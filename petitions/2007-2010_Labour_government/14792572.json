In the light of recent oil exploration, The Argentinians are once more making claims to the Islands and the surrounding Oceans. We ask that the Prime Minister issues a guarantee that if necessary, Military force will be used in the defence of the Islands. He will also guarantee to deploy sufficient forces in advance, to protect the Islands from any possible invasion. Should it be required an assurance will be given that military asset's currently deployed elsewhere will be re-called and deployed to the South Atlantic in defence of the Falkland Islands. These Islands must never again be allowed to fall into Argentinian hands.",
