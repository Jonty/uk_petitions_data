            "background": "I have read so many stories of soldiers getting awards for bravery shown on the battlefield during the war's in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut I believe the following story is one that should be addressed and the proper Medal awarded.\n\nOn the morning of 19th July 1972, 250 PFLOAG guerillas stormed an isolated British Training Station in Mirbat where 9 S.A.S. soldiers were training.\n\nThese 9 brave men held off the attack from these rebels for 9 long hours and it was notibly the Fijian Soldier Sgt. Talaiasi Labalaba who mounted a machine gun and fired to save himself and his collegues.\n\nBut Sgt. Labalaba was fatally wounded and died from his injuries.\n\nHe showed immense bravery in the face of enemyfire and I believe this great fijian man should be honored the V.C. Cross for his services to this country and the bravery he showed on that frightful morning.\n\nI hope he is honored not only for himself but also for his family and the whole of Fiji.\n \nThank you reading this story Prime Minister.",
