            "background": "If any wife or mother out there knows what it is like to have someone with a drink problem, it destroys your life and your childrens.  The Pime Minister should consider the cost this causes to the NHS AND TAX PAYER, not to mention the stress on the Police Force, there should be tighter laws on drinking hours, in pubs and clubs, cut them back to say, 7pm - 11pm, and this should apply to off-licences too.  Increase the age to 21. Stop alcohol for sale in supermarkets and small grocery shops, it is too easy for drinkers.  This wouldn't solve the problem completely, but it might help! I know this sounds harsh to drinkers, but if only hard drinkers could see how they destroy lives, maybe\nthey would understand.",
