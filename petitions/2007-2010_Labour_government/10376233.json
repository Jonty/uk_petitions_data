            "background": "After having just qualified as a teacher of physics, I have worked in an independent school. My induction period was overseen by ISCTip, fully in accordance with DfES principles. However, I am not eligible for the golden hello. This, I feel, is contrary to the reasoning behind the golden hello incentive and, formerly, the repayment of student loans for teachers. I teach physics to A2 level and, indeed, have encouraged a number of pupils to continue to degree level. The current anomaly with the golden hello payments is that a teacher of KS3 general science (ie a biologist) working in a maintained school has a claim for this payment but I do not. I feel that I am discriminated against, particularly as every job interview for a maintained school has been rejected because of my specialism and the fact that most schools in Devon are unable to offer A Level teaching.",
