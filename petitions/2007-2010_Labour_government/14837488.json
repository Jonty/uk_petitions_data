            "background": "Ashton United Football Club and player Danny White have been sued by Marcus Hallows in respect of injuries received during a football game in 2005 \u2013 and the judge has ruled in favour of Hallows.  Expert witnesses were divided on the case \u2013 one side saw the tackle as \u201creckless\u201d, and the other side argued that the type of tackle was \u201ccommonplace in football at any level\u201d.  There was no video evidence \u2013 only photographs. This decision could create a legal precedent in football whereby any injury could result in players or clubs being taken to court, and the financial implications could bankrupt both club and player.  We urge the Prime Minister to reconsider this verdict \u2013 and possibly look to setting up enforceable guidelines for all football clubs and players in respect of liability insurance.  Football is not an \u201cextreme sport\u201d \u2013 although it does contain an \u201celement of risk\u201d - and every player knows this. However this decision could spell the end for non-league football as we know it.",
