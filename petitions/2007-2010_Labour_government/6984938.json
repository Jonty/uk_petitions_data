        "action": "make it illegal for ticket agencies to charge more than 10% above the face value of a ticket for any event.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Ticket agencies routinely buy tickets in bulk for top sporting and entertainment events.  These tickets are then sold on at vastly inflated prices.  Tickets with face values of tens of pounds are sold, quite legally, for hundreds or thousands of pounds.  This is legalised touting and such activity would be prosecuted were it to be carried out by a member of the public.  This petition aims to put a top limit on the mark-up that a ticket agency can place on any ticket sold in the UK.  A maximum 10% mark-up means, for example, that an agency selling a ticket with a face value of \u00a350 can charge a maximum of \u00a355 for that ticket.  10% is a reasonable level to allow an agency to make a profit from a ticket sale, without exploiting the customer.",
