            "background": "The Home Office has announced plans to deploy 10,000 additional tasers in the UK police force, despite legitmate concerns about their safety.\n\nIn many US police forces, the officers train by using tasers on themselves prior to being allowed to use them on the public.\n\nIn light of this, we expect that the Home Secretary should also publicly undergo a taser test to demonstrate her confidence in the system.",
