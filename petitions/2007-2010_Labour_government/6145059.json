            "background": "We would like to ask for clause 43 to be reviewed, and deleted to enable women to empower other women and charities as they have been doing for a number of years.  The scheme is called Hearts and it was set up by women for women to enable those who were less fortunate to achieve something.  It also helps charities by making donations of the gifted money to various organisations who would otherwise suffer.  We feel that it is a shame the Government who are set to tax us on just about everything, including now holding a fund raising event, see fit to halt another method of fund raising.  It would appear that they would like to quash the charitable, giving and compassionate nature of the British Public.",
