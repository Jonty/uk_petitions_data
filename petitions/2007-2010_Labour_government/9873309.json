            "background": "Improper lane discipline and misuse of the outside lanes on motroaways and dual carriageways (\"lane hogging\") contravenes the Highway Code and causes delays and congestion. The traffic concertina effect is also dangerous and frustrating. Making lane mis-use an endorseable offence will give Police Officers more strength to deal with this dangerous and un-necessary behaviour. Any driver, measured over a similar distance to speed monitoring (i.e. 1/4 mile) identified mis-using lanes on motorways and dual carriageways should be charged with Careless Driving or a specific lane mis-use offence i.e it should be treated as seriously as under-taking offences, which usually occur when drivers are frustrated by improper use of outside lanes",
