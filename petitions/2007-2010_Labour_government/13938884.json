            "background": "I would like to see family tax credit help with childcare more available for middle income earners as well as lower income so that families can keep working and be able to pay their bills as well as their childminders. Middle income earners often get no help with anything else but are required to pay full tax etc so that often, they end up with the same amount of money in their pocket as someone who doesn't work and claims benefits. Help with childcare provides a large boost to all parents who wish to contribute to society as well as their family finances and it seems unfair that affordable childcare is only available when children go to school. This means that their is a huge strain put on families financially when returning to work of parents of all wages.",
