            "background": "Many young people like myself know that insurance companies abuse their powers when they decide what premiums they should quote younger drivers. The fact of the matter is that we are given stupid quotes, which exceed into the thousands. Everybody knows that we are probably the poorest section of people in the UK (with mounting student debt), so why should insurance companies use the fact that it is the law to have insurance to make younger drivers foot the bill. Yes its true some young drivers are awful however when you look at the cross section of us we really arn't that bad. I myself have a Citroen 2CV it has a 602cc engine (lawnmowers have more)and the car cant evn hit 70mph, yet the quote is still \u00a31100. If i try to get tempory cover i cant as i am not 21,and this is also the case when i try and get classic insurance. We are tunneled into paying massive lump sums just because of our age, this is not good enough.",
