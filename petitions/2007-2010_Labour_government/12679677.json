        "background": "We believe that James Purnell is now wholly unsuitable for his role as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Following the revelations published in The Telegraph we believe that James Purnell has lost the moral authority to target fraudulent benefits claimants. His vilification of those claiming benefits now appears totally morally bankrupt. The nature of his own claims render him totally unsuitable for his position and the only remaining option is to remove him.",
