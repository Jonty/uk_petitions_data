It has now emerged that this \u201cgrace and favour\u201d pension will be exempt from taxes announced in last year\u2019s budget. \n\nThe speaker can claim \u00a379,754  on top of his MP\u2019s salary, giving a total of \u00a3144,520. He has not claimed it in full and is paid \u00a3141,647. \n\nUnder the new measures, other employees earning more than \u00a3130,000 will pay tax of up to 30% on pension contributions from April 2011. The Speaker\u2019s office has confirmed he will not pay taxes on his grace and favour pension.",
