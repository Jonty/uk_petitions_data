            "background": "How is it that this government keeps on strangling the motorist and the aviation industry.  I drive and fly as a matter of business and the rediculously high prices are strangling businesses in the UK.  People are moving business abroad because tax keeps rising and rising and there is no increase in wages.  People cannot afford housing, food is expensive and not to mention other every day items.  Why is it fuel companies are boasting rocket profits and knowing people in that industry they make a small amount on the price of fuel.  The rest is just greed from this government.  \u00a31.21 ltr for diesel in some garages is taking the mick out of the british public.  You could charge 78p a litre as it was last year and still make millions for the coffers.  Leave us alone, stop feeding us crap about crude prices and start charging us the price that they charge any where else in the world.  You are being greedy and this needs to stop other wise there will be a retaliation by the british people.",
