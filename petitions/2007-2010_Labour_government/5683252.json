            "background": "The local Government & Housing Act 2000 created the necessity for Local Authorities to sign up to a Code of Conduct for Elected Members and was also responsible for the creation of the Standards Board for England. \n\nThis has resulted in huge numbers of complaints, mainly from Officers and opposition Councillors and often being pursued for no other reason than political embarrisment, or to get back at Councillors by vindictive officers. \n\nIt has stifled democracy and eroded the free speech of Elected Members and led to institutional control. Councillors are elected to serve the people and this often brings them into conflict with the Authority and Council Officers, who quickly resort to a complaint to the Standards Board for England.\n\nThe original concept was to give members of the public protection when elected Members used their powers erronously against them and against the interest of the majority. We therefore petition the Government to consider abolishing the Standards Board and replacing it with a Local Advocacy",
