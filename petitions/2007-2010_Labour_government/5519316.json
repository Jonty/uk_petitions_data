I hereby petition for Brian to become the New Poet Laureate for the following poetic language he has applied within the house:\n\n\"I love Babe:Pig in the City. I actually was a vegetarian once yeah? 'Cos we was watching Babe: Pig in the City and it was really good. The first Babe turned me into a vegetarian, but I was only vegetarian for like a week, because I couldn't just live on Linda McCartney meals.\"\n\n\"What's Romeo and Juliet?... Romeo - ain't that the geezer out of So Solid Crew?... Who's Shakespeare?... So did dis Shakespeare geezer direct Romeo and Juliet?... So how comes loads of people know about this Shakespeare geezer if her wrote it a million zillion years ago?... You know I din't pay much attention at school.\"\n\n\"If he wrote Romeo and Juliet, then that's supposed to be like ummm a proper ummm arty farty film with Leonardo DiCaprio in and they speak like there p*ssed and stuff.\"\n\n\"Women don't even have proper poo... So what about like Amanda and stuff, does she do proper sh*ts and all?... I dont think she does... Cos as if Amanda does full on dumps... Arrggh, that's kinda spoilt my fantasy now.\"",
