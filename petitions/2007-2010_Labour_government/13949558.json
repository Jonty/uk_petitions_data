            "background": "It is important that the MPs current Defined Benefits Pension Scheme be closed to new entrants now, as, following the expenses fiasco, about 200 MPs are likely to stand down at the next General Election. \n\nMany of those MPs may wish to draw their pension benefits at that time, in addition to which it is likely that the 200 or so replacement MPs will want to join the MPs pension scheme.\n\nThis is unprecedented, and if allowed to happen, will place an ever increasing financial burden on taxpayers - possibly extending UK Citizens liability for a further three decades.\n\nThis is not acceptable, and would be a contradiction of the Socially Just and Fair stance that the Prime Minister is currently undertaking.\n\nParticularly so, as many of those taxpayers also contribute to Private Sector Pension Policies, and have seen their funds rapidly decrease as a result of stockmarket volatlity, in addition to which their anticipated pensions (annuities) have collapsed as a result of the forced lowering of interest rates. \n\nNaturally a suitable Defined Contribution Pensions Scheme will need to be introduced for MPs.",
