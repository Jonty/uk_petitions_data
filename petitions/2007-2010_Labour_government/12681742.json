What is the point of a politician who doesn't act according to his heart and conscience but does as he is told? Lets get rid of these whips and liberate the MPs.\nPrimaries - in which all voters in a constituency get to choose the candidates that will stand for Labour, the Conservatives, Lib Dems and the rest rather than party selection committees. MPs should be impressing the public, not the party machine.\nThere should also be an elected House of Lords and smaller House of Commons.",
