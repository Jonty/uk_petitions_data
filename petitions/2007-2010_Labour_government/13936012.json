        "background": "I believe that there should be a new crime created so as to cover such action. \n\nThis crime should be called \"Shaming the flag\" and it should be applied to any British Nationals who act in such a way whilst abroad so as to bring shame on the British people as a whole. \n\nThis law should apply to those people who get so drunk abroad that they commit a crime worthy of imprisonment. \n\nIt would also cover those people who commit any serious crime abroad, such as rape, murder etc, whether they are drunk sober or otherwise. Alos included in the category of serious crime would be Drug trafficing and Hooliganism of any sort.\n\nThis crime should and should be applied to those whe desecrate British war memorials on British soil. It should also apply to those who do the same thing to war memorials aboad - whether they be commemorating the sacrifice of British Soldiers, or the sacrifice of Foreign Soldiers.",
