Alos included in the category of serious crime would be Drug trafficing and Hooliganism of any sort.\n\nThis crime should and should be applied to those whe desecrate British war memorials on British soil. It should also apply to those who do the same thing to war memorials aboad - whether they be commemorating the sacrifice of British Soldiers, or the sacrifice of Foreign Soldiers.",
