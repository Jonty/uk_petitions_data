The money has been effectively taken from them ie stolen.\nUnlike Icelanders, British citizens will receive only 20,000 Euros (not pounds so no problem there then!) - if the Icelandic funds do not run out first.\nSurely such prejudicial actions are illegal.(If not what does the EU do with all that money they take from us every year?)\nFor once the British Governement should actually do something useful, yes and break the habit of a lifetime, and stand up for the rights, and money, of British Citizens.",
