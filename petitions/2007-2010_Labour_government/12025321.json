        "background": "The reluctance of developing countries to address population control in the context of climate change condemns developing countries to future poverty, hunger and health problems. Although developed nations are the main contributors to climate change, poorer countries will be the main victims. Reduction in birth rates, however, will better enable them to cope as well as reducing infant and maternal mortality and vertical transmission of HIV.\nThe UK government should increase spending on programmes empowering local people to provide culturally sensitive family planning, such as Marie Stopes International and the UN Population Fund, as a central strategy to combat the consequences of climate change.",
