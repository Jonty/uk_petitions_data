The film is not unlawful and is publicly available.\n\nJacqui Smith banned this MP to placate muslim voters, not realising that she has alienated English voters.  She is a divisive, racially insensitive bureaucrat with no respect for our traditions of freedom of speech.  She is therefore unsuitable to serve in Parliament, let alone to serve as a minister in a democracy.",
