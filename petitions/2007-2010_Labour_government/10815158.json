        "background": "We need to move forward with the rest of the world and start exclusively using metric. I was educated in metric here in the UK and am now 41. I can see the logic in using metric, but no logic to using imperial units. If we all used metric, it would make things much easier. There should also be proper education for all in the use of metric, but as metric is so easy to use, it should not take long to get people to understand it. But the Government must also eradicate imperial completely to ensure a full changeover to metric to be successful.",
