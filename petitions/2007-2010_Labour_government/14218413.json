        "background": "We propose that a tax is levied on all the senders of unsolicited mail and leaflets, delivered either by post or by hand. Unsolicited mail is a low return marketing method that creates pollution, waste, adding to the costs of disposing of the already considerable amount of waste paper.\nWe believe that a reasonable tax would help raising funds to preserve the environment, reduce waste and pollution. The tax could be levied to the beneficiaries of any unsolicited mail collected by the residents and citizens through special containers placed in easily accessible places of interest.",
