            "background": "Travel concessions in England are, at the basic level supposed to be uniform across all local authority areas. Unfortunately, whilst OAPs can easily swap passes when moving home to a new area, disabled pass holders have to re-apply to their new authority, which may also have stricter criteria, or require a referral by Social Services which was not previously needed, and, let's face it, we are not all needing to be registered with them.\n\nI moved from a district where my pass was deemed by the council to be for life, with the new card dated to 2013. Why can't I, and any other disabled card holder simply transfer their existing entitlement to their new authority when they move? Surely councils could confer to verify claims? This would save costs for various departments involved and stop people benefitting from local enhancements to the scheme in their old area, as well as reducing stress and denying many of the travel which they previously enjoyed.",
