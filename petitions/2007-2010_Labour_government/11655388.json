        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Glue traps are strips of plastic or cardboard with one side coated in a strong glue. When the animal crosses the board it becomes stuck by the feet and fur.\n\nThese traps are barbaric and must be banned. It has been found that trapped mice struggling to free themselves pull out their own hair, exposing bare, raw areas of skin. The mice brake or even bite off their own legs to try and free themselves, and the glue causes their eyes to become badly irritated and scarred. After three to five hours in the glue traps, the mice defecate and urinate heavily because of their severe stress and fear. Animals whose faces become stuck in the glue slowly suffocate, and all trapped animals are subject to starvation and dehydration. It takes anywhere from three to five days for the mouse/rat to finally die.\n \nThis is nothing less than torture.\n\nIt is not only mice and rats that die a slow and painfull death on these traps. Birds, hedgehogs and other wildlife are also at risk where these traps are used.\nPlease help to stop this unnecessary suffering and cruelty.\n\nThank you",
