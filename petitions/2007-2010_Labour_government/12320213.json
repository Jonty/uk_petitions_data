        "background": "In addition to earning \u00a310,000 more than nurses the police get many other 'perks'. One of which is free public transport inside of London plus a certain radius outside of london. I believe it is unappropriate to give one of the highest paid departments of the public sector these 'perks' and one of the lowest paid none. While we may put up with below inflatation pay 'rises' year after year it seems unfair to give free transport to one service and not the others.",
