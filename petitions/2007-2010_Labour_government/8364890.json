            "background": "The plan to create a regional hub in Guildford and increase the population by 25% using 'inward migration' is an attempt to manipulate the political demographics of the area.\n\nBecause the region is an EU creation, 'inward migration' does not mean people from elsewhere in the UK, it means people from elsewhere in Europe, who, grateful for a new life will vote to a man, for whom they see as their benefactor.\n\nSimilar programmes of gerrymandering are taking place elsewhere in the UK.   These are not the actions one expects from properly elected democratic representatives, who should be seeking to satisfy the will of their own people, and not forever be seeking ways to thwart it. Gerrymandering is an act of cynical betrayal of the people of Great Britain.",
