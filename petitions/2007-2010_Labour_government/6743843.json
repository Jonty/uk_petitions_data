            "background": "Currently across the UK it is common practice to place 18 to 25 year olds on the same ward with much older adults. (usually up to the age of 65) There is a lot of emphasis on under 18s mental health and placing them on adult wards and it often feels like 25s and unders are forgotten about.  There is evidence to suggest that the human mind continues to develop rapidly, at least until the age of 25, therefore a young person's vulnerability doesn't disappear as soon as they turn 18.  Therefore there should be separate wards and also, mental facilities for 18-25 year old age group throughout the UK.  CAMHS should be extended to suit the needs of 18-25 year olds, in order to ensure that they receive age appropriate treatment, care and facilities.  This age group needs a lot of care and support to transfer to adult life.  Mental health issues make the transition more complex and harder for young people, and this process is difficult enough for people without mental health issues, let alone with.",
