            "background": "Making those who earn over the Personal allowance (~\u00a36,500) but less than \u00a335,00 pay 22% on their earnings is truly unjustfiable: this tax will severely hurt those on the national minimum wage and push many families in to poverty.  It will also punish those who have left school and Further Education and start their 1st job by paying as much in tax as those who have been working for many years.  Many of these individuals will also have to commence re - paying their student loans and so will find it much harder to have a decent standard of living.",
