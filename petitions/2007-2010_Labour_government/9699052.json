Lamberts Lane is at the heart of a residenial area and is host to horse riders, dog walkers, joggers, family groups, playing children, groups of teenagers and canal users. It provides access to footpaths across the golf course to Astbury, to Fol Hollow and into Congleton.\nIn the summer, the trees on either side of the lane form a leafy canopy, host to squirrels and birds. In the wintertime you can often find robins in the branches.\nLamberts Lane is not the place for industry on such a scale as to require the movement of 22 & 44 tonne lorries.\nPlease add your name to prevent the construction of this unit.",
