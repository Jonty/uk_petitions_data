It provides access to footpaths across the golf course to Astbury, to Fol Hollow and into Congleton.\nIn the summer, the trees on either side of the lane form a leafy canopy, host to squirrels and birds. In the wintertime you can often find robins in the branches.\nLamberts Lane is not the place for industry on such a scale as to require the movement of 22 & 44 tonne lorries.\nPlease add your name to prevent the construction of this unit.",
