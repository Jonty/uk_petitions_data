The Government links benefit increases to the RPI rate of inflation which is approximately 5%. Benefit recipients should not receive a rate of increase of twice that public sector workers are receiving. The only exeption I would make would be pensioners.\nThe Government should not increase benefit payments at twice the rate public sector workers will receive.",
