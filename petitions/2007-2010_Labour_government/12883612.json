            "background": "Since car parkign at most stations was contracted out, charges have risen by up to 300%.\n\nMy ticket is \u00a311 to get to work but the cost of parking is a whopping \u00a36.60 - I am trying to be green but it now costs me twice as much to get the train as to drive. Like many people I live too far away to walk or cycle and there are no buses to the station until the middle of the day.\n\nThis is not a recipe for encouraging people out of their cars!",
