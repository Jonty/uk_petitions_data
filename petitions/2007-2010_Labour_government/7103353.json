            "background": "Blair, and the Metropolitan police, have acted despicably in the recent court case where they were found guilty of breaching health and safety regulations in relation to the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.\n\nAfter the shooting two years ago, Blair apologised and accepted responsibility for the shooting: \"This is a tragedy. To the family I can only express my deep regrets.\"\n\nIn the trial (where, let's not forget it, the police were not accused of murder or manslaughter but of breaching health and safety law), the police did its best to paint a negative portrait of an innocent, dead man: \"Did he fear he might have some drugs in his jacket and might want to get them out and throw them away when he was challenged by the police?\u201d said the counsel for the defence, Ronald Thwaites.\n\nDe Menezez did not have any drugs on him, and this effort to disparage him is low and unnecessary. Anyway, even if he had been carrying drugs (which he wasn\u2019t), how could that in any way be used to defend the police\u2019s tragic mistake?\n\nIf Blair thinks it acceptable to vilify an innocent man, killed by mistake, he obviously has no sense of moral decency, and should stand down from his post.",
