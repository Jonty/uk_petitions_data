            "background": "This is the second academic year that school pupils attending Thorngumbald Primary School have had to take packed lunches to school, despite repeated promises of provision by East Riding of Yorkshire Council.  The school has no kitchen nor is there any means to utilise facilities at any neighbouring school to provide pupils, particularly on cold winters days, with warm food.  The quality of school meals are supposedly high on the agenda for the government for schools nationally.   However, here is a school with no school meals provision at all.  This petition is a means to speak up for the children (aged 4 to 11), who should have the benefit of a hot school meal, either provided from within the school or by another neighbouring school from within the same LEA. As a temporary measure the school children ought to be, in the least, provided with a soup kitchen, pending resolution of this gap in services.",
