            "background": "We petition the Prime Minister to require that all privately rented properties are insulated adequately by landlords by 2015. \n\nAlthough local government can drive social housing insulation, and owner-occupiers have a financial incentive to insulate their own homes, private landlords continue to leave their properties uninsulated. This increases the energy bills of their tenants, contributing to fuel poverty, and adds  to carbon emissions, which must urgently be reduced.\n\nWe welcome the Government's commitment in February to improve insulation for all homes by 2030, but would urge it to put more stringent measures in place for private landlords. At present it is envisaged that improved asset value and the provision of low-cost measures available will encourage private landlords to insulate their properties, but we have concerns that the new proposals will not incentivise landlords to act quickly enough.\n\nSetting a firm target for landlords to insulate their rental properties will significantly reduce emissions, and put money in the pockets of tenants when they most need it.",
