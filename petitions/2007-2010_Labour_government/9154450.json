            "background": "The principle of 'simple interest', which is taught to foundation tier GCSE Mathematics candidates, is not representative of the 'compound interest' system which society uses.  To teach E-grade candidates of a system which is not used in our society (or any other) will result in them being susceptible to financial difficulties due to a non-understanding of the way interest is charged on borrowing as well as on savings.",
