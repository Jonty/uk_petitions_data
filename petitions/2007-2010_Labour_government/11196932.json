            "background": "Once again pensioners have been forgotten in the Queens speech, it is time pensioners are treated as equal members of society and not swept aside as so often in the past. The reduction in vat is useless to most pensioners who have seen their income greatly reduced in real terms. Do something to offset the falling interest rates and help those who have been a little thrifty and saved for their retirement. Pensioners appear to be the only members of society not catered for. URGENT ACTION IS REQUIRED NOW before many die of hypothermia this winter.",
