            "background": "For many years I have been amazed at the cost of passports in the UK. I recently checked how much it would be for our family (2 adults and 2 children) to have new passports - \u00a3236!\nFirstly, how much does it cost to produce a passport?, I seriously doubt it costs more than \u00a310, so why is an adult passport \u00a372. Is it a profit making initiative? \nMy idea is to reduce the price to a maximum of \u00a320, so more lower income people and pensioners can also enjoy the similar holidays like other people.\nUntil the price is dramatically lower then I intend to not holiday abroad period. I regard these prices as utterly obscene, I can find no better description of the fees.",
