            "background": "Ban smoking in ALL public places\n\nIf smokers want to destroy their own health in the privacy of their own homes, so be it, but why should they be allowed to force others to do likewise? Shooting heroin in public is illegal, yet this activity doesn't actually force others to partake of its poison; why then, should people be allowed to smoke in public, forcing others to do the same?\n\nFor too long smokers have been given priority over non-smokers. At last non-smokers can enjoy smoke-free bars & restaurants, but are forced to stay indoors or tolerate an increased level of toxic cigarette smoke with their food if they want to enjoy summer and socialise outside. \n\nWhy should people whose health is severely affected by passive smoking be forced to live as second-class citizens to avoid a minority with no respect for their own or others\u2019 health? Even walking up a street or entering a building, people are forced to inhale the foul emissions of smokers who currently feel free to pollute public spaces.",
