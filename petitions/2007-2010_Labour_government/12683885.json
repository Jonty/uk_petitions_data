            "background": "The overnight running of coal trains on a refurbished rail line through the middle of small villages is odious.  If it was the intention to re-open the line, planning permission should never have been granted for residential buildings so close to the disused line.  If it was never the intention to re-open the line and housing therefore built alongside it, then a new line should have been proposed.  Night time running of heavy, old, noisy carriages is causing untold damage to both buildings and people.  It MUST stop immediately!",
