        "action": "introduce legislation to protect our male infants from the cruel and medieval practice of circumcision based on religious grounds.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Other than for medical reasons, to inflict permanent, irreversible, painful and disfiguring surgery on the most private parts of an infant\u2019s body when he is incapable of resisting or expressing an opinion, is a simple breach of his most basic human rights.\n\nUnder Humans Rights law, everyone is entitled to protection from injury by another. Everybody is entitled to equal protection before this law. One person\u2019s human rights cannot be used to deny another person\u2019s human rights.\n\nThe choice to be circumcised (or not) should remain with that individual until that person is capable of making an informed and balanced decision. I would suggest that legislation should clearly define this as being at least 13 years of age.",
