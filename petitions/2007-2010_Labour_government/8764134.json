            "background": "Vision zero aims to remove any other form of transport other than cars from uk and European roads under the pretence that this would help towards zero casualties.In itself an unacheivable goal. As such this would be actively discriminating aginst other road users and more importantly cheap and viable transport options, such as cyles and motorcycles.Furthermore this very action would go against govermnent reccomendations and guidelines and would therefore increase the amount of four wheeled traffic during a time when traffic is trying to be reduced.\nThis would also go against green thinking.\nYet again this is another attack on personal freedoms and choice.",
