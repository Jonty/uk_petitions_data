        "background": "I feel that not enough money is being put into solving the problem of youths on our streets. Increasingly more youths are finding nothing to do and instead wind up on the streets in gangs causing trouble and taking drugs and alcohol. I feel that if more facilities were provided then this would give children a decision. It seems in my area more money has been ploughed into shopping centres and taxes rather than tackelling problems.",
