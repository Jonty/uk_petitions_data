        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently hardware and software, particularly business use software is heavily over-priced in the UK to subsidise foreign markets.\n\nTo take a single example, one large company is currently selling its flagship product to UK residents for 165% of the cost to US residents. The price is for an identical download.\n\nWe the undersigned accept that some markup is necessary to protect companies from exchange rate fluctuations. We also accept that some price difference is inevitable due to varying tax rates. We do not accept that it is right or fair for UK businesses and individuals to be forced to subsidise their competitors abroad.\n\nWe would like the Government to seriously consider legislation that would help level the playing field and enable UK businesses compete internationally without prejudice.",
