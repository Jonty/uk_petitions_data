            "background": "We are of the opinion that the DSA provides little or no value for money.  This can be summarised by the following points:\n\nTest fees are unreasonably high.\n\nExaminers are inconsistent and often unfair, dismissive or rude.\n\nTests are often cancelled without notice or reasonable grounds.\n\nThe waiting list for practical tests is unreasonably long.\n\nThose who have had their tests cancelled are expected to return to the bottom of the waiting list.\n\nComplaints are not dealt with effectively.\n\nWe also consider that the entire testing system has become irrelevant, and believe that it would prove more consistent for the candidate's ADI to formally assess their competence over a longer period (or a similar system).",
