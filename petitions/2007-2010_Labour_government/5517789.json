            "background": "Successive governments have made changes to our education system and standards are not getting better. The national curriculum is so restrictive and teachers are so tied down with paperwork. Everyone is looking over their shoulder to see what Ofsed comes up with next teaching and children seem to come second to all this. Can we have education run as the interest rates are by the professionals eg educationalists. Disband Ofsed which is not supportive and costly. Go back to when the HMI employed by HMG, inspected schools and had the powers to challenge children who where not in school when they should be. Lets have less responsibility for what parents should be doing eg diet and more preparing children with a wide education to prepare them for adulthood. The teachers are professional people.Let them teach.",
