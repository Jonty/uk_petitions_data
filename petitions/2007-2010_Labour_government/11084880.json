When it gets to the courts they are being sentenced in my opinion, with a tap on the wrist and out early for \"good behaviour\". I speak for all when i say that the punishment needs to fit the crime.However the goverment will not allow the death penalty,therefore life should mean life. And so in the case of baby P, may his death be the marking of a new begining in the way we deal with inhumane criminals",
