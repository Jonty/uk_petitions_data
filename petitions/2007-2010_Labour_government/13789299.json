So why on earth do these Bennefit Spongers get a rise every time they knock out yet another child??? Maybe you should think about a change the law to say that they must go back to work for say at least 6 months before they are elegible to get this extra paid cash before they go back onto (our tax paid) social bennefit handouts.",
