            "background": "It is a disgrace that this Government are allowing Banks such as RBS to pay out bonuses of over a billion pounds when they are still holding so much of tax payers money.  If they were made to return all the money before paying out bonuses then the current cuts on much needed public services would not be happening and those in need would not be suffering because of the greed of Bankers who would not have a job if they had not been bailed out.",
