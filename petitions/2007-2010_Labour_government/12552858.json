            "background": "Following the recent unfortunate arrest and release of the Pakistani students suspected of plotting attacks in the UK I feel an oath of allegiance, or at least, non-aggression, towards the UK would be appropriate, to be sworn on the Koran. These are bright people and the UK needs them - they have anyway an underlying love for the UK. \nWhen I was naturalised in 1976 I had to swear the oath on the Bible, which did not feel binding, particularly as I discovered later it was so heavily corrupted by Paul, and I was not even militant, or a product of Islamic education. I can guarantee this would be taken seriously, if done properly, even by the most cynical of jihadis.",
