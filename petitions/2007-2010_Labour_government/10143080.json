        "background": "Every other possible bill you can imagine has a facility to spread the cost over a period to lessen the blow and make it more affordable. Paying the full amount in one go for car tax is an archaic system which can be a real drain on the monthly finances of the average household!!!\n\nPlease make it possible to spread costs of car tax over a twelve month period, it is as simple as that. Surely this would cut down on the amount of people who drive without tax and cost the tax payer millions each year in policing and processing those who avoid the charge.",
