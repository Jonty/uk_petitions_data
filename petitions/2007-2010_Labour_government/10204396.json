            "background": "We would like to change the law to stop discrimination in the     workplace, based on appearance.       This includes people with visible tattoos and piercings     (including facial, arms, neck etc) and hair colour. We feel     that if it doesn't conflict with health and safety regulations,     (i.e. facial piercings when working in close proximity with     fresh food) or is offensive, (i.e. racist tattoos), it should     be made illegal to refuse someone a job, based on the above     descriptions.      Britain is quickly becoming more modern, and now, a majority of     people within Britain have at least 1 tattoo or visible     piercing; but we feel that British law hasn\u2019t yet caught up.      As it stands, we are currently providing bigots with an excuse     to be prejudiced towards people within certain subcultures. We     already have in place, laws associated with disability, race     and age within our working society. Please sign, to give people     the fair treatment that they deserve.",
