            "background": "Currently lenders have the right to repossess homes and sell these at low cost, regardless of current market prices, then add enormous charges of various types which still leaves a substantial sum unpaid to the creditor, which can be as much as tens of thousands of pounds. This results in low earners carrying debt for the rest of their lives. This does not just result in families and single people never being able to improve their living standard and will remain on the poverty line, costing the government/taxpayer millions of pounds every year in income support and housing benefits\n\nPerhaps the Prime Minister would consider introducing a similar law as in the USA, once repossession has taken place that no moneys are owed to the creditor thereafter.",
