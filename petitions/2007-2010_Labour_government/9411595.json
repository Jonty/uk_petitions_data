            "background": "At the office, are you tired of hearing Irish, French or southern hemisphere folk whinge about the state of this country when they refuse to work in their own supposedly superior homelands.  Yet they are happy to take our nation's prosperity and work for far higher salaries than they could ever get at home, taking jobs away from  Brits that love this country.  Flexible economic immigration is all very well, but an inbalance of love for this country is not a healthy state of affairs.  The government should not allow foreign cynicism to corrode the nation's mental health.",
