When somebody is found guilty of killing another or involved in the killing of another and there is no doubt at all that they are guilty then the correct punishment must be death. Putting these people in prison is just a drain on the nations resources especially in these times of the credit crunch. Not only will this save the nation money it will also cut prison over crowding and send out a message to criminals and gangs that people will no longer tolerate any more of this behaviour.",
