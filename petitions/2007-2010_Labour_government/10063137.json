            "background": "The Devolved Formula Capital (DFC) is an amount allocated each year to primary and secondary schools. It is up to each school to spend the money according to their own priorities, and may be used for buildings, ICT, or any other capital need.\n\nThe amount of the DFC is calculated purely based on the number of pupils in the school. The\n consequence of this very simple funding formula is that a 100-year old school will receive identical\n funding to a 5-year old school of similar size. Clearly, a 100-year old school will be subject to very\n different building maintenance requirements than that of a 5-year old school but they will receive the\n same money to effect this maintenance.\n\n\nThere is benefit in keeping a simple funding formula, but the current formula leaves out a key element that determines capital funding requirements for schools: the age and condition of the school.",
