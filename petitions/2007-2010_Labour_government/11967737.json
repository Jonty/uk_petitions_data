        "background": "In this nation the Police are supposed to uphold the Law of the Land and stand as an example to all it's citizens. The recent release of information showing that at least 1000 officers currently serving in police forces throughout England, Scotland and Wales have criminal records for, amongst others, Fraud, Perverting the Course of Justice, Drink Driving, Kerb Crawling and Assault, makes it clear that the officers we trust to police our streets are morally unfit for this duty.\n\nHow can a Police Officer, guilty of a dishonesty offence, be trusted to behave in a lawful and just manner? Any conviction on the record of Police Officer should result in immediate dismissal. After all if the Police can't be trusted to abide by the law, why should we?",
