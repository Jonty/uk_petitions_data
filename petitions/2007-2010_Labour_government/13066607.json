            "action": "confirm his commitment to the country by installing a system which cuts the cost of government to the reducing number of taxpayers, by causing the suspension - without salary and allowances (apart from the same unemployment benefit available to everybody who is unemployed) - of one elected member of parliament for every 50,000 citizens on the unemployed list.  Members to be suspended to be selected at random from ALL elected members, regardless of party or position held at the time of selection.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Our present band of elected representatives have demonstrated, quite admirably, that they consider themselves to be above what is going on in the country.  It is immoral, and a fraud, for them to continue costing taxpayers as much during a time of recession as they do during a period of growth.  Elected representatives should be forced to endure the same situation as the people funding them and make a contribution by reducing their number pro rata with the number of people who are unemployed.  The cost of government burden upon the cohort of taxpayers should be lessened in line with the amount of money being taken in taxes from the fewer number of people who are actually paying taxes.\n\nThe question of not having a sitting MP in an area is not a consideration because the government are more than happy for Glasgow East not to have an MP through the summer period because they decided it was not important to hold an election in the normal time frame following the removal of Gorbals Mick - if they can be without an MP for five months then they can be without an MP until the recession is over!",
