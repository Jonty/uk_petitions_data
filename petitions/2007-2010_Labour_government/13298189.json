            "background": "Dogs have to be on leads in public and I think children, who are generally less well behaved are allowed to run free being both a nuisance and a danger to both themselves and to others, so I am petitioning for a law that all children four and under are put on reins while out in public.\nReins have been used to control children for decades keeping them out of danger.  Having once again nearly been tripped up by a toddler running free which could have caused an injury both to myself and the child in question I think it is time that parents are made to put their children on reins to prevent accidents.  Reins are cheap and easily available so there is no excuse for them not to do this.",
