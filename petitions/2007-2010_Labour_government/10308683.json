            "background": "Pupils should be banned from not leaving school grounds at lunchtime, unless their parents are there to take them to a dentist/GP appointment (having shown a letter or appointment card first). Pupils only go out at the moment to get some junk food, have a smoke etc. There is no justification for leaving the school grounds. Plus, there are some pupils that once they have left the grounds, don't bother to return for afternoon lessons. If the pupils don't like the school food, bring their own food in.",
