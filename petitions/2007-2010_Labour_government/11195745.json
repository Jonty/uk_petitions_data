The reason that ticket agencies use for posting tickets out up to 48 hours before the actual event is to stop ticket touting - if the second hand ticket market really is something that the government wants to stop and not just pay lip service to then it should make hard arrests of all touts at all gigs, stop ebay from selling tickets and actively pursue through court action anybody court selling tickets on ebay.",
