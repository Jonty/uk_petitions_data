        "background": "I will not stand for green groups who insist on ruining the already mundane task of shopping by removing plastic bags. It is not a 'crime' if you forget to bring your own. We must ignore this and focus on implementing nuclear power which is going to reduce CO2 much more than halting plastic bag production. Furthermore, new reactor designs are really safe.",
