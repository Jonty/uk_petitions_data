            "background": "the shocking case of Amersham where over 100 equines were in need of help, left until over 30 of them died in appalling circumstances.\n\nThere is confusion as to whether this could have been prevented if it had investigated more thoroughly the reports they had previously about the welfare of these animals, an enquiry into why they didn't fully investigate the whole grounds of where the horses were kept.  There is a law passed to enable removal of animals at risk or suffering from cruelty and neglect before they reach the stage of starvation which many of these horses did, why was it not implemented.\n\nA full inquiry into when they received their first report of these horses welfare would be very welcome for the horse community and the community of Amersham as a whole who are deeply saddened and shocked by what has happened. the lines of enquiry which they then followed and what caused them to believe the horses were in a condition that was acceptable to them for them to be left there, and for horses that were removed previously to be returned to this person.",
