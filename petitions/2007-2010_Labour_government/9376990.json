        "background": "HM Treasury plans to withdraw the exemption from higher road tax rates for cars that were registered before the new top rate was introduced.  This decision gives the lie to the claim that the increase in excise duty on high-emitting cars was intended to influence purchasing decisions in favour of more environmentally-friendly vehicles.  The cars now being drawn into the highest tax band - many of them ordinary family cars - already exist and taxing their continued existence will not change that.  From the environmental point of view it remains better to use these cars until the end of their natural life than to scrap and replace them, because a high proportion of a car\u2019s lifetime emissions are released during manufacture.  Many who bought their cars in good faith \u2013 remember that in 2001 225g/km was not even a high level \u2013 are now faced with a crippling but unavoidable increase in tax.  Even the option of selling their cars to those who travel lower mileages, and buying low-emission replacements, will be denied them as their vehicles become unsaleable.  This decision must be reversed in the interests of justice and the environment.",
