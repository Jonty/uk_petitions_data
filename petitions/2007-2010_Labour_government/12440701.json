            "background": "There are people who have been driving motorbikes and lorries for years. When they send their licence to the DVLA to change their address etc, the parts of the licence that proves that they can drive a motorbike or lorry, are omitted from the new licence. This is because they have poor records of the drivers' licences.\n\nThe DVLA deny any wrong doing. Because of their crass atitude and poor record keeping, the driver has to spend money on driving/riding lessons, feel demotivated and even worse, may lose their jobs if their jobs involve driving.\n\nAlso many insurers will charge these drivers with new driver charges.\n\nThe DVLA should start to keep proper records. To those they have messed up, they should pay for the costs of the lessons etc and the difference in insurance prices.",
