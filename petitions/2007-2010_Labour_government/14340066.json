            "background": "As demonstrated by the recent attempted attrocity at Detroit the current airport security measures are woefully inadequate.\n\nI believe that 25% of passengers on flights between airports in the Unoted Kingdom should be routinely strip searched. This should be increased to 50% on flights to or from airports in the European Union. For flights outside the Eurpoean Union the appropriate level should be between 50 and 100 percent and should vary from flight to flight.\n\nNo exception should be given to heads of state or government minsters or for passengers on holiday charter flights or airline staff.",
