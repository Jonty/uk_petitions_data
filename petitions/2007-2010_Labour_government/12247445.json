            "background": "The MPs have voted for a 2.3% pay increase from April.  This is very unfair, particularly in light of the economic crisis.\n\nThe people of Britain need to see Parliament acting in due fairness.  Who else can vote themselves a pay rise?  Not many can.\n\nDuring these troubled times Parliament and the Government need to be seen to be leading the way and NOT giving themselves pay rises.  When the economy looks better then vote, until then live with what you get now.",
