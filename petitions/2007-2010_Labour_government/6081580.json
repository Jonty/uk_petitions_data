            "background": "The majority of traffic lights in this country should be made part time. Not only will it improve journey times, but more importantly it will drastically reduce pollution helping significantly towards global warming. The number of times a whole string of cars has been forced to stop just to let one car out of a junction. Think about all the pollution all those cars produce when they have to start off again. Forcing cars to stop for no reason at all does a lot more harm than good. Most traffic lights need only be turned on during the rush hours, outside of those hours, they are a waste of time and energy, and a cause of unnecessary pollution.",
