However, to discourage them from abusing the system, all expenses should be taxed at the new 50% rate (no exemptions).  And to solve the second home issue, they should also stay in a floating accommodation block moored on the Thames directly next to the Commons.  Their eco-friendly behaviour will be an example to us all.",
