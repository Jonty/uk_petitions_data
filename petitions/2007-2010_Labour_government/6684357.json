            "background": "Dumfries & Galloway's communities are hugely dependent on its network of sub post offices - We reject the plans to force widespread closures on a community that relies upon their services.\n\nIn many small communities across the region, sub post offices are the only link for the community and perform a vital public service role, whilst in larger communities they are a valued provider of lifeline services.\n\nWith 2,500 proposed closures across the country, the axe is likely to fall on those that depend on them the most, with Dumfries & Galloway facing the brunt of this unpopular government policy. \n\nWe reject their closure and ask that the Government looks again at new ways of allowing sub-post offices to provide the new services that will secure their future.",
