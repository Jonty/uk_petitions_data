            "background": "Lord Goldsmith admitted in his citizenship report that there was a time that many UK nationals in HK found their UK passports not convenient enough.\n\nEven BNOs had the US visa refusal rate of 2.4% in 2007, we are still not eligible for the Visa Waiver Program. However, some countries with higher refusal rates like Korea are admitted to the VWP in 2008. It is probably because the UK Govt has not done its job in negotiating for better visa arrangements.\n\nRecently Dominican Republic also granted visa-free to China-HKSAR passport holders, but it has not extended this to UK-BNO holders. BNOs still need a US visa in order to apply for the landing tourist card.\n\nSome other countries (e.g. UAE, Rwanda etc.) also have misunderstood BNO status so they refuse to grant visa-free as they do for full UK citizens and/or HKSAR nationals. However, all BNOs have the right of abode in HK (stated in their passports, with HKID#). We are civilised, affluent and will not cause any trouble in any country. \n\nIt would be much better if the recommendations in the citizenship report are fully implemented. In the meantime, we would like to ask FCO to negotiate with other countries for visa free access.",
