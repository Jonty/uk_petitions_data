All this achieves is to make them planes\n     wait longer to take of on the taxi ways burning fuel. Same as\n     when they land, If the airport is not big enough there will be\n     no stands available and they need to sit on the taxiways again\n     burning lots of fuel waiting for a stand before they can power\n     down. That is why these planes need to come thorough quick. Its\n     a positive step in lower carbon, not to mention boosts the\n     economy and creates millions of jobs.",
