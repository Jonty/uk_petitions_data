            "background": "Parliament has lost the trust of the people following abuse of the expenses system.  A general election would permit MPs genuinely 'beyond reproach' to retain their seats in a publicly accountable way.  Those who have made expenses claims which fall between ridiculous and disgusting will have the opportunity to try and persuade their voters and taxpayers that there really was a good reason to make their claims.  Calling a general election on this issue will also make it easier to prosecute the small minority of MPs who have gone beyond the unwise into the realms of the illegal.  Only radical action can stop the rot of public mistrust and international ridicule of the mother of parliaments.  The current parliament sanctioned and abused this corrupt system.  People do not trust it to make a replacement.  Please give us an opportunity to vote in a completely new parliament to re-establish trust in politics and parliament as one of its highest priorities.",
