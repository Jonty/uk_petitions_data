        "background": "I see no reason why I shouldn't be allowed to use the iPlayer as soon as it is ready for release just because a vocal minority of Apple and Linux users object to the service not being available on their platform of choice from day one. The Windows community make up the majority of BBC consumers and it makes complete sense to allow the majority to experience this service whilst the BBC continue to work on releasing the service for the minority at a later date.",
