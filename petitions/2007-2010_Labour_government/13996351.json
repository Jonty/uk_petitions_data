        "background": "The Australian PM has issued a very profound apology to child migrants and financed travel and accommodation for some to Canberra. I was not among this group but witnessed same at Parliament House in Brisbane. I think funds should be made available to hear this apology in person and not via satellite TV as we are all mostly retired and have limited funds. This is a most important occasion as you would have been made aware with recent publicity. Most of the experiences were harrowing to say the least and I for one want to hear this apology from the front row of the British Houses of Parliament.  I have always pined for England from the day I left Tilbury Docks in May 1951 believing I was an orphan only to find many years later I did have a mother.  All records from the English orphanage were destroyed and piecing this jigsaw together was thanks to the Child Migrant Trust.  There are still a number of holes which will never be filled. Assistance for accommodation and travel to England would be greatly appreciated by us and could alleviate the feeling of desertion we have felt by the British Government over the years.",
