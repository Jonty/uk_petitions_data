            "background": "I would like to propose that the minimum age to legally buy and consume alcohol be reduced to 16. we understand that alcohol has a long term affect on people's health when drunk in large amounts frequently. however,the reason that \"binge drinking\" is a problem is that when youngsters do get hold of alcohol they have to make the most of it as getting hold of alcohol when below the age of 18 is difficult and illegal. reducing the age to 16 would cut down on the number of binge drinkers in the country significantly. some people say that people age 16 wouldn't be responsible enough to handle the effects of alcohol however,at age 16 you need to be responsible to handle the ability to gamble on the national lottery,buy scratchcards and are legal to have sexual intercourse which seems a much bigger responsibility than would be placed on 16 year olds who are consuming an amount of alcohol on a one off,e.g. a 16th birthday party. i now leave it up to the Great British public to decide.",
