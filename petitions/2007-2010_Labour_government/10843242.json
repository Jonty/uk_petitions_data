        "background": "It seems astonishing that in the financial system irresponsible behaviour is rewarded when in other forms of life it is usually punished. It seems that one of the major causes of the present financial chaos are policies  sanctioned by executives in financial institutions. Given the fact that many people have potentially lost money or jobs and that governments throughout the world have been forced to use taxpayers money to deal with disruption to the financial system it is surely only just to ask those who in large measure created this situation to rectify it from their own resources.",
