            "background": "We reject proposals to cut District Hospital services nationally and require the Goverment to create new policy protecting the historic \"Golden Hour\" for accident and emergencies, and births. New regulations are required to prevent Hospital and Primary Care Trusts degrading District Hospital services and then using historic degradation in services to justify further cuts. For example, removing consultants from Midwifery Units and then stating local maternity units are no longer viable because fewer babies can be born in a midwifery led unit. \n\nWe require a restructure of the decision making process within our Health Service to enable greater input from the patients whose tax pays for the service. At present local health policy is left to the discretion of non elected Hospital and Primary Care Trusts with little Government intervention. As a result milions of people living, working or travelling in the areas where cuts in A&E and Midwifery services have occured are now at greater risk.",
