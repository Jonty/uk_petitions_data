        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Unfortunately, there is certainly a need for more new homes throughout Britain to support changes in the population, but this will of course have implications for the environment. There are many ways to make new houses eco-friendly, including insulation etc but surely an even better method is to plant a green roof, with creeping shrubs and other plants suitable for the microclimate. Walls can also be covered after this fashion, with 'vertical gardens' (in the style of Patrick Blanc). Not only would these look highly attractive, they can easily be low-maintenance and of course they also replace CO2 in the atmosphere with oxygen, taking up almost no space too.",
