            "background": "The government is undertaking a review into the services provided by pharmacies.\nAt the moment patients who live more than one mile away from a chemist, can get their medicinces from the doctor's surgery. If the rules change, there may no longer be an option and the dispensary will have to close.\nNothing is proposed to replaced this service, therefore patients would lose the choice of where to collect their urgent and repeat medicines.\nAs with most rural practices, the income generated by the dispensary supports other services offered by the surgery. If the surgery lose the dispensary income it would lead to staff redundacies and investment in the Practice infrastrusture would be decreased.\nI implore the government to leave the Surgery Dispensaries policy as it stands today.",
