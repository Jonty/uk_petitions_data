With services ranging from kerbside collections, composting and furniture re-use schemes the group lives up to its promise. \n\nBut what is really impressive about WISH is not just the 1,200 tonnes of waste it is diverting from landfill each year, but the social function it serves in doing so, employing people with a spectrum of disabilities to create diversity and the feeling for every individual that they are contributing to something that is exciting, new and ambitious. \n\nThe project is an exemplar of best practice that should be widely replicated - but government locally and nationally MUST support such schemes rather than impede them with needless regulatory interference that is AGAINST the public interest. The third sector offers the way forward with recycling schemes - if you will let it Mr Brown.",
