            "background": "Some people drive without insurance, knowing that the penalty if caught is often less than the annual premium they would pay if they chose to take out insurance.  \n\nA published study suggests that the cost of uninsured drivers adds \u00a330 to the cost of each premium for insured drivers.  Why should each honest insured driver fund those who choose to disregard the law?  \n\nA high fine will increase the deterrant and provide the revenue for compensation/costs that the Motor Insurers Bureau currently require of our insurers.\n\nPut simply, the deterrant needs to be strong enough that people are left with an economical alternative - to take out insurance.",
