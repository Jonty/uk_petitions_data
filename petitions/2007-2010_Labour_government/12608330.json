            "background": "The Student Loans Company have announced that the interest rate on student loans - meant to be set equal to RPI - shall only do so for people with pre-1998 loans. RPI in March, when they set the rate, was -0.4%, but post-1998 loan holders are being charged 0%. This is completely against the concept of student loans in maintaining their *real* value, not rising in nominal terms.",
