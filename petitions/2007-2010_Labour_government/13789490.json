        "action": "Ensure that the vital wording of the Redd agreement reads to protect our rainforests, not leave loopholes for destructive practices to continue.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In this agreement, there are two opposing pieces of text, both with completely different connotations and consequences. the first reads: \u201call parties should collectively aim at... reducing gross deforestation in developing countries by at least 50% by 2020...\u201d and implies that the rate in which natural rainforests are cleared slows down. However, the second reads: \u201call parties should aim at halting forest cover loss in developing countries by 2030\u201d and has a completely different meaning. \u2018Forest cover loss\u2019 means literally exactly what it says, in that it does not specify what forest cover it has to be. So in effect, the rainforests can be cut down, yet replaced by mono cultures like oil palms. All without breaking the agreement. Please sign this petition to ensure our rainforests get the future they deserve. Without rainforests, the fight against climate change will be next to impossible.",
