Also, making sure roads have enough dropped curbs and pavements are not uneven.\n\nAnother problem is that disabled toilets are unisex and they don't have changing facilities.  Along with this,cash points are too high.\n\nAlso, for blind people it is difficult to cross roads so crossings need fixing to make it safe.\n\nDisabled access is a right not a previledge!",
