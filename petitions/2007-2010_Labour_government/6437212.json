        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Whilst we believe in freedom of choice, we believe that stockings are far more stylish, comfortable and healthy than tights. A whole generation of women are now unaware of the benefits the wearing stockings has.\n\nSince tights became popular in the mid 1960s the divorce rate has risen and continues to rise. We believe in strong family values and feel it is important to ensure that women realise the importance of wearing stockings.\n\nWe feel that Great Britain is losing it's greatness. The slippery slope started in the mid 1960s with the invention of tights and continued downwards via horrors including the shell suit, the Juicy Couture style tracksuit and the low rise jean. The country needs a return to style, and what is more stylish than a seamed fully fashioned stocking?\n\nWe need underwear manufacturers to produce better suspender belts with metal clasp that actually serve a purpose rather than just bedroom eyecandy.",
