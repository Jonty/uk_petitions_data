            "background": "There is no definitive test for Pernicious Anaemia.  The current test for intrinsic factor antibodies could be as little as 30% accurate.  Due to the lack of an accurate diagnosis patients are often diagnosed as suffering from another disease.  The most common misdiagnoses are Depression, M.E., Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and M.S.\nTreatment of Pernicious Anaemia is by replacement B12 therapy that is usually administred once every three months.  For a great many patients that is not enough and most feel the need for another injection after one month.  Many patients are prescribed anti-depressants rather than a harmless vitamin and are forced to seek treatment in the private sector where self-injecting Methylcobalamin at regular intervals is prescribed.  It is estimated that there are around 500,000 patients with Pernicious Anaemia in the U.K. and the cost of administering an injection is estimated to be \u00a310 for the cost of the injection and the nurse's time.  The true cost is much higher (time off work to visit the nurse etc.).  Four injections per year = \u00a340 and if this is mulitiplied by 500,000 the cost in nurse time alone is \u00a320 million.",
