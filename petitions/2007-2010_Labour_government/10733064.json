        "action": "To treat the citizens of the UK who live in Northern Ireland with equity of esteem when giving aid to ease the burden of fuel poverty as they have been excluded from the recent help that the PM announced.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The people of Northern Ireland have once again been snubbed by another British Prime Minister.\n\nThe PM in typical Harold Wilson style has treated the citizens of Northern Ireland as second class citizens once again.\n\nThe Prime Minister announced measures to help alleviate the present fuel poverty crisis on the mainland but he excluded Northern Ireland from his plans of help, I guess the reason being for this is that there are no votes in Northern Ireland for the British Government.\n\nThe citizens of Northern Ireland who pay the highest utility bills in the UK and who have no choice to who they buy their gas or electric from are controlled by the utilities monopoly who have intensified the fuel poverty situation in Northern Ireland by over hiking the charges, the people of Northern Ireland deserve better from the British Government by treating them with equality in line with the rest of the UK.",
