        "background": "To ensure that religious education is taught correctly in Roman Catholic primary and secondary schools.That all primary & secondary Roman Catholic schools are given a half hour period at the start of each school day to say the Holy Rosary and that this is to be made compulsory . That each Roman Catholic pupil in the UK is to be given a Holy Bible , Holy Rosary & Guardian Angel medal all of which are to be specially blessed by the Pope . That the main emphasis in Religious Education in Roman Catholic schools is mainly on the reading of the Bible , prayer ,your Guardian Angel ,  fasting and sacrifice and that theology should be taught by the local priest who should attend the school at least  2-3 times a week  in which to teach theology classes instead of wasting their time going to the golf course or NHS Hospitals ( unless the person requests the Last Rites ) . This is where the school I went to in Bishopbriggs called Turnbull High went wrong regarding Religious Education as they did none of the aforementioned and this is why the Scottish schools discipline & spirituality is in chaos .",
