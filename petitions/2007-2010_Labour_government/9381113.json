More than 100 countries will meet to discuss a ban on the use, manufacture and sale of cluster munitions.  We urge our government not to continue to seek exemptions to allow the retention of certain cluster munitions.",

            "background": "Cluster munitions are anti-personnel weapons, designed to emit fast-flying fragments which maximise soft tissue damage over the widest possible area.  Their aim is to kill as many people as possible and wounds they inflict are horrific.  \nAs part of a process initiated by Norway, more than 100 countries will meet this month in Dublin to negotiate an international treaty to ban their use, as well as to clear contaminated land, destroy stockpiles and assist victims.  Last November, Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a ban on cluster munitions, yet Britain is one of a small group of nations, including France and Germany, seeking broad exemptions to allow them to retain certain cluster munitions.  We urge the Prime Minister to follow through on his promise to seek and support a comprehensive ban on these most horrific of weapons.",
