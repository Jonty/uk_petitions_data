            "background": "There was an ice rink in Birmingham until 2003, but it closed down, leaving everyone in the West Midlands with no other choice than to wait for Street Ice at Christmas or go to Solihull Ice Rink. Solihull is only a small centre, and while it has many public sessions, the ice hockey clubs and especially the figure skating sessions are far too overcrowded for the 'serious' skaters to be able to train productively. Therefore it is essential that Birmingham is provided with an ice rink to reduce the burden on Solihull and stop people from having to travel a long distance.",
