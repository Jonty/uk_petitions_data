Can he be impartial about MPs expenses given that the press previously exposed the claims made for taxi use by his wife?\n\n2. His ill tempered rebuttal of David Winnick and Kate Hoey was belittling, inaccurate and irrelevant. He failed to defend democracy and treats MPs inconsistently. \n\n3. His failure to tackle the issue of MPs expenses impartially is as injurious to British democracy on the global stage as the abuse of the expenses system itself.\n\n4. He hasn\u2019t grasped the public sentiment about MPs abusing the expenses system for their own gain.",
