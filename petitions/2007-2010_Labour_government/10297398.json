            "background": "36 year-old Jason Howard cycled on a pavement and killed 17 year old Rhiannon Bennett. This would have been bad enough had it been a genuinely unavoidable accident, but in fact as widely reported in the media Jason Howard shouted to her \"Move, because I'm not stopping.\"\nIf a driver shouted this to a pedestrian crossing the street instead of stopping, and then killed them, they would quite rightly receive a jail sentence. In this case Rhiannon as the pedestrian had right of way on the pavement - she had the right to walk safely along it. Jason Howard had no business cycling on the pavement in the first place, but it is the breathtaking arrogance of his words that has angered me enough to petition the Prime Minister.\nWe hear a lot about young people having no respect and posing a menace to society. In this case it was an adult's arrogance and lack of respect for a young woman which killed her. The law should reflect the fact that an innocent girl lost her life in a totally preventable incident. Jason Howard should have been punished severely for his actions. \nPerhaps the young people we see behaving with so little respect for others have grown up observing adults like Jason Howard.",
