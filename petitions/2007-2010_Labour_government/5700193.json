        "background": "The office under threat might deal  ith anything from helping find accommodation for a family fleeing domestic violence, to obtaining birth certificates or pension for elderly Irish people. It also helps trace relatives of people who have died. The following are just some areas where the Irish Welfare and Information Centre offers advice and assistance: accommodation issues, alchol and drug misuse problems, benefit claims, birth certificates & passport assistance, conflicts with neighbours, debt situation, domestic violence, family crisis, funerals for people with no next of kin, general support issues,health and care needs, isolation and loneliness, pastoral befriending and mediation, return to ireland assistance and advice, signposting and liasing with external agencies and prison visit. Without this \u00a360,000 funding the IWIC's frontline crisis intervention centre in Deritend will not be able to help as many people as they do now.",
