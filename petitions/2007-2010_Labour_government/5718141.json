            "background": "Motor insurance companies should offer 50cc cover free on every car insurance policy.\n As a green issue the government should force Insurance companies to include within every comprehensive motor policy, free insurance cover for mopeds and scooters with a cubic capacity below 50cc. \nThis would encourage motorists to move away from their cars for short journeys where the vehicle has perhaps only the driver or just the driver and 1 passenger, the environmental solution would be a small two wheeled vehicle (moped/scooter).\n\nModern mopeds are economical and very easy to use; they pay inexpensive road fund licence and are very easy to park. Inclusive moped cover with the car driver\u2019s insurance company would be an encouragement, that wouldn't cost the government anything but it would free up the roads and ease congestion on the roads.",
