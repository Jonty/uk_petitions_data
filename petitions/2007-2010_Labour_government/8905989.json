            "background": "I think it would be a great idea to re introduce national service for 14 to 18 yr olds.  They will learn respect and real life skills; this will bring down crime and sponging off of the taxpayer after finishing education at 16 with no life skills or respect.  A career path and trades will be learnt and no more youths causing mysery to everyday law abiding citizens.",
