            "background": "Please lets come together to stop children being harmed, the recent news articles are disgraceful, the horrid sickening details of what happened to baby P.  Why are so called 'experienced social workers' allowed to continue on with a job they are just not doing.  The role of a childs social worker is to protect children like baby P, That never happened.  I have children and I am sure that people who do not have children feel sickened by what happened to this poor innocent child, and we now know its not just this poor baby that has suffered. STOP THIS NOW, make a change to law, policies and KICK OUT social workers who fail to do the job they are assigned to do PROTECT CHILDREN. Think for a second about what these poor children have gone through, the pain,agony,fear,hurt,torture. It is wrong  - time to change Dont turn away from what needs to be done. HELP THEM NOW, PLEASE",
