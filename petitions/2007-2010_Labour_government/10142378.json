            "background": "There are no longer any Polytechnics in our country and for what reason? So that the Government can say that more people have degrees. This degrades what it is to have a Degree and the sorts of people who should go to polytechnics do not seem to understand most Degrees are worthless now. It is making it harder to impress employers and it is more important than ever to go to a good university. Greater reliance is put on league tables to guide prospective students on where to study. Which is unfair on some leading universities which do nt perform as well.",
