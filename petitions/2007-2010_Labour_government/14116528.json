        "background": "PC Barker should receive the Queens Police Medal for Gallantry for his brave actions, which led to his unfortunate death. It's about time fallen officers who have died in the line of duty were recognised by HRH for the work they do serving her, and their country. The last QPM awarded to an officer for Gallantry was 1977, yet everyday officers risk their lives in the line of duty.",
