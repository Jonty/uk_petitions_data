        "background": "A new rule was brought in that councils will now give tenants the rent money and that the tenant will pass this on to the landlord.  In some cases this is not happening and the tenant is keeping the money themselves.  The council will do nothing until they are 8 weeks in arrears and even then you will not get those 8 weeks you are owed.  Bring it back that the council pay the landlord directly like before. Councils are crying out for properties so it must be in their best interest to get this changed as well.",
