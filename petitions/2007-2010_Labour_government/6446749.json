            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A great many road junctions now have cycle forward boxes to enable cyclists to move forward of standing traffic, making it easier for them to be seen and to help prevent traffic turning right across them.\n\nThe boxes are hailed by cycle safety camapaigners as crucial to keeping cyclists safe on the roads.  A number of high profile cases have seen cyclists killed by lorries turning left across them and the boxes help prevent such senseless deaths.\n\nHowever cycle forward boxes are not enforceable in law - which means that there is no penalty to motorists that use these boxes to inch ahead at junctions endangering all road users in their demand to make a 'quick getaway.\n\nWe ask that as these boxes do help save lives that it be made illegal and a suitable deterrant applied (a fine and license points) to improve the safety of our roads for cyclists and confirm the Government's position on climate change and improving the nation's health.",
