For example with the new NHS Electronic Staff Record Scheme, data is to be held outside of the UK, when this was challenged I was told, \"Working for the NHS and getting paid are also optional\".\nIf you buy a new TV now you have to tell the supplier your personal details but have no option where they put those details.\nConsumers and Staff need far more rights over where their data is stored.",
