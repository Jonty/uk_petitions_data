            "background": "A much fairer system would be based upon each households income tax. People who can afford to run two houses, one of which is usually a second/holiday home, usually earn more than the locally employed , would therefore have to contribute more to the local economies. It may also encourage some of them to sell their second home therefore freeing up more homes for local families. It would also ensure that MP's start to pay back some of the money which they have been able to rip off from the country legally.\nLet us have a fairer system so that the poorest members of the country aren't always being unfairly penalised",
