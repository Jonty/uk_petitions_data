            "background": "Dear Sir,\n\nI would draw your attention to a report from the Royal United Services Institute titled: A Force for Honour, which asks the question of whether Britain wishes to remain a Great Power, and in what manner we might wish to achieve that status.\n\nThe five options include:\n1. Global Guardian (eg Desert Storm)\n2. Strategic Raiding (eg Sierra Leonne/Falklands)\n3. Contributory Option (eg Australia)\n4. Gendarmerie Option (eg Belgium)\n5. Little Britain Option (eg Ireland)\n\nOnly the first two of the options listed above will maintain Britain as a Great Power.\n\nThe author of the report supports the idea of Britain as a Great Power, achieved by the Strategic Raiding option which would focus on maritime and expeditionary forces, I agree and would urge this course of action upon you.\n\nOption two is compatible with our history and our geography, and the shared social and cultural expectations that have emerged from that history, we are a maritime nation.\n\nYours sincerely",
