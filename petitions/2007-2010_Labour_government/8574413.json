            "background": "I recently tried to give blood at my university. I filled out the forms, waited for 45 minutes and then when it was my turn to donate, I was told that the Blood Service does not accept donations from men who have had sex with another man. I realise that gay men are at higher risk of contracting the AIDS virus but I also know that everyones donated blood is tested for this disease (amongst others). There are plenty of gay men in this country who are able to give blood, healthy blood and just because we are gay (which I might add is NOT a choice we make) it doesn't mean that we have AIDS. Please ask the blood service to reconsider this old rule and maybe the gay population will be able stop the shortage of blood in this country.",
