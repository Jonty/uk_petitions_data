            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I keep thinking that the way to rescue our economy - if we must spend 50 billion would be better distributed like this...\n \nDistribute the funds via the individual debts of britains population.\n \nThe average households debt is \u00a335,000\n \nIt would cost around 1 trillion to liquidate us all.\n \nThe banks would receive over 1 trillion in REAL money\n \nThe people of Britain would be debt free and able to move freely. Which translates as spend more freely.\n \nThere would be no risk involved in re-couping tax payers money.\n \nLots of people would be very happy.\n \nIf that sounds ridiculous - mainly because of the huge unforeseen amounts of cash that would be required in reality, then consider the fact that 700 billion as proposed by the US - will be a drop in the ocean. Wall street traders in the know say that there are as yet Trillions of hidden $s still waiting to surface and are currently not recorded and/or are hidden from regulators.\n \nDoes this still sound like such a useless idea?\n \nI petition the government to consider this option.",
