        "background": "Much of the serious organised crime in the UK is now funded by the sale of drugs. Many people use drugs illegally and under the radar, meaning that huge problems are created.\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to legalise the sale and use of Cannabis at licensed and regulated outlets, much like the Dutch system of coffee shops.\n\nThis move would take the profits from the sale of Cannabis away from the criminal dealers and move it into the hand of regulated companies, whilst allowing a tax to be levvied on it, thus increasing tax revenue in the UK.\n\nResearch has shown the damaging effects of Cannabis to be less severe than once thought and the government should move with the times to allow it.",
