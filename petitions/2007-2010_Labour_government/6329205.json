            "background": "Again we read the news of another young life tragically taken away by the effects of gun crime. There must be a solution to this increasing trend. As this situation if unchallenged will reach pandemic proportions. I would like the government to set up a reform group to look at the support and education against the use of weapons on our streets, the censoring of violent games, music and TV images, tougher sentences for persons selling, carrying or using lethal weapons. There must be a national campaign to show our children that carrying guns and knives is not cool. The time for action to crack down on this social cancer is now. We don't want spin doctor statements Mr Brown we want decisive action.",
