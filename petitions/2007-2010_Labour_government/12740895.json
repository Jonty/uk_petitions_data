            "background": "It is discrimination to refuse to employ someone just because they have a poor credit record or have CCJs etc. The current financial crisis has made even more people incur bad debt problems and for those of us who find themselves unemployed we cannot even be considered for certain jobs because of our poor credit history. Why? Having debts does not make you a bad person, untrustworthy, a thief or incapable of doing a good job! Credit checks should only be allowed when people are requesting credit. I suspect that most of the MPs who are guilty of fiddling their expenses do not have bad credit but I know I would be more trustworthy and more capable of doing a good job than them! This practice is making it impossible for some people to gain employment and forcing them into deeper financial crisis. It must be stopped.",
