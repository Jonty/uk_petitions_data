        "background": "On Friday 11th December 2009. Andy Norman, Host and organiser of Thimbleberry Music Festival in County Durham, Uk is in court facing the charge of \"permit the use of cannabis on his premises\" relating to alleged use by the festival-goers of cannabis at the last September festival.No one was, I believe, arrested at the festival. In effect he is to be prosecuted for the alleged offences of other people. If he is prosecuted this would set a precedent that could have serious repercussions for all festivals. Would any land-owner (including the councils) want to risk holding a festival on their land knowing that they could be prosecuted for the alleged offences of the festival-goers upon which they can have little control.\n\nThis a serious charge. He could face jail.\n\nThe future of all small, independent festivals could be jeopardised if Andy Norman is prosecuted",
