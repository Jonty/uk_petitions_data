The media states that if you have more people than bedrooms then it is unechonomical to change to a water meter, I used my common sence and feel that the water companies (and Govenment) are now discrimating against me and my family at our time of need. I know the water companies would all like us all on meter's (and maybe this is another way of forcing us) - but what happened to human rights, Why should I and other unmetered Customers not be entittled to help, when we are buying the same product/service?",
