        "background": "This petition regards Application No: 9/0000-07, the application to vary condition 10 of planning permission 9/0367-06 (increase the number of permitted HGV movements at London Concrete site, Orphanage Road to no more than 44 per day to an average of 100 per day).\n\nThis application should be turned down on the following grounds;\n\n1) The average increase in daily movements of HGVs of 66 will cause additional traffic congestion in one of the worse areas for congestion in Watford. The cross roads by St Johns Road and the Wellington Pub is already one of the worse congested areas in Watford. \n\n2) The increased noise pollution, and dust would degrade the local residents enjoyment of the area.\n\n3) The railway bridge is not wide enough to accommodate two HGVs passing beneath it, this means that when two attempt to pass a traffic blockage is created, or the bridge becomes damaged. This is both dangerous for public safety, and creates additional, exponential, traffic congestion.",
