            "background": "From the perspective of a member of the british public, almost every aspect of my life has become harder and, in many ways more taxing under Brown's labour party. I do not choose to believe their current rhetoric that life is not so bad and that what problems exist are somehow not their fault. I believe that they fail to properly understand the nature of democracy and the needs of the public. So strongly do I feel this that I wish, with all my heart and mind that Gordon Brown is removed from power, either of his own volition or by force of impeachment.",
