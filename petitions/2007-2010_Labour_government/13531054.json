Daisy was lucky but sadly many are not.Reports show that up to as many as 5 children die each day from undiagnosed strokes. Hospitals need to be more aware that children do have life threatening strokes and support should be made available to them and their families as sadly this has not been the case with Daisy.Daisy was initially discharged from Hospital diagnosed with shock.This must not be allowed to happen again.",
