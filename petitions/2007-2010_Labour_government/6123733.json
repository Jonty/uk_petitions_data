With each e-petition we feel that rather than just having people sign the petition, they should be able to choose whether they agree or disagree.  Often we see petitions which we strongly disagree with and would like to opportunity to express our dislike or disagreement of certain petitions.\n\nWe feel that although this would be more than just a petition, it would effectively give the government a fairer view of how the nation feels as currently a simple petition is a rather one-sided view.",
