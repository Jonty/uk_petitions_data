            "action": "change the law so that those building societies who forced anybody who wanted to buy a house to take out a fixed rate mortgage by withdrawing all products apart from fixed rate mortgages at upwards of 6% - which was a move designed to maximise their return - during the recent loan crisis are forced to pass on lower interest rates to all borrowers.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Building societies are receiving interest rates of 6% upwards on many loans made in the last 6 or 9 months while paying out less than 1% interest on any money held in their society as savings.  This is a blatant rip off practice which is badly affecting anybody who has taken out a new mortgage and the government, which has used our money (that paid over in taxes) to keep the building societies in business, needs to do something to make life more equitable by removing the differential between borrowers and savers.",
