            "background": "Introduction:\nBAA's and TfL's terrible mismanagement of access to Heathrow airport has left commuters to the Europe's busiest airport out of pocket, delayed, annoyed and stranded.  The current status quo of an exorbitantly disproportionately expensive connection from Paddington (which should see a fare reduction and accessibility of Oyster Cards) and the similar farce connection of the Piccadilly Line requires a change.  \nThe Proposal: To use existing infrastructure to connect Waterloo with Heathrow T5 along the Staines route by 2008.  There exists a strong business case as the link would fulfill key government strategies of relieving congestion in Thames Valley area, M4 and on local roads, reducing economic inefficiency of time lost in travelling and environmental impact. Improving access to Heathrow for the current and potential workforce and to build on Heathrow's current status as a major transport hub in light of the 2012 games.",
