Immigrants should not be allowed to come to this country and immediately claim countless benefits - no benefits should be allowed to immigrants unless they have contributed NIC and Tax like all other citizens.  They should not be given priority housing from local councils and authority's - they should wiat on a waiting list for years like the rest of us!  Translators should not be provided for them or their children - if you want to live in the UK, being able to speak english is essential.",
