            "background": "The national speed limit was introduced several decades ago. It was fit for its time, when cars were slower and a lot less safer. Seat belts were not even required.\n\nEvery day on the motorway more cars than not are driving at a speed above the National Speed Limit. \n\nI believe that if we were to raise the speed limit by 10 miles per hour to 80mph, and be far more strict on drivers breaking this limit we would be more comfortable when driving on the road, which will lead to less accidents.",
