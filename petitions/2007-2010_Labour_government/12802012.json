            "background": "Due to the current financial climate it is being requested that some of the Television Licence money be given to channels due to them no longer making profits.\n\nI a taxpayer would prefer to not have any of these channels as if they cannot afford to exist then they should close down, this sharing will only end with an increase in the licence fee as it would become diluted and the companies and channels involved would require more money due to inflation and other expenses that require funding.\n\nNew channels appear quite often as part of sky's package and appear to be profitable so maybe the companies making losses are not being managed in the correct way.\n\nPlease sign this petition to stop us the TV Licence payers from having this shared and potentially increased significantly.",
