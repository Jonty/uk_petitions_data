            "background": "Those who are claiming unemployment benefits should be made to work for their money rather than just enjoying free handouts. Many are unable to find employment and I'm sure would enjoy having something useful to occupy their day. Others deliberatley avoid working and should be forced to repay their debt in other ways. \n\nOur streets and the country-side are becoming increasingly messy so with this paid-for resource at our disposal, let's use them to solve this litter problem we have.\n\nLogistically, teams of unemployed could work their way around areas of our towns monitored by benefit office representitives. If they don't show up and register, then they won't receive their subsequent benefit claim.",
