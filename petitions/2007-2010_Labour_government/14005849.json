As this is also a family activity it encourages the younger generation to \u2018get out\u2019 with their family and also encourages the older generation to stay active. \nI would also like to point out that it actually contravenes the wording that is in their Business Section and is headed   \u2018Holding events in The Royal Parks\u2019\nGeocaching certainly fits the criteria mentioned within that quoted section\nMany  authorities  accept Geocaching with negotiated agreements in place so as the hiding of and searching for the actual Geocaches is carefully regulated.",
