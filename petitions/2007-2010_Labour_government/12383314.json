            "background": "Puntius denisonii was first imported for the aquarium trade in 1996. Since then, the numbers of fish stocks have decreased by 70% per annum because of importing P. denisonii over the size of 4\"(10cm) which are sexually mature fish. These fish cant spawn to keep the stocks up, so i write this petition to plea for tighter controls in imports, making the legal import size, 6\" (15cm) or more, to allow larger sized fish under the reccommended import size and over the export size so that some fish that mature to breed.",
