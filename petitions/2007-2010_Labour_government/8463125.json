        "background": "In dealing with this crisis, brought on by poor management by both the company directors themselves AND The Government and its agencies, it now only seems keen to:\n1. Protect taxpayers; \n2. To promote financial stability; and 3. To protect consumers.  \n\nThis clearly leaves out entirely from aims any kind of protection or even consideration for small shareholders.  Why?  \nMost small shareholders are not rich people & do not deserve to be written off ENTIRELY, while at the same time all small savers are saved from ANY loss AND the Government also make a profit from its support (or at least hopes to). \n\nIf the bank is Nationalised rumours are that shareholders will get next to\nnothing.  If the Virgin Money scheme is successful current shareholders are badly marginalised while the Virgin organisation reaps disproportionate future gains.  A solution that properly considers ALL current stakeholders is the only moral one.  Why do they not address this side of the equation fairly?",
