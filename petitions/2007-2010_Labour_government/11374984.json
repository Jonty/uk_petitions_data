            "background": "The Bank of England has been steadily cutting the base rate and it now sits at the lowest level since the Bank\u2019s inception; the Bank's monetary policy committee said the pace of contraction in economic activity had increased during the fourth quarter of 2008 and that output was likely to continue to fall sharply during the first part of this year.\nThere is clearly emphasis on \u2018freeing up\u2019 monetary supply.\n\nFor those in the UK who have been prudent with their finances over the past years, the critical drop in interest rates causes problems in the reduced income for their savings.\nIt is reported that more than 7 million people have saving accounts that already pay interest of 1% or less. Just over six months ago, savers were enjoying rates approaching 7%. This is a source of funding that is available for the UK Banking sector, but may soon be \u2018lost\u2019 to non-UK Banks who are offering 5%.\n\nThe under-signed petition the Prime Minister to emphasis to the Banking sector that there is a source of funding that is available, but only if a realistic return is made on private sector individual savings.",
