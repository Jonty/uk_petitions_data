            "background": "From April 1st 2009, there has been a fundamental increase in the number of 16's and under and 60's and over for free swimming in public swimming sessions.  for any disabled person trying to swim in a pool overwhelmed by lots of people is, by it's nature, stressful.  Not really the point of attending a leisure activity.  My request is to increase the number of disabled sessions to try and overcome this problem.  Currently, my local Authority has 5 pools, but only 4 hours in total per week dedicated to disabled people.",
