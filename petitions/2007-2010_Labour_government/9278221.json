            "background": "It has become obvious that the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a mistake when he did away with the ten pence tax band. Anybody who had researched properly would have seen that this would adversely affect the poorest in society, the very people who are the core Labour voters. It might be embarrassing for the chancellor and the Prime minister to reverse the decision, but nowhere as embarrassing as the consequences if they don't. Write to your MP and let them know your feelings on this matter.",
