        "background": "Brokers would like the ability to take much of the onus from clients as a service. We would like to be able to log in to the client's existing mortgagee and view, online, the settlement figure of all accounts and see the client's payment profile. Only FSA registered brokers with FULL client details and previous  registration with that lender can apply for a mortgage on a client's behalf but does not have the facilities to ensure the correct amount is being applied for. Having this will really increase the speed of which these mortgages are completing. If, so say, any broker can effectively apply for a mortgage without a signature from the client, why is it we can't obtain these figures this way when we do!",
