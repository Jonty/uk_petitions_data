            "background": "Currently employers must pay for the first 6 weeks of maternity pay at 90% of the employees current salary. Although some employers increase this length (NHS and Council workers especially), many do not and it is forcing many families into a difficult financial situation. We are way behind most European countries, where maternity pay is given much more importance. \n\nEmployers should pay their employees at least 3 months maternity pay at full pay before the statutory maternity pay begins.",
