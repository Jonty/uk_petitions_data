            "background": "Since I have been in schooling from 1995 to the present, I have recognised a much more impersonal development between school children and the curriculum. It seems that teachers are pressured into making sure the majority of their class gets high grades, that they unwillingly pressure their students when really they would much rather go through a difficult subject steadily so that everyone understands. I must admit that sometimes I feel more like a number on a grade sheet than an actual student. Therefore I call on every parent and student in every school to sign this petition and stop the needless, agravating, stressful pressure that is put on us at a time in our lives when we can do without it most.",
