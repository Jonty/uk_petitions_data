        "background": "Following the proposed closure of the Cadbury site at Keynsham, Bristol, there is the potential loss of 500 jobs there and thousands of other jobs dependent on the factory both locally and nationally. \n\nI am calling on the Prime Minister to put the utmost pressure on the Cadbury board to ensure that these jobs are protected and not lost to cheaper European competitors.  It is the Prime Minister's duty to stand up for British workers in the same way that other governments protect their workers' interests.\n\nThe Somerdale site has been producing chocolate for 70 years and is Keynsham's major employer.  Somerdale {Keynsham] is a profitable site, a productive plant and part of Bristol's heritage as well as our manufacturing history.\n\nThis will have a huge impact, with many workers depending on the jobs to pay their mortgages and the town's economy will suffer when the factory closes, causing losses of tax collection, increase in personal debts, loss in rates collection, and increase of benefit payments, all supported by the UK population.",
