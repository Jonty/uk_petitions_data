The pain medications available in the UK at the moment go from Codeine (Weak) straight to Morphine (Very Strong). In America various other medications such as Hydrocodone, Oxycodone and Hydromorphone are used, which can provide the bridge from Codeine to Morphine, and would allow thousands to get on with their lives with a much more bearable level of pain.\n\nSo we, the undersigned ask the Prime Minister to bring in these medications and end the suffering of those in Chronic pain.",
