Clearly, Mr. Brown ought to prevent the youth of our fine Kingdom being sullied by Russell Brand's vulgar brand of anti-charm. As banning the film is outside the Prime Minister's remit, this massive and prohibitive tax will serve a similar purpose.\n\nRegrettably, at least a few people will be foolish enough to see the film. The revenue raised from ticket sales, then, ought to be directed to funding public screenings of Rik Mayall's original masterpiece.",
