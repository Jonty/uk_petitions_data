            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Since the age for buying cigarrtes was raised, many who were legally able to sustain their addiction have been reduced to begging people on the strrets to buy the cigarretes for them. Despite the government wishing Britian to be the fifty first state of america the government has not fully thought about the public and those who will have to suffer the consequences of the governments rational decisions. when a child reaches the age of 16 they are legally in control of their money so should they not be in charge of what to spend the money on, even if this means harming one's body. In the short period between turning 16 and turning 18 people do not become any less at risk from cigarretes nor do their opinions on smoking change, and so the goal for a healthier nation has not been reached, it has just caused many to smoke in secret.",
