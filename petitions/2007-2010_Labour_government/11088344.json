We believe there is an insult to human dignity where the incitement to violence and murder of LGBT community members is seen as a lesser crime to that of incitement to violence and murder. Racist artists are banned on the grounds that they are a threat to public order and good community relations. The current situation offering double standards in London Metropolitan police operations is unacceptable. The support by the London Metropolitan Police for perfomances by artists recorded as using 'Murder Lyrics' against members of the wider community is unacceptable.\"",
