            "background": "The digitisation of TV required only the fitting of a low cost decoder between the aerial socket and the TV (though sometimes the signal needed to be boosted.)  In contrast, all existing radio equipment in homes or cars except the minority that receives a DAB signal will be useless.  This is because radio aerials are integral to the radios.  Expensive integrated hi-fi equipment will no longer supply radio as one of its features: one-piece hi-fi will be scrap and for multi-piece systems replacing the tuner will spoil the appearance of the whole installation. The radio lifeline of those who are elderly and/or infirm will need to be replaced.  Radios are reliable, and most would otherwise last for many, many years.  The cost to radio listeners of replacing all their radios will typically be many times that for the adaptation of their TVs.  Meanwhile, unlike the situation with digital TV, the benefit in terms of freeing up FM frequencies or making additional radio stations available is at best marginal.",
