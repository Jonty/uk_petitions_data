        "background": "I find it hard to understand being a British Citizen how on earth you can let Learco Chindamo live freely in the UK once he has served his so called sentence.  What are you robustly challenging? This person took a life and knew exactly what he was doing coming from the background he does. Just to carry a knife at the age of 15 is bad enough but to use it to kill is horrific - let alone what it has done to the bereaved family.  I fail to see why he cannot be deported back to Italy regardless of the language barrier or family ties, after all it's not like you're not sending him to the war in Iraq.  You claim you want to listen to the people of this country, well now is your chance to really sit up. DEPORT THIS MONSTER and let  Frances Lawrence and her respective family live without fear.",
