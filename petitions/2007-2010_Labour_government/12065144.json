            "background": "Family Law is decided upon by a judge hearing evidence from parties contained within that family unit, also Guardians, CAFCASS, Social Services and reporting experts.\n\nThis petition is to carry out family law in the same way criminal cases are heard. Evidence would be submitted with a jury deciding the outcome at a final hearing. This stops the people involved with the case being directly involved with any decision making. After hearing the result of the jury the judge could then set out the restrictions and orders with regards to the jury's decision.\n\nThis petition is directly aimed at the prime minister to ensure family courts are based on innocent till proven guilty, as with all other law.\n\nI will campaign on this matter by talking to the press and also trying to get many MP's involved with promoting this petition. \n\nMiscarriages of Justice in family law must be concluded as soon as possible and a new and fair system put in place.",
