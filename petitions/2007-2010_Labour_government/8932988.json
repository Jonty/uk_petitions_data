        "background": "I would like to see a public enquiry into the actions of Argyll and Bute Council in the wastage of public funds in the massive overspend in the development of Oban Airport and the persecution of the users and services provider through bullying. As a result of the development the airport has no greater level of facilities and users are now worse off due to the behaviour of the local council.",
