            "background": "Immigrants-Should-Work-For-The-Right-To-Benefits & Housing. Immigrants should be made to work for our struggling local authorities until work is found or until the individual is allowed to work in the UK. They should be made to contribute to our country to be entitled to receive any benefits or housing. I remember when I was unemployed as a teenager I had not paid enough National insurance or tax to be entitled to anything. My family has been in the country for Hundreds of years and worked most of there life yet I was not entitled to anything. Rules should not be in favour of immigrants wishing to come into the country they should earn the rights.\nPlease sign this if you wish to help your local authorities to improve services and CUT COSTS NOT CUT YOUR RIGHT TO PUBLIC SERVICES.",
