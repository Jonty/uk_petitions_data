            "action": "introduce legislation that will make the pro-life lobby responsible for paying the total cost of incarcerating every murderer who would otherwise have been executed if they, as a minority pressure group, hadn't decided to use their undoubted power, influence and money to have the death penalty removed from our Statute Books.",

            "background": "Many good people hold personal views/convictions about the sanctity of life and oppose the death penalty. I respect and even share some of those views but not to the extent that I want to contribute to the \u00a330,000 and more a year it costs to incarcerate every violent maniac likely to indiscriminately main or kill me. I want my government to protect me.  I want them to move swiftly, cheaply and sensitively to execute anybody our courts decide can\u2019t be trusted to live amongst us without randomly maiming or murdering us \u2013 not charge me to keep them in relative comfort for the rest of their lives or release them to prey, once again, upon the public.\n \nEverybody is entitled to their own views. Nobody, however, should expect the cost related to their views to be born by those who don\u2019t share their views. The pro-life lobby doesn't reflect the view of the majority. If they\u2019re wealthy enough to impose their views on the majority (as they clearly are) they should be prepared to pay whatever it costs to indulge those views.",
