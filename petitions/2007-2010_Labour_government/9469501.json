        "background": "I'm a resident of the area close to Brookmill Park and I don't understand why such a nice and well kept park is restricted to dogs.\nI understand that since the park has a children play area and a cycle path, the Council wants to avoid incidents, but the same features are present in many other parks where dogs are allowed.\nThe park is not attended by many people daily, and is equipped with bins for the disposal of dogs waste.  I ask fort the restriction to be removed or modified in order to allow dogs on a lead to be welcome.",
