Please don't mention that it is for business reasons, because there are daily flights and most if not all carriers fly there. Most travellers also complain of poor customer service especially from the 'National Carrier' BA!! I urge the PM to put pressure on the Airlines or at the very least BA. BA should lead the way!!!",
