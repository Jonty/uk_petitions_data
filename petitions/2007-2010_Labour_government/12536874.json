            "background": "Being mandatory for professionals would not be an imposition on the parents or family in general\u2026If the governments were to adopt this as an example it would send a message of encouragement to families that grandparents can be a huge asset in the family and it could be worthwhile attending mediation focusing on the best interests of the children.\n\nThere is a huge rise in drug and alcohol abuse and there is reckoned to be a million children in Britain today living in a home with one or both parents addicted to drugs or alcohol. and fear of the ever increasing cases of child abuse from different partners in a child\u2019s life \n\nIt is generally agreed by governments grandparents are important in the family and can be vital in the early detection of child abuse and in the care and stability of children when they are in a crisis situation especially in the middle of the night. It would be in the best interests of the children to be settled as quickly as possible with someone who cares for them.",
