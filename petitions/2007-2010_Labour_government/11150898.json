        "background": "The fiasco that the BBC call their iPlayer. This is supposed to make the BBC more accessible to the licence fee paying public. Yet it is far from that. Instead it has turned into a great waste of money. When we try to get the new, great advance in technology to work we are met by problem after problem and an overly complexe process that often fails. This is not due to it not being possible to make work flawlessly but due to those in charge of the BBC and work for the aforementioned company not doing their jobs to the full. The iPlayer shows the contempt that seems to come from the BBC towards those that pay their wages. It is time this was brought to an end, it is time that either the BBC offered the service we pay for or got closed down and those over paid suits were made to find real jobs.",
