            "background": "CAW dedicate the needs of disadvantaged, excluded groups in our community, people coping with learning disabilities and mental health problems. The library owned by Warwickshire College is boarded up. The roof in the gallery leaks, there is no heating. As a listed building there is a duty of care by the owner to carry out maintainance? Let's not lose these two buildings to  developers for flats or another resuarant pub. Give these buildings a  lease of life turning them into a centre of creativity, with mental health and other vulnerable groups at its hub.The buildings could house a range of facilities including creative businesses, artists' studios, digital media and music workshops. The state of the economy, puts a strain on us all and as more of us becomed unemployed, the level of depression and mental health issues will increase. We need to help people becoming isolated and withdrawn, and it is so important to maintain peoples motivation and self esteem. Please consider my points, this is a opportunity to use CAW as a flagship all over the country.",
