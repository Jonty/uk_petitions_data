        "background": "I, like many others were pleased when the UK government signed the declaration to ban cluster bombs which disproportionately maim and kill civilians. However, the Times reported on June 1st that the UK goverment had added a loophole that excludes anti-tank cluster weapons. Britain will now press ahead with an \u00a383m contract to buy a new generation of the munitions, signed last November with GIWS, a German manufacturer.\n\nI find this highly disingenuous after such a fanfare of an announcement to discover that the UK government sought to get round the ban before signing it. I would ask that the PM restores the moral integrity of his government on this matter by closing this loophole and cancelling the order with GIWS.",
