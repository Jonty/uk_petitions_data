            "action": "Bring before parliament a bill to change the law controling Hackney carriage fares in the UK.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current laws governing the level of fares employed in Hackney carriages dates from 1847&1976. We believe this legislation is overdue for reform.\nThe councillors who decide upon Hackney fares are not involved in the day to day running of a Hackney carriage and as such are not best suited to make decisions that have such far reaching effects upon the profitability and viability of our individual business's.\nWe would remind the Prime Minister that no such restrictions to fares exists for our competitors in the Private hire trade and as such this inbalance is anti competitive and on a personal basis may be in conflict with the spirit of the European Human Rights protocol.\nWe therefore call upon the Prime Minister to initiate a change in the law that will allow Hackney carriage drivers within a Licensing area to determine the level of fares necessary to enable their trade to remain competitive with the Private Hire trade, Bus&Rail operators for the patronage of the travelling public while at the same time retaining local Government control for all other aspects of their operation as is the case with the Private Hire trade.",
