            "background": "During the last EU summit the UK govt. has surrendered an enormous amount of powers to the EU, deciding almost everything from taxes and social rights to transport. Defence governance is now the SOLE power reserved SOLELY to member states. And yet, some federalists seek to extend the EU's power range further and force Britain to cede that last right, the right to decide when, and how, to defend itself. This is a plea to the government to always refuse to agree to do that.",
