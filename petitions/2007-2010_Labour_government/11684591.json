            "background": "My daughter's cat,Lucky, tragically died from anti-freeze poisoning. Within 24 hours of ingesting anti-freeze this wonderful healthy loving cat was dead. Lucky's death mustn't be in vain... Because anti-freeze contains Ethylene Glycol,(a dangerous poison) it tastes sweet. Animals and sometimes children are attracted to this common, but deadly, fluid. A simple bittering agent, Denatonium Benzoate would discourage children and animals from ingesting it. This petition is to enforce the manufactures of engine coolant and anti-freeze to add this additive. Denatonium Benzoate is one of the bitterest substances available and is now used safely in many other household products \nThe cost is minimal, just pennies per gallon. A small price to pay to save a life!",
