        "background": "This country has become one with a compensation culture due to there being no risk if you claim for even the most insignificant injury due to the no win no fee schemes that get pushed at people both by unsolicited phone call and junk mail. \n\nThis leads to people trying there luck simply to get some fast money\n\nThis compensation culture is not money for free and gets paid for by every member of the public either though taxes or though price rises in the case of the private sector \n\nIt also is having the effect that many simple things that were once a normal part of life are deemed too risky under over the top health and safety rules that are designed to avoid any possible compensation payouts.  \n\nOf course the right to claim compensation should always be there but if in the event of a loss the claimant had to pay for all the costs of his or her legal representation all the bogus claims would disappear overnight\n\nThese no win no fee deals should therefore be made illeagal",
