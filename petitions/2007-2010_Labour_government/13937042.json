            "background": "Recently the Government has proposed plans to keep records of every phone call, text message and website visited to be logged and made available to every Government body without permission from a judge. The information would be kept for one year. As a British citizen I like it that the Government does not know absolutely everything I do. Phone calls and websites visited should be kept with me and people I want to share them with. The reason for this all is \"To stop terrorism\" I do not see a need to spy on British Citizens to stop terrorism. Please sign the petition.",
