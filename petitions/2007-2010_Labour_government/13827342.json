        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This proposal is all about making heightism against the law, preventing people using height as a way of discriminating. Daily people experience heightism but can\u2019t do anything about it. Examples are; \n\n1) Jobs \u2013 who gets them, earning or promotional potential.\n2) Sports \u2013 most favour tall or average height people; short people are left on the sidelines.\n3) Bullying (can include use of derogatory terms to ridicule e.g. \u2018midget\u2019 or \u2018shrimp\u2019) \u2013 in school, work, home or when you\u2019re out. \n4) People are treated differently by stature, regardless of age.  \n5) Clothing/shoes - not all shops offer petite sizes, shorter/longer garment length or bigger/smaller shoe sizes.\n6) Height is used as a way to define or judge someone; people see height before anything else. \n\nThis campaign is very important because people should have the right to be treated equally not differently just because of their stature. Other types of discrimination are not allowed, so it should be the same for height discrimination.",
