            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Our three demands are:\n\n - Force builders to hardwire carbon monoxide detectors into new homes by changing Part J of the building regulations, which relates to combustion appliances and fuel storage systems. It should state that it is compulsory for all new homes to contain carbon monoxide detectors that are hardwired into the building. While this would not stop leaks occurring, it would at least give every resident an immediate warning of danger.\n\n - Require landlords to post emergency procedure posters on every corridor in tower blocks, to ensure that tenants know exactly what to do if fire breaks out. We want emergency procedures posted in clear view on every communal corridor \u2013 much the same as in hotels.\n\n - Set up a national database of all UK tower blocks. It will detail where they are, and who owns them. Landlords should be required to confirm that the fire risk in all blocks has been assessed and when that last happened.",
