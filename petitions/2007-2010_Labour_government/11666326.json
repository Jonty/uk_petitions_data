            "background": "Heavy horses could soon be extinct in Britain, according to conservationists.\nSome traditional breeds are under such threat that they are said to be rarer than giant pandas.\nThe Suffolk Punch is listed as ' critical' with only 100 pairs left in the UK.\nBefore the advent of modern machinery, Heavy horses were traditionally used for farm work, pulling wagons and even in warfare where they hauled artillery around the battlefield. \nWe owe it to these gentle and beautiful animals and future generations to save them from dying out, by ensuring funding is given to breeders to ensure they have the resources to raise and care for heavy horses.",
