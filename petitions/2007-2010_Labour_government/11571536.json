            "background": "To restore the link between the rate of basic state pension and average male wage which was lost as a result of action by the Thatcher government in the 1980's\n\nPension rates were then, and continue to be linked to the rate of inflation. Basic pension today stands at just over \u00a390 per week. This results in poverty, hunger and cold for many older people in Britain today.\n\nDefend the living standards of the elderly and vulnerable and petition for social justice.",
