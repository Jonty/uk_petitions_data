        "background": "This was brought to light by an email I received from a colleague of mine from New Zealand.  In many industries, and in this case the oil industry, employees are tested for illegal substances.  If the drug test is failed then the individual is deemed unfit to work.  Should such a system be put in place whereby any person claiming benefits in the UK should also be put through the rigour of  a drugs tests?  It seems all too easy to  coast upon the handouts freely available  under the present Government. Surely by tightening belts and actually monitoring what benefits are distributed the country could save money?  Monies saved could subsidise any  existing bodies that help rehabilitate people addicted to such illegal substances.  The remaining money could help float our economy.",
