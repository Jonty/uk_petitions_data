            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Clean Coal Technology is the real answer to our energy needs. UCG provides a clean energy source of a size matching world energy needs and within a short time frame. UCG is a method of converting unworked coal into a combustible gas which can be used for heating, power generation or the manufacture of hydrogen,synthetic fuel or diesel fuel. The gas can be processed to remove CO2 content thereby providing a source of clean energy with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. Coal accounts for 95% of the fossil fuel energy content of the planet - hundreds of years of energy.\nSecurity of supply, potential for CO2 capture and storage, low cost production and rapid development to fill the energy gap are the principal motivators for the unprecedented increase in UCG activity around the world. Britain should embrace UCG.",
