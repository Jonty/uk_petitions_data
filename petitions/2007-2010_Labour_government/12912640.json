            "background": "Complete ban on the use of hands-free mobile phones and smoking whilst driving, leaving the car to be driven safely and allowing the driver full attention to the safety of other motorists, passengers and those pedestrians near the moving vehicle.  Safety has to be paramount and whilst driving can become customary to the driver none the less, there is no room for error caused by distractions which could and can be avoided.  Lives can be saved and serious road accidents and fatalities become less.",
