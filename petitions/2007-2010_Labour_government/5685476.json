            "background": "Manchester City and other councils wish to impose a punitive and impractical road congestion scheme to pay for improvements to the transport infrastructure in Greater Manchester at a cost of up to GB\u00a33 billion.\n\nManchester Airport Group, owned by those councils, is the last remaining airport operator in the UK still in the public sector. Selling it could easily raise that amount.\n\nHigh quality airport operators around the world would form a lengthy queue for such an opportunity, which, if handled well, should be of benefit to all parties including employees and the general public.",
