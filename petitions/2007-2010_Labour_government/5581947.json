            "background": "Today's Free Software community creates a vast array of programs for the greater good of humanity as a whole. Proprietary software removes individuals' ability to cooperate. Free Software programs are used in research against disease, climate change, network security and powering 60% of websites.\nSoftware patents constitute a restriction on the free flow of ideas - such patents may risk slowing down continued development of Free Software. \nMain reasons why Free Software is important are in preserving the freedom of the individual within society, fighting disease and climate change with shared research tools, building on progress made in previous software innovations in exponentially more complex hardware implementations.\nSince software patents threaten these fundamentally important activities, we propose that software published under the GNU General Public Licence (version 3 and above) be given immunity from prosecution from patent infringement under the Copyright Designs and Patents Act.",
