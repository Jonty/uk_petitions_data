        "action": "force water companies to repair leaks or, if they fail to do so, fine them 150% of what it would have cost to repair them",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This 150% fine should be paid BY THE DIRECTOR(S) of the relevant company and it should NOT be permissible to recoup this by passing the cost on to customers; any company which does increase its water charges, before a year has passed since this fine, should have to prove, to the standard of proof required in a court of law, that this increase has nothing to do with the fine.\n\nThe reason for this petition is concern over water supplies next summer; I acknowledge that we have had a reasonable amount of rain (in London anyway; I don't know about other parts of the country) but this doesn't necessarily mean no summer drought.  I am particularly anxious to avoid a situation in which stand-pipes might become necessary; as someone living in a 3rd floor flat, with no lift, I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA how I would cope!",
