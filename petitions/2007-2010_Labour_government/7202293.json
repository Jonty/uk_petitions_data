            "background": "If government pays lower prices for stoma products, some will be withdrawn; companies won\u2019t sell at a loss, leaving a reduced choice. The more expensive & modern products, which are good at solving problems & make life easier, will disappear. This will lead to a reduction in quality of life. Although some bags may be more expensive, they last longer, cause fewer troubles regarding leakage & skin problems. This must be more cost effective in the long run. If the companies receive less money, 60% of our stoma care nurses will disappear as companies, not the NHS, sponsor them. Stoma care nurses are our lifeline. They support us with any problems we may have. It is a very specialised field & GP\u2019s & Consultants often don\u2019t have that kind of knowledge. If fees are reduced to the delivery companies it will not be economically viable for them to deliver to our homes, cut our bags or give us free wipes & disposal bags. We would have to rely on pharmacies. With the amount we have to use, supplies are bulky to obtain & a delay in ordering could be a disaster. It is bad enough that we have to have stomas, please don\u2019t take away our quality of life - the services & products making our lives bearable",
