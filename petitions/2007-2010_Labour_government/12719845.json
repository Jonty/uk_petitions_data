            "background": "NICE guidelines use an assessment tool called MMSE, which most practicing clinicians in the field of dementia does not recognise as being worthwhile.  In order to prescribe memory enhancing drugs such as Aricept for Alzheimer's disease, they have to wait until the person scores 20/30 on the MMSE.  Many health professionals in this field feel that it should be left to their clinical judgement and they should be able to provide early intervention, and not have to wait until the person with Alzheimer's deteriorates, causing distress to the person and their family/carers.  Enable doctors to prescribe memory enhancing drugs much earlier than that suggested by the NICE guidelines.",
