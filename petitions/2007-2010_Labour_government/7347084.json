Politicians should stick to politics and stop interfering in thinks they have little or no understanding.  It is about time the NHS was taken out of the political domain and allowed to progress without political interference (not unlike the changes made to allow the Bank of England to achieve the targets set for it). CEO of the NHS needs to have a proven track record in the service sector charged with ensuring as much as possible of every pound of funding is spent on serving the patient, not bureaucracy.",
