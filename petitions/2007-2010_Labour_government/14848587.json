            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A very high percentage of Largers, Ales, Wines and ciders contain Isinglass (derived from the swim bladders of certain tropical fish), used in the fining or clearing process. Also occasionally the sometimes animal derived additive Glyceryl Monostearate is used in place of 900 Dimethylpolysiloxane as a foam-control agent in the production of keg beers.\n\n The addition of these products is entirely un-necessary and other drinks manufacturers manage to produce their drinks without animal products in a profitable and productive manner.\n\n The use of Isinglass along with other animal products in drinks means that around 7% of the UK's population are unable to consume them when it would be very simple for the manufacturers to make them suitable.\n\n The banning of drinks manufacturers from being able to use these animal products would mean they would make more money from more custom due to a wider audience and the vegetarians and vegans of the UK would be happy knowing that they don't have to check with a manufacturer each time they want a drink.",
