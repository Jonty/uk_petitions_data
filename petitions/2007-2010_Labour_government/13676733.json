            "background": "West Berkshire Council have purchased a Georgian House on the A4 in Speen, Newbury, and have put in for change of use to a Pupil Referral Unit. \nWhilst the village is on the main A4, it is heavily populated by elderly people and young families. We fear that youths who are too troubled to be in mainstream education will be roaming our community during the daytime, forcing the elderly to cross a very busy road to save passing the unit on a pavement only 3 ft wide. This creates horrendous possibilities in their safety. We also fear for the security of our properties for those out working during the day.\nThis is a village with a true and thriving identity which is highly unsuitable to the proposal being made for Richmond House.",
