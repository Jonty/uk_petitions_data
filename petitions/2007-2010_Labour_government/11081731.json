After reading this first line, reading the rest should not be necessary for someone to realise that it\u2019s time for the government to ban all use of plastic bags. We managed without plastic bags, we can do it again.\n\nFor the people who do need some more conviction to sign this petition here are some more facts:\n\n\uf0a7 1 billion shopping bags are being used each year in London alone. Average 400 are re-used. But the most end up in land fills or in the environment\n\uf0a7 Wildlife experts warn that animals are dying and being seriously injured every year after choking on discarded bags.\n\uf0a7 As they break down, they release poisonous materials into the water and soil\n\nThere are many alternative that can be used:\n\uf0a7 Cloth bags\n\uf0a7 Bags for life\n\uf0a7 Paper bags\n\uf0a7 Etc\n\nThe only way to make a change to this is if the government votes against all use of plastic bags.",
