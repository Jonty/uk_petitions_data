        "background": "The scheme is based on a route which is actually a very well used safe cycle route and linear park (>600 users per hour peek times). Used daily for safe routes to school and leisure/commuting use.  The introduction of a high speed bus would force cyclists and young children on to a busy main road and cause traffic queues. A similar scheme to introduce a tram on the same route failed for the same reasons reasons and because it was found it would not improve traffic flow and attract people out of cars increasing costs. There would also be a significant impact on wildlife",
