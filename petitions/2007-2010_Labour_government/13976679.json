        "background": "Right now there are real people wandering around on the streets who have never heard of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. When presented with the option of using Riemann or Lebesgue integration most people will simply shrug their shoulders, start grooming themselves or head-butting a mirror. Its hard to believe, but some people don't actually have an opinion on whether the Axiom of Choice is true or not (well, 'opinion' may be the wrong word, we all know for a fact that its true. Right?). At the very least people should be rounded up and press ganged into lecture theatres around the country and forced, Clockwork Orange style, to ingest some mathematics. Anyone who has done a course in maths knows that this will make the world a more logical, less scary place where everyone appreciates chat up lines like \"Baby, I wish I was your derivative so I can lie tangent to your curves\". And who wouldn't want that?",
