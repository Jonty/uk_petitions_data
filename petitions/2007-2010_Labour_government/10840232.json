        "background": "The comprehensive failure of the Government and in particular Gordon Brown concerning the mis management of the economy has made me look round at who got it right. For sometime now Vince Cable has been a lone voice warning about the state of the economy. He has been on the ball on such topics as levels of personal debt, the state of the mortgage market, interest rates, Government borrowing, banking regulation, and many other areas of Treasury scope. If Vince Cable has seen and spoken about what was and is still wrong why did nobody listen and take action to what were clearly logical views? There is only one place for Vince to be and be heard and thats as Prime Minister.",
