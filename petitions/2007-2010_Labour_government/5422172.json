            "background": "There is no career ladder accessible for the current workforce of associate practitioner staff, including ALL Hearing Aid Dispensers.   There is now in place a very clear academic pathway for all new students from HE certificate to foundation degree and beyond.  There is no  process for already employed and qualified, associate practitioners to progress to practitioner level through a 'nugget' of post qualification learning.   Individuals in this particular area of the career spectrum are becoming disenfranchised and have a poor understanding of any future career pathways which will open up to them if new learning is put in place.   It is our view that we have simply been left on the 'back burner' Clearly there needs to be an equitable solution facilitated, for all audiology staff at this level.   A continuing professional development approach that has academic worth attached needs to be developed urgently.\n\nThan you for listening and be thankful you can.",
