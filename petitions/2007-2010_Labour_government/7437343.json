The british government should get themselves over to Sudan and definitly STOP all aid to them untill Gillian Gibbons Is released with appologies and safely back home in a country where you can safely name a teddy bear Steve McClaren if you want to!  Lets face it, in this country any name you can give your child, you can name a pet or cuddly toy the same!",
