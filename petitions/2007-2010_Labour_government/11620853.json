        "background": "The purpose of this petition is to get back to basics and offer all mortgages on the same terms to all borrowers.\nWhy are they so many mortgage deals available.\nI am 65 with a small mortgage. When I and my husband had a mortgage at 24 all mortgages were at the same rate you had to have 10% upfront to get one.\nPeople now who are renting multiple properties on tracker mortgages are gaining when people on standard mortgage rates are not receiving the  benefits of the reduced Bank of England rate.\nIn fact people on disability are only receiving interest paid above base rate of 1.5% and are having to find deficit.\nWe should get back to basics same rate for all.",
