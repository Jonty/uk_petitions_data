            "background": "I lost my little boy 22/09/05 when i was 19 weeks and 3 days pregnant. He was perfect in every way just tiny. He is medically classed as a miscarriage and sometimes even referred to as a spontanious abortion, this is WRONG! My baby had arms and legs, fingers and toes and a heartbeat... How is he a miscarriage? I physically gave birth to my baby, i went through the contractions. My baby was born so therefore should be classed as a STILL BORN baby. I think (and i know im not alone in this) that is disgusting that these babies born before 23 weeks and 6 days are swept under the carpet and forgotten about. The least parents and babies deserve is some sort of recognition that our babies were born, a certificate of some sort. It wasnt long ago i was reading about the 16 week gestation baby that was ferried around in an ambulance desperatley clinging to life. Something has to be done, and it has to be done NOW! How can a miscarriage breathe???\n\nThe classifications need to be changed. Loss families dont like 'labels' but if we have to fall into a category then PLEASE give our babies some respect and lower these limits.",
