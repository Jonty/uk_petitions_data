            "background": "Many home educated recieve wonderful educations, however there are a good number who do not and are way behind their conventionally educated peers in basic skills such as reading, writing and basic maths.  This is grossly letting down these children and handicapping their future prospects. We the undersigned propose that all home educated children must pass tests in reading writing and maths every year and gain results at least equivalent to the average child of their age with mandatory school attendance for those that fail on more than one occasion.",
