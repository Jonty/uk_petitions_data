            "background": "This housing outside of the main settlement of Polegate is contrary to the Statutory Plan for Wealden, and as the Folkington link is not planned in the foreseeable future it is also outside the Non Statutory plan for Wealden\n\nIt will spoil the views from the South Downs and the National Park, and probably cause flooding in Gosford Way, Polegate, which can now just cope with the overspill during heavy rain.\n\nThe extra traffic using the vehicle route onto the Cophall roundabout will grid lock all the local roads during peak times, restricting the main north and west routes into Eastbourne, and severely congest them at all other times of the day.\n\nThe proposed pedestrian/cycle bridge planned through Brookside Avenue (up to 5 metres wide) will be an eyesore and the foot and cycle traffic will create an unnecessary intrusion into the quiet residential area of Brookside Avenue, Albert Road, Victoria Road, Brook Street and St Leonards Terrace, and compromise the privacy and security of the area",
