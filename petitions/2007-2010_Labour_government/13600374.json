        "background": "in current legislation it is not viable for a baby who is born less than 23 weeks of gestation to be given medical treatment. i want this law to change so that all babies are given a fighting chance of survival. some babies who are born after 23 weeks gestation but are still premature can go on to either having significant health problems or  normal healthy lives. i think it should be the right of the parents no matter how premature the baby is that once been given all the details about the cicrumstances should be able to decide weather their child recieves the neccessary medical treatment to keep it alive",
