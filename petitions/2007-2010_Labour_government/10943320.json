Utilise our own resources to our own requirements so that we do not have to buy back from foreign companies our own commodities. We should not be subsidising European communities by paying higher charges. Something must be done soon otherwise probably thousands of people will be unable to heat or eat. Also put a stop to extra Independent Gas Transporter charges.",
