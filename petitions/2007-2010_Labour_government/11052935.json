            "background": "The governments value-for-money policy on public transport is seriously threatening public transport improvements. Under the policy, all public transport schemes must predicted to be able to support itself through fare revenue AND be able to pay back all its construction costs- regardless of how great the benefit to the local population would be. This has lead to the scrapping of several light rail schemes, and is harming the economies of many cities due to the governments refusal to fund public transport projects. \n\nIf the government wants to be serious about getting people off the roads then they should amend this policy- instead, create a system where the costs can be weighed up against the benefits, so that an unprofitable project could still be built if the benefits to the local communities is deemed to be greater than the cost.",
