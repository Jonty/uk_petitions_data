        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The practice of battery farming is a cruel and inhumane practice, which should be a crime in today's society. Hens are kept in cages the size of a piece of A4 paper, they never see natural light, they have no stimulus, and so peck each other's feathers out, and they cannot express natural behaviour. \nsurely any reasonable person can see that this practice is unnacceptable. I am sure that most people want to see an end to the suffering.\nChickens are naturally curious, OUTDOOR creatures. I believe that they should enjoy a good quality of life while they lay eggs for us. The cruel battery cage should be condemed in favour of the superior free range system!",
