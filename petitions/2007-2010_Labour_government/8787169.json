The name \u201cThe Right Honourable\u201d has long been cast into doubt, especially now the truth of how MP\u2019s are blatantly abusing public funds and taxes in order to increase the wealth of themselves and their families. When considering what the word Honourable represents, \u201cworthy of being honoured; entitled to honour and respect\u201d and \u201dadhering to ethical and moral principles\u201d, and then considering the number of MP\u2019s who abuse public office in order to gain wealth and standing, it is not only a travesty, but is no longer moral to use this form of address.",
