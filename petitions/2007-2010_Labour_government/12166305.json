And as there appears to be a growing trend towards eating disorders in this country, I think as much effort should be put into preventing them, as is put into \"the obesity crisis\".  We are constantly told how the media is having a negative impact on young peoples self-esteem, and this is having a backlash.  Maybe it's time to stop this?  Get back to some old-fashioned values that don't revolve around some celebrity \"showing off\" they're unhealthy size-zero.  There will just be another mountain of health problems in 10 years time if this trend continues.",
