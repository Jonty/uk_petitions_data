            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current law for fining drivers 3 points on their driving licence if they are caught breaking the speed laws needs to be addressed. We propose that the law be changed so that if any driver is caught breaking the speed limit on a UK road, that they be served with a monetary fine only (which will be the same as is presently issued). We believe that road safety is very important and seek to change the law to protect our human rights within this democratic government. This will prevent 'safe and able' drivers losing their licence for 'totting' up points for driving faster than the letter of the law states. For those drivers whose job requires a driving licence, this change in the law will also protect their ability to continue to work.",
