            "background": "Over the past eleven years the current government has repeatedly refused to listen to the electorate on nearly all matters. They have failed to provide long-lasting improvements to the economy, society and security. They have misled the opposition and the nation in supporting an endless illegal war in Iraq, while cowardly ignoring more serious matters in other nations. On all these matters and more I call for a public vote of confidence in the current administration.",
