            "background": "to be a crucial human rights issue that over generations, stigmatises  people, housing and estates. To consider that passing a tenancy more than once within a family after death can still be based on  the decision of a social landlord, rather than a court of probate, as it might be if the property was owned, seems to take the rights of a large percentage of people who rent, back into a feudal  era. \nFraming of social housing tenancies outside the legal framework most people would assume as their human rights if they are mortgage holders, is a serious and important social and economic issue.\nPeople who rent from social landlords may not ever wish to move, may not wish to purchase but should feel in the 21st century that they can provide security for their families in terms of housing. To live in a property, paying rent, maintaining it, living a life over maybe forty and fifty years but not  be able to pass the tenancy on more than once  builds in an undeserved rejection, social disdain and meaninglessness into social housing. \nThis links and connects to lack of access and confidence in accessing other social, educational and health services.",
