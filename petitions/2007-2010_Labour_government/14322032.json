That doesn't make sense and puts national security at rest. In other countries, they'd have deported him straight away back to Al-Qaeda.\n\nHe has written to the families of soldiers telling them that their sons died in vain and is organising hate marches against Britain in Britain.\n\nBetter yet, I hate Britain now give me a 320K house and everything paid for me.",
