            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In 1997, the laws were changed, putting restrictions on towing a trailer with a standard driving licence.\nThis change has been impossible to police reliably due to the lack of an accurate database of both vehicle and trailer weights. There is also some confusion as the legislation is worded badly.  \nFurthermore, with the recent decline of several caravan manufacturers, it would seem that the next generation of caravanners who are not eligable to tow similar outfits to those of their parents with a standard licence are turning away from the pastime. This has lit a time bomb, not only under the caravan industry, but the leisure industry in the UK as a whole. We urge the current legistlation to be returned to the old weight restrictions and a minimum age limit of 21 with a minimum of 3 years of conviction free driving experience being required. This will preclude almost no outfit on the roads at this time so will take little policing, whilst ensuring that inexperienced and immature drivers are kept to a minimum.",
