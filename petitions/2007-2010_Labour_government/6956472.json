            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To many criminals and young unlicenced drivers these days seem to think it fun to not stop for the police, and when they are finally forced to stop, how many people have they nearly killed, or actually killed, when the police charge them, they are let off by our feeble courts.\nToo many people are being killed, I refer to the boy in Edinburgh last year, the driver was found guilty and given 12yrs, he claimed the police were chasing him, when it was proved the police had called off the chase.\nThese drivers treat the law with contempt every time they get behind the wheel, even though the courts ban them, and send them to prison for a couple of weeks, they still drive again, even after several ban's.\nI ask that you sign this petition to try to embarrass the government into doing something positive to protect us the law abiding people, by making it law that any driver who refuses to stop when requested to do so by the police, and I don't mean the little old boy who is hard of hearing, I mean the rogues who put the foot down to try and evade capture, must serve a mandatory 5 year prison sentence with no chance of parole, it might make these people think twice about starting the chase in the first place.",
