            "background": "I propose the setting up of a body under the auspices of the Secretary Of State For Energy, to oversee the utility companies. This body will replace existing bodies. It will establish up a fair pricing structure and will actively seek to agree with the companies, the fair setting of prices and tarriffs. This body must have the authority to act against any and all companies who seek to impose outrageous price rises on their customers, if necessary, by advising to bring forward legislation restricting the amount by which prices can be raised (as they do in France). Government, please consider this request carefully and act to help the british people in an uncertain economic climate.",
