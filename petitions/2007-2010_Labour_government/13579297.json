        "background": "I propose that senior management teams in schools should be scrapped.\nSenior leadership teams in schools are a waste of money and resources. This means that schools can't spend the amount of money on education that they should be able to. Senior managers cost more than teaching staff, are there for PR and when it comes to how much the pupils learn, often ineffective. Overall, the function of senior management teams in schools is to manipulate statistics rather than improve standards. The old system of just having a head and a deputy head should be brought back.",
