        "background": "it is a well known fact that children with down syndrome have a much higher risk of getting leukemia than children without d.s. at present they are not tested for leukemia unless they are showing symptoms of the disease, even then it seems to be a last resort test! many children with down syndrome are having to go through months of chemotherapy and possibly bone marrow transplants as it was not found early enough. just 1 blood test a year might help save a child go through this terrible ordeal, it could possibly save many childrens lives! please sign the petition and give our children a chance!",
