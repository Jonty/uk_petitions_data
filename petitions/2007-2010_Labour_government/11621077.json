            "background": "As head of Halifax Bank of Scotland,  Goodwin presided over a company that  lost so much money it devastated the nation's economy.\n\nMillions of lives will be blighted by a lack of confidence in the UK economy. A BBC report estimated HBOS's losses to be \u00a328 billion in 2008.\n\nWhen HBOS appeared to be doing well, Mr Goodwin was only too eager to take responsibility, and accept the awards and seven figures bonuses.\n\nHBOS and a quorum of British banks needed to be bailed out by the British taxpayer (including the 'hard working families' Gordon Brown pays so much lip service to) to the tune of \u00a340 billion.\n\nAnd yet, before his staggering incompetence came to light, Goodwin was awarded a knighthood for services to the banking industry. Services? \n\nWe can forgive Gordon Brown for being hoodwinked. But we can never forgive him  for being so arrogant that he does not recognise (and rectify) his mistake.",
