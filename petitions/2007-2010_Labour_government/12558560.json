It was owned by various Indian rulers before being seized by the British in 1877, and is now a part of the Crown Jewels.\n \n\nThe Kohinoor diamond must be returned as atonement for colonial past and we must strive to bring it back to its place of inception- India, where it truly belongs. \n\nReturning the diamond will also lead to further strengthening of relation between India and UK.\n \n\nTogether we can make a difference and that moment is NOW.",
