        "background": "Whilst using my Nokia 5800 touch screen the screen cracked. After speaking to Nokia, they state that screens are not covered under warranty under any circumstances. This means they can provide faulty batches of screens and get out of it by stating screens are not covered under warranty. Surely this is highly illegal. I had only had my phone 2 weeks when my problem happened. These companies should not have carte blanche to decide if they have to provide a fit for purpose phone or not. They never even investigated my problem.\n\nI ask people to sign this petition on behalf of all consumers who have received terrible service at the hands of manufacturers and/or suppliers.",
