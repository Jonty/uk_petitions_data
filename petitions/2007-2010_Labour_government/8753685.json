And the the Govenment issues the relevant instructions to the Judicery to employ the tough sentencing that is required. No more nanny state, no more rubbish additions just some tangible action.",

I want less legislation and more bad people where they can do no more harm. In other words, the zero tolerance that we were all promised with prison spaces that does not rely upon numbers. I would also welcome a vote on capital punishment.",
