            "background": "On the 12th October 2009 the Governing Body at Grangetown Primary School decided to close Daisychain Nursery by Christmas.\n\nA 3 year grant has come to an end and further funding can not be found. They also state the fees already paid by the parents do not cover the full cost of running this nursery.\n\nGrangetown Primary School governors agreed that they could not be liable for any potential deficit.  While not advising what that potential deficit may be.\n\nThe parents have not been informed of any problems which means we have not had the chance to raise any funds to save the Nursery.\n\nPlease support our petition to save the nursery that is loved so much by the children that attend.  \n\nThe care and support that they receive from all staff at the nursery is fantastic, closing this nursery will be a massive loss to all concerned.",
