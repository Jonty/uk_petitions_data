            "background": "A campaign to save Rhyl's historic Queen's Arcade - a former ballroom mecca \n \nThe Queen's Arcade in the Denbighshire town dates back to Victorian times. \n\nSteve, Jo Francis and Stuart Jones from the town are campaigning to protect the building and have started a petition. \n\nDenbighshire Council leader Rhiannon Hughes said should the site be sold for redevelopment she would want to see the work done in a \"sympathetic\" way. \n\nThe building, which once housed a hotel, theatre and ballroom, dates back to the early 1900s and is currently used as a shopping arcade. \n\nDance floor \n\nIn its heyday, this place was fantastic, it had a huge theatre with all the stars. There was a waxworks and a skating rink. You could stay here all day and be entertained.\n\nLaurel and Hardy, Cliff Richard, Italia Conti, Anne Heywood and Julie Andrews all performed in the theatre. \n\nIts ballroom had a sprung maple dance floor that could accommodate 2.000 couples, even having British Champions dance there. \n\nWe fear the arcade's days are numbered as Rhyl undergoes a series of re-developments.\n\nPlease Mr Priminister can you help us.",
