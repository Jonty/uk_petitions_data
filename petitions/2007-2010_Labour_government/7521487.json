We can all see what policy is on most public subjects, the purpose of creating and signing these petitions is to show that WE WANT CHANGE!\nthe government must realise that they work on behalf of the people and must act accordingly.\ntechnology is now at a point where mass referendums via internet is becoming a real option, and if public opinion is not taken notice of now, soon e-referendums will make government redundant.",
