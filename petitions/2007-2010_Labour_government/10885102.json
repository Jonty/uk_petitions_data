            "background": "South London is poorly served by Underground when compared with Northern areas. The plentiful train services help to alleviate this, however PAYG Oyster cards cannot be used on these train services. As Oyster fares decrease with relation to increasing paper ticket fares, the price penalty paid by customers becomes greater and greater. PAYG has been promised on these services for years, but is still unimplemented even between stations with Oyster card readers fitted.\ne.g. Clapham Junction to Oxford Circus costs \u00a33.80 (\u00a32.30 train to Victoria & \u00a31.50 Oyster underground fare), despite being a standard zone 2 to 1 journey.\nWe request that the government require TFL and the TOCs to reach an agreement to allow Oyster PAYG to be used between any stations within the zone system immediately for stations with Oyster readers fitted, and to agree and publicise a specific date by which readers will be expanded to the whole rail network within London.",
