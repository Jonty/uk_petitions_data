This stops us from wanting to help the people. There is much suffering taking place in Zimbabwe, which, according to the World Health Organisation, has the lowest life expectancy of any country and one of the highest percentage of orphans. It is now time for us to make a stand for these people and change the perception of the West towards Zimbabwe to one of 'How Can We Help'. Together we can bring peace to Zimbabwe. As long as we all breathe the same air, we are all one world and we have a responsibility to all people living in our world. Together we can put an end to their suffering",
