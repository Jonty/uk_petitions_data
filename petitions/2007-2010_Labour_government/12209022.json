            "background": "The Government of India's Archaeological Survey of India (who run the Taj),  have discovered that the underground vaults are crumbling. They have announced they intend to a) either move the Taj 800 metres to the south-east or b) replace the heavy minarets with new ones made of lightweight material. We believe a full survey needs to be carried out to look at less radical alternatives, as these solutions threaten to alter forever one of the world's greatest monuments - which belongs to us all. We ask the Prime Minister to use his influence with the Indian Government to press for a re-think.",
