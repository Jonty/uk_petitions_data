            "background": "Speeding and poor driving seems to be increasing on our ever busier roads.A vast amount of money is spent on 20/30 and 40 MPH signs and flashing warnings with little or no local enforcement, many vehicles, especially commercial ones ignore local speed limits. The govenment should cease looking at spending more money on speed controls on motorways and national roads and instead cause local authorities to enforce rural limits where the issues of noise, polution and safety is much more significant.",
