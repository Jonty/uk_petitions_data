Viewers spend a considerable amount of money voting on these show but never get to know the details of the voting.  There is current no compulsion for TV companies to publish the results.  As a result how do the voters know that there vote has been counted or who has really won the show?\n\nI request the Prime Minister to ask all TV companies to publish the full telephone votes results of TV shows within 24 hours of the phone lines closing.",
