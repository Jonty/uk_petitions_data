        "background": "My main reason of starting this petition was to stop cruelty to cats as it is disgusting the amount of people that get away with it however I then found out that the new animal welfare act 2007 states: Anyone who is cruel to an animal may be banned from owning animals, fined up to \u00a320,000 and/or sent to prison. Which in my option is about time, however I found this still does not cover if you run over a cat. At the moment the law states that if you run over a dog you have to report it but if you run over a cat nobody cares. I feel in my option and im sure many people will agree with me that this is wrong. Dogs and cats are both beloved pets that should be treated the same. We should have to report these crimes. I do understand a lot of the time a cat may jump in front of your car and it is a genuine mistake but it still needs reporting as I stated before cats are beloved family pets and there heartbroken families will be searching for them.",
