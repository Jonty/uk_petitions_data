        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is a disregard of the Race Relations Act, our Human Rights and the Cripps Report (1976) to disregard our right to our traditional heritage, identity and lifestyle( Poulter). Understood by most of the World, the  uneducated and primitive capitalist society needs to learn the ways of harmony from Tribal Society ( Knight). We believe a better way for a peaceful society is equality, and mutually beneficial reciprocity ( Fry). A society based on hierarchy, meritocracy, and a class structure creates conflict, as it is based on a struggle to dominate, with morality being punished. An improved homeostatic society is based on equality, everyone can learn to be their own leader, with acceptance of different cultures, faiths and skills. (Walzer and Danford).We can never bring back our dead Father, relatives or ancestors. Some the 258,000 Gypsies killed in the Nazi Genocide ( Huttenbach), for being different, or initially strange.However we have no vindictiveness, rather hope and faith that those who wronged us will learn to make amends by paying us monetary compensation and treating us with respect, rather than persecution. Thank you.",
