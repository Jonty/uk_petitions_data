            "background": "Obviously, you are aware of the appalling and inhumane actions caused by Robert Mugabe, the incumbent prime minister of Zimbabwe. He has in no way benefited the people of Zimbabwe except for his corrupt 'war veretans'. He is guilty of multiple human rights violations, and should be rightly punished for the deaths he has caused. The only forseeable solution is for the assassination of Mugabe for the betterment of Zimbabwe and its people.",
