            "background": "We have some fantastic colleges in this country doing day and evening classes for adults needing or wanting further education. These fulfil a great need for learning new skills and meeting new people. I have retrained for two careers during my life due to these and gone on to university. I have also seen many people drag themselves through very difficult parts of their lives using these courses to succeed. They are a great institution for young and old and often part of the local community.",
