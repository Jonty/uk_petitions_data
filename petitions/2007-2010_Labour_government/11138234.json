This is just another reduction in the quality of service of Britain's train operators. If National Express get their way, passengers will be joining those on virgin services eating plastic sealed junk food instead of traditionally made fresh meals. \n\nThey must be prevented from removing the restaurants from those trains as well as stopped from reducing the number of them.",
