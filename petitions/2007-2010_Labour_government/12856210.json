            "background": "HOAP is a council owned pool in the Borough of Broxbourne.  It is usually open between May and September.  Broxbourne Council claims (falsely) that it cannot find \u00a360,000 to open the pool this year.  This money could have been claimed through the Government Free Swimming Initiative as could a grant to renovate the 70 year old pool.  The council did neither.  Yet the borough is in the Lea Valley with its many lakes and water courses.  6 primary schools and 2 swimming clubs used the pool for lessons.  The Amateur Swimming Association says that the borough is 'under-pooled' having 2 over-subscribed public indoor pools for 87,000 residents.  With rising obesity, it is essential to provide opportunities for all to exercise.  HOAP is a honey-pot in the holidays for children, who enjoy hours of healthy recreation there.  1000 people signed a petition, to keep the pool open, which was presented to the council on 24 Feb 09.  This was dismissed.",
