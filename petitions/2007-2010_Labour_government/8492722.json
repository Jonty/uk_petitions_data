Any visitors, immigrants, illegal immigrants or refugees MUST also be made to abide by OUR laws without the fear of any infringement on their human/civil rights. Would we invade a Muslim country and demand our laws are installed there? Unlikely. The Government has to stand up for itself and the UK, we are viewed as one of the softest countries in the world, welcoming all-comers with open arms despite the protests of the people of the UK and look where it has got us.",
