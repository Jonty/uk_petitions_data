            "background": "Lets regulate work agencies and force employers to take responsibility for a change. There are so many of these so called 'recruitment agencies' quite often advertising positions that don't exist and taking away every bit of hope that a jobseeker has left. They are soul destroying, and seem to have a license to have a total disregard for those unfortunate enough to be in the position to have to sign on their books. How sad that very few employers take people on direct anymore. Work Agencies should only be used as an aid back into work, not an employment 'go between'. Once a suitable candidate has been supplied, they should be taken on by the employer direct, and thereby the agency role ends having made their commission in helping the individual to find work.",
