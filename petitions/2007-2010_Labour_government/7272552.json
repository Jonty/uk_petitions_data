        "background": "As many of you know Bob Mackenzie has recently resigned due to certain circumstances relating to an alledged unruly pupil acting in an aggressive and racist behaviour towards him. To expect someone to go into work and deal with such behaviour is completely unacceptable when the pupil in question gets off scott free and the victim is a teacher of which has devoted over 18 years to the education system - along with hours and hours of his own time to organise ski trips, football exchanges, weekend athletic meets and hockey tornaments but to name only a few. Help provide teachers like Bob Mackenzie with more support by signing this petition.",
