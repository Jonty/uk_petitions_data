This name means nothing to the identity of the area, its heritage and the people who live there. Restore some of the pride and identity back to the  North east area by Giving us back our Pre 1974 county boundaries, aboloshing Tyne and Wear as a county name and restoring the Land taken from Durham and Northumberland to the rightful county. Hundreds of years of history and belonging was ended on 1st April 1974. Now is the time to put that right",
