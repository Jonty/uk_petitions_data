            "background": "In recent months, the cost of a litre of petrol or diesel at British petrol pumps has rocketed. It is well-known that a very large portion of the retail price of fuel is tax, and the Government has the power to make reductions in order to offset the crippling price rises.\n\nIt is easy for MPs to call for the public to use public transport instead of private cars, but very few areas of the UK have the excellent public transport enjoyed by those who live or work in London. The car is not a luxury item that we use at weekends, but a necessity which we need to get to and from our jobs.\n\nHigh fuel tax should only exist where there is a realistic alternative to using one\u2019s car, and in the UK, this is not the case.\n\nThe undersigned petition the Prime Minister to take urgent action to bring the cost of a litre of petrol or diesel back under \u00a31.00.",
