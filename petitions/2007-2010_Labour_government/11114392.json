            "background": "The British Government could arguably be described as one of the world\u2019s most oppressive democracies. Few populations are more heavily surveiled or restricted in their right to free speech or protest than the British Public. With the introduction of ID cards it would seem that George Orwell\u2019s vision of Big Brother has finally materialised. We the British public must let our elected representatives know that we will not tolerate any further erosion of our freedoms. The following petition requests that the government abandon its ID card scheme immediately and conduct a cross-party review of all legislation that impacts our basic civil liberties.",
