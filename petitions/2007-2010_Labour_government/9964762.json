        "background": "Monoclonal antibodies work differently from standard treatment, attacking cancer cells specifically. They give patients the chance for a longer & better quality of life. NICE ordains they should not be prescribed because 'they do not represent value for money' Government guidelines now insist that those who wish to pay for these drugs to supplement their NHS treatment should be denied any further NHS cancer treatment & should pay privately for all their current & subsequent treatment.  This is just reducing our health service to the lowest possible level for all.",
