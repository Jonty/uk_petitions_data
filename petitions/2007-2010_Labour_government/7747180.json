            "background": "Although the legislation is in place to impose fines on the owners of dogs which foul public areas, there is insufficient funding to enable this to be enforced.  It is a known scientific fact that dog faeces can cause blindness, serious illness and even death amongst children and other vulnerable people.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs where this country has to legislate against such inconsiderate dog owners but there is also a duty of care towards children and the health of the nation in general.",
