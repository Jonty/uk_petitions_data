            "background": "Before 1930, lake Windermere was privately owned. It was then bought by the Sheriff and given to the people of Windermere and the public to enjoy, and persue hobbies, including watersprts. With the ban in place, not everyone can enjoy the lake. If the ban were to be relaxed so that at certain times or on certain days or in certain areas of the lake, people could enjoy themselves by waterskiing etc, thousands would take up the oppourtunity...Even if it was only occaisional; the number of tourists who would come to visit Windermere would increase dramatically on these days, and some of the business lost by imposing the ban could, perhaps, be regained.",
