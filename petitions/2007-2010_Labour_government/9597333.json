            "background": "The student maintenance grant is awarded on the basis of the household income of the parent with whom the student lives. Thus a child could live with a mother on \u00a320k p.a. and receive a full grant, even if he has a millionaire father who regularly gives him money but happens to live apart from the mother. This is grossly unfair to married/co-habiting parents and their student children.",
