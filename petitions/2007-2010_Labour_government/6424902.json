            "background": "Despite the United Kingdon being a free market, the vast nmajority of homes and businesses have no option but to use BT for landline telephone services.  Similarly, non-cable broadband services all require a BT landline.  As BT currently have a monopoly on this market and increasingly consumers have no option but to use these services, they should be required to have the highest standards of customer service and should be penalised for failing to achieve these.\n\nThis should include fines for unacceptable call queue times, delays in installations and repairs and failure to share information promptly (eg; with other directory services and internet service providers).",
