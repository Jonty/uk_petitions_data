            "background": "We the undersigned feel that the government would encourage people back to work and make working parents lives easier if funded nursery hours were given for more weeks of the year.\nWorking parents with children at nursery still have to pay nursery fees during school holidays and the present system only provides funding during term time.\nMost nurseries give the child 4 weeks holiday so funded nursery should be paid 48weeks a year for those whose children attend nursery all year round.",
