        "background": "Compensating victims of violent crime is \"adding to their woes\" because of bureaucracy, delays and inefficiency, a spending watchdog has claimed today. What are you doing about the CICA if it is \"slowly grinding to a halt\" ?\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to examine how to improve an organisation described as \"failing to help people who have suffered traumatic attacks and injuries while the taxpayer is paying more money for a worse service.\" Having experienced two assaults, a car crash, threatening death calls, two muggings and a knife attack in the course of duty for local  \nauthorities - with no compensation whatsoever to date, like the 80,000 people in the report, the petitioner is actually wondering if the average British citizen is entitled to protection from the state.",
