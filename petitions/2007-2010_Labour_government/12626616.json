Sadly, there's no guarantee it'll be permanent & as a moot point, would you sell up if your current agent lost their membership & begun dirty tactics?\n\nObviously it's not the same as getting works done based on a company's registration with a legit standards association, & these are peoples sanctuaries we're talking about!  Besides, furore over the lack of 1st time buyer homes & manic house building proves the property market was wanting.\n\nMany agencies outside these associations are guilty of the aforementioned ploys, & thousands of UK residents are affected.\n\nRegulation should allow responsible Leaseholders to live peaceably, with less fear of threats & exploitation (least of all via sly charges).\n\nUnite to raise the minimum standard & filter out this hassle to our already stressful lives!",
