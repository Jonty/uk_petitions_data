            "background": "It is absolutely ludicrous that so much media coverage has been afforded to a radio show in which only two people complained.\n\nThe papers whipped up a frenzied attach against Brand & Ross when most normal thinking people found the whole episode, at best funny and at worst, ill thought out. In any case someone else at the BBC allowed it to be aired and I for one would not be offended if they had left the messages on my answer phone.\n\nThe BBC has been weak in its stance and should have stood up to the flack. We will all be worse off in the future if this kind of censorship continuously takes place.\n\nHow many people have listened to the broadcast and found it not necessary to complain?",
