            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The state currently insists that schools, playgroups, and child-minders teach children not to talk to strangers.a.) this is a gross abuse of parents' rights to socially educate children. b.) Our society already suffers from severe alienation between generations and social isolation is the rule rather than community. This approach increases these problems. c.) the evidence is that the vast majority of children who are abused sexually, physically or emotionally, are abused by people they know.\n\nThe risk presented to our children by speaking to strangers is tiny. The social cost of the 'stranger danger' approach is massive. To teach children that they should view all strangers as suspect is abusive both to children and to adults. \n\nThis practice should be stopped and replaced with more sensible and traditional warnings, including not to go with strangers or to accept sweets or gifts from them.",
