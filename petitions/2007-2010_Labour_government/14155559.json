He confirmed the arrest of Mrs. Khazraji under the terrorism act. Her brother however is certain the accusation is false, leveled as a result of a personal grudge. Human rights lawyers confirm many cases of arrests and detention are based on false intelligence,see Reuters article.\n\"Murder, threats mark judge's life in violent N.Iraq\".\nDated 29th Nov 2009\nEnd the practice of detention first and proper investigations later if at all. In the case of women and especially mothers we call on the Iraqi security forces to investigate the allegations, question the women in their own homes and only resort to detention if there is credible evidence pointing to her guilt. Free Rajaa Al Khazraji now! Reunite her with her children. End arbitrary arrests in Iraq.",
