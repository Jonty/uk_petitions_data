            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If one is on benefits for any reason at all and is a single parent then child maintenance must be declared. If the child maintenance is over a certain amount (I believe in Birmingham it is \u00a320 and in some other cities it can be as low as \u00a310), then the remainder will be used as income. For example, a non resident parent pays \u00a333 per week maintenance towards a child they never see. The receiver of that money will then need to delare this and \u00a313.00 will be taken off the benefit claimer forcing them to pay \u00a313 towards their housing benefit a week. If no maintenance was paid, or if under \u00a320 was paid a week, then the claimant would be issued with full housing benefit. \nThis needs to stop. The clue of the reason for child maintenance is in its name; \"Child Maintenance\". It is not residential parent maintenance, rent maintenance or benefits maintenance. This is for the childs upkeep; clothes, food, travel, education etc. Yet some parents are forced to use most of it to pay towards rent. \nHaving conversed with many parents in this situation, many do not even bother to seek maintenance as there will be absolutely no point as it would just go straight back into the system.",
