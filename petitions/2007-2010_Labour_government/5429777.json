When the DLA claim comes to the end of its award date, a new claim pack is sent  the whole thing is treated as a new claim, no previous award or history is taken into account. This makes life very uncertain, you never know whether the new claim will be successful or not. Stress that a disabled and long term ill person can do without. I want the Government to scrap this system and make it easier for disabled people to re-claim",
