Brine does not only get you inebriated for under \u00a33, also there is no age limit (so under 18s can enjoy) and acts as the most stimulating afro-disiac known to this world, but mainly Salford (like, all of it). Basically, we ask you, our mate, Gordon Brown, to help us out mate. FFS (Freedom for Snowmen). *sorry about that* We want you to replace the selling of beer with that of the incredible substance....\n\n\nBRINE. \n\nGod bless and good night!",
