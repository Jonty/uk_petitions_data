People making impulse buys in a pet shop only inflames the situation as very often the animal becomes a chore and is tossed aside. \nIt would make more sense if there was a regulated authority which, alongside UK animal charities, rehomed animals which are unwanted and worked with registered breeders to sell young animals to serious potential owners.",
