        "background": "I understand that currently there are two indices used to assess the rate of inflation: Consumer Price Index and Retail Price Index.  One or the other if these is used to calculate increases in pensions etc but both include items far too expensive and luxurious for most pensioners to be able to afford them.\n\nIn my opinion it would be much better and fairer to rely on an index of basic items such as food. Just to give one example: my local supermarket has increased the price of a pack of 6 tomatoes from 99p to \u00a31.29 in the space of a few weeks; that's just over 30%! as opposed to the single-figure rate of C.P.I. and R.P.I.  The government does guarantee that pensions will increase by at least 2.5% every year but how does that help when prices of basic foodstuffs are increasing at more than ten times that rate?",
