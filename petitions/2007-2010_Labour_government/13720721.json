            "background": "The reason hemp is illegal\n\n(Nothing to do with its effects on the mind and body)\n\n\nThey say marijuana is dangerous. pot is not harmful to the human body or mind. marijuana does not pose a threat to the general public. Marijuana is very much a danger to the oil companies, alcohol, tobacco industries and a large number of chemical corporations. Big businesses, with plenty of pounds and influence, have suppressed the truth from the people. The truth is, if marijuana was utilized for its vast array of commercial products, it would create an industrial atomic bomb! The super rich have conspired to spread misinformation about the plant that, if used properly, would ruin them.\n\n....... Few little facts there. But seriously... Lets stop or these corporate fools. ITS MEANT TO BE A FREE COUNTRY.... ARE FREE PEOPLE... NO WE ARE NOT. WE ARE NOT FREE PEOPLE. WE ARE GUINEA PIGS FOR THE BILLIONAIRES, THE GOVERMENT. WE ARE PROJECTS. so... 1st step is to get cannibis legalised. Then we can move on from there. I expect to see a plenty signatures on this...\n\nEven the NHS tells people even now to smoke \"pot\" when in pain. FACT.",
