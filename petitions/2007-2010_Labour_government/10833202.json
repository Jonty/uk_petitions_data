        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Need I add any more details? We all know about how global warming is affecting our planet and the major cause is the burning of carbon based fuels so by simply reducing the basic tax rate on all products and then adding this tax proportionate to how big of a carbon footprint a specific product has, the UK will become a more carbon conscious country. Those products which have lower carbon footprints will cost less so therefore more people would buy them because they would become cheaper and be able to compete better with other products with far larger carbon footprints which are damaging our world. This increase in popularity would mean more businesses would offer products with lower carbon footprints and thus more businesses would start to produce products with lower carbon footprints. Therefore everyone wins, cheaper prices for the products with lower carbon footprints we buy and less damage caused to the world by the burning of carbon based fuels which often is more damaging to those in poorer countries than us here in richer economies, what could be better?",
