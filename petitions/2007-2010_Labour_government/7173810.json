            "background": "I urge the government to use common sense in tackling the problems on our roads.\nA few minor policies will make a drastic difference to congestion and safety on our roads.\n1. Adopt a policy which will make it an offense for HGV's to attempt to overtake on motorways. HGV's are limited to the same speed any marginal difference in speed caused by vehicle age load weight etc does not provide enough speed to pass effectively causing major congestion.\n2. Replace ineffective Fixed point speed cameras with Average speed cameras where they are truely needed. Fixed point cameras cause dangerous sudden braking and are simply revenue generators\n3. Introduce an element to the Driving Test/Training to train and assess Motorway driving the majority of problems on the motorways are caused by innapropriate behaviour caused by lack of training\n4. Class Middle lane cruising as driving without due care and attention and as such make it an offense, this inconsiderate driving causes untold amounts of congestion but would be reduced by point 3",
