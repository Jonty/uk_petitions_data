The rules currently in operation make a mockery of the efforts of every worker in the country and must be changed.  The people should be presented with a choice of four or five options, ranging from leaving things as they are, to paying MPs the minimum wage {Which they themselves deem fine for the bulk of the population).  The option chosen by the people should be strictly monitored by a person directly answerable to the Queen and having absolutely no duty to Parliament.",
