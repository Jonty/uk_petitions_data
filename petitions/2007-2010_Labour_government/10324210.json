            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) or Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)has been proved time and again as a primary skin irritant which has been known to penetrate into the eyes as well as brain, heart, liver etc, and also been known to show long-term retention in the tissues. Studies indicated that when penetrating a children's eyes this could prevent them from developing properly and caused cataracts to develop in adults; may also cause hair loss by attacking the follicle.\nAnother extremely serious problem is the connection of SLS or SDS with nitrate contamination - Nitrates are a potential cancer-causing carcinogenic.\nThe list is endless and they are found in many industrial products including floor cleaners, car wash soaps, toothpastes, shampoos and some dissolvable aspirin, fiber therapy caplets, bubble baths and many more products.\nDue to the harmful hidden dangers to children and adults the above use of the products should be banned completely. \nThey are only used as a cheap alternative rather than using a product that isn't harmful to humans.",
