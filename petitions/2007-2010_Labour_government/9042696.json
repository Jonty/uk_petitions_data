            "background": "Mini moto riders & moped riders have become a menace in my local park, haring up & down the paths, churning up the grass & so on, yet when asked the local police say they cannot pursue these miscreants for fear the little dears will hurt themselves. I'd like to see the government  enable the police to take direct & forceful action, there & then, to stop these antisocial riders. Have it declared that if these people hurt themselves while being pursued, it's their own fault. If it's a choice between a criminal banging his head, or wiping out a toddler learning to ride a bicycle, I'd choose a bang on the head for the criminal. Might knock some sense into him.",
