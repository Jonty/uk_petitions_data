The FA should be comprised of appointed and democratically elected counsellors with fixed terms. All major decsions should be subject to an independent review by a body with the power to dismiss counsellors should the need arise. \n\nFootball as a sport in this country represents a huge amount to many millions of hard working fans. It is time the government put structures in place to ensure their interests are guarded.",
