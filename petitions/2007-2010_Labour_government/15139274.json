        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is a proposal to reduce the alcohol limit for driving from 80mg/100ml to 50mg/100ml in blood. As the natural base level of alcohol in blood is about 30mg/100ml, and many foods and medicines contain alcohol, that will make legal drinking almost impossible. This will have a devastating effect on country pubs and will reduce peoples' quality of life. There is a risk that people who drink alcohol in the evening with no intention of driving that day will still be over the new limit next morning, although well rested and perfectly safe to drive. The current alcohol limit does not significantly reduce driving ability, although should be more strictly enforced.",
