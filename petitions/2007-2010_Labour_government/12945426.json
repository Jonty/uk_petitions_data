            "background": "There is so much unjust in this world at the moment, and the one thing Mr Brown can do, is to allow parents the right of knowledge, the god given right to protect their children, and stop hiding the animals that live amongst us. \n\n I don't want a witch hunt, or to go on a vigilante manhunt, all I desire is to know if a paedophile lives in my local area.  \n\nChildren are innocent and need protecting, and we should be given the right to know if these sexual predators are a threat to our kids !\n\n48% of the paedophiles found their victims through babysitting.This a alarming statistic that shows most of paedophiles are known to the family before they commit the crime ! But this is only due to the paedophiles worming their way into the lives of familys and grooming the kids ! would we even let them near our kids if we knew what they were about !\n\nNo ! \n\nNow is the time for the law to change !",
