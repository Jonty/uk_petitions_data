            "background": "It is widely known that it is becomming more and more expensive to drive anywhere. I am aware of many who are dependant on a pension of limited income who have become more and more house bound as the result of the increase in fuel prices, their freedom is therefore limited, it is all to easy to be ignorant and just say get a job when people have no idea of other peoples circumstances or illnesses,or their GP's view on sending a patient to work. It would be a good idea to abolish the free road tax for disabled people which is a one off payment once a year and give them a fuel discount card for use at the forecourt to give the disabled who must use a vechicle back their freedom.",
