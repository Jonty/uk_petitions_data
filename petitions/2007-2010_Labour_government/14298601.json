        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Presently, the annual pricing of a car's road-tax is being off-set against it's carbon emissions by an equation that does not take into account how many miles that vehicle travels throughout it's taxed year. Low emission vehicles, whilst more environmentally friendly per-mile, may do many many more miles per-year than presently higher taxed vehicles, thus causing much more environmental damage. \n \nThe vehicle's carbon emissions, equated together with it's yearly mileage covered, correctly determines the cost of it's environmental impact which, in turn, should then set the structure of it's true and just road-tax pricing. \n\nThe fundamental component required for implementing this proposal is currently already set in place, as the odometer reading is officially recorded as part of every vehicles MOT certificate.",
