            "background": "For two years now cricket has been off terrestrial television, and subsequently, the viewing figures have plummeted. Unfortunatly, this has coinicided with the rise of the England national team. This is now stopping people from taking up the sport, from people buying memberships at County Cricket clubs, and from increasing county attendences. The numbers taking up cricket will drop as children chose football over cricket if there is no free to air cricket. \n\nMany cant aford the \u00a340+ for Sky and Sky sports, is it right that huge sections of our society are bared from watching our great national spoort? \n\nIf you think that this is wrong, then sign this petition!",
