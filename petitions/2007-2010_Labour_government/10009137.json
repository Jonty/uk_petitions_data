            "background": "Steve McLaren did not perform in managment of the England Team who subsequently failed to reach the EURO 2008 finals. His reward has been a contract to commentate on the Crotia games paid for (inclusive of flights, hotels and food) by the BBC through licence payers money. We petition the prime minister to request that Steve returns to the UK and organises youth football camps to make clear his apology to the nation and prevent him scouting for players for his 'next managment job' at our expense.",
