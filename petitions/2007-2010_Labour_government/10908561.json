        "background": "i'm in the army and am bassed in Kent and i think it's terrible that millitary personnel are being banned from pubs, nightclubs etc for being in the millitary. i see this is as discrimination as a someone would never be turned away for being Black or Disabled so why should it be any different for being in the millitary. It's like saying you can protect us but not socialise with us and it can feel like a kick in the teeth. Obviously anyone causing trouble should by all means be banned but the majority of people in the millitary will go out have a good time and go home peacefully. I thought the goverment wanted us to start to integrate with the civillian community and some sort of law being passed to stop this discrimination can only be a step towards this. Thankyou",
