            "background": "Due to the high level of tax burden on the working people of the UK I beleive that income tax on earnings below \u00a3100,000 per annum should be abolished. There are vast amounts of tax payers money spent on the civil service,dhss and the NHS that are not proportionally beneficial to all tax payers. If we only pay tax on purchases, tax on the interest our savings may earn etc then it would give us all a real choice of whether we should be involved in footing the bill for those who have never contributed to the exchequer",
