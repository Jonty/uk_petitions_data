        "background": "The reason that the Premier League is the most entwertaining football league in the world, is due to the huge diversity of talent that it boasts. To take this away, will be disasterous for English football. To say that putting a quota on British players will help the national team, shows a lack of a grasp of the facts. \n\nEngland have not won a major competition since 1966, and the game hasn't been flooded by foreign players since then. It's just another excuse to hide the fact that not enough has been spent of sports facilities for the young. Cases of selling off school playing fields is a typical example of this.",
