They are holding onto power by the skin of their teeth to serve themselves and not the people whom they are supposed to be serving.  This could easily be interpreted as treacherous.  The country is suffering each and every day until a new government is installed.  Gordon Brown should now show some backbone and do the right thing for the country and not for himself.",
