            "background": "Melatonin is 'the light dark hormone'.  It is prescribed for people who have long lasting difficulty in sleeping.  It is used a lot for children with ADHD as there are no other alternatives available such as sedative medications.  It is a safe and reliable medication which helps sufferers to achieve natural sleep with no 'hangover' effects the morning after.  The DOH have now stopped GP's supplying this medication which for a lot of families involves increased cost to collect it from the hospital - at the same time they are closing down local hospitals and centralising childrens services.",
