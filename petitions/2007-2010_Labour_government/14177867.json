Morocco has occupied the former Spanish colony since 1975, refusing a say on independence to the indigenous Sahrawi population, including some 100,000 people still living in refugee camps in the desert in south-western Algeria.\n\nWe therefore ask the Prime Minister to put pressure on the Moroccan government, so that Aminatou Haidar can return to her country.",
