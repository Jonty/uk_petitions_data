            "background": "The first thing to mention is the bravery of Kate Bush in creating the music she has made. She not only adopted progressive rock from a previously exclusively male elite at a very young age but she melded this with an unusually wide range of influences such as British cinema/horror films, English history/folklore, celtic influences, music hall, rock and roll, classical music, British humour and her own distinctive sensibilities. Her genius resulted in some of the most unusual ideas and delivery in popular music. She has continued to display new forms of musical expression in her albums, of which her most famous is arguably Hounds of Love, covering personal and avante garde ideas. She has also contributed to English cinema with the film 'The Line, the cross and the curve'. She has refused to repeat the same formula over and over again, which has endeared her to many other high profile singer/songwriters. She has won an Ivor Novello award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. She retains a very loyal following in this country and others who rightly regard her as a national treasure. For her uniquely distinctive contribution to the arts, we ask that Kate Bush be made a Dame.",
