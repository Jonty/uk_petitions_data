Instead he was ordered to pay \u00a3500 in court costs & banned from driving for a year.\n\nThe girls car was stationary when it was rammed by XXXXs 40 ton truck which had failed to break on time.\n\nIn the Trial: the majority of the Jurors were made up of mainly non car drivers & as such did not know the Legal requirements i.e Highway code eg. breaking distance. The coroner did not find any traces of alcohol in Danielle\u2019s blood. The police scientist reports supported the claim that the hazard lights were switched on shortly after the girls Toyota Yaris lost power & that the truck driver only applied his brakes (partially) one second after impact despite giving evidence to the contrary.\n\nSection 19 C of the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000 states that Judges and anyone working for the courts i.e Jurors can discriminate against a black or ethnic minority in the court of Law.",
