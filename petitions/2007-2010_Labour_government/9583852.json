However, some establishments may operate their own informal guidelines on obtaining parental consent.\n\nI am calling for restrictions on the age at which a minor can have body Piercing. My daughter whom is 13 years came home from school and told me that some of her friends have had there Tongues. Belly\u2019s and Private Parts pierced some as young as 12 years old. This is not acceptable, as at this young age the child is still developing and there have been many cases where the piercing has grown or has been ripped out. The piercing of young girl\u2019s private parts is no less than child abuse and should be stopped.\nThe age for body piercings other than the ears and nose should be regulated to the age of 16years.\n\nPlease sign this petition and put a stop to this.",
