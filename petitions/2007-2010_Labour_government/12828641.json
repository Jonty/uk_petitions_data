            "background": "Not only do people on the dole often receive more than the minimum wage (which is earned through both time and mental/physical effort) but some do not actively attempt to seek a job. This petition is to make those who recieve the dole give some benefit to the community in return for the receipt of the dole money for those who are mentally and physically able to perform these tasks. Thus the dole should be earned, and those who receive it should give something back to the community in return for that income.",
