            "background": "We believe that, if all of the above points are taken into account, it may well be the Government & taxpayer are the overall winners as it is likely there is an overall NET gain.  To raise the qualification age and/or to reduce TRUE levels of funding, would be \u201cto cut off one\u2019s nose to spite one\u2019s face\u201d.  Any such action would appear to be an act of economic MADNESS: a failure to look at the OVERALL PICTURE; allowing tunnel vision by one department ONLY looking at its own budget.\n\nTalking with friends & neighbours, who use the scheme, have said they would travel less frequently, thereby leading to REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.  The cost of a bus ticket is a small amount when compared to the spend that is likely when the visit is made.\n  \nONLY the PRIME MINISTER is in a position to take an OVERALL VIEW in this situation.",
