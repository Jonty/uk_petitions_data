            "background": "James Whale, the king of the airwaves, was today confirmed as being sacked, after several compliants to Ofcom about his interference of the London Mayor Elections. Despite the Ofcom report not being completed, Talksport have sacked James, even though he has done far, far worse. James is the voice of reason, and the king of the people. James has set up a cancer charity, and even worked on the night he was confirmed as having cancer. This man is an inspiration to thousands and says what most others do not have the nerve to. We cannot allow him to be treated in such a harsh way. James has always lived on the edge in terms of his content, and if people didnt like what they heard, then they should have pressed the standby switch.",
