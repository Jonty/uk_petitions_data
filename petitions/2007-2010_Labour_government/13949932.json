Nowadays, bands are struggling to find venues, and the music scene is dying because of it.I'm also in a band, and all we want to do is play pubs to entertain people, but finding somewhere to play in my home town is nigh impossible. What exactly is the point of restricting this sort of thing? Surely the government has bigger fish to fry than pub bands...?\n\nScrap the licence, and it may even help struggling landlords make a bit of money on saturday nights.",
