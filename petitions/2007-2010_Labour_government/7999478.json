            "background": "If you watched Michael Portillo's recent documentary about Capital Punishment, you will know exactly what I mean.  Why work with a Country fighting murderers and torturers, when that Country is murdering and torturing it's own citizens?  Somewhere along the line this has to stop, and if our government are too scared to do anything then we'll have to make them, and fair enough it might take a while, but other Countries will follow suit, and eventually they will give in.  We need to refust trade with America, fight them in any way we can non-violently, obviously.  I dont mind suffering a bit if it means less people suffering, and would you really trust the USA's legal system after EVERYTHING?  Ask Borat what he thinks.  For once do the right thing, vote with your heart.",
