The government of the UK is democratic, the nation is multicultural, it\u2019s people posses a plethora of varying views on religion and therefore the Government has a responsibility to make important decisions based on fact, not faith. It is not right for religious groups to impress their view on laws that affect a nation whose overwhelming majority is without a faith.",
