        "background": "In the UK we no longer buy fuel in gallons, but still use miles to measure distances.\nIt is therefore not relevent to measure fuel economy in terms of gallons (mpg) or kilometers (km/l) as neither reflect UK usage, so a combined metric/imperial measurement of economy (miles per litre) needs to be introduced.",
