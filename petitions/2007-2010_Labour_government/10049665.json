            "background": "Ex Royal Navy sailors are being asked for at minimum \u00a340 per medal they earned during the hostilities of the 2nd World War. These brave men and women risked their lives just as much as the other 2 armed forces who received their Medals free of charge. It is a very great insult, when they receive a letter from the MOD telling them they were awarded medals but can't have them unless they pay, to them the equvalent of half a weeks pension for each. The cooks and deckhands in the Merchant Navy recieved theirs free, so why the discrimination.",
