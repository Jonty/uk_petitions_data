The only exceptions being the M6 Toll and certain river crossing like the Humber Bridge or Dartford Crossing. Some years ago I entered Switzerland, from France, and was oblidged to purchase a permit, from the border post, before I could use the main roads or Motorways. Such a system would, amongst other things, help our UK haulage industry compete with foreign Companies.",
