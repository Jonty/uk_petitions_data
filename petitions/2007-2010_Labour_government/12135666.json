            "background": "The only winners over the last year or so , it seems , are those with businesses that can exploit economic recessions and those who know how to play the financial securities markets . Savings and pensions are not generally managed efficiently because they are invested for the long term . Much more efficient is 'share trading' which exploits short-term volatility in the markets and can also exploit bear markets . This last point means investors would be net winners since mid 2007 istead of losers . Skills could be taught in schools with students managing dummy trading accounts for several years before they have access to funds .",
