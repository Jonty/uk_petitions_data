        "background": "Local Authories should be given retrospective powers to compulsory purchase back Right To Buy an ex council property at the original selling price, where there has been proven ongoing ASB, Racial Hatred and drug dealing. The resident is then allowed to remain but under a starter tenancy but if thenow tenant persists or defaults, eviction preceedings are taken. Tenants on council estates are often blamed and targeted for such problems but quite often ex tenants under right to buy are as much of the problem as their neighbours. Right to buy is a privelage and ther should be some added resposibility of those who have it. On the other hand there should be a way of removing that privelage where they have abused it!",
