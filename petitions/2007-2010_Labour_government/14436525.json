Often we hear of one enjoying a life of bliss that the average person cannot enjoy. A bed, a TV, a games console, full library at their disposal and learning opportunities to gain qualifications that we must pay for on the outside!\n\nAllow for \"over-time\" to earn rental time for luxury items such as Television for a night.\nLimited used books only for entertainment if no over-time.\n\nBring back the punishment in incarceration rather than a holiday. Stop us paying for their holiday. Make them work for their keep.",
