        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Recent events make it quite clear that the practice of MPs employing family members as staff is creating problems of transparency and honesty. It is unacceptable that MPs are allowed to use taxpayers money to employ members of their own family - in no other public service would managers get away with employing family members in public service jobs, so why should MPs? This seems a very common practice amongst MPs and seems to result in a lot of family members being employed in \"jobs\" of dubious value. MPs should be using their allowances to employ the best, professionally qualified staff for clear, useful jobs that are necessary to serve their constituents better. In most cases, it seems unlikely that the very best candidate will just happen to be a family member.",
