            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\nI am and have been for 3 years a patient of Haslar hospital..I have had 3 hip operations in that time as well as being a single parent to 3 young children...At Queen Alexandra hospital I was shoved on a trolley and left and 'forgotten about'which they admitted.at Bupa I nearly died due to medical negligence..Anyway my point being I became dubious of hospitals.HASLAR IS THE BEST HOSPITAL AND TREATED ME WITH THE BEST CARE AND REHABILITATION.As I need further operations so I can walk in the future I will be heartbroken if you close Haslar.It is also so much easier to access from Portsmouth than QA and is so clean,staff always smiling even under duress,professional,NO MRSA...WE NEED THIS HOSPITAL!!stop letting people who do not need goverment money have it..give it to a Hospital and keep it open.please.",
