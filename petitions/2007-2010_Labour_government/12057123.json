            "background": "A single rail ticket for off-peak travel is often only \u00a31 cheaper than the equivalent return.  This means that rail does not integrate well with e.g. bus travel, car sharing, or cycling, as not much money can be saved by taking the train one way only.  Similarly it is often cheaper to fly both ways on a budget airline than to fly one way and take the train back.\n\nThe train should be ideally suited to flexible travel, and this would help the environment too, but the cost of a single ticket needs to be roughly half that of a return.",
