            "background": "It is detestable that Harriet Harman has four roles as a result of the recent Cabinet reshuffle under the Gordon Brown led government.  Her new roles include: Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Labour Party Chairman, Minister for Women, and most worryingly Leader of the House of Commons. \n\nThe role of the Leader of the House is one that requires all members to be fully represented, without compromise.  It is our belief that she is unable to wholeheartedly commit to this role in an impartial manner, and due to this very fact we urge the Prime Minister to reconsider this appointment.",
