            "background": "Lake Natron is a soda lake in the Great Rift Valley in northern Tanzania, and the worlds most important breeding site for the lesser flamingo. \n\nThe chemical company TATA are proposing to extract salt water from the lake and extract the sodium carbonate, for use in washing powder destined for export. \n\nAlongside the soda ash plant would be built housing for over 1000 workers and a coal fired powerstation. \n\nThe lake is the biggest of only 5 breeding sites in existence. In summer it is home  to 75% of the worlds population.\n\nThe RSPB say the chances of the flamingoes continuing to breed there with the disturbance caused by the plant is 'practically zero\u2019, and this could well push the birds to extinction.\n\nFlamingoes are a major tourist attraction in the region, and the loss of the breeding site will affect many other populations.\n\nWhile tthe developers say that they welcome input, many environmental organisations are barred from participating, so there is a risk the report may underestimate ecological damage.\n\nEven this early, it is clear this proposal could devastate on this pristine site and the animals which depend on it.",
