            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We recall the story of the \u201crogue trader\u201d of the 90\u2019s,responsible for the collapse of Barings Bank. He was rewarded for huge profits in 1992. When he failed, he was found guilty of cheating, and sent to prison. Executives of Barings who were involved in the failure to control Leeson either resigned or were sacked. That sounds like justice. Huge risks and mis-representation are now camouflaged as \u201ctoxic assets\u201d. Essentially, some bankers took huge risks to maximize profits and personal bonuses. Why does the same justice not seek out the \u201crouge traders\u201d and their executives and punish them? The banking system is critical and needs to bailed out, but what about cleaning it too? We petition you to demonstrate resolve and carry out justice, as a true leader of the free world should.",
