Many of them, especially recently, seem to add spices and pepper to these foods; most of which would be very tasty if only they were not added! People's tastes differ and I feel, strongly, that nothing  extraneous at all should be added to these foods; anyone who wants pepper or spices on their food is perfectly capable of adding it for themselves!",
