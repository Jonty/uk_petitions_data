            "background": "Companies who ignore the health & safety of their employees are escaping scott free. The HSE is underfunded and therefore cannot carry out the inspections, which would prevent many injuries from happening. The cost is passed to the taxpayer via the NHS. I propose that the NHS be allowed to claim back medical bills for work related accidents. This should ease the burden on the NHS and make poor companies improve their health & safety records.",
