I want this extended to cover ex offenders who have a record of violence. I have good reason for this as I believe this could have prevented my 34 day old Gt nephew from being murdered by his own father.  My family had concerns about him but were totally unaware, until the court case,that he had a violent past. If somebody wants to check confidentially, this should be an option. We need to protect the innocent",
