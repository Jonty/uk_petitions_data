America gives Israeli weapons and money and vetoes all UN criticism of Israeli war crimes. America is a partner to Israeli war crimes by not having an independent American foreign policy. Israel is a strategic liability to America and the UK.  The UK must not follow Israeli\u00b4s dictates, but develop her own foreign policy to guarantee liberty and freedom for Palestine.",
