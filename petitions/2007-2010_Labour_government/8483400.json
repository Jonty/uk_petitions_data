        "action": "introduce a Recycling Equality Bill.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The act would require supermarkets to provide the same environmental conditions for customers recycling packaging as they receive when purchasing products. For example: shelter, accessibility, heat and security. Currently those who wish to recycle their packaging as part of the consumer experience are discriminated against by poor commercial facilities.\nThe Prime Minister would be responsible for drafting the Bill into a pragmatic and workable form, making the necessary qualifications.\nThe measure would significantly increase recycling behaviour with minimal public expense. It would ensure that people who recycle are not treated as second class consumers. People should be given the same security and accessibility when recycling as they received when buying the product. The supermarkets relationship with consumer waste does not end when the customer walks out the store (especially if the packaging sold IS recyclable).",
