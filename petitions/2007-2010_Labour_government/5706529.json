            "background": "My daughter like many other people is living in a two bed property with her two children - a boy aged 5 and a girl aged 18 months - the children share a bedroom and my daughter has been told that she will wait approximately 14 years before she will be eligable for a transfer.  However we knows a girl who had a two bed place with two sons and she was given a three bed property in a warden controlled area although she did not have enough points to be given the house officially.  Even her housing officer was surprised.  I also know of one couple with five children in a three bed house and they are now using their lounge as a bedroom which is actually illegal.  One young couple were told that they should not have had more children knowing that they did not have the space for them - isnt that an infringement of their human rights.",
