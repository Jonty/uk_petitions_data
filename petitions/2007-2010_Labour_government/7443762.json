            "background": "The Post Office announced its proposal to close five local branches: Fylingthorpe, Helredale, Ruswarp, Sandsend and Westcliff.\n\nThis attack on rural services will:\n\n1) seriously affect the lives of people in these communities, especially the elderly, infirm and disabled.\n\n2) There will be a knock-on effect on other sevices, especially village shops which are the lifeblood of many communites.\n\n3) It would mean extra car/bus journeys to alternate branches, which would increase the carbon emissions within the North York Moors National Park.\n\n4) It would inconvenience tourists, a major part of the local economy.",
