            "background": "A number of people now belive that the invasion of Burma would have brought around a lot more support and success than the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIt is common knowlage that there was no support in iraq from the local population.  However the people of Burma are trying to rise up in protest against the dictatorship they are under.\n\nWe belive that with British support those protesters can return there president to power.\n\nThe fact is that we let Burma down in world war 2 now we are doing it again and it is irrisponsible of us as a past power to sit and talk about it.\n\nBy now we could have liberated them and saved many lives.  And improved democracy in a part of the world which is covered in communisum.\n\nJoin us and the same goes for Zimbabway, we had years of robbing them of there riches now we should give something back.",
