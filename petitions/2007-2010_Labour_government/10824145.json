            "background": "Millions of hours and pounds are lost every month in businesses dealing with the impact of internet viruses and spam.  Despite the attempts of software to lessen the impact, the reality is that productivity is hugely impacted by the actions of a group that are still apparently regarded as harmless geeks.   \n\nWe believe that government resources should be increased to track spammers and distributors of viruses and internet porn.  Once identified, the police and other government agencies should have greater powers to shut down their activities, convict them for consequential losses and increase sentences and damages.",
