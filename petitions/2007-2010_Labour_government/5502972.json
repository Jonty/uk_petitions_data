        "background": "If one were to learn all they know about human sexuality in a classroom, they would be led to believe there were no question of gender preference. I have just finished my GCSE's and have spent the last 4 years subject to homophobic discrimination from fellow students who simply don't understand homosexuality or bisexuality. Because they have only been educated in heterosexuality, they believe that is all that is acceptable or natural. It is hard enough coming to terms with finding out that you are bisexual without uninformed colleagues preventing you from leading a normal life. It is essential that this becomes an integral part of PSHE curriculum so that all young people can grow into mature, sexually aware, liberated adults. By witholding this kind of information from students, we are disallowing them from making their own informed decisions.",
