            "background": "The extension of this act will REQUIRE companies to log data on every call or text made to and from every phone in Britain, for a full calendar year. \n\nThe data will have to be handed over to over 650 government quangos and bodies. We are frankly concerned about the governments poor record in handling sensetive data, and in the implementation of new computer systems, which has been poor at best. \n\nA person's location can be pinpointed to within a few feet by identifying the mobile phone mast used to transmit their call. \n\nThe extention also allows authorities to compel individuals targeted in such investigation to keep silent about their role in decrypting data. We are exceptionally worried about the veil of secrecy which this sentiment implies. \n\nWe the undersigned are worried about the increased surveillance in our society today. We want it to stop.",
