This petition urges the Government to reject any such suggestion for the following primary reasons:\n\nThe cost, which taxpayers can ill afford\n\nThe divisive effect that any such funeral would have on the nation\n\nThe lack of any modern precedent for such a move: Winston Churchill was a unique case in that he united Britain during an unavoidable war which the nation was forced to enter.",
