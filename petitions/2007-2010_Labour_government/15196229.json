            "background": "OPEC has been allowed to artificially inflate the price of oil, and thereby the cost of petrol, by decreasing the output of its oil fields. The current situation is unacceptable, and the OPEC nations are holding the rest of the world to ransom. The UK Government, along with its international allies must put pressure on OPEC to increase its output, thus bringing the cost of oil, and petrol, to an acceptable level once again.",
