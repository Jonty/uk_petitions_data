            "background": "If BT does install fibre optic cables from the telephone exchages to peoples streets everyone will be able to access faster nd higher speeds like 50mbs or even 100mbs in some countries which use fibre optic cables to achieve this. So the prices will come down or stay the same but a much faster connection speed so you are not paying \u00a330 for a 8mb connection.",
