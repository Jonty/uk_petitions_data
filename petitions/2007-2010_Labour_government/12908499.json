        "background": "I am a British citizen married to an Egyptian. My wife and I have been married  for 6 years. We have twins who have obtained the British citizenship as well. I understand the nationlization law dictates that a spouse has to reside for 3 years with his/her British dependant in the UK. I am petitioning an amendment whereby the spouse is granted citizenship after being married for 3 years or more regardless of the location. Many of us work abroad and cannot be expected to change where and how we live for our families to gain citizenship.",
