            "background": "Tuition fees for students increased to \u00a33,000 pa in 2006.  The government has belatedly recognised the burden this places on undergraduates and is putting more generous loan/grant arrangements in place for those who begin their courses in 2008.  Students who began their courses in 2006 and 2007, and who have to pay the higher tuition fees, will not benefit from the new funding arrangements.  All students paying the increased tuition fees should be treated equally.  The new funding arrangements should therefore be applied to all those who pay the higher fees.",
