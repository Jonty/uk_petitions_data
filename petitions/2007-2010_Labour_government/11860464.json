He has cited a clause claiming \"serious damage\" to cabinet government. Well shouldn't we be allowed to know what made us engage in a war without a UN mandate, where chemical weapons were never found in which British soldiers are still dying? This is in the public interest contrary to what the Rt. Hon. MP Jack Straw has said.",
