        "background": "Jack Straw has vetoed the publication of key minutes held in cabinet meetings before the run up to the Iraq war, going against the freedom of information act. He has cited a clause claiming \"serious damage\" to cabinet government. Well shouldn't we be allowed to know what made us engage in a war without a UN mandate, where chemical weapons were never found in which British soldiers are still dying? This is in the public interest contrary to what the Rt. Hon. MP Jack Straw has said.",
