            "background": "I do not feel Mrs Thatcher should have the state funeral because during her time in office she was paid to do a job the same as many thousands of ordinary people. Sir Winston Churchill pulled the British people through a World War and was a strong leader. Mrs Thatcher closed down mines, created the poll tax, very cleverly sold on council houses forcing the working man to be tied and less likely to strike.",
