            "background": "At present, if you view TV via a broadband connection such as the Sky Anywhere you have to have a TV Licence even though none of the programmes viewed are made, broacast by the BBC. I feel this is boardering on fraud as the BBC is charging for something they are not providing. It gets even more silly: if you watch TV via a laptop running on battery you do not need a TV licence but if you plug that laptop into a socket you do! Most students rely on loans/grants to survive, charging them for a TV Licence out of the money is just wrong.",
