        "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to follow up on his public apology for Britain's \"appalling\" treatment of WW2 hero Alan Turing in 1952 (for being gay) by opposing Uganda's proposed intention to criminalise homosexuality with a maximum sentence of death.\n\nIt was with great and humble dignity the the Prime Minister said; \" While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can\u2019t put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him. Alan and the many thousands of other gay men who were convicted as he was convicted under homophobic laws were treated terribly\".\n\nWe ask that the Prime Minister and the government speak out and do all that they can to ensure that this kind of persecution does not happen again.",
