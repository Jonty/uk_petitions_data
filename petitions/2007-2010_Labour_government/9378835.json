            "background": "Paramedics are an essential part of the NHS and yet are the only healthcare profession leading to registration that are unable to receive government funding. This, on top of high tuitition fees make the course crippling for students. The course is a highly specialised course and is often undertaken by graduates who have completed other degrees, graduates who are unable to obtain a second student loan. Paramedics are the front line of the NHS and are without fail first on scene at serious medical emergencies. Classes are not large, often between 15-20 per year and only around 15 universities offer it as a course. The funding is there and can only benefit everyone.",
