And although i strongly disagreed with the petition i still felt that it had a right to be there. \n\nwe are meant to have the right to say what we want in Britain and i am concerned that we are turning into a country where the people in power will only let you say what they agree with, otherwise it is banned. \n\nas Voltaire said, \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" \n\nWe need free speech back and please sign if you agree. \n\nJoseph, 17",
