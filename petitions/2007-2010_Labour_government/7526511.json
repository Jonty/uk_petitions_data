            "background": "In Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and many other towns and cities, Councils are creating congestion black-spots, thereby adding to CO2 emissions by altering road layouts.\nSuch actions as removing lay-bys and narrowing roads (both at bus stops and junctions), constructing one-way systems of no useful purpose and sequencing traffic lights to cause queues & delays can be seen all over the country.\nMotorists contribute over \u00a340bn to the government and deserve better treatment.\nThe PM should address this deliberate policy as a matter of urgency to reduce overall costs to the economy and our CO2 emissions.",
