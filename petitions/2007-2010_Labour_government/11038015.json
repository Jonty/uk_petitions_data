        "background": "All banks benefiting from public money must reduce the charges on credit cards held by the public to a maximum of 12% APR with no late payment fee and no over balance fee. This would recognise that the poorest in society often need the credit cards the most, the above would allow the hard pressed cash strapped public to better able make their payments instead of being the first to be penalised by exorbitant charges! The high charges make their situation worse!",
