            "background": "A truly green choice.\nPromession is an environmentally sensitive alternative to standard burial and cremation that should be available to all. \nPromession would allow for burial in a wider choice of resting places, whilst dramatically minimizing our environmental impact on our most precious resources; our air, water, and soil. \nUsing liquid nitrogen, Promession gently reduces the body to its most simple form by removing all water (70% of body) and metals (eg. medical, dental) in a clean and respectful non-burn process. The remains can then be buried in the living topsoil and will be restituted to earth within 6-12 months \nA stone or marker may be placed at the gravesite and if a tree or bush is planted, new life will grow from the nutrients released from the remains beneath. Promessed remains may also be kept in an urn as a keepsake or they can be readied for scattering, in a clean mini-cremation.\n\nPromession is the only true environmentally friendly alternative to burial and cremation.",
