            "background": "Several years ago truancy was a high profile social problem.  Government introduced metrics to stamp out unauthorised absence from schools.  Local education authorities implemented the metrics overzealously.  Tight targets for attendance metrics resulted in schools demanding all absence is authorised in advance.  Later, some schools decided to only authorise absence in exceptional circumstances.  This was followed by \u00a350 fines per child per day for unauthorised absence.\n\nAt this point, schools effectively 'own' our children.  Law abiding parents must obtain school 'permission' for any absence, even one day.  It applies to all children regardless of their school record.  This is draconian and must be stopped.  'Truancy' means 'without parental concent'.  The metrics should not be used (or abused) to challenge fundamental parental rights.\n\nWe petition the prime minister to ensure school attendance metrics are not misused out of context where a genuine truancy problem does not exist.",
