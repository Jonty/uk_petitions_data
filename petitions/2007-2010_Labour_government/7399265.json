            "background": "With the restriction imposed by airports regarding the amount of liquid we can pack before we reach passport control. Airlines should be able to give passengers free bottles of water before entering the plane. They make millions of pounds profit so this will not dent their profits or make their shareholders cry. Passengers do get dehydrated a lot quicker in the air than on land. Plus dehydration makes the blood thicken - ie DVT. The liquid ban is silly. The govt won't do anything unless someone dies due to the effects of dehydration. This needs to be sorted before someone dies.",
