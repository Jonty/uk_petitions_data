            "background": "The Highland Midge, or \"Culicoides Impunctatus\", is a pest to humans and animals.  These wee beasties plague Scotland, and constantly ruin our tourist industry. The beauty of the Scottish countryside, mountains, lochs and glens, whisky distilleries, heather moors, salmon rivers and all things Scottish, from Highland Games to Haggis-hunting are marred by this unsavoury insect.  Even although only pregnant female midges bite, their abundance is so all-pervading, many family holidays have been ruined, not to mention the everyday pest these ravenous creatures inflict on indigenous Scots.  It is an oft debated fact whether they serve ANY purpose in the food chain, as birds and bats surely prefer to snack on something more substantial.  And less annoying.",
