        "background": "The Human Tissue and Embryology Bill (currently before Parliament) will pave the way for scientists to create a variety of embryos made up of of different species. \n\nPeople are opposed to this type of research (only Canada allows it). The UK public have been kept in the dark e.g. a managed low profile in the mass media. In the longer term, we face the  dilemma of what it will mean to be 'human'. This research will also lead to animal suffering as the natural barriers between animals and humans are removed e.g. greater experimentation with ' animals' to satisfy research. N.B. Reliable alternative research is available e.g. adult cells for stem cell research.  \n\nProceeding with this legislation behind 'closed doors' (the House of Lords) is outrageous for such an important issue. Before legalising research that threatens the future of the human race as we know it, the government must facilitate a proper debate, engaging fully with the the British public.",
