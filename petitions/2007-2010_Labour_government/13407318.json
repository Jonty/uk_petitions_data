        "background": "Plainly the Attorney General is in the wrong.\nYet that same AG pushed for this very law to be passed - against sage advice warning of the pitfalls of presuming guilt.\nAnd the Code for Ministers indicates that they 'must' not break the law.\nSets a bad example; gives ammunition to the Government's foes - abroad and domestically; and, politically, is inept in the extreme.\nPlainly, as the AG will not go, apparently, the Prime Minister should sack her.",
