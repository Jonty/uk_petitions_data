            "background": "These vehicles are much more economical in the wide open ares of the countryside, They are the vital vehicles that get your food to market on or in trailers that only they can pull along dirty tracks and lanes.(Try pulling a cattle trailer with 2 tonnes of live beef in it with a VW 1.4 diesel). \nAll of these Large Vehicles should be fitted with trackers and/or be taxed upon a post code basis and when they enter the larger Towns & citys where these vehicles use twice the amount of fuel they would normally, they should be then Taxed on a daily or as you drive basis.(The technology is available now.)\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister to rethink this appalling TAX and concentrate on cleaning up the city pollution, rather than taxing the unfortunate people that really need these vehicles.",
