            "background": "Not all listed buildings are large mansions in the countryside.  Many are small town houses.  Having a listing on your property means you have to get planning consent for all repairs and changes that affect the building and its environs.  You have to keep it in a way that supports its listing.  Many of us want to do this, but there is no funding to support private residences.  We can't have cavity wall insulation or other modern building solutions as these contravene the listing.  These are often free or grant aided to other householders.  We can not have a chemical injection damp course.   We always have to take the more expensive option.  Grants from the Heritage lottery fund only support public buildings.  We want our significant ancient buildings to be safe and maintained.",
