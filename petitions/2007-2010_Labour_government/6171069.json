            "background": "Parents are hampered going back to work because of school holidays. Although the government help with funding, it is still too expensive for a lot of people to pay extra costs to have children looked after. It is also difficult to find a day care centre that has placements availiable and do not charge extortionate costs. The government should put in place a system where the schools that children attend should stay open during holiday times and implement a lot more fun based activities for the these periods. This will create thousands of new jobs, not only for holiday staff to run the Summer schools but will help parents get back to work without having to undergo large financial costs to have their children looked after for such a large amount of time. If the government truly want the nation to work then instead of parents having to go through countless paperwork and time consuming searches for decent day care,( and some cannot because they simply cannot afford it even with government help)  the simple solution is to keep the existing schools open and the government to fund them.",
