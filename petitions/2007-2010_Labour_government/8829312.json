This could be up to \u00a3250,000 in some schools.\nWhilst we fully support our colleagues and agree that this is money that they are entitled to. We do not believe it is legitimate or lawful to charge schools this back pay.\nThe school is not the respondent for equal pay claims, the local authority is.",
