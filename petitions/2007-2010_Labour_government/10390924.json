        "background": "The National Institute Of Clinical Excellence is currently recommending the withdrawal of therapeutic options (Anti-TNF) for Arthritis sufferers if the first option fails, despite good evidence to show that the majority of patients would benefit from other options.\n\nCurrently there is no method of pre-determining which therapeutic option would be most beneficial to the patient. With only \"one bite of the cherry\" and no option to move to other Anti-TNF options should the first choice be ineffective, this creates a lottery of sorts with a 1 in 3 chance of a decent quality of life for the patient. This is wholly unacceptable in a modern civilised society, where all should have the opportunity for a decent quality of life if possible.\n\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister to intervene, ensuring all therapeutic Anti-TNF options as currently used by the NHS are available to arthritis sufferers who would likely benefit from these treatments, as and when needed.\n\nRelated Interest Groups:\n\nhttp://www.rheumatoid.org.uk/article.php?article_id=535\n\nhttp://www.arthritiscare.org.uk",
