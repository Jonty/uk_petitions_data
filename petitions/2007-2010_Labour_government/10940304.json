            "background": "I think that in order to give Labour the best chance of winning a 4th successive term in government they should hold a national poll in around 6 months time. The governments actions in terms of responding to the recent \"credit crunch\"  in terms of bail outs for affected banks, I think has been satisfactory in the eyes of the British Public. By next spring, circumstances will have probably improved and I think that Labour will have a fair chance of victory if an election is held then. By next June, the current parliament will be 4 years old so if a poll is held off any longer the government is at risk of losing touch with the British public and therefore at risk of defeat.",
