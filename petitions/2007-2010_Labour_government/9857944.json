Having been on support websites, I know this to be common practice by employers.\n\nI have had to endure the physical symptoms of Migaine for a number of years. Despite ongoing treatments and my doctors best efforts, My condition now is erratic to predict and affecting my day to day life. This has now be exacerbated by the stress caused by Disciplinary measures and by my employers releuctance to recognise my condition under the DDA to make reasonable changes.",
