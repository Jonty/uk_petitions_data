        "background": "We implore the government to set new laws that when the British Judiciary decide that someone need to be deported for British security needs, that this cannot be over-ruled by the European Court for Human rights, if the European courts say these people cannot be deported from Britain, let them have the responsibility for these people in their own countries. This is reference to the appeal by Abu Qatada against deportation being won in the European courts.",
