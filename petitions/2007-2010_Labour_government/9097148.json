            "background": "Under the guise of landscaping improvements, some developers have been granted permission to deposit hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of landfill waste onto Green Belt land. Transportation of the waste results in noise and congestion while its use in remodelling destroys fauna and flora and creates dust and particulates harmful to nearby residents. \nWe call on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency to investigate fully these nationwide environmental disasters, some of which we have researched in detail. We also urge the Government to withdraw waste licences pending an inquiry into the activities of these developers and that the exemption of landfill tax for the improvement of golf courses, which encourages these highly profitable activities, be suspended until all matters relating to this issue are thoroughly examined and investigated.",
