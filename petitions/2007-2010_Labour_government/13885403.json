        "action": "commision a review into the working practices of LA officials with regard to the legality and ethics of their methods, particularly in relation to response to parental concerns over education provision,  home education and special needs provision.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the light of the Badman Review into home education, which recommends giving more powers to LA's and has been accepted in full by the government, there are grave concerns over how those powers would be used, as there are many instances, recorded and anecdotal, of LA officials misusing the powers they have, often by claiming to have more legal responsibilies than they really do or by using bullying tactics to get the outcome they want. We, the undersigned, feel that a comprehensive review of current LA practice should be undertaken before deciding to hand over powers that could easily be misued to a far greater extent than currently is possible in order to protect the public by ensuring that any current poor practice and abuses that may come to light are dealt with effectively and prevented from occuring in the future.",
