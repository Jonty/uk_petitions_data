            "background": "Recent historical research makes it clear that not only was the metric system invented in England, but also the idea behind the International System of Units (SI), that is now used all over the world, came from the work of John Wilkins, the founder and first secretary of the Royal Society. This discovery finally discredits the arguments of last ditch defenders of \"imperial\" units that the metric system is \"foreign\".\n\nImperial measurements still used by some people in the UK came from France and Italy and aren't 'British'.\n\nWhen all the other countries in the world apart from 3 have switched to metric, it is totally crazy that we haven't switched by now.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand managed the switch without problem and non of this stupid dual running for years.\n\nIt is time to bring the UK into the 21st Century and completely switch to metric.   Schools have been teaching metric since the late 1960s, the UK was meant to gradually switch since 1965.  This has been going on for 42 years, no wonder the UK looks a joke.  It's time to move forward for all our sakes and our childrens sake.  Let's stop being a laughing stock.",
