The dog had no collar or lead on and charged at us, leaving no doubt in our minds of it's intentions.  The owners have been seen on a regular basis training the dog to aggressively jump and attack a rope hanging from a tree in their garden.  This is the second time she has been attacked by the same dog.  After veterinary treatment this morning, she has been treated for puncture wounds to her chest, lacerations to her back leg, and severe bruising.  \n\nPeople who think that encouraging a dog to be aggressive need to be arrested and charged with cruelty not just to the dog itself but also to any animal that is unlucky enough to come into contact with.  \n\nThis is a all too often occurrence in this country, especially in the inner cities.\n\nIt needs to be STOPPED!",
