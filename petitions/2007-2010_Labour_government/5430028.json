            "background": "The conditions are disgraceful in which more than nine-hundred-million chickens live their lives each day.  Broiler chickens living this way suffer from being packed together tightly in large farms and living with their decomposing siblings as well as the inhumane limb damage caused to most of the broiler population. They live for around 6-8 weeks and suffer inhumane 'boxed' transport to the slaughterhouse to await their pre-death boiling and decapitation.\n\nChickens have the absolute right to live a happy life, these don't.\n\nHelp us to make it law for chickens and other farm animals to be treated as fairly as you and me.",
