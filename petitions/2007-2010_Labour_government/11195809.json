            "background": "Many local councils in England engage the services of private, self-regulated debt-recovery companies whose conduct is questionable, even when it can be demonstrated that non-payment is not the result of wilful refusal or culpable neglect, but a genuine inability to pay. These companies frequently impose walking possession agreements, themselves attracting a daily fee, in addition to pressing for inordinately high repayments that are neither affordable nor sustainable, and which cause additional hardship.",
