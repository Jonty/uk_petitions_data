            "background": "This petition is in light of the recent documentary showing the horrific practice of filming assaults by children on other children.  Adults should set an example to ensure that our children are not targeted by these violent people and are also not the instigators of such a barbaric practice, but it is also the responsibility of the site owners and modifiers to ensure that this practice does not continue.  Bullying and violence is bad enough without it coming into the public domain as \"entertainment\".  Please support me to ensure that appropriate steps are taken and children are spared this experience.",
