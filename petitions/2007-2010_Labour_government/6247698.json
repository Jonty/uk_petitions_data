            "background": "I have on countless occasions seen Buses, Taxis etc carrying fare paying passengers exceeding the speed limit. The National Express bus from London to Aberdeen crashed due to high speed on the motorway slip road with fatal casualties, passangers could only estimate the speed of the bus before the crash with many thinking that it was going faster than it was supposed to.\nMy proposal is to fit a simple LED display to all public transport vehicles within view of the fare paying passengers. The LED will display the current speed of the vehicle. This should encourage the drivers to stick to the limits and ensure that members of the public travel in a bit more safety. The system could be enhanced with GPS plotting to a recording device fitted to the vehicle, any reports of excess speed from passengers can be verified when a complaint is made.",
