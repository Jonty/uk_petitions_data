            "background": "The ENVIRONMENT AGENCY will take no responsibility for the maintenance of the River Thames and its main tributaries, instead leaving this  undertaking to the riperian owners. As a result of gross negligence by Government and the Federal Government in Brussels that governs over them, the prospect of flooding in the Thames West region has become a problem that has run wildly out of control.  Far too great a politically correct lobby of influence favours the preservation and habitat of the water rat and the great crested newt. \n\n\nI ask you all to support the petition and press the Prime Minister to alert himself to the circumstances that this problem poses. It is very easily overcome but it does require an iota of common sense and drive. Does he have it? \n\nI do know that DEFRA and The ENVIRONMENT AGENCY by past and current performance certainly doesn't.",
