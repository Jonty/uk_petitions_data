Without alternative life skills including lip-reading, you eventually withdraw from society. A thirty week lip-reading course in Essex now costs \u00a3186. This has caused most courses to close, remaining courses to be under-subscribed and a large number of deaf people to be cast out into an uncaring world without the ability to communicate with others.",
