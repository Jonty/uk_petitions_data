France & Germany have it right by keeping out. So not only are we sending our forces to this bloody hell hole, we are sending them without the correct equipment to protect them! All we have achieved in 7 years is the massive loss of young lives. Our street's will be the same regardless because the government are breeding these terrorists by being an 'accepting' country and opening its borders to the world and there dogs!!\nIs it worth it?",
