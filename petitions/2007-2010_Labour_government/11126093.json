            "background": "Disabled people, the elderly, those with pushchairs or simply those with heavy luggage deserve to be able to use public transport easily, safely and independently.  Clapham Junction and Vauxhall stations are both examples of inaccessible stations where people with mobility problems have to struggle with hundreds of steps alone.  Too many train stations also do not 'fit' the trains meaning that there are huge gaps between the train and platform making boarding and leaving the train hazardous for all but the most sprightly.  Disabled people have the right to be able to go to work or enjoy leisure time the same as anybody else.  Providing a few lifts and escalators should be made a priority in the busiest stations.",
