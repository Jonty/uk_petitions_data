            "background": "We agree with the findings of the recent Healthcare Commission report that says that patient focus should be central to care - but also include disease management and protocol design to meet variations and standardise best practice. We call for greater consistency, yet individualised care. \n\nSome problem identification and ideas for addressing what the report calls \"the challenges of working in the NHS\" have been suggested online.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to please address variations in infection control - and in personal experience case management - highlighted in the report.",
