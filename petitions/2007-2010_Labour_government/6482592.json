        "background": "The TV licence would no longer be neccessary if the BBC had commercial breaks like ITV, Channel 4 and every other channel available in the UK.  Adverts on the BBC would mean the TV licence would have to be abolished as they would make the neccesary revenue in other ways.  As we all know in the future this fee will rise and rise as time progresses.  Please vote for this and save yourselves around \u00a3130+ per year for a tax that will be proved as an unnessary fee.",
