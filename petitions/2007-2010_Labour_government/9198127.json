            "background": "The UK government should help out Tibet by taking action against China. This may mean stopping trade or relations. This is a major issue and needs to be dealt with however the government at the moment seems to be doing little about it. The Prime Minister needs to take action and be an example to the rest of the world. What China is doing is going against human rights and has led to thousands of deaths. The UK stands for democracy however we do not seem to be helping the countries who are in need. Sign this petetion and give your support to tibet and the sanctity of life.",
