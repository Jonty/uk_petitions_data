            "background": "4 million Baby Quorns (originally called Quoharn) are harvested every year for supposed \"vegetarians\" or \"meat free\" enthusiasts. Some naive people still believe that these products are meat free, just because western marketing has instigated such a strong brand ideology. It's about time that everyone who truly cares for animal rights helps fight for these small creatures native to the island of Maksanspeensers, just off the coast of Vacoas near Madagascar.\n\nThe desired method of catching the Quorn was by lighting small clumps of pumpy pumpy sod ( a rather pungent moss) which when dried and lit, emits sulphur which, due to its density, sinks into the underground tunnels and chasms and drives the baby Quorns out into crude wire Garrotting devices.\n\nThe Quorns that are mass produced live in small cages where they are drip fed anabolic steroids to fatten up their avalaf membranes. The Quorns live in complete darkness and cold for 7 weeks and 4 days to gain the maximum growth. They are then killed in a high speed vortex turmulation device, (much like a very large washing machine drum).\n\nMore details available at http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=231590845812&ref=mf",
