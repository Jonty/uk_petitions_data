My son has settled in well and is enjoying his time at the school. This is all down to the wonderful staff who are working so hard to raise the profile of the school after so much bad press.I feel that the school isn't being given a chance to prove itself. Already this year, the school has received an impressive OFSTED report and fantastic exam results. It would be a real shame if the school was to shut without us putting up a fight!",
