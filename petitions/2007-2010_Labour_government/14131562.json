            "background": "Referring to Couriers and Pizza delivery scooters: No other professional motorist is allowed to operate on L-plates and many require further professional training (HGV/PCV etc). It makes little sense therefore to allow learner motorcyclists with very little experience and hazard awareness to ride professionally often to tight deadlines.\n\nAdditionally, these learner motorcyclists (invariably teenagers) are also exploited by certain courier companies by being paid very low rates due to their age. This further increases the risk of accidents by requiring the learner motorcyclists to ride faster/take greater risks in order to maximise his/her earnings.\n\nGiven the costs involved in running a motorcycle and the low rates being paid, it is also questionable if all learner couriers/pizza deliverers have adequate motor insurance for business use.",
