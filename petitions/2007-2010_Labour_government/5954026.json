Many businesses have been forced to close as a result of a reduced amount of people visiting windermere. Water-skiing does not harm the environnment it is harmless fun, if people do not want to hear the noise of speed boats- which make the same amount of noise as a car then they should visit one of the other many lakes where you can't ski or go faster than 10 mph. More people want the ban to be reversed so surely you should want the majority want not the fussy minority who really have no valid reasons for the ban anyway.",
