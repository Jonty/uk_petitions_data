My personal taste is for classical music but I don't impose it on anyone - I listen on a personal stereo - why can't devotees of festivals show me, and everyone else, similar consideration?  As long as the people who like the music can hear it why does it need to be so loud that everyone in the neighbourhood is subjected to it?",
