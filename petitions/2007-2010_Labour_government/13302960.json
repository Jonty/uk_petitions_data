            "background": "I would like to campaign for concession tickets at Wembley Stadium. Many people wanted to take children with them for the 2009 Rugby League Challenge Cup Final, but were unable to do so, due to the cost, as no reduced price tickets were made available. Also many elderly folk couldn't afford the ticket prices. There were many seats left empty in that vast stadium, to which cost was a contributory factor.\nWe have a superb facility there, we must utilise it but give them less fortunate a chance to attend and support their respective teams. Individual sporting clubs have concessions, finals held at Wembley should not be any different and if anything, discriminate against the less well off with children, and senior citizens.",
