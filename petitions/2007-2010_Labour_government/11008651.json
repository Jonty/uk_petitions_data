            "background": "Where consumers pay for their TV via alternative services such as bSkyb, Virgin, Tiscali etc - We feel there should be no requirement to pay the BBC TV licencing fee.  The digital providers listed above (not limited to) are able to restrict the viewing of BBC channels.  Due to this we do not see why BBC channels can not be part of a package that consumers subscribe to by choice rather than being dictated to do so. We also do not agree with BBC management being paid the extortionate wages, which could be better spent else where.",
