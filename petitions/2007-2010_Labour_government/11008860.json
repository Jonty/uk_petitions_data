            "background": "The tuning and modifying community wants the government to embrace and accept this culture so that we can establish a LEGAL form of street racing on unused out of town roads.\n\nWe are not all idiots and 'chavs' driving around causing mayhem, we just want the opportunity to work with authorities to promote this exciting culture in a way that satisfies everybody.\n\nThere exists a strong engineering and technical base in this community and we spend ALOT of money on our cars money that inevitably goes into the economy If a similar opportunity is afforded to clubbers and drinkers with vast amounts of public money being spent on clean up and security and safety to take care of them then why cant they let us sober, skilled street racers enjoy our form of sport/entertainment?\n\nCrackdowns don't work and just penalize innocent road users and all street racers do is move to a new location and all this pressure does is force it underground and become really dangerous.\nDont waste vast amounts of public resources on road countermeasures just give us the opportunity to establish LEGAL STREET RACING.",
