            "background": "Thousands of schools have been closed for many days over the past week without good reason, their excuse being snowfalls preventing staff from getting there and safety for the parents and children. This meant that parents had to find emergency carers or take time off work themselves. Excuse me but there is no excuse here as all other European countries do not close down due to a little adverse weather. Sign my petition so that we make the point that we do not expect this to happen in the future without a very good reason.",
