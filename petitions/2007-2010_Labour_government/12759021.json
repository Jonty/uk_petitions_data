I mean no one had even heard of most of you fools before 1997...they'll not forget you in a hurry will they? At the end of the day you can't polish a turd and try as you might to bullshit your way out of it now you and your cronies have been caught with your hands in the till but everyone in this country has heard it all before. The only way your party will ever see another term in office is if you fraud that also like Bush did. If you were a Company Director, you would've been gone long ago...I think the term people would use in is 'embezzlement' \"The act of dishonestly appropriating or secreting assets, usually financial in nature, by one or more individuals to whom such assets have been entrusted.\" Look it up in the dictionary should you need clarification.",
