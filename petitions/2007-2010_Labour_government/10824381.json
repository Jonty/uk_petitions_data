        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Due to the increase in fuel being a constant in 2008, the 40p tax free allowance for business mileage does not cover the cost of the fuel used let alone a proportion of the tax, insurance and repairs costs. Therefore I would like to see the tax free allowance be brought more in line with today's economic climate.",
