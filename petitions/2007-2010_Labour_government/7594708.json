        "background": "The technology exists to allow all homes to be heated (and cooled) using efficient heat pump technology using geothermal energy. Heating homes would be virtually free after 6 years on current prices and importantly virtually zero emission. If all new houses had to be so heated the heat pumps would drop in price to be affordable by all. The savings on power generation and fuel imports would be huge.",
