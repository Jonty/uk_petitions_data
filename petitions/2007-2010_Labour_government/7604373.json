        "background": "Schools throughout the country have drama and music but nothing to do with dance. For those who dance or would like to do it they should be able to have that instead of a subject such as biology or french. A lot of children these days arent able to cope with so many subjects which make you study, read lots of books etc. Dance is also a great form of exercise and can build confidence.",
