            "background": "Following interest rates cuts by the Bank of England totalling 2%, a number of Banks and Building Societies, both major and otherwise, have failed to pass these rates on to Standard Variable Rate mortgage customers. \n\nIt is widely accepted that this refusal to pass on cuts is merely an attempt by the Banks to bolster profits and,  ultimately, shareholder premiums and \"Fat Cat\" bonus payments to directors.\n\nAs the Government ploughed billions of punds of taxpayers' money into the banking system in an effort to keep it afloat, we believe that the Government should now introduce legislation to ensure that ALL interest rate cuts, both future and retrospective, are passed on in full to all, and not just some, mortgage holders.",
