The Environment Agency states: \u201cDischarges from Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) are a regular occurrence and can happen following as little as 2mm of rain.\u201d \n\nIn response to the rain in July 2009, Thames Water emptied concentrated untreated sewage at Mogden into the river in order to protect the plant after the rain. \n\nThames Water has pointed out that the dumping of almost a million tonnes of raw sewage into the Thames at Isleworth was \"not an accident\" and they have consent from the Environment Agency to discharge into the river at any time - the Thames Tideway is classified as open water and falls under the same laws as discharging waste into the English Channel.\n\nIt is senseless that a strip of river which is almost static in the summer can be classified as such.",
