            "background": "The aim of this petition is to have the government put in place clear policies and procedures that prevent the M.O.D from low flying over Equestrian properties and land used for horses. These policies must include the ability of owners and managers of Equestrian facilities to report such sites to the M.O.D and for the M.O.D to create a register and exclude these sites in all operational and training flight paths, unless unavoidable. If low flights are made over such sites then the M.O.D must keep a specific log and be publicly accountable when questioned over such decisions.",
