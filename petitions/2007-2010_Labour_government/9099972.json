We suggest that the law be changed in favour of the home owner AND legalise the home use of non lethal defense items. The items considered should be Taser, CS/Pepper sprays and any other easy use non lethal  weapons.\n\nThe self protection items should ONLY be allowed for use in a private residence. Against an uninvited person or a person who is now not welcome and is refusing to leave and where the owner feels threatened.",
