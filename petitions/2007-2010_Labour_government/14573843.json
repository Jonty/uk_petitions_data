            "background": "If a business owned by a self employed family earns over the amount to become uneligible for a means tested bursary (\u00a325000), then you can't get the money! Why do the government assume the parents take all the money for themselves? EG, my parents don't pay themselves nearly enough, yet I won't get the bursary because the business earns more than \u00a325,000 per year. This is totally unfair and now I don't know how to afford it. With the diploma soon to be gone too, it means all nursing students, who were previously able to afford the Diploma only won't be able to afford the Degree.",
