        "background": "RAF Eye is a former World War II airfield in England. The field is located 11 miles NE of Stowmarket in Suffolk.\n\nThe airfield was closed and there have been various industrial developments on the site. Many of the old taxiways and runways remain however, along with a T-2 hangar and various wartime buildings in various states of repair and use.\n\nI would like to see Eye Airfield re-opened to the public for Civil Flying. This would be popular with aviation enthusiasts all over the country and it would give a real boost to the local area and tourism.",
