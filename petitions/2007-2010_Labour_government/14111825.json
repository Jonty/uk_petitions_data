        "background": "Since the 2007 floods, not a great deal has been done to prevent a re-occurence of the flooding that hit Tewkesbury. The town still floods several times a year making it very hard to access the local town for some residents of Priors Park. New housing estates are being built on known flood plains and some action needs to be taken before it goes to far and the town is permanently flooded.",
