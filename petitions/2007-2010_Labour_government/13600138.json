            "action": "introduce emergency legislation that if any public sector or key service provider employee (including royal mail employees) go on strike they can be dismissed immediately. The legislation can be revoked in the future once the economic climate has improved.",

            "background": "With the recent strike ballots held by the CWU it is incredible that in this current economic climate they believe that by holding strikes it is going to benefit the future of royal mail, it's employees and the UK as a whole. Their customers will find alternative options and will not return. Based on the current number of unemployed and the skills required the vacant positions can be filled immediately. We cannot allow the unions to hold the UK and it's financial recovery to ransom.",
