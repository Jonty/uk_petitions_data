Please sign and support this petition to ask the UK, UN, US and ALL world leaders to deploy the skills of structural, civil engineers, earthquake building specialists and troops when the rebuild starts so that future buildings in Haiti can withstand the perils of nature. The rebuild will of course require further funding therefore we also ask that we all (including world governments) continue to donate till the very end.\n \nHaiti is unfortunately prone to storms and earthquakes. We need to ensure that the devastation endured and witnessed 2 weeks ago does not happen again on such a catastrophic scale. We also need to ensure that the rebuild is successful and efficient. Thank you for your support.",
