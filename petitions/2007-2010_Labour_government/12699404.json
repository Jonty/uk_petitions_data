            "background": "If a tax free payment of \u00a31 million opounds is paid to every registered voter it will jump start the economy from multiple directions.  Those that retire and emmigrate leave behind jobs and houses revitalising those areas.  The new money will be pumped back into the UK economy from the grass roots level.  Inner city urban areas will be able to modernize in a cohesive manner and of course a solid reelection is nearly guarenteed.  Plus it will be much cheaper than current options being undertaken.",
