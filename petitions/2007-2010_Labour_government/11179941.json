        "background": "A month ago the Bank of England cut interest rates by 1.5%. The Royal Bank of Scotland were quoted at the time as saying that they would pass on the full cut.  Now, almost a full month later, they have made a cut of only 1%.  As we the British Taxpayers are the major shareholders in this company the government should enforce their own economic imperative (and RBS's commitment) by having them pass on the rate cut in full.",
