Make all the lines as safe as the jubilee lines with double doors, preventing tragic deaths and disruption on the tube especially in the rush hour. Invest our money in good signalling systems across the tube. If neccessary forget the money for the Olympics at Stratford and use the money to prevent tragic deaths on the tube with these ideas!",
