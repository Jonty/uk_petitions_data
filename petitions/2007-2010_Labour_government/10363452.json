            "background": "An ever growing number of Local Authorities are now refusing to follow the recommendations of the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO). This is not an unexpected development because Local Authorities can save a substantial amount of money through maladministration which can help keep local taxation down and local taxpayers happy. Using my case as an example, Trafford Council recently saved \u00a3100,000 through maladministration. The LGO found them guilty and recommended they pay my family the \u00a3100,000 they had saved through their actions. The Council refused to comply. Unfortunately, local taxpayers are reluctant to hold Trafford to account because of the direct correlation between the payment of compensation to us and an increase in their local taxes. This situation should not be allowed to continue. A Public Authority should not be able to profit from maladministration. They should administer correctly and effectively in the first place but when they fail to do so, and families like us suffer as a consequence, they should be forced to pay the compensation recommended by the LGO.",
