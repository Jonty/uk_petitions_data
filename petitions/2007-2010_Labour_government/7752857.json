Therefore,why should we be forced to use these hazardous materials in our homes? We petition to retain freedom of choice to select our method of household lighting based on personal preference and with due regard to personal health and safety. Are the manufacturers of these devices prepared to arrange for their safe disposal at their cost(as specified under H&S legislation)?..",
