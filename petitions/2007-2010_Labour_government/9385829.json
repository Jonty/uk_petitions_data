            "background": "This is a problem that needs a solution, thousands of people suffer with a nut allergy and worry everytime they fly that someone is gonig to be eating nuts around them.\nWhen you tell the airline that you have an allergy, they only take the sale of nuts off that peticular flight not for the whole day and the scent of nuts could be still in the air which could still set off a reaction in someone with a very serious allergy and could lead to death. I understand you wouldnt like it to come to this as this can be solved so easily just by taking nuts off flights altogether could save lives potentially being lost and nut allergy sufferers not having to worry everytime we fly \nThank you",
