We consider that this should be addressed by substantially increasing the tax levied on short haul and domestic air travel. We believe that the revenues raised should be used to reduce the cost of longer distance rail fares. This would not only encourage more rail travel, but more importantly make a positive contribution to the Government\u2019s environmental objectives on climate change.",
