            "background": "As a believe in the Polluter pays principle I think that tax on car/van fuel should be increased significatly.\n\nRecent sharp increases in forecourt fuel prices has had an impact on the number of cars on the road.\n\nThe current method of road tax is unfair, why should 'low emision' vehicles that do 100,000+ miles a year pay less than a 'high emision' vehicle that are only driven on a weekend? \n\nNon-UK registered vehicles can avoid this tax, but none can drive without fuel! \n\nThe Increased income from fuel taxes will cover the shortfall and tax those that pollute in a fair manor.\n\nThose cars that pollute more use more fuel, polluter pays.",
