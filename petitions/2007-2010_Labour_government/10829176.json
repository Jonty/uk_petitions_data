            "background": "If a car is used by other family members as well as a disabled person, that disabled person is not then entitled to free road tax BUT, because of the constraints placed upon them by the need to transport a wheelchair and/ or a mobility scooter, they have a very limited choice about the size of vehicle which they can use.  It is grossly unfair therefore that they have to pay higher levels of road tax simply because they have to accomodate the demands of their disability and they should be allowed to designate one vehicle for their use which would then be entitled to the lowest rate of road tax currently available.",
