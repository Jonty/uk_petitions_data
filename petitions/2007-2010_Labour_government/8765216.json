            "background": "We have recently seen the regulators issuing heavy fines against bodies such as Nationwide Building Society for security failures (loss of laptop), Southern Water for systematically dishonestly reporting its performance data, leading to unjustified price increases, and now Network Rail for incompetence in organising engineering work over the Christmas period (announced the same day chairman Sir Ian  McAllister is knighted for \"services to transport\"). It would be a better joke if it were not for the fact that similar fines have been imposed after fatal rail accidents for which the organisation was found culpable.\nThe only people effectively punished when the organisation is fined as a body, are the customers and taxpayers, and the guilty get off relatively unscathed.",
