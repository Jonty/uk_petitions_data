            "background": "Since January when the rail fares went up train services seem to have got even worse. I, like millions of other people, use the train to commute into London everyday rather than drive. But the service has not gone 1 week where it hasn't been delayed or cancelled. The smaller stations seem to be worse effected forcing people to switch to driving. I don't see how Network rail can put fares up when the level of service has got so bad. Is this just the way the UK is run these days? Rewards for failure? I think rail fares should be reduced NOW and if you agree please sign this petition?",
