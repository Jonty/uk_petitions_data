        "background": "Current levels of car insurance premiums are prohibitively expensive, especially for younger drivers. The penalties for non compliance are not a deterrent when compared to the costs of purchasing insurance. Could the UK govt look to the examples of several other nations who provide a minimum 3rd party cover for a reasonable fee, this could be administered by DVLA and recorded on licences.",
