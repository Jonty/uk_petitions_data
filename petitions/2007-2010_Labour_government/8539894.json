        "background": "These mosquito devices are a form of discrimination.\n\nIt has attracted the attention of the Children's Commissioner and several civil rights groups.\n\nThese devices hurt babies, todlers and innocent young people and can be used to indiscriminately attack young people even when they are not causing a problem.\n\nThey also demonise young people, and create more social tension than they solve.\n\nIf this device targeted any other group within society, it would be banned. Therefore, it is completely unfair to install these devices against young people.",
