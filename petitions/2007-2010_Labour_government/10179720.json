        "background": "At present, those FALSELY accused of crimes against children can be found not guilty at trial, or have their case thrown out before the trial even completes, only to find that Social Workers summon them to a Family Court for a 'Finding of Fact' hearing.  At that hearing, they can be 'found' to have committed the offence despite already having been shown to be innocent, and then have serious restrictions (such as not being allowing to live with, or have unsupervised access to, their children) applied to them with dire legal consequences if they breach those rules.  It is wholly wrong for an innocent person to be treated in this way and for their family to be torn apart in such a callous manner, and for the Family Court to have a legal right to cause such destruction.",
