        "background": "As the rules stand at present, registered carers who are in receipt of Incapacity Benefit cannot be paid Carers Allowance because of the \"overlapping benefits\" rules.\n\nA registered carer who works full-time CAN receive payment for their caring duties, whereas carers who themselves are incapacitated CANNOT.  Is this \"disability discrimination\" in some form???? Surely carers who are not in good health themselves deserve to receive payment for their caring duties which may enable them themselves to pay for help THEY need to give them more time etc to complete their caring duties and alleviate some of the pressure they are under?",
