            "background": "With the recent bout of various government departments loosing sensitive data, and the probability that many untold company laptops have gone missing, there should be a law mandating the encryption of data of that leaves premises. This should include all removable media, including CDs and Memory Sticks, and the entire hard drive for laptops, as a password does not stop people accessing the data on the drive. \n\nAs there are many tools for doing this free, it should be compulsory for all companies, as companies with a lesser turnover would not have to pay to much. Also if it was law, then the government would have to provide information of how to encrypt laptops, as well as laptop retailers would probably perform the service as well. \n\nThere should also be set rules on the level of encryption, preferably using a recognised standard such as AES, with a set minimum key length for certain levels of security.",
