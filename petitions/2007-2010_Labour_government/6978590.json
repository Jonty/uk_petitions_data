Having so recognised take steps to work with Cadbury Trebor Bassett to stop the closure and retain both the jobs and chocolate production in Keynsham and not to transfer same to Poland.",

            "background": "Recently Cadbury Trebor Bassett has announced the closure of its Somerdale factory in Keynsham near Bristol with the loss of some 500 jobs over the next couple of years. The factory is to be moved to Poland.\nThe factory has been part of Keynsham's history and way of life for some 70 plus years and has a direct link with the history of chocolate making in Bristol. \nThe site has historical interest and the factory is iconic to the town. The main thrust has to be the retention of a vibrant and working factory.",
