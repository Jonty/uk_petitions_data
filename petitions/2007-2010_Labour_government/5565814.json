        "background": "Having watched the Save Planet Earth programme there are many laudable projects being run to save the wildlife that are losing their habitat due to deforestation. However without governments coming together with a plan to halt the deforestation, our wildlife is not all that is at stake.  The homes of the people that live in the region are threatened along with the climate change caused by the deforestation that affects us all.  It really needs governments worldwide to support the rain forest to change the trend but our government could and should make a start.  We need the deforestation to stop Today.",
