            "background": "Either side of January - March, houses bought under \u00a3175,000 were exempt from stamp duty. Its not fair to punish those who struggled to buy a house in this 12 week period, when everyone else, before and after, will be exempt. \n\nThe exemption was halted in Jaunary and reintroduced in March, AS A MEANS OF WINNING VOTES. \n\nIt is wholly unfair to do this at the cost of those people, who struggled through this time to buy the same houses at the same prices, as those who will now not pay this tax.\n\nPLEASE SUPPORT THIS MATTER.",
