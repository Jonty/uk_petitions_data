            "background": "As a tax payers we object to the sale of the UK nuclear power industry to a French government owned company. The UK would be better served by investing in the existing UK industry to develop,  build & operate a new generation of UK nuclear power stations. This would recover its skills, invest in UK jobs, our future & security of strategic power supply. We ask that our government act as we desire &  to not sell our share holding in the UK industry to EDF.",
