            "background": "i am a student and i am recieving \u00a330 a week but as i am a full time student i do not have time for a job but that makes me limited to what i can do because of the current problem with jobs and i know many students my age suffer the same problem\ni would love to learn to drive like many my age and mostly because its  easier to get to college and back because i live a great distance, and im not a big fan of busses.  This petition is to ask if there is a way of raising the weekly allowance to be able to support students will full time courses, and give us the chance to access further funding when needed",
