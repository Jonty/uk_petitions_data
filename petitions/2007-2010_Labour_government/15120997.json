Surely the UK government being racist against the english, denying them the same rights that the irish, scottish and welsh already have.  We should be allowed to celebrate being english in its many and varied ways without being made to feel that doing so makes us somehow wrong or anti-others.  Because to not do so should surely make celebrating the other countries saints days racist against anyone not of that nationality.  And no a British day or a UK day is not the same thing.",
