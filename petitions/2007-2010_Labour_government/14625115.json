            "background": "The House of Commons members estimate committee review of past ACA payments chaired by Sir Thomas Legg cost \u00a31.16m to produce.  Sir Thomas Legg recommended that 389 MPs, more than half the current and past MPs reviewed, should repay \u00a31.12m to public funds.  The cost of the Legg report exceeded the recovery and in effect we will still have lost \u00a31.16m from public funds.  The review of MP expenses has been to prove honesty and restore confidence in politicians.  Therefore it is not the public who should pay for the privilege of this proof.",
