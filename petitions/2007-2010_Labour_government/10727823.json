        "background": "Supermarkets are professing that they are reducing prices  of food to help those on low incomes, when in fact they are offer unhealthy foods, whilst those who can afford more quality foods pay a premium. This is yet again creating a two tier system, (the have's and have not's). The Big Supermarkets are making vast profits and caring very little about our environment and the people who live in it. Yet they try to convience us that it is in our best interest, when in fact they are putting profit and gain before people. It is repeatedly suggested that everyone has to 'tighten their belts' what makes the shareholders of these vast business empires the exception? Supermarkets should be forced to 'cut profits' during a Credit Crunch for the benefit of All, we are all in this together.",
