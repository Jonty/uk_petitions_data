            "background": "It should be illegal for parents/guardians to suggest or force a religion upon a child.\n\nIt is wrong to attempt to persuade or \"brain-wash\" the minds of the young so that the parent/guardian has the clarity that they have \"saved\", or in my opinion \"ruined\", their children's lives.\n\nThis may be a biased idea, but shouldn't people be able to choose the religion they wish to follow, without the suggestion from another biased source, i.e. the parent/guardian, who selfishly wish to inject the poison of a false concept into the innocent consciousness of a child.\n\nThanks for reading.\n--Liam Goodacre",
