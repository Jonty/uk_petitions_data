        "background": "This man is a Burnley FC legend! He has just finished his playing career at Burnley and has now signed for our neighbours Accrington Stanley. He was not always a fans favourite whilst playing but his kind nature and his determination to succeed eventually prevailed to leave him in the fans hearts forever. \nHe recieved his nickname 'Di Branchio' mainly due to the exceptional skill used in that memorable goal against Watford.\nEarlier this year he held a testimonial match due to his 8 and a half years at Turf Moor. Many of his former team-mates played including Robbie Blake and Steve Davis. I've never seen so many grown men cry as at that game. He truly was a legend!!!",
