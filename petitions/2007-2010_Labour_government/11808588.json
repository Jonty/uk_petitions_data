Eg music... written word... etc. These people live on the backs of us who have to work daily recreating our finished products and are wetting their pants at our naivety. For instance, musicians should make their living by live performance NOT by sales of works recorded many years previously unless that sale consists solely of the medium on which the work is reproduced. Ie the CD is a physical and tangible object and can thus be owned BUT the sounds emanating from the playing the CD should be freely available via the public domain.",
