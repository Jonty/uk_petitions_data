            "background": "The Future of UK Manufacturing Summit believes five key issues need immediate attention.\nSkills: Priority programmes for vocational and academic education are needed now to improve the level of professional and technical skills.\nEnergy costs: UK companies pay more for energy than their European counterparts. This disadvantage must be removed in order to promote competitiveness. \nSimplified incentives: Access to grants, credits, taxes and regulations is too complex and must be rationalised to incentivise research, innovation and investment.\nPolitical consensus: A long term commitment is needed from Westminster, Whitehall officials and the Treasury in order to rebuild the UK\u2019s manufacturing base for future prosperity. \nCulture change: Manufacturing suffers from an overwhelmingly negative image. A sustained campaign must be mounted to persuade the country \u2013 especially parents, teachers, students and the media \u2013 that manufacturing is essential and worthwhile.",
