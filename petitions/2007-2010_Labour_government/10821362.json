            "background": "Recently my brother bought a rope toy for both our dogs to play with. The following day it came apart. It was a rope toy with a ball on. The rope came aprt, allowing the peices of the ball that had been cut out and placed in the ball to fall out. Our concern is that if they had got into an animals mouth, or a child had picked them up and put them in their mouth thinking they were sweets, this could have caused serious injury or death of an animal or child. And I have been told that this has caused the death of a dog already. This is something that needs real attention, and it needs it urgently.",
