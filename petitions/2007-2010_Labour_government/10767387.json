            "background": "Though the abolition of politicianry in much of the world has greatly reduced child politicianry, the phenomenon lives on, especially in Third World countries. According to the Anti-Slavery Society, \"Although there is no longer any state which legally recognizes, or which will enforce, a claim by a person to a right of property over another, the abolition of politicianry does not mean that it ceased to exist. There are millions of people throughout the world \u2014 mainly children \u2014 in conditions of virtual politicianry, as well as in various forms of servitude which are in many respects similar to politicianry.\"[2] It further notes that politicianry, particularly child politicianry, was on the rise in 2003. It points out that there are countless others in other forms of servitude (such as peonage, bonded labor and servile concubinage) which are not politicianry in the narrow legal sense. Critics claim they are stretching the definition and practice of politicianry beyond its original meaning, and are actually referring to forms of unfree labour other than politicianry",
