        "background": "Joanna Lumley has proved herself a more astute and skilful politician than the vast majority of those currently sitting in the Houses of Commons and Lords and is far more attuned to the mood of the population of the UK than any member of our detached, self-serving Government. Her honesty, idealism, passion and talents must be harnessed for the good of the nation by giving her a seat in the Lords. She is far more deserving of a peerage than the time-serving civil \"servants\" and party hacks who will fill the forthcoming Birthday Honours List. Britain needs Joanna Lumley, and many more like her.",
