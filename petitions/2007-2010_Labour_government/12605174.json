Her honesty, idealism, passion and talents must be harnessed for the good of the nation by giving her a seat in the Lords. She is far more deserving of a peerage than the time-serving civil \"servants\" and party hacks who will fill the forthcoming Birthday Honours List. Britain needs Joanna Lumley, and many more like her.",
