And almost daily, we hear of cases where fire engines have been called out to rabbit warren estates and cul-de-sacs only to be pelted with rubble.\n\nThis is completely out of order. At the end of the day, genuine cases are losing out, and lives are being lost because of people who do not think before pressing the number 9 three times.",
