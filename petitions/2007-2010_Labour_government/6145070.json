        "background": "For centuries the study of Classical languages as been at the heart of academia in this country. Learning Latin and Greek provides a great intellectual challenge, developing linguistic, analytical and many other skills. Yet now this great tradition is at risk.\n\nThe exam board OCR has decided to combine the three Classics A-levels that they currently run (Latin, Greek and Class Civ)into one. This change will mean nothing more than the dilution of the subjects, bringing down standards at A-level and leaving students under-prepared for Classics degrees.\n\nThe government cannot allow these great subjects to be destroyed by dumbing down, and must intervene to make sure the three seperate subjects are retained.",
