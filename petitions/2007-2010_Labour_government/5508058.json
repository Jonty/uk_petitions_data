            "background": "I would like to petition to get the speed limit increased for vans of up to 3.5 tonnes so they are the same speed limits as cars. I do not see how driving a van is any different to driving a 4x4. I also don't understand how a class 2 vehicle can range from a normal van right up to a 7.5 vehicle that has the potential to carry up to 35 people. Vans in this day and age are just as safe as cars they are not any more dangerous than any other road user and there is clearly no need for a seperate speed limit.",
