Firstly I consider that it is bordering on obscene to take these creatures lives for no reason other than to satisfy the whims of Brussels Beaurocrats.\n\nI find this practice unacceptable for several reasons.  Firstly I consider that it is bordering on obscene to take these creatures lives for no reason other than to satisfy the whims of Brussels Beaurocrats, and should be stopped immediately.  Secondly, it beggars belief that no one in authority has considered the economic absurdity of such a practice.\n\nI would request that you bring to the attention of those concerned that this type of fishing is unacceptable, and that pehaps you can put pressrure on those responsible foor such ridiculous rules to put the matter right now.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nGeorge Walker",
