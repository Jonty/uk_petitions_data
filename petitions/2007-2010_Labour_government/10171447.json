            "action": "enforce the compulsory teaching of politics and cultural studies to all children under the age of 16 in school. I left school having been educated on religion, drugs, alcohol and sex, but never once was taught anything as basic as the meaning of left wing or right wing. How can the goverment expect young people to vote when they are not educated about what they are voting for?",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I left school knowing more about the classification of drugs and sexually transmitted diseases than politics. A basic understanding of politics and culture is essential to any child becoming an active and well-informed citizen in adulthood. One should be aware that reading certain publications will provide left-wing or right-wing views. One should understand political economy and the way it affects the information made available by the mass media. One should know how and where one can get a balanced opinion on matters of culture, politics and citizenship. I believe if lessons on these subjects were compulsory then even if people chose not to vote, it would at least be an informed, not apathetic, decision.",
