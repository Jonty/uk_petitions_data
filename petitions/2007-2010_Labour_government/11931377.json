            "background": "It is widely reported the government are planning to cut the speed limit on single carriageway roads to 50mph and enforced it with average speed cameras (SPECS).\n\nThe governments own statistics show that less than 5% of road casualties are caused by drivers exceeding a speed limit so why do we need new speed cameras and a lower limits?\n\nPlease Gordon Brown, spend more of the \u00a350 Billion taken from drivers every year to improve our roads. This will reduce accidents and contribute far more to road safety than new speed cameras and a lower speed limit.",
