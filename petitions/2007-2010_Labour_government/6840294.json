            "background": "The National Audit Office has responsibility to monitor government expenditure yet it fails to exercise such monitoring and control of its own expenditure. Since 2004, its Auditor General, Sir John Bourn has spent \u00a327000 of public money on meals at restaurants such as the Ritz and Savoy. The travel bill has exceeded \u00a3365000 for him and his wife over the last three years, including first class air travel. This is an appalling and profligate waste of taxpayers money by the body charged with the responsibility to ensure our money is wisely spent",
