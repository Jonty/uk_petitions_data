        "background": "The indigenous British people are fed up with the current terrorist threat, and continual abusive approach of the extreme wing of their supporters....we as indigenous British people deserve the same right of free speech, and expression as those who see fit to attack our traditions, laws, and ways...I call on the prime minister to re-vamp the laws governing racial crime, and discrimination so it is served equally and justly on all groups and organisations, and i also ask that the indigenous people of Great Britain have the same protection from abuse, insult, and attack that any other community have....No matter what a persons colour, or religion, they have a right to lawful protection, a protection that seems lacking for some people in the UK, but abundant for others. The Prime Minister has to serve fair and just racial laws for ALL, and i call on him to do that.",
