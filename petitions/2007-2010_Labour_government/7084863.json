        "background": "I am referring to the following cases; the murder of philip Lawerence and the attack on Gabrielle Browne. How can it be against their human rights if they are deported because of these crimes. They have committed a crime and this has been proven, after any sentence served they should be removed from the UK without fail. Politicans want people to respect each other but allow things like this happen which just undermines everything. Therefore this shows yet again the victims and their families are second place.",
