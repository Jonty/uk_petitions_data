        "background": "This petition is for a re-think on the government watchdog decision to prevent the British Broadcasters from working together so as to provide a world class internet platform on which to provide catch-up services and sell archive media.. Firstly the archive service needs to compete on the world stage against other broadcasting joint ventures such as Hula and currently iplayer is the most reliable and easiest to use platform; this is an excellent opportunity for Britain to take a technical lead that would also provide the UK with a good income. Secondly the public wants the British Broadcasters to focus on producing programmes; therefore diverting funds to produce and support three separate internet platforms is a complete waist.",
