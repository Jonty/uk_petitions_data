The scare mongering of cannabis use and psychosis links are very far removed from the truth. \nThe studies are unbalanced, as there were no comparisons made.\nThere is no hard undisputed evidence.\nThere is no definitive evidence.\nUsing words such as 'could' and 'might' cause are not good enough.\n\nOur request is this.\n\nPlease do not upgrade cannabis use back to B.\n\nRegards.",
