Military ceremonial is part of the fabric of the nation and we should all be very proud of this one thing that no-one else can do quite like us. \n\nPeople have excepted the cuts that have already happened in this area. However, further reductions would now start to be very noticeable on major State occasions. We are no longer talking about axing some obscure regimental line band. We are now talking about the nations finest! Please show your support and put a stop to further reductions in this area.",
