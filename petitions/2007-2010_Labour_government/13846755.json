            "background": "The government calls upon experts to write reports so that they may know the facts when making important decisions.\n\nNot for the first time has the government commissioned a report only to reject it's findings. This is an abuse of power & misuse of taxpayers money.\n\nAlan Johnson rejecting the findings of Prof Nutt is one example, but this petition addresses a broader issue than Prof Nutt's mistreatment: whatever the subject, it is unacceptable to call in the experts and then, when they make their report, hold the opposite view without supporting evidence. Why is the government refusing to base their decisions on the truth?\n\nBe a just government and when commissioning a report, by experts in any field, don't waste money. The tax payer would never willingly fund an investigation if they knew those in power had already made up their minds, based on personal opinion. It should not be so easy to over-rule specialist reports.\n\nIf ever any one individual is responsible for ignoring factual reports they should be personally responsible for refunding the tax payer.",
