            "background": "The Bank of England has been steadily cutting the base rate and it now sits at the lowest level since the Bank\u2019s inception.\nFor those in the UK who have been prudent with their finances over the past years, the critical drop in interest rates causes problems in the reduced income for their savings.\nIt is reported that more than 7 million people have saving accounts that already pay interest of 1% or less. Just over six months ago, savers were enjoying rates approaching 7%. This is a source of funding that is available for the UK Banking sector, but may soon be \u2018lost\u2019 to non-UK Banks who are offering 5%.\nISA is a mechanism by which funds are made available on a longer term investment but they are currently capped at too low threshold.\nTo allow funds to be re-invested through the UK Banking system, the threshold for the ISA should be increased",
