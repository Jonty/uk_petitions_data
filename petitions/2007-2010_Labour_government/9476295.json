            "background": "I have two children both girls.\nThey catch headlice all the time, apart from the fact that its not a nice thing for the children to put up with. \nTrying to get a decent education and learn while constantly being distracted by the itching.\nIt cost a fortune to keep buying products, that sadly headlice are getting immune too. And even more sad is the fact that not all parents bother with their childrens hair, so our children are infested again and suffer with the itching and trauma of having yet more lotion put on.\nSomething needs to be done.\nThe Nit nurse needs to be bought back to schools to send the infected children home to be treated.\nI easily spend \u00a324 a month on headlice products, which could so easily be avoided with a nit nurse being available.",
