            "background": "Recent times have seen an increase in media adverts broadcast by the DVLA warning of punitive measures for car tax evaders. The objection has been lodged on the basis of the following:\n\n(1) The cost of producing and broadcasting the adverts on television and radio is substantial and should be subject to full economical scrutiny to determine the economical benefit of production/broadcast vs the number of non car tax payers that may be otherwise persuaded to pay car tax as a direct result. One of these adverts in particular uses elaborate CGI effects to demonstrate a car crushing itself whilst its owners look on. \n\n(2) We object to these adverts being produced to an excessively high quality such that the principal intent for these now appears to be for public entertainment as opposed to a public information broadcast.\n\n(3) We object to the DVLA having apparent autonomy and little/no accountability for allocating taxpayers money to fund the production and broadcast of such adverts when money should be otherwise used to maintain and improve the UK's failing public highway network.\n\nWe call on the government to abolish DVLA advertisement altogether and provide full disclosure of costs.",
