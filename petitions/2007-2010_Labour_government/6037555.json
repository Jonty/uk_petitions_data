        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Residents in the Gloucestershire area have suffered in the last 7 to 14 days with the water supply being interrupted due to the recent floods in the area, which have been classed as the worst floods ever recorded.\n\nWater purification installations are key to a survivable water supply network.  The installation in Tewkesbury was not built on a flood plane however, why didn\u2019t Severn Trent Water have flood disaster protection around the site especially as Tewkesbury has records of severe flooding since 1947.Severn Trent had a pretax profit of 1.6 Billion 2000 \u2013 2004 shouldn\u2019t some of that profit have been used to install high grade flood protection\n\nIf a company leases a car to someone and it breaks down, does the cost of rectifying the problem become the responsibility of the consumer, the answer is 'no', the liability and cost of repair would rest with the company leasing the vehicle so, why are Severn Trent Water able to impose the extra costs to the consumer\n\nI urge the government and Ofwat to intervene on behalf of all Gloucestershire residents to prevent Severn Trent Water from increasing their water prices\n\nJohn Sullivan",
