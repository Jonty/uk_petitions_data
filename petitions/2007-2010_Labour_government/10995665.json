            "background": "After reading peoples comments on the local newspaper website, opinions seem to be that the sale of fireworks should only be allowed to those who are qualified to work with them, who understand the dangers, and know how to use them safely.  An ID card of some kind should be issued to those who are qualified to use fireworks, and this would need to be presented on purchasing the fireworks, which should be used for public displays only.  This would greatly reduce the amount of accidents that happen every year and the amount of threatening behaviour towards other people and animals.  Please sign the petition to ban the sale of fireworks to the public!",
