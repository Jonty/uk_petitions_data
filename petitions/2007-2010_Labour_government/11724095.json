        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The government have already seen an increase in applications for state school places as parents start to withdraw thier children from the private sector. The current economic climate will see this number increase and an already stretched state system will become overloaded.Some private schools will close with a significant number of job losses.\nCurrently those paying for private education are contributing in taxes to suppport the state school system but receive no benefit from it.Should there be a mass withdrawal from private schools the state system would not be able to cope.By giving tax relief on private school fees paid it would assist those in the private sector to continue paying for their childrens education and eliminate the need to burden the state system.\nWith reduced income on savings owing to the low interest rates the impact of private school fees is even greater on the individual.\nShould we really be expected to pay for education twice, once in taxes for the state system and again for our preferred choice.\nThe relief is fair for those of us not burdening the state system.\nPlease show your support.",
