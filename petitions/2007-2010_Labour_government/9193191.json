            "background": "Many hospitals and NHS sites now charge for parking.  In principle, this is wrong because:\n\n\u00b7\tIt adds extra stress and inconvenience to individuals who are usually already under additional emotional and physical pressure.  Such stresses of modern life are underestimated, but they do have an indirect health cost of their own.\n\n\u00b7\tIt creates additional bureaucracy, in to monitor and enforce it fairly.\n\n\u00b7\tIt should not be used as a means to raise revenue.  This is ethically wrong, partly because, almost by definition, hospitals can never have too much funding.  It is therefore a form of moral blackmail to tell people that if the charges are removed, then patient care will suffer as a result.\n\nWe therefore urge the government to adopt the principle that all hospital parking should be free of charge, for a minimum agreed duration.  Beyond this, we accept there may be exceptional circumstances where charging is allowed, eg in order to avoid abuse, or to allow access by priority staff and services.",
