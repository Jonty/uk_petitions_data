The island would make an ideal prison for dangerous prisoners or illegal immigrants as the sea waters around the island, and tides, makes escape without a boat almost impossible.\n\nPrisoners could be used in looking after the flora,fauna and wildlife on this remote island. Visitors can use the daily ferry from Bideford and a helicopter service could be provided locally.\n\nIt would bring much needed jobs to North Devon.",
