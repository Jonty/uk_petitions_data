If the employee is doing the same job as an older colleague then they are being discriminated against; show your support for equal rights! The government may argue that younger people should be in further education but this is not always an option for some people and some may struggle to support themselves through education so may need to work alongside studying.This shouldn't mean they should be punished for their age.",
