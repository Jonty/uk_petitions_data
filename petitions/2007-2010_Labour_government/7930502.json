            "background": "The three options put forward by the IW Council to reform Island education could mean the closure of between 28 and 41 schools, not to mention the loss of employment, and the destruction of village life. Many of our top performing primary schools will be closed as a result. Rural families would have to travel considerable distances. Alarmingly, no evidence has been given to prove that changing the structure of schooling would lead to an increase in standards. Please support us and sign the petition to stop the destruction of our Island's education.",
