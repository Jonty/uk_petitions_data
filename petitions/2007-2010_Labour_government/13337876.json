            "background": "If after 15 years of leaving university the student has not managed to pay back his student loan, due to illness or low-income. The goverment should abolish the loan. This would be inorder to give the student a chance to \"get back on their feet\" without a huge loan over there head.\n\nIt can only prove as a hinderance to the person to have a huge loan, that was taken out as a balance of working as a graduate after leaving university.\n\nIn Norway they attempted Student Loans and then abolished them, the generation that had Student Loans were later termed \"The (new) Lost Generation\".\nThe student loan is taken out on account that once you earn over a certain amount, you are in a position to pay back the loan. If the person is not able to do this due to illness or low income, the loan is left accruing interest.\n\nThis can only be a millstone around somebody's neck after an extended period of unemployment and hardship",
