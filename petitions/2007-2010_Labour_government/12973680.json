            "background": "We the undersigned support the notion mooted by Ed Balls to ban BNP\nmembers from joining the teaching profession. We find it \nreprehensible in the extreme that anyone who has willingly \njoined a political party holding the bigoted views, including \nextreme racism, anti-semitism,  homophobia, class prejudice, Islamophobia and \nsexism, that the BNP support not  should be allowed in the classroom. \nThe BNP also have substantial links to extreme rightwing \nneo-nazi terror groups such as Combat18,and has a history of \nviolence toward ethinc minorities, LGBT groups, trade unionists \nand other groups. We therefore feel that anyone supporting the \nBNP cannot be allowed to teach especially as such views \ncontradict many of the precepts of the school curriculum and principles of the teaching profession.",
