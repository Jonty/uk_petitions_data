        "background": "The commuter service between Kent and London Cannon St via Medway towns currently carries 4882 commuters per day into London Cannon St.  \n\nUnder the proposals resulting from the Integrated Kent Franchise, only 30% of the service will run - 2 trains per rush hour instead of 7.  The service into Cannon St from 2009 will only be able to take 1420.  The remaining 3462 will have to go via St Pancras.  Rail fares will increase across the board,  Those having to travel via St Pancras will have to pay even more for tube travel.  \n\nWe can do nothing, or we can campaign.  \n\nSouthEastern Rail are beyond reason, their only concern is increasing their massive profits at the expense of the commuters and taxpayers.  \n\nThe government may do little.  Or they may have enough grasp of maths to subtract 3462 votes from Labour\u2019s majority in some of the local constituencies.  Medway\u2019s Labour majority was a mere 213, Thanet South\u2019s only 664.  A shortfall of some 2,700 votes is not to be ignored.  \n\nPlease sign this petition.",
