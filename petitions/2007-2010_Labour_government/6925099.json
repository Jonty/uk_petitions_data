            "background": "At present, the first units are the most expensive. This is socially unfair and it rewards energy wastage. Everybody has to use a certain quantity of energy to maintain a modern home. People who limit their energy use to the minimum possible pay the highest rate. Those who are profligate currently waste energy cheaply.  The reverse should be the case: ones\u2019 basic requirements should be charged at the lower rate, and higher use should attract higher charges. This would be socially just and encourage energy conservation.",
