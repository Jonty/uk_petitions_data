Albeit 'illegal' at the time. Importantly, a public government apology for committing him to compulsory injections of oestrogen (&/or other female hormones) that affected his physical appearance and mental ability that caused him to commit suicide in 1954.This action was reminiscent of the Nazi regime that we had just defeated, in large part assisted by him and his codebreakers!",
