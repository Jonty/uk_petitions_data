        "background": "Alan Turing, the acclaimed mathematician, creator of Colossus and the Enigma code breaking efforts that gave this country the code breaking capabilities that helped Britain, and our allies, win the 2nd World War, and created/assisted in the precursor to the technology behind the modern GCHQ after the war, a postumous pardon for being criminalised for his homosexuality. Albeit 'illegal' at the time. Importantly, a public government apology for committing him to compulsory injections of oestrogen (&/or other female hormones) that affected his physical appearance and mental ability that caused him to commit suicide in 1954.This action was reminiscent of the Nazi regime that we had just defeated, in large part assisted by him and his codebreakers!",
