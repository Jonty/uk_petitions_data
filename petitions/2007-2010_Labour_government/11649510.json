        "background": "Engineering in the UK is on it's knees and desperately needs assistance from the government. There are lots of projects waiting to start but as the banks aren't lending to anyone, these projects are being shelved and thousands of Engineers, Designers, Fabricators and Fitters etc are loosing their jobs with little hope of finding new work UK WIDE!!!! Tens of thousands more are currently living in fear of loosing their jobs and wondering when their turn for redundancy will come!!\nThe PM and his government are about to bail out the banks for a second time, and they are considering bailing out the car manufacturers. Whilst we have every sympathy for those fighting to save their jobs in the car industry, surely bailing out the car companies is a waste of time if the rest of the country have no job (and therefore no money) to enable them to buy a car?? Or for that matter, a holiday, petrol, clothing, housewares or pay taxes to UK Plc!!\nWe implore the Government to please do something to breathe new financial life into UK Engineering - FAST !!!",
