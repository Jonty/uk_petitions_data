Manchester has just launched a fantastic campaign to cultivate fruit, nuts, vegetables and herbs in their public parks and green spaces.\n\nWe would like a similar campaign to be launched in London, at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nThe idea of going on a walk to a park on a sunny day and being able to pick and enjoy fruit which grows naturally in that park is delightful.\n\nWe feel that this would be a good use of public resources, one that benefits any who choose to enjoy it and is avaliable to all.\n\nFruit trees still produce lovely flowers and herbs release tremendous aromas. We believe that this will not spoil our parkland simply make them more enjoyable and more bounteous.",
