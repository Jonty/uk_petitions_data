Its members fly the flag for Birmingham nationally and internationally as well as working with Birmingham communities and schools. \n\nThe fact that BA was only given one month\u2019s notice of the funding being cut is \n\ndisastrous as it does not allow the organisation to make alternative \n\narrangements. Effectively this will bring an end to the city\u2019s only membership \n\nbased artists\u2019 group and studio provider.\n\n\nBA has a membership of 150, runs an experimental gallery, supports young \n\naspiring artists and provides crucial information and networking opportunities \n\nfor Birmingham\u2019s artist community. BA\u2019s studio complex at Lee Bank Business   \n\nCentre includes the Birmingham Print Workshop, the only artists\u2019 printing   \n\nfacility in the region . BA has pioneered \n\nexhibitions in non gallery venues allowing people \n\nfrom all walks of life to come into contact with the city\u2019s visual out put.",
