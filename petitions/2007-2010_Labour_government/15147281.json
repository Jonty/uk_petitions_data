The LSC now no longer exists and it is causing alarm amongst the students at Bicton College who are currently on Degree Courses(some of which are not offered anywhere else in the country) as to whether or not Bicton College will close. What will happen to these students? One of the Courses offered by Bicton College is Environmental Education which enables the students to go onto teaching about the Environment in schools.  Bicton College MUST be saved!",
