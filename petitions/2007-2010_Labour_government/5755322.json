        "background": "The method of \"dressing\" a road surface where by a local council employs a team of \"expert\" workmen to smother the road surface in hot tar followed by random scattering of stones which within a week have all but dissapeared leaving a surface that is 10 times worse than it started off. It also causes damage to cars using the road both through tar being sprayed all over the car and stone chips.This practice should be stopped and councils made to resurface the roads properly.",
