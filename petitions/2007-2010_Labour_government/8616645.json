So if you just make it that little bit more difficult for them to actually re-start or even to start in the first place it will make a big difference.\n\nSome people would be deterred from drinking alchohol if they had to make the effort to fill in a complicated form, get a photograph taken and pay a charge.\n\nIt's a little bit of a problem to actually do it, so you have got to make a conscious decision every year to opt in to being a drinker.\n\nThe cost savings to the NHS would be enormous.",
