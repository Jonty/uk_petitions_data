            "background": "We want to know whether our pensions and savings will keep us in old age.  The present RPI and CPI tell us all sorts of costs such as health club membership, a diamond solitaire ring, sat navs, mobile telephone texting or football shirts.  The lists change all the time: out goes a decorative plant plot and in come probiotic drinks in 2007, for example. \nWe want to know whether the Government is devaluing  our money in terms of basics we spend every week to keep alive and keep going to work. \nA sort of ration-book cost index called the True Inflation Index would let us judge better how well our elected governments manage our wealth.  We are an aging population with shrinking savings.  \nWe propose the True Inflation Index  is based on a static list for austere survival into old age: 1 lb beef, 1 pint milk, 1 loaf  bread, 4 oz of tea, 1 kwh of electricity,  a 3 mile bus fare, 1 l of petrol, 1 doz. eggs, 1 lb of potatoes, soap, 1 week's council tax and water rate.  The list must be pared to the minimum needed to be spent on things we need to buy every week - tea not blankets.   We would then know the least we need to  support ourselves austerely on our savings: the TII.",
