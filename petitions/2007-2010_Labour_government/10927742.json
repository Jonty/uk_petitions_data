            "background": "The amount of credit on offer to those on average wages is enormous, and tempts many. Those that are already struggling with payments are offered further credit constantly, with little refrence to outstandings debts. This is causing many to seek debt management help. We need a return to the old days of asking your bank manager for a loan rather than just filling out a online form.\n\nI propose that a limit of \u00a320000 be put on personal credit. This roughly reflects the annual salary for many people and is a manageable amount paid off over 10 years. Those that earn much more than this can apply for additional credit.\nAll credit company's should be forced to declare all their customers debts and further credit should be denied to those over the \u00a320000 limit.",
