            "background": "We are currently facing tough times and drastic measures are required to reduce our budget deficit.\n\nI have noticed in Bulgaria that junior and senior pupils share the same schools and resources. The juniors go to school between 7am and 1pm, the seniors go between 1pm and 7pm. The times are then reversed on rotation.\n\nThe benefits of such a scenario would include the following;\n\n1. A reduction in the total amount of schools and locations and similar reductions in maintenance and equipment costs (General repairs, heating, PC's, furniture etc).\n\n2. School land can be sold off or used for local recreational facilities. (Parks, exercise areas, allotments etc).\n\n3. Traffic jams would be minimised as school traffic would be non existent during the normal rush hours. This in turn would result in less C02 emissions and a safer commute for the children.\n\nIn essence the overall result would be a lump sum cash income for the government. Reduced ongoing costs and improved shared facilities for schools. A cleaner, greener and healthier environment.",
