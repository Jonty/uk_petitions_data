            "background": "We would like the Government to give UK people a democratic system fit for the 21st Century.   New technology, such as the internet, is creating a 21st century platform for democracy \u2013 where everyone can communicate/see what is happening, express their views/concerns, suggest ideas for improvement and have their say on the priorities/changes needed. Other Governments are already starting to do this, and gaining trust (and ideas) as a result.\n\nMore referendums should take place and representation should be based on ability and a true representation (e.g. more proportional representation). Representatives should also reflect, and be continually answerable to, a robust, representative and independent sample of the community they serve.  One person should not be given complete responsibility (on election day) to represent 100,000\u2019s of people every day for five years, whilst not being continually accountable to those they are supposed to serve.\n\nDemocracy should happen \u201cEvery Day\u201d, not just \u201cElection Day\u201d \u2026\n\n\u2026 as \u201cTrust\u201d will not be restored without it.",
