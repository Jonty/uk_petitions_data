            "background": "The inheritance tax threshold was recently increased from \u00a3300k to \u00a3600k but only for deaths occurring AFTER 10/10/07.  For deaths occurring before this date (even one day), their estate will pay up to \u00a3120K extra in tax.  \n\nThis doubling of the threshold demonstrates how out-of-date the old IHT limit was, and as a result many estates have paid way too much tax. \n\nThis is an extra kick in the teeth for those who have lost their loved ones very shortly before this increase came into effect. \n\nSo, we request that the IHT threshold  increase is back dated seven years to 9/10/2000 and refunds given as appropriate to those who have paid excessive tax in this period.",
