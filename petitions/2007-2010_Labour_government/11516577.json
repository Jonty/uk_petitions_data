            "background": "Interest rates on investments have dwindled to almost nothing and as every \u201cprudent\u201d person in the UK knows, savers are the hardest hit, particularly pensioners.\n\nWith the Government needing to borrow billions of pounds, wouldn\u2019t it be better to borrow from our pensioners and savers.\n\nGive them a fair guaranteed rate of interest and in return they will spend the money in the UK on UK goods and services.\n\nAt present bonds are issued to anyone around the world and we end up paying vast sums in interest that leave our shores and does nothing to help our economy.\n\nBy paying a good rate of return to our pensioners (and why not all UK savers) the money will stay in OUR economy and help us through this current crisis.\n\nIt seems simple, but it would be very effective and reward all those careful people who did not mortgage their life away on frivolous; spurious and unnecessary luxuries.",
