            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The introduction of the CPZ on Oman Avenue will seriously affect the neighbourhood and change the uniform layout of the properties. Based on the outcome of the implemented CPZ on Olive Road, the new regulation will reduce available parking facilities on Oman Avenue - which currently satisfy the needs of local residents. Currently, the residents of Oman Avenue have not expressed to the Brent Council any problems nor concerns regarding a \u201clack\u201d of available parking space. As such, the introduction of the CPZ by the Council can ONLY be described as a new rule imposed merely for the sake of collecting more funds from its residents and has nothing to do with facilitating parking space. The purpose of the Council is to provide services to its citizens in a fair and equitable manner and not to look for any means possible of raising as much funds from its residents through such pretexts as the CPZ.",
