            "action": "introduce legislation to change the law so that local government authorities who are responsible for the disbursement of council tax, are legally obliged to appoint, at random, from the list of council tax payers in their geographical area of responsibility, a panel of 6 independent overseers, with full executive authority, to oversee ALL expenditure.  Half of the panel (3 members) to be changed after one year and each year thereafter so that no panel member can serve more than two years; no panel member can ever be allowed to serve more than once; any panel member who ceases to be a council taxpayer must immediately be replaced.",

            "background": "This petition was prompted by reports that a council was paying over GBP1 million to rent a house for an immigrant family in London who were living off taxpayer funded social security benefits at the same time.  It is a fact that the many hundreds of thousands of people who pay into the council tax fund of their individual areas have absolutely no control nor oversight of what happens to the money.  It is merely doled out by council officers who are exempted from any accountability and responsibility for the success or failure of their activities.  It is time that use of this money was monitored and oversighted by the people who pay it.",
