As well as this excellent produce they are often good stewards of the countryside which all of us can enjoy.\nOn this day farms could be open to the public and could advertise their produce and generally educate the public about their work, perhaps particularly of interest to children.\nA high profile day where all that farmers do can be celebrated rather than denigrated.",
