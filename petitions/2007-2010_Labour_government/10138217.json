        "background": "My local newspaper carries stories of dads physically assaulting referees who make decisions they disagree with in respect of their sons' teams. Fans invade pitches when implored not too (Bradford City - last home game 07/08 season). Rich football stars in the Premier League (Chelsea - a good example) chase referees who make decisions they don't like.  Time for TV pundits to stop condoning inappropriate behaviour and to set a leadership example.",
