            "background": "since the original 50 Billion is tax payers money. This money should be offset against any mortgages held by any bank taking cash.\nalso the remaining 250 billion and 200 billion in loans and gaurantees. This is money invested by the tax payer. Therefore should automatically be written off on customer mortgages until such point as these are repaid in total to the BOE, and the tax payer. The problem has been irresponsible lending, and the creation of money using interest. We should not thus be using this bail out to create another 500 Billion which the banks can indiscriminately lend on, creating more fictional money and another go round on the wheel",
