        "action": "raise the Bankruptcy threshold to \u00a35,000",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The threshold has been unchanged since 1986 and Bankruptcy is now being abused by creditors in place of other more cost effective methods. In particular those who are unable to pay council tax are being bankrupted for sums as low as \u00a3750 when the council is fully aware that they will not realise the sum claimed as most assets if there are any disappear in costs of the bankruptcy procedure. Those made bankrupt can then be a burden on society through loss of employment, rehousing and various benefits including ironically future council tax bills. The costs to society far outweight the benefits if indeed there are any benefits. Councils now opt for bankruptcy bypassing attachment of earnings where a debtor is in paid employment and withdraw instalment options after just one missed payment at a time when a more balanced repayment programme will result in council tax receipts increasing at no cost to councils.",
