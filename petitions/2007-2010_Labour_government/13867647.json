            "background": "Statistically it is a well known fact that more children are abused in social care, than in their own homes, however inadequate the authorities believe the natural families are?? Most of the cases of children abused in care are suppressed and kept out of the public domain. In light of the recent exposure of malpractice in failing CAFCASS and most associated departments and the secrecy of family courts. I believe we, the public have right to know the truth, about what really happens in social care, and the deliberate social engineering taking place, to destroy healthy families. A Fabian led social engineering policy since at least 1700.",
