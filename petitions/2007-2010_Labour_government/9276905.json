            "background": "This law was in place since 1941 or something like that and yet has not been updated. I want this change to be done so the UK public can listen to things like Air Traffic Control. I'm a trainee pilot and iv been reading about live ATC feeds but they only seem to be in America, i asked why and was told because the UK law doesn\u2019t allow this. There are many people here in the UK who would also like to listen to ATC at airports not just for learning but its quite nice to know what people do in ATC etc..\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about things like terrorist listening in, what exactly can they do apart from listen to see what plans come in and land and takeoff? That\u2019s all they can do. Think about it, America allow this and name something bad that happening regarding terrorist listening in to Air Traffic Control (not 9/11 as that has nothing to do with terrorist listening in to Air Traffic Control). I think you will find nothing because what use do they have for that as you can find what planes takeoff and land on the internet and live data on when they have landed/taken off as airports now do a live tracking on there website that shows the aircraft that just took off etc...",
