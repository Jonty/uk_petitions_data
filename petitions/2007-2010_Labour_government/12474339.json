            "background": "The British Economy is facing major competition from China and the key factor is labour costs. People buy those goods even though they are not of adequate quality because it is cheap.\n\nTo kick start the economy, the goverment should bring about an overall reduction of 20% in the wages of everyone. Thus this will help organisations to reduce costs and hence be able to employ more people for the same quantity of money or reduce prices by an appropriate amount.\n\nThis will also make British Goods more competitive in the international market allowing us to export more and go back to the strong manufacturing industries that we once had.\n\nThere will be some pain but as they say no pain no gain.\n\nRather than pump millions into the banking sector, having less money around with lower cost items will help the economy",
