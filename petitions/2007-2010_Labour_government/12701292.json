        "action": "promote legislation to introduce preferential voting for Parliamentary elections so that voters can elect the honest and careful and remove the dishonest and careless.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "People want to remove MPs who have abused their expenses, but the present voting system makes this hard because most MPs have safe seats and those are the ones most likely to have large expenses claims. Proportional Representation (PR) may help a little but party supporters usually cannot vote against a sitting MP without voting for another party and splitting the party vote.\n\nWith preferential voting, voters list candidates in order of choice so they can choose between the most corrupt, the honest and those in between. It is also more feasible for a party supporter to stand against the party\u2019s official candidate than it is under the present system.\n  \nIf preferential voting is combined with multi-member constituencies, voters can choose between different official candidates of the same party. This would allow them to vote against sitting MPs without any risk of splitting the party vote and would make MPs directly accountable to voters. In short, the VOTERS could elect the honest and careful and remove the dishonest or careless. Also, the result would be proportional.\n\nThe websites of stvAction and the Electoral Reform Society explain preferential voting more fully.",
