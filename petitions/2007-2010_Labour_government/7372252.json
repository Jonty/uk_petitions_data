However, my mother is friendly with a woman who has an organisation for those who support kids with Fetal Alcohol Effect and Syndrome. One mother had a glass of wine, and her son has full scale FAS (the more major of the two). Help put a stop to this, and stop children being aborted, and abused because of their mothers carelessness.",
