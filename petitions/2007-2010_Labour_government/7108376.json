        "action": "put in place a new games rating system whereby games are rated by people with extensive knowledge of the industry",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As has been proven by the BBFC's handling of film ratings, these systems are an advisory measure; something that customers look at and take into consideration when making a purchase. As a result, we believe it is important that this advice comes from people with extensive knowledge of the games industry.\n\nThis knowledge is something that PEGI, the current games rating organisation, clearly does not possess, as a significant number of their ratings are perceived to be bizarre and illogical. Similarly, the BBFC, while effective where films are concerned, lack an appropriate knowledge of the games industry to pass judgement.\n\nWe would therefore like to see an independent organisation established for the sole purpose of reviewing and rating games before release. This organisation should be made up of people with extensive knowledge of the entertainment medium, enabling them to provide us with accurate, logical and reasonable advisory ratings for new games.",
