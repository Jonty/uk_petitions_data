            "background": "Here in Bromsgrove we had no say in if fluoride was to be added to our water supply back in 1985, since then we have evidence that it is harmful to us if drank in whatever qualntities.\nThe gov't state that it's there to protect children's teeth up to 12 years of age, after that it has no benefit, best way is a blanced diet that would contain natural fluoride and not a by-product from a metal production. Many children have fluorosis of the teeth caused by this fluoride being added to the water supply.\nWe now hear that cancer can be caused by this chemical, it can also bring on early dementia, plus many more side effects, some fatal.\nSign our petition and in doing so you say take fluoride out of our water supply now here in Bromsgrove!!",
