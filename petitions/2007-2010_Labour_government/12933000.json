            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Thousands of home owners were advised to lock into fixed rate mortgages, merely weeks before the base rate fell to a record low. By allowing mortgage holders to revert to the variable rate, without penalty will increase the spending power of these homeowners to spend in the struggling sectors, motor industry, travel, consumer goods and luxury items. Surely it is time for the fat cat directors and shareholders of these institutions to realise that by increasing the spending power of these people is for the greater good of the economy, thereby securing jobs and working towards a more prosperous future. More spending power will increase confidence and surely bolster the financial industries longer term by increasing confidence in providing credit again.",
