        "background": "Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of blood cancer. The current treatment is Imatinib (IM). Approx. 40% of individuals may display resistance to IM.\n\nDasatinib (DS) & Nilotinib (NL) are licensed for the treatment of adults with chronic & accelerated phase CML with resistance or intolerance to IM. DS is also effective for Blast Crisis CML. Both received approval by the FDA & EMEA.\n\nNICE do not accept the evidence supplied in the initial report, as they consider open label, non blinded trial designs seriously flawed. \n\nCost of supply is the issue.\n\nWe are urging NICE to reassess their decision NOT TO fund the use of these EFFECTIVE treatments on the basis of cost \u2013 without the need for 4 arm (DS, NL, high dose IM) double blind randomised studies including a control group receiving \u2018best supportive care\u2019 \u2013 allowing none of them to crossover and no dose escalations according to how they respond.\n\nThe NICE assumed average age for CML is 60. \n\nWould you accept such a trial would be morally/ethically correct if it was aimed at young children with CML? What if your National Insurance scheme now doesn't treat you with the best drugs because the cost is considered too high?",
