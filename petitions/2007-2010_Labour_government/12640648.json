This process cannot be left to parliament and the current group of MP\u2019s. The main reason for this is that they have clearly shown that they are incapable of self-regulation, also the general public has now lost all confidence, and trust in the current group of MP\u2019s who hold office.\n\nThe general public must have their say in how this mess is resolved. The long process of reforming our parliamentary system should start with a general election so that we, the general public can have MP\u2019s in office that we trust to bring a level of confidence back to our parliamentary system",
