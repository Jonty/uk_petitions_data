        "background": "If everyone had to pay a minimal fee for prescriptions it would encourage those that had to pay to actually go to the doctors and receive any required medication they may require.\nAlot of people who do not have to pay for prescriptions are more likely to go to the doctors for items that thy could buy over the counter.\nI am quite fortunate that I have very few visits to the doctors; if ever I do need to go I will try to avoid prescriptions due to the price of them.\nI do not think that prescriptions should be free unless it relates to life saving medication nor do I think that they should be the current price.\nPlease make prescription charges fair and make everyone pay \u00a31.00 per item regardless of their income; surely this is better for the NHS than scrapping charges all together.",
