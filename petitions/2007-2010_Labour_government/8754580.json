        "background": "Death by lethal injection for the crimes already mentioned. Murder must be proven, that is why I have put mass murder, i.e. more than one (e.g. serial killers where there is total proof of the crimes committed).\nWhy should the Tax Payer have to foot the bill for looking after these people? The Government are there to represent the people of this country in a democratic society. If most of the law obiding citizens want the reintroduction of the death penalty, then this should be made law as per the request of society, not what one or two liberally minded politicians request.\nTHANK YOU FOR SIGNING MY PETITION.",
