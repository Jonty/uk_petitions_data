            "background": "Every year children in England are forced to complete their SATS tests. These are tests that create a great deal of stress and anxiety for children and mean that for most of the time running up to the tests the children will not be allowed to do any other subjects except english, maths and science as the league tables are too important. Teachers are trained and more than capable of assessing children without national tests and could probably do a better job. secondary schools rarely use the information from SATS and are now not really worthe the paper they are written on.",
