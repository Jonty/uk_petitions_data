There is no requirement upon them to ensure that the notice has actually been received by the recipient. \n\nThe minimum requirement should be that recorded delivery is used so that a proof of delivery is available to the court as an audit of due process. Furthermore, wherever possible, an email should be sent in parallel.\n\nI can think of no reason why any reputable company or agency would disapprove of this change. \n\nPlease support this petition, thank you.",
