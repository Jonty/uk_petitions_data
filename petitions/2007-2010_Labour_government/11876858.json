        "background": "These days challenging psychiatric practice and opinion is very difficult.  Even specialist solicitors don't know how to do this.  And \"vulnerable\" and unassertive patients don't stand a chance.  So much of psychiatry takes place behind closed doors with an institutionalised mentality.  And matters labelled as \"clinical\" are automatically seen as beyond challenge because non-psychiatric staff do not feel qualified to make a challenge.  Complaint departments should have the power to insist that questions are answered and changes are made in order to serve customers much better.",
