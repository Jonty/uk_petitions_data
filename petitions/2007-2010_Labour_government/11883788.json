            "background": "In April 2008 Wrexham & Shropshire started running trains from Wrexham via Shrewsbury, Telford and Tame Bridge to London, a serice missing for over 30 years. Since then Virgin Trains have started a service from Wrexham and now propose a service to Shrewsbury, this puts 50 jobs in Wrexham at risk plus jobs at Wrexham & Shropshires suppliers in Wrexham and surrounding Shropshire. Virgin Trains should instead concentrate on the West Coast Main Line or lines with no direct link to London ie Blackpool.",
