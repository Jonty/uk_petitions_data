        "action": "provide for annual pension increases for UK pensioners living overseas",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently UK pensioners living in countries that are not party to Social Security Agreements do not receive the same annual pension increases as other UK citizens. This despite the fact that they continue to pay UK taxes and have paid UK National Insurance contributions throughout their working life. This is inequitable, despite the European Court of Justice ruling in favour of the UK Government (but allowing right to appeal).\nIf you are, or will soon be, affected - sign the petition now, bearing in mind that the Opposition Leader has agreed to review the situation if they are elected. Our pensions are now worth around 30% less than 12 months ago due to worsening exchange rates. We still can vote in UK.",
