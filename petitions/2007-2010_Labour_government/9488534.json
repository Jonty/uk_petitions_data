By banning a team from playing any further matches, for a set period of time, supporters will be forced to behave in an orderly manner if they wish to continue to see their team play. Following such an instance of mass rioting, in the interests of public safety, the team should be subject to a ban to prevent the supporters having the opportunity to riot again.",
