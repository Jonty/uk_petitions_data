            "background": "Roughly 18 months ago the uptick rule was eliminated in the USA. The uptick rule was a rule that said that short sellers could only take a new position when the stock in question was moving upwards in price. This helped to stopped massive short attack on a declining stock. The rule was repealed and short trading is out of control. It is a major factor in the rapid decline of the markets. If the rule is reinstated  it will cause an immediate upswing in many areas of the stock market that are under threat - area which have not been the focus of the new US legislation.",
