            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We need national service in this country but cant send unwilling youths to war. I believe a force of trained and disciplined rescue and relief workers could be used to help in natural disasters both home and abroad. These people would be trained in a military style except for the weapons training. Instead being used as a force for good without taking the military away from its primary duties.  In conjunction with the military the personnel and equipment would be available at a moments notice to be deployed where needed.\n    These conscripts will develop a sense of discipline and worth sadly lacking in todays society, and also develop citizenship skills and skills for life and work in general. There would also be no youth unemployment and youth crime would also fall. Training could be done by ex service personnel and run along the lines of previous generations national service.",
