            "background": "In December 2006 The Electoral Commission produced a fact sheet discussing the pros and cons of compulsory voting to improve voter turn out for UK elections. The electorate was split down the middle on the issue prompting the Commission to suggest that more thorough research and public consultation be carried out.\n\nCompulsory voting has been seen to cause up to 95% turnout in the liberal democracies in which it is employed, with evidence that it causes people to make themselves more aware of politics, and forces parties to address all sections of society. In addition empirical evidence shows that lower turnouts mean a disproportionate number of working class citizens are excluding themselves from the political process.\n\nDebate needs to take place to decide whether and how compulsory voting would be implemented, with what sanctions and exceptions.",
