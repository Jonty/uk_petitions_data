            "background": "The tailback of vehicles trying to access the Tunnel cause gridlock on the Greenwich Peninsular, leading to problems for local businesses and residents as well as for tunnel users. The excuse given for the contraflow's suspension was that poor driving has made it too dangerous. Current technology is capable of recording average speeds in the Tunnels; automatic numberplate recognition means that a dedicated police presence could respond to a previous offender re-entering the tunnel approach. We ask for this technology to be implemented immediately, and morning contraflow reinstated.",
