            "background": "The import of Infectious Equine Anemia into the UK has shown that the TPA is flawed. IEA came to the UK via a dealer who imports Rumanian horses from Belgium/France. The horses  were in the UK for approx 4wks before a Coggins Test was undertaken. We were lucky that it was winter when few or no biting insects were around, this could have easily happened mid summer and a post import test would have been useless.IEA is endemic to Rumania and all horses, barring those bound for slaughter in Italy,should have a Coggins Test before leaving Rumania. Horses intended for slaughter in Italy are ending up with dealers, entering the UK via France to be sold on for the leisure market,this is how we find ourselves in the position we are in today.Any horse tested positive for IEA in the UK will be euthanised, the compensation paid to the owners is \u00a31 regardless. Under the TPA's current legislation, no horses imported from France or Ireland to the UK need ANY health checks and IEA is not the only risk. Amend the TPA so that only Racing, Breeding or Competition horses are covered. Instigate health checks on all other horses imported to the UK.",
