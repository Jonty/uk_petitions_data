Once it was gone, it would be gone and nothing more may be spent on that Election campaign.  There would be a lump sum for each party and a smaller amount per candidate fielded in the Election.  By Elections would be handled in the same way but the amount spent would be reduced.  The amounts to be allocated would require a referendum.",
