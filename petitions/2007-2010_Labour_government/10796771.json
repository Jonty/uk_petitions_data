            "background": "The current mileage allowances of 40p per mile for the first 10,000 miles and 25p per mile thereafter, have been in place for the past six years.\n\nDespite inflation going up and up, as well the cost of fuel (thanks again to taxes!) this rate has not been increased accordingly, and should be, to fairly reflect the cost of using your own vehicle for business use.\n\nAs an Accountant, many clients of ours are now questioning whether to carry on using the mileage route as it is no longer as effective at covering the cost of fuel and running of their vehicle.\n\nThis allowance needs to be increased inline with inflation, rather than staying at a rate that was fair six years ago.\n\nThis subject should be brought to the attention of the government to assist the self employed in this current econonmical climate.",
