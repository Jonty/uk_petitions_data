            "background": "We would like to petition against the sentence imposed on the two teenage boys in Dorset who brutally murdered an innocent fawn in June 2009. Although they were found guilty of killing the fawn, they received a mere 100 hours community service, fined \u00a31000 and given 12 month community rehabilitation orders. Animal campaigners called the sentence pathetic. It is not a severe enough punishment for two boys who knew what they were doing, being aged 17. The fawn would have suffered a cruel and long death and these young boys need to be punished. This is not an adequate punishment and shows that this behaviour is acceptable. Their sentences should be increased!",
