            "background": "Around 10% (1 in 10) people have dyslexic tendencies (4% severe and 6% mild to moderate). It affects all backgrounds and abilities, from people with literacy difficulties to people with advanced doctorate degrees. Most people associate dyslexia with reading and spelling difficulties, but it also includes poor short term memory, coordination, fine motor skills, balance, and math. I suffer from dyslexia and wasn't diagnosed until I was 20! It can make a big difference if picked up between the ages of 4-7. That is why I want EVERY child to be tested when they begin school, so they can have a happy school life and not have to worry about being \"stupid\". I don't want other children to suffer in silence like I did. All children have the right to an education and to learn so why is it children are still missing out because learning difficulties are not being picked up when they should be? People with Dyslexia are far from stupid and it's about time they were able to say that to themselves!",
