            "background": "Any market leads to big winners and big losers. Higher fees will only deter the lower socioeconomic classes from entering into Higher Education, as students will become consumers and effectively judged not by their academic ability but by their ability to pay. The more established institutions will become better off and the less established worse off - extending the gap between the richest and the poorest Universities. We, the students at the University of Leicester, say no to any further attempt to lift the cap on tuition fees.",
