        "background": "With the press consistently reporting on the thousands (estimates in the region of 70,000) of students who are yet to receive any financial support from the Student Loans Company (SLC) and with recent reports of 43 universities paying out increased volumes of hardship funds (an average of \u00a344,000) due to the failure of the loans system, the dismissal of the CE is long overdue.\n\nRalph Seymour-Jackson has not only presided over a system that has failed with such magnitude and brought distress to many young people embarking on new chapters in their lives, but also what simply amounts to a supreme embarrassment of our much credited and world-class higher education system.\n\nIt is time for him to exit with immediate effect.",
