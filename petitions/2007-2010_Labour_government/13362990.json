            "background": "The City Council and Nottingahm Forest FC have conjured up a plan to build a massive football stadium on green belt land in the beautiful suburbs of Nottinghamshire. The current transport facilities are limited if not poor and there are virtually no facilities for the fans to congregate at.  Add to this the fact that the current road network in the area is already congested, this seems like poorly concived idea and  one destined for failure.",
