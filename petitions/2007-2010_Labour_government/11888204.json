        "background": "Taxi cab drivers leave the engine on whilst waiting to pick up customers, solely to keep the meter running. This is a pointless exercise, wasting fuel and increase carbon emissions. A taxi waiting at a pick up point for 5 minutes seems like negligible, but when you consider the taxi is a major means of night time means of transport in a built up area. Five plus minutes multiplied by the number of taxis waiting at an time in a built up area multiplied by the number of built up areas in the country and the sum total of \u2018tick over\u2019 minutes quickly escalates to the extreme.\nA simple system of a \u2018waiting\u2019 button would mean the engine could be switched off and waiting time still recorded. As many companies already employ a system where there vehicles\u2019 engines turn off at lights this is not a ridiculous scheme and would greatly benefit the cause of lowering carbon emissions.",
