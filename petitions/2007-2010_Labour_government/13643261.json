        "background": "The current very high levels of national debt are largely because of greed and incompitence within the finacial industry.  The governmnent have effectly converted this private debt into public debt and consequently all the major political parties are calling massive cuts in public services and spending. This is occuring at a time when a number of those financial institutions are making huge profits again.\nThis petition calls for the private financial industry to pay off the national debt and for the government to rigorously enforce this with no chance of 'mitigating' any of the money given to the banks.",
