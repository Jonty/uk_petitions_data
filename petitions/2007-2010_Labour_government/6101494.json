        "background": "The treatment of the brave men of the Gurkha regiments and their families by this Country's Government has long been a source of shame and disdain for many British people. We ask that the Government grants any Gurkha past, present or future willing to risk their life for this country the right to British Citizenship for themselves, their families and a full army pension. \nFor too long this nation has neglected men whose statue in Westminster says 'never had country more faithful friends\nthan you.'. They fought for us we should fight for them.",
