        "background": "In light of the most recent Mini-Budget to help the uk out of a recession, VAT has been cut, This cut is unlikely to reach us the consumer due to the costs of mass re-pricing, Duty is up on alcohol and tobacco to offset the vat cut but the motorist is hit the hardest with 2p on a litre of fuel, this is unacceptable and is a back handed way to tax us more without choice",
