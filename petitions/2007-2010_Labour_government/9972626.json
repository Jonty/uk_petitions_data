            "background": "Godshill high street on the Isle of Wight, currently has a 30mph speed limit (which is NOT enforced), but when you walk along the high street you have to walk in the road as it only has a few bits of pavements (you have to walk around corners of old buildings and the cars cannot see you). Godshill is a very popular tourist attraction, you get hundreds of visitors to godshill a day (in season).\nI have been told by the local council that the people slow the traffic down, (but why should we!!) and that someone would have to DIE on the road to get the speed limit reduced!!",
