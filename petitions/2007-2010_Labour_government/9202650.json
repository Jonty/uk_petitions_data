He is, however, for all practical purposes, invisible. What is wrong with the man? He appears to have no policies, no purpose, and no objectives, beyond clinging to his position for its own sake. On every issue, his dithering  and general indecisiveness brings our nation into disrepute. He is, in short, a \"waste of space\". He should step aside, NOW, to make way for someone who has a clue about what being Prime Minister is about.",
