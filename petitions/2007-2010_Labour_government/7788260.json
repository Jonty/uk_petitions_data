            "background": "Still in todays society throughout the armed forces, men and women that live in single accomodation are treated worse than convicts, and people that live in married quaters. Many of the accomodation blocks are falling apart, too small to accomodate us and our personnel items and have faulty heating and electrics. I feel it is about time that single people in the forces were paid more attention when it comes to our living accomodation and not discriminated against. We also loose out when it comes to moving to a new camp as being single we dont get the same service or disturbance allowance as married couples do, yet have the same trauma of moving everything. It should be the same for everyone no matter what.",
