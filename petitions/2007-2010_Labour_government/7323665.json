            "background": "The major Pub Cos were investigated by the Office of Fair Trading in 2004/05 resulting in Enterprise Inns and Punch Taverns being given some guidelines to follow. It would appear that they are failing to do this and continue to bully their lessees into whichever situation suits the Pub Co. This needs re-examining. Mr Brown has kindly forwarded my case to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform however I am not alone in this as there are many lessees in a similiar predicament. So therefore I would be very grateful if the Prime Minister would look at this again.",
