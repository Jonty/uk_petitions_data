            "background": "This petition has been set up by myself as a resident of Gosport unlike those who have come up with this proposal. The BRT will run from Holbrook to Redlands Lane in Fareham offering no benefit to those wanting transport to and from Fareham Train Station or Gosport Ferry. The transport issues we have in this area are not not going to be solved by this scheme. \nThis opposition is to save our wildlife and their habitats from the diggers. To ensure the safety and security of the homes that run along the proposed route and to stop this pointless scheme.",
