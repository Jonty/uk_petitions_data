            "background": "It is a fact that 1 in 5 people have participated in sexual activity on board an aircraft, the majority of these people are passengers, but also include cabin crew and pilots.  With lower air pressure on planes, people's inhibitions tend to be lowered, resulting in joining the \"Mile High Club.\"  Unfortunately these people risk losing their jobs and/or being prosecuted by over-zealous airlines for taking part in such activities.  As sex and sexual attraction is perfectly natural and most encounters take place in the confines of aircraft lavatories away from view, we believe that all adults, whether gay, bi, straight, passengers or crew, should not be subject to prosecution by airlines when engaging in sexual activity on an aircraft.",
