        "background": "Some 12,500 HM Revenue & Customs jobs have been cut since it was created by the merger of the Inland Revenue and Revenue & Customs. A further 12,500 jobs are now at risk for 2008-11. This has already had a serious impact on service to taxpayers and their agents, and the loss of experienced staff has surely contributed to the high-profile mistakes made by the department recently. The priority now must be to restore morale in the department and the level of service it provides.",
