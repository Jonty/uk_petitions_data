        "background": "Road tax should be charged at the forecourt thus removing the need to purchase a tax disc and eliminating the complex taxing systems that is becoming more of a complicated stealth tax on the honest road users. It would be simple. The bigger your engine, the more petrol you buy, the more tax you pay. And there's no way to avoid it, no deadlines, and no SORN. The need to prove insurance could easily be added to the MOT certifcate or the insurance cert could be displayed in place of the Tax Disc. As a bonus, foreign drivers would have to pay to use our roads.",
