            "background": "All these funds should be invested in a more secure type of fund e.g. Government bonds. The Council tax payers should have been consulted of where the investments were going to be deposited and what were the implications or the risks. Furthermore I believe the amount of funds that are invested should be made more available to the Council tax payers so there is more transparencies to determine whether the usage of such funds are being used correctly and allocated to some of the infrastructure or projects E.G. Potholes or pavements, which always seem to be on the backbench.",
