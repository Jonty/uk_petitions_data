The government go on about everyone who matters, what happened about the every Child Matters campaign. If you look around you, do you see the help and support that you would expect if you have a disabled child or children, NO there is nothing, it's not anywhere.  People have been disabled a lot longer than my son who is 4 years old.  \n\nWE NEED  THEM TO LISTEN NOW, ANY PARENT WHO HAS A DISABLED CHILD OR CHILDREN, OR AN ADULT WHO IS IN THE SAME POSITION MIGHT NOT KNOW WHERE TO LOOK.  WE NEED  MORE ADVERTISING, MORE AWARENESS AND THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ACT NOW BEFORE WE GET LOST IN THE SYSTEM\".  \n\nWhy should we have to fight for our childrens future.",
