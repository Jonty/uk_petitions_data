This may leap foreward our knowledge of the universe and create benefits for mankind or, as some scientists believe, end in catastrophe for life. Such Risks should not be left to the scientists' thirst for knowledge. Scientists make mistakes in their methodology and criteria. There should be much wider debate that the citizen is aware of the risks and be able to effect whether they should be taken. This is not the equivalent of the Luddite destruction of the Spinning Jenny. Scientists such as those at C.E.R.N. are searching for knowledge that they do not have. What if the results are not as they expect?",
