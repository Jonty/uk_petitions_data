            "background": "Prof. Nutt has been sacked for essentially doing his job. As the UK's chief drug advisor, his recent statements as to the reclassification of cannabis and other drugs in relation to alcohol and tobacco may have run contrary to government opinion, but comes from a base of some expertise (hence his appointment). Surely the job of any advisor to the UK government is to offer their expert opinions and not just to agree with the government, otherwise the whole point of having advisors and advisory commissions is, well, pointless and ministers may as well stand in front of a mirror and ask themselves the questions. This is not a question concerning the legalization of cannabis - or any drug, for that matter - but rather the devaluing of scientific evidence and opinion, and the stifling of dissenting voices.",
