        "action": "scrap the present system of funding of the Lee Valley Regional Park which requires an annual levy of \u00a312 million from council tax payers across Greater London, Essex and Hertfordshire and replace with a direct and self sufficient method of funding.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Lee Valley Regional Park Authority was founded in 1966 and is funded by contributions from all Greater London Councils, Essex and Hertfordshire. For example Havering pay a levy of \u00a3270,000, Barnet \u00a3415,000, Ealing \u00a3385,000 while Essex pay \u00a31.56m and Hertfordshire \u00a31.34m. Whilst valuing this open space, it is time to remove this financial burden from the vast majority of councils to which it has no direct relevance.\n\nThe current system should be scrapped and replaced with a direct and self sufficient source of funding on the following grounds:\n\na) By its geographical location the Lee Valley Regional Park has no relevance to the majority of council tax payers who provide the funding.\n\nb) The Lee Valley Regional Park Authority will become responsible for the 2012 Olympic sites after the Games. It is important that the levy is not used as a trojan horse to increase contributions to meet any Olympic overspends and ongoing liabilities. This is particularly relevant for the council tax payers of Greater London who are already making a \u00a3625million contribution to the Games.",
