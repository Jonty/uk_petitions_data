            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "TUPE (Transfer of Undertaking of Protected Employment) is a nasty piece of Tory legislation that allows an employer to outsource their redundancies.   When a person has been selected for TUPE they are not allowed to defend themselves and even saying \"I do not wish to be transferred to a different company\" is legally interpretted to say \"I resign\".   \n\nThe legislation is being used by offfshore outsourcing companies to buy your job, you have to train your replacement and then they make you redundant costing the State money; it happened to me and it is a vile experience.   I believe that an employee should be able to defend themself against this draconian legislation and that the legislation should be modified so that offshore companies outside of the EU should be banned from using the legislation to act as a proxy redundancy solution for companies.  If a job really does need to be transferred outside the EU and an amployee is mnade redundant, the outsourcing company should be forecd to pay the State all the costs of unemployment benefits etc;why should the State contribute to the profit of the outsourcing company?",
