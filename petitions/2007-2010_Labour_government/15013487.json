            "background": "Politicians should take less notice of what PR advisors tell them, and start acting in the interests of the country. \n\nFor instance, Gordon Brown has obviously been told to smile more by his PR advisors. He should stop immediately. When he smiles, it just makes him look scary.\n\nWhat he should be doing is spending the time considering how to get our once great country out of the mess it's currently in, and not listening to image consultants. He was much more effective when he always looked worried.",
