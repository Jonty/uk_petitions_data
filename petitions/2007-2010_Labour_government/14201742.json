            "background": "The current SIA training is not enough as 'open palms' and 'switch' methods can only work so much. There are times when physical action needs to be taken for the saftey of the officer, public and the detained person. In todays current culture it is not unknown that a number of offenders are well known to carry weapons as they know that our hands are tied as we cant carry what we need to defend ourselves and others. Front line security officers/guards have as much chance of being seriously injured if not killed by an offender that they have detained.Most offenders are drug dependants who are desperate and or wanted on warrant already and do not want to be locked up.They do not think twice about pulling and using knives,blades,needles etc.By training Security Officers/guards to use and carry and batons as the police do.The security officer/guard has a better chance against the offender who is prepared to pull weapons and cause serious injury or death. At the curent time we can be arrested/charged/imprisoned for carrying batons to allow us to defend ourselves. This law needs to changed as we should be able to defend ourselves in what can only be described as a world gone mad.",
