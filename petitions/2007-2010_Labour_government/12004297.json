        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the UK sonographers do not have to be state registered, or have a regulating body.\n\nUnfortunately mistakes in sonographery are not unusual; vital things can be missed, and measurements can be incorrectly taken and recorded. Both of these can have devastating consequences such as abdomens of babies being over measured leading to stillbirth, anomalies or cancers being missed which at worst causes the loss of a life.\n\nA regulating body would be able to decide if disciplinary action is required, and if so, of what nature. It would also mean future employers would have access to a sonographers record, thus being able to see if any issues had arisen in the past.\n\nHaving a regulating body would also be beneficial to the sonongraphers. It would give them the recognition they deserve as sonographers, and would also be able to care for a sonographers rights.\n\nPlease help to change this- not only for babies- but also to protect patients in other areas sonography is used.",
