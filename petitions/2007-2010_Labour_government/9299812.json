        "background": "Gwyneth Dunwoody, Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich, and Chair of the Transport Select Committee, sadly passed away on Thursday the 17th of April following emergency heart surgery.\n\nIn the Prime Minister\u2019s own words, Ms Dunwoody was \u2018politics at its best \u2013 a great Parliamentarian\u2019.\n\nA one-women gun boat, Gwyneth's sharp tongue was infamous, thanks to gems like telling Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly \u201cI long ago gave up expecting answers from Government departments, Secretary of State, but I do occasionally like to see the questions\u201d \n\nHer vast knowledge,formidable character, and status as the longest serving female MP deserve a worthy memorial. \n \nAnd so we wish that instead of selecting a new chair to the Transport Committee, we would like to see a \u2018Deputy Chair\u2019 appointed to lead the  sessions, as Ms Dunwoody simply cannot be replaced.",
