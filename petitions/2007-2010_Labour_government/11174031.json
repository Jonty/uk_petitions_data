        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present, anyone coming to live in this country has immediate access to our medical and benefits system without having paid any National Insurance, whilst people who have paid into the system all their lives are being denied essential drugs because there is no money available. Making it a requirement that anyone moving to this country has to be able to support themselves for a minumum period of time i.e. two years and, initally, has medical insurance would ensure that the NHS and the benefit system are being used by those who have paid into the system and should result in available funds being less diluted.  This could help to avoid a top-up system whereby only those who have money can afford the expensive drugs. There would obviously be exclusions to this rule, i.e. genuine assylum seekers, people marrying into families where National Insurance is already being paid etc.",
