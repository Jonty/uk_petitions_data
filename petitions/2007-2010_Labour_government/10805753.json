            "background": "Its the oldest profession and always will be, dating as far back as biblical times.  If prostitution was legalised and kept in controlled areas, it would be safer for all concerned - primarily the working ladies.  \n\nThe government should make it a legal requirement that all working establishments would have to have special licences and be up to a minimum standard, in terms of health and safety etc.\n\nEarnings taken could then be subject to tax and NI.\n\nSurely this benefits all concerned and allows the appropriate authorities to govern it sensibly.\n\nAt the end of the day, if its an act between consenting adults, then whats the problem.  Should also help in the reduction of illegal trafficking of girls from other countries.\n\nIt is the oldest profession, always will be, will always be around.",
