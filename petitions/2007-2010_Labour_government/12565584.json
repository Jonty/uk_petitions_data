            "background": "Under my idea, if \"No Candidate\" got the most votes in a constituency, a new election would he held in that constituency, but with none of the original candidates who received more than 10% (say) of the vote allowed to stand. The remaining (\"small party\" and \"single issue\") candidates (who are an essential and colourful feature of our elections) would not have to pay another registration fee for the new election. The proposal would allow the electorate to have more control when non-local candidates are foisted upon them, as well as enfranchising many who currently feel disenfranchised by the choice of candidates available to them.",
