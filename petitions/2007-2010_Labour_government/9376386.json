            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We believe that it is a human right for a female to ask for money in exchange for any sexual service which she may see fit, and to solicit such services in any way she wants such that they do not cause nuisance or contraveen any other law or regulation. We feel that it is inhumane for women to have no say in this matter in a modern world where feminine sexuality is blatently key to every aspect of their current servitude, ie, a pretty waitress, roles which are typically focussed around the discreet marketing of their inherent sexuality. This is further antagonised by the fact that it is legal to sell ones services for sexually explicit filming involving sex, ie, porn, but not to serve directly the target audience where greatest relief and minimum frustration will result. We believe that this is critical for the full liberation of women from an inherently tyranical society and the emancipation of sexually starved men.",
