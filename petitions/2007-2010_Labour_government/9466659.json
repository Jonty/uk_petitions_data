        "background": "It was agreed earlier this year that  extra payments would be up to \u00a310k per annum per additional spouse, for multi-spouse households such as those traditionally established by some Muslims. This sum could be paid either to the individual wife or into a bank account held by the husband.  As bigamy is against the law in UK and punishable by 7 yrs imprisonment, this is totally unacceptable and does not fall in line with the Government's policy of Equal Opportunities.",
