            "background": "The education system that is currently underway in Britain is seriously lacking in supported for children gifted and talented. Just because they are labelled this, does not mean that it can be ignored and seen as an excuse to \"leave them do their own thing\". It is there for a reason! They should be praised and rewarded, encouraged for helping the country to drive forward in the 21st Century. These children are our future doctors, lawyers, mathmaticians, athletes, and many more much needed personnel! \n\nI believe I was let down as a former pupil. I was put on the G&T register, and was my education altered to suit my needs? No. It was simply there to make the school look good. However, when I was on the SEN register in Reception for Segmatic Pragmatic Disorder, everything was done to keep my education level at a constant. There is a reason to be on that register. It is not to be ignored!",
