            "background": "It seems that the nation is losing its identity particularly in terms of being a Christian country. 'Winter lights' instead of Christmas lights is just one example. There are many petitions which ask for the closure of single faith schools. Whilst faith schools can discourage integration in certain communities, Christian/Catholic schools should not be included in any consideration to ban single faith schools as they are a part of our national identity. Religious toleration is a good thing but to put other religions above our national religion is betraying our country.",
