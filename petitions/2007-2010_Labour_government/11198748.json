When fuel started to rise, Food prices did also immediately every week, But now fuel has come down the food prices have stayed the same! I know, I do the shopping.\nMr Brown why are they getting away with Ripping us off? You would be helping all families in GB, Don't you think it would be a big vote winner if you did this? I can't keep affording 72p for a loaf of bread, that only cost 39p at the start of the summer! Please help us.",
