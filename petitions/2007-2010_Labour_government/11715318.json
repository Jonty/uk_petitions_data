            "background": "While probably most people now believe in evolution, it has not been conclusively proved. There are many people who do not believe it for many sound reasons, such as incomplete fossil evidence, lack of intermediate stages and lack of vestigial organs. It has also been propagated at various times by deliberate fraud, and is routinely amended in light of new discoveries. There is no evidence AGAINST God creating animals, and those who have reached this conclusion should not be ridiculed or led to believe that their conclusion is necessarily wrong.",
