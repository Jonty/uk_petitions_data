            "background": "At a time when inflation exceeds the national target of 2%, the Bank of England is introducing quantitative easing to solve our economic situation. This is akin to pouring oil on a road in order to slow down a speeding car. Whilst the long term effect of hyper inflation will eventually resolve the economic crisis. We should at least remember the ordinary folks whose life savings will become worthless.\n\nThe savings of common people will be used to dig us out a hole created by some of the wealthiest, so the least we can do is have a national holiday to say thanks.",
