            "background": "Whilst the Government has no direct control over banks, or their lending policies, it seems both unfair and unjust that many banks and lenders do not pass on the savings on the Bank of England base rate drops.\nTherefore, we would propose that UNLESS the banks or lender commits to passing the base rate drop savings on in full to borrowers / customers, they DO NOT get the saving from the bank of England.\nThe drop in base rate is for the benefit of people with mortgages, loans and other products, not to generate additional revenue for the banks.\nIf they are not prepared to pass the savings on, then they do not deserve the reduced lower rates from the Bank of England. Simple.",
