            "background": "\"That the Secretary of State for Health respectively change the current  directive/guidance under the national framework for continuing health care section 77 to PCT\u2019s/SHA\u2019s through out England and  Wales and thereby empower/direct them to commission a direct payment by commissioning through social services for cases that are currently working well in the system with service patients/users that meet the continuing health care criteria if it is in the best interests of the patient and their well being.\u201d\n\nThat by doing so it will not contradict with other guidance and legislation. The Secretary of State for Health is empowered to do this under Section 12 of the 2006 NHS Act. It is in line with the government's  recent next stage review published by Lord Darzi in June 2007. \n\nIt will save a lot of Disabled People currently living happily on excellent care packages a lot of stress and disruption in their lives.  \n\nThat by taking away their right to a Direct Payment is a breach of their Human Rights.",
