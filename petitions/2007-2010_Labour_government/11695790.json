            "background": "I am a British SriLankan and extreamly concerned about the current crisis in SriLanka. I attended a crowded (over 200 British Tamils)parlimentary meeting on 26th Jan 2009 conducted by both the foreign secretary and the foreign minister. Both of them made me feel ashamed of being a Labour party supporter. They could not give a decent answer to a single question especially David Millband. Everyone in the room felt the same. The meeting suppose to start at 7:30pm they came at 8pm and suppose to finish at 9pm but they vanished at 8:30pm. Mr Millband stated that the Priminister is doing everything on this matter. He showed lot of incompitance, seriously lacking knowledge and evasiveness on this matter. Sir we the British SriLankan Tamils urge you to take this matter personally as we have all the confidence on you. By lifting the ban on LTTE is the only way to make the SriLankan government to rethink is war stratergy.",
