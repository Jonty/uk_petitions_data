            "background": "Paul Burrell, the former butler to Princess Diana admitted telling \"red herrings\" during the recent inquest into her death in Paris.  This inquest, conducted at vast public expense, was made a mockery by Mr Burrell with his blatant contempt for the proceedings.\n\nThe coroner presiding, Lord Justice Scott Baker, commented himself that it was \"blindingly obvious\" that Mr Burrell had lied in order to protect his brand value and commercial interests.  Without a public complaint, Mr Burrell will not be held to account for this gross disrespect of the country's legal system.\n\nI hereby submit this petition to call for Mr Gordon Brown PM to instruct the Metropolitan Police Service to extradite Mr Paul Burrell to the UK to face charges of perjury.\n\nSigned, \nJames Lavan",
