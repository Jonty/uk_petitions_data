Someone on lower income can be hit very hard indeed by the fines inmposed by even the most minor offence. If the fine to be paid (for any offence, by no means limited to driving) was set as a fixed proportion of annual income then everybody would be hit fairly in terms of the impact on their lives. For example a \u00a360 speeding fine could be imposed on someone earning the national average wage but someone earning 10x that amount should have to significnatly more, less for those earning below the national average. A deterent for all would then exist.",
