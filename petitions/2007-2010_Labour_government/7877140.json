            "background": "Thomas Deacon Academy in Peterborough, do not have a playground. Therefore, the children are not allowed out side only for their p.e lesson's which some people don't get to go outside anyway. Most of the children at the school don't think this is very fair and lots of people have asked for breaks outside. Lots of people have been suffering with headaches, and people have been catching illnesses more often, because of it being an enclosed place. I wish for the children to get a break outside, so sign my petition if you agree.",
