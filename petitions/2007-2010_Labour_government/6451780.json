        "background": "I feel that as the Royal Mail has significantly changed the way in which it prices items, and the structuring of this revenue and it is also changing its collections times from October onwards moves should be made to conserve and repair the quality of postal services in this country. This should include a reasonable cut off time for daily deliveries to households so post arrives in the morning and not far into the afternoon as it is happening in some areas. They should not also be allowed reduce collections times or locations so that the community continues to be served in the same way.",
