            "background": "There are already redundancies going on and yet the college is still going to be moved. The majority of local residents are against it. The Town council are against it but the District Council approved it . The move will put pressure on the local infrastructure. There will be reduced parking for staff and students. the current location will just be a mass of concrete housing which will not improve the area. There are no buses that will serve all students to it's current site. I could go on but there are too many reasons why the College should not move.The move is outside the original planning permission and so can only go ahead if the government approve.",
