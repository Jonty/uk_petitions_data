            "background": "Over the last 10 years, the income of the top 10% and bottom 10% of society, has increased by over 50%. But the income of the rest of us has increased by only 20%. I think the middle classes in this country are being ignored at the expense of the rich and poor extremes. I want a tax cut paid for by increasing tax on the richest who have squandered the nation's wealth on speculation. I want a tax cut paid for by reducing the benefits paid to those who do not deserve them. I'm fed up with the rich getting richer every year because they hold the purse strings, and I want it to stop now. In a democracy it's the majority who make the rules, so I suggest it's time we voted ourselves more money and showed the rich minority they cannot continue to ignore us. Money is power, but if we want to make it fairer, we can. We just have to show we won't take it anymore and vote! Let's remind the richest 10% who's really in charge.",
