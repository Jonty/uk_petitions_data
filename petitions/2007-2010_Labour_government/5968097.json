            "background": "I have heard from reliable intelligence sources that Steve McClaren is proliferating WMD. I believe that this (coupled with the fact that under his management England have been playing utter garbage) is enough to justify regime-change. Furthermore, I propose that the political vacuum be filled by the one and only Kevin Keegan.\n\nA return to attacking football with 4-3 scorelines and rants with big hair, tracksuits and headphones is preferable to losing to \"minnow\" teams comparable to Birmingham City.\n\nI don't think we should go via the UN, because they will faff about for ages and we need to get McClaren out before the match against the Germans on August 22nd. NATIONAL PRIDE IS AT STAKE! \n\nBring back Robbie Fowler as well",
