            "background": "At present whether an alleged speeding offender is offered a speed awareness course instead of a fixed penalty ticket is at the discretion of the local police force. It should be mandatory for all forces to offer this training in lieu of a fine/penalty points, courses should be available reasonably near to the alleged offenders home rather than in the area where the offence was allegedly committed and the costs of the courses should be limited to a maximum of the alternative fine on the FPT. \n\nThe Government could thereby justify its claim that speed cameras are used in the interest of road safety rather than revenue generation.",
