            "background": "This Petition is to legalise the use of Cannabis in a controlled way. My recommendation would be to open a drop in centre, where this substance is made available and consumed on the premises at a fixed price and where it is exempt from inflation and further price ammendments. This would see a major reduction in crime as it would force illegal suppliers out of business and make it possible for an effective monitoring system to be put in to affect to stop consumers abusing this facility. My other recommendation would be to introduce and enforce no tolerance laws. This would prohibit the possesion of this substance in a public place and in their own home. So this would provide the consumer a safe and stable environment for the substance to be consumed.",
