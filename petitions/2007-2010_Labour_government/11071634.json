            "background": "Many people feel the collection of tolls at Dartford is a major >cause< of congestion and justifying the continued* charge as a way to reduce congestion is dishonest spin used to disguise yet another stealth tax.\n\nWe petition the prime minister to publically support a plan to allow a decision to be made on data rather than conjecture by suspending tolls for six months and allowing an independent body to study and report on the effects on congestion. \n\n(*) The Dartford crossing toll was introduced in 1963 to pay for the costs of the crossing. These costs were paid off in 2002 and the legal authority to charge a toll expired in April 2003. The Government has continued the toll under justifying it as a congestion charge.",
