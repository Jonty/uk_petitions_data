            "background": "The so-called % the non-resident parent pays in maintenance is 15%,BUT they then are entitled to reductions if they have their child a 52n per annum. Yet the resident parent if working, is expected to use their entire monthly wage on keeping.I think that the amount of council tax a lone parent should have to pay should be 50% or less.Why do students pay nothing yet those of us who work pay 75% and that is a struggle.If you were to set the limits of maintenance to 15% with no scope for reductions then this would mean that the resident parent might not have to try and claim assistance from government funding to try and keep their roof over their heads.It seems the non-resident parent has it too easy.If all the resident parent paid out of their wage was 15% of it towards keeping the child warm, safe, fed and clothed then the world would be a financially better place, but as it stands the resident parent who does all the work, puts in all the hours is the one that is struggling whilst these non-resident parents are laughing all the way to the bank.This has to be addressed!!!",
