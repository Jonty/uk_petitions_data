This meant that the packaging used was far greater, the resources to deliver are far greater, which in this day and age leads to over flowing bins and streched recyling plants and a depletion of world resorces. The example above seems to be part of a growing trend which puts the resposibilty on to the ordinary consumer rather that the people that gererate the waste problem in the first instance. I would like this be be switched back to the originator, I am sure that with a few checks and balences and some sensible thinking much of the waste could be avoided at source.",
