            "background": "Husbands with multiple wives have been given the go-ahead to claim extra welfare benefits following a year-long Government review.\nEven though bigamy is a crime in Britain, the decision by ministers means that polygamous marriages can now be recognised formally by the state, so long as the weddings took place in countries where the arrangement is legal.\n\nThe outcome will chiefly benefit Muslim men with more than one wife, as is permitted under Islamic law. \n\nNew guidelines on income support from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) state: \"Where there is a valid polygamous marriage the claimant and one spouse will be paid the couple rate ... The amount payable for each additional spouse is presently \u00a333.65.\"\n\nIncome support for all of the wives may be paid directly into the husband's bank account, if the family so choose. Under the deal agreed by ministers, a husband with multiple wives may also be eligible for additional housing benefit and council tax benefit to reflect the larger property needed for his family.",
