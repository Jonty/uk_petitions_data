        "background": "Health officials, social workers, police investigations all played a vital role in the death of 'Baby P'. The same authorities failed in the case of Victoria Climbie who died on 25th February 2000. Recommended changes to how that case was handled should have ended the torture and prevented the death of 'Baby P'. If officials felt they would be held accountable, maybe they would react differently when confronted with a child that has extensive injuries, regular bruising and repeated hospital visits.",
