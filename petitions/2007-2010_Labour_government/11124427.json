However, the colonization is still viewed as \"not bad\".\n\nIt seems as the country becomes stronger and stronger, it is becoming fashionable to colonize/conquer a weaker country either in the name of \u201cdemocracy\u201d or \u201ccivilization\u201d.\n\n\"Sun Never sets on the British Empire\" becoming a goal of some stronger countries, except they would like to replace British by their country's name.\n\nIs communist colonization of Tibet any worse or different than the colonization by Europeans?  They all want to be like \"Churchill\"!  Fight in the name of \"Freedom\", while subjugating millions to harsh treatments and forcibly ruling them.\n\nWe should make \"colonization\" a taboo and illegal, just like the slavery.",
