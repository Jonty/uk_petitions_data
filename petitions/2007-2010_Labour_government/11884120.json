            "background": "In several other countries it is the law that drivers must STOP and GIVE WAY (yield) to emergency vehicles employing blue lights and sirens whilst in this country it is not.\n\nIt is time that the law was changed to state that you must STOP and give way. This would do several things\n\n1 Enable emergency vehicles to safely get to an incident quicker\n\n2 Due to a quicker response save more lives\n\n3 Lessen or even end RTC's between emergency vehicles on blue lights and other road users\n\n4 By lessening or ending RTC's reduce the costs involved in repairing vehicles and hence free up more funds for providing the service",
