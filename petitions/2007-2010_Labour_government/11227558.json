        "background": "If the Government buys all repo houses this gives direct help to the voters that need it. They don't need to move out or loose their homes (they effectively become council houses with council tennants). The local council don't have to re-house those repossessed. AND the government no longer needs to support the banks, so can sevearly reduce their financial commitment/risk to the banks by far more than the cost of buying all that housing stock. A WIN WIN solution.",
