        "background": "Jersey is one of the tax havens that have become the legal pirate coves of the 21st century. The Tax Justice Network estimates the UK loses about \u00a318bn a year in tax revenue due to \"corporate tax efficiency\" i.e. companies moving offshore. The Iraq war cost at least \u00a38bn. So war with Jersey would not only be morally right but self-financing too. In fact we could probably do a bond issue for the invasion to pay for everything up front with the promise of a steady yearly return for investors.",
