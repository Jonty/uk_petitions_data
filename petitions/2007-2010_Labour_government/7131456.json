            "background": "the BBC wastes license fee money on paying ridiculously high salaries to many of it's \"faces\" who present TV programmes and radio shows. This money SHOULD be spent producing new viewing/listening which would help to reduce the amount of duplicated junk TV and repeats. The money saved from not paying huge sums to \"celebrities\" would also enable the BBC to provide all it's channels for free (eg High Definition) and could be used to bid for sporting events that can only be viewed on subscription or commercial channels.  Bear in mind that our license fee money is used to promote these people as celebrities and gives them a platform to earn equally high sums on commercial TV, advertising \"voice overs\", endorsements etc.",
