            "background": "We the british public should support our Prime Minister, the events of the last year have not been his fault. It was unfortunate that he came to power when so much was about to go wrong. The British people don't know who to trust and it would quite frankly be dangerous to have a general election at a time when people are misinformed and easily led. When Gordon Brown was Chancellor we all listened, it is a shame that attempts to make him more 'user friendly' have actually possibly alienated a lot of people. Nobody else would be able to carry the country through these times, the problem is a lot bigger than who his leading the Government. I am in full support of the Prime Minister & am angered by peoples lack of faith.",
