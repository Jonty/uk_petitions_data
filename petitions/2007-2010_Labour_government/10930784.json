        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As a qualified teacher of more than 30 years\u2019 experience, I see children being loaded down more and more with multiple subjects of homework every night of the week and weekends. I am very concerned about the effect it has on them.\n\nAt the end of the school day, children should pursue other interests;  Brownies, Cubs, Guides, Scouts, learning an instrument, sports, voluntary work, youth clubs, gardening etc. Those with talents need time to hone these lifetime skills.\n\nTime spent with family is limited enough as it is.  Time together to sit down for a family meal once a day used to be the norm. Now if they can have one meal a week sitting together around a table, they are doing well and homework is a major divisive factor in family evening life.\n\nThe musicians, writers, artists etc of our future should be learning these skills in their spare time. Excessive homework as a concept is out-dated, unnecessary and the last resort of teachers who fail to cover the curriculum in class time.\n \nWe urge you to have OFSTED examine the practice urgently.",
