            "background": "A judge has been accused of giving paedophiles a licence to offend after he refused to send a serial child sex attacker to jail.  Michael Porter, 38, used his trusted position as a ministerial servant in the Jehovah's Witnesses to prey on young boys in Clevedon, Somerset, over a 14-year period. One of his victims was an 18-month-old baby, the court heard.\nPorter, of Okehampton Close, north London, pleaded guilty to 25 counts of indecent assault and gross indecency on boys and young adults at Bristol Crown Court.\nBut Judge Tom Crowther opted not to jail him and handed him a three-year community rehabilitation order after hearing he had undergone therapy. He was also given credit for his guilty plea.  The sentence provoked a furious reaction from victims' groups and the defendant's own sister, who branded the judge a soft touch.",
