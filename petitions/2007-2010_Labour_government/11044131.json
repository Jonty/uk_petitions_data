            "background": "The new rules for overseas students and staff threaten university autonomy and breach human rights legislationThese rules would require Universities to report to the Border Agency anyabsencesfromlectures and seminars or any failure to submit any assessment on time.In other words the University is being asked to act as an Immigration Officer to the students.These requirements gofar beyond the present monitoring of student progress systems in Universities which has as itspurpose assisting students to reach their full potentialIt is hard to justify such detailed monitoring of overseas studentsSurely the Border Agency just needs to know students have registered and are at the University This police-like surveillance is not the function of universities and alters the educational relationship between students and their teachers in a very harmful manner.University staff are there to help the students develop intellectually and not to be a means of sanctioning them Trust between students and staff is essential to the relationshipThey representa breach of Articles 8 and Article 3of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998\nIan Grigg-Spall",
