        "action": "conduct an audit of timesheet signing to coincide with government offers of a three-year pay deal to nurses/NHS workers",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Patients often complain of being left - one of the main reason is that nurses :\n\na) are looking for equipment\nb) are being exchanged on different wards\nc) are looking for someone to sign their timesheets\nd) suspended unfairly\n\nIn accordance with research projects to cut down wastage of junior staff time, the petitioner is calling on the govt. to examine who signs timesheets and pay mechanisms.\n\nThat the proposed deal will give over a million staff an increase of 2.75% in the first year, from this month, followed by further increases of 2.4% in 2009/10 and 2.25% in 2010/11 is of course great, but what in practice, many workers are pay either late, or not at all, incurring substantial bank charges. Health Secretary Alan Johnson said a multi-year deal ensured security for staff and stability for the NHS - but more could be done which allows experienced midwives to enjoy the earnings potential of over \u00a332,000, 28% more than a decade ago and allows them to plan for their future and the future of their families.",
