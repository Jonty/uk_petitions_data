            "background": "The lack of available parking for two wheel transport is a blatant statement by central government & their councils that there is no genuine interest in any congestion reducing or green environment schemes.\n\n\n\nThis is a \u2018green\u2019 petition to introduce free & plentiful two wheel vehicle parking in all congestion chargeable zones.\n\n\nTHIS PETITION SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT A PERSONAL DESIRE TO GET PARKING AVAILABLE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL (however, such a scheme would be most logical and humanitarian). THIS PETITION IS ABOUT CREATING A FUNDAMENTAL GROUNDWORK INITIATIVE TO REDUCE CONGESTION AND PROPERLY ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.\n\n\n\nLondon\u2019s public transport system is currently dangerously over subscribed without sight of future solutions. This petition requests the sensible encouragement of alternative 'greener' forms of transport such as two wheel vehicles should be encouraged.\n\nCurrently there is little incentive to encourage commuters to travel into London on two wheels. Parking is too expensive to justify the additional road accident risk.\n\nTwo wheel vehicles include motorbikes & bicycles.",
