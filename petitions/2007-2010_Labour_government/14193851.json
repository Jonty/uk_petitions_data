            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Department of Health (DoH) is actively recruiting doctors from non European Union countries under Medical Training Initiative (MTI). These doctors are promised training posts during the recruitment process, which not uncommonly, happen in their native countries. These doctors come here only to be used and rather unfortunately, abused to fill in service gaps in NHS. There is no career progress for these doctors who are dumped after a couple of years in NHS. Over the years, International Medical Graduates (IMGs) have contributed immensely to the successful running of NHS. In fact, the NHS of today will not be a possibilty without the IMGs contribution over the years. Hence we propose that the best way forward is to limit the entry of IMGs into the United Kingdom. But once given an oppurtunity to work in the NHS they should be treated on par with the local and European Union graduates. This way the NHS can make use of their services and in return train them to be competent in their chosen speciality. \nEND of content",
