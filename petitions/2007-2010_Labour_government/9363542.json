            "background": "The oil and petrol production companies MUST show a price they pay for Oil in British Pounds and not in US Dollars. \n\nAs the price of the Dollar has drasticaly fallen against the Pound, the increase in oil price is not really influencing how much companies like BP and Shell are really paying for Oil. \n\nAs we pay for petrol in Pounds, that is the currency they should use in all the pricing they give us.\n\nFor example:\n\nAllowing for the Dollar fluctuation against the Pound any increase in Oil price would be ofset by the strength of the Pound.\n\n$100 per barrel roughly = \u00a350 per barrel. Which is not that much different from what they payed in the previous years.",
