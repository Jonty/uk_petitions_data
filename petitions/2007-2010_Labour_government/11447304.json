            "background": "The process is deeply flawed and is not being applied consistently in all authorities resulting in staff taking pay cuts in excess of \u00a311,000 per annum.  We believe the process and its results are immoral, unethical, totally unjustified and provide no protection to staff.\nThe 1997 Single Status agreement called for pay and grading reviews to be implemented in local government in order to provide a fair and equal pay and reward system for all employees. In practice, this has led to huge wage cuts, distressed staff, low morale and reduced quality of services. Single Status has caused many more problems than it has resolved, and the trade unions that are meant to be protecting the rights of their members have so far failed to act effectively. Many authorities have been conducting the implementation of Single Status as a means of reducing their costs. It has not therefore been conducted in the spirit that was intended. This petition calls for the immediate total abolition of the current process and for the setting up of a national body to carry out an independent review across the UK.",
