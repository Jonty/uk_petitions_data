            "background": "Flechettes were first used as an air-dropped weapon in World War I by combatants on both sides. These were about four inches long (10 cm) and weighed a couple of ounces (60 g). \nThe use of artillery flechette rounds in populated areas has recently been criticized due to their use by the Israel Defense Forces in the Gaza Strip. These criticisms focus on the wide area of effect of artillery flechette rounds, and their use in areas with large civilian populations. Detractors argue that the such use of the rounds conflicts with the Fourth Geneva Convention provisions protecting non-combatants.\n10 civilians have been killed in the Gaza Strip by flechette shells since the start of the Palestinian intifada, in September 2000. The flechette is in use by NATO countries for use by its forces.\nThey are inaccurate and indiscriminate and should be banned",
