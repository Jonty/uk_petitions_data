            "background": "This petition is to stop Wiltshire Council building 3,000 homes on Swindon's western border under Regional Spatial Strategy proposals.\n\nIf this expansion were to happen then Swindon, Cricklade and Purton would almost become one and there would be disputes on where Swindon ends and where Cricklade and Purton starts.\n\nWith so MANY more people Swindon will almost definitely come to a big stand still and the town will not be able to cope. Swindon town centre is too small for this expansion.\n\nWildlife would be ruined in the process.",
