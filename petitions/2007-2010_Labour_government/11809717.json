For each advert they show, they obviously gain more money. however, there comes a point where the amount of adverts shown makes the programming unbearably interrupted, and causes frustration and annoyance to all the viewers watching. This petition is to get the Prime Minister to pass a law lowering the amount of time during a program that adverts may show.",
