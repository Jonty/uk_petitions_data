            "background": "It has come to our attention that there are plans to have the famous \"Bristol Hip\" removed and destroyed. As of yet, planning permission has not been granted. Bristol hip is a concrete structure consisting of two flat banks at a 90 degree angle from one another with a rail on top. It doesn't sound like much, but infact this spot is one of the UK's most respected and well known for bmxing, rollerblading and skateboarding. It would be a crying shame to have the \"Bristol Hip\" removed forever.",
