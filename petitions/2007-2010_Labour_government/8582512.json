            "background": "As a business seller on eBay, we are most concerned that the new rule changes on eBay will put us at the mercy of dishonest \"buyers\" and will leave us nowhere to go in the event that we are ripped off.\nPaypal's business model is bordering on a scam. Sellers pay fees for using their near monopoly of a service yet are subjected to bias on a scale that cannot be comprehended. Paypal offer a dispute process for buyers to go if they are unhappy with a purchase. The problem is that Paypal always side with the buyer and do not even provide an explanation as to how the decision was reached. They are unnaccountable. To make matters even worse, eBay are even considering making Paypal mandatory for certain transactions.",
