            "background": "All too often am I on a bus and hear people on there blaring music out (usually on phones) without any regard for others.\n\nHeadphones are rarely used and most the time it is music with strong language, this is always happening on bus trips and those doing it are rarely bothered about the fact of their being elderly people who are intimidated more so and younger people including toddlers on the bus.\n\nPeople on the bus and the drivers never stand-up to those who do this, which is quite understandable with the fears of getting beaten up or stabbed in the modern day but a rule should be made that is clear and will stop the majority.\n\nI, the writer of this petition, am a 16 year old who uses 2-3 buses a day and I'm extremely annoyed about this, you get people (usually around 13-28) doing this and you can't stand up to them with fear of getting attacked.\n\nThis is clearly the case on trains too from many I have spoken to, therefore...\n\nI and I'm sure many others will believe that a ban is somewhat required on \"the use of audio playback devices on public bus and train services (when they are not used with headphones)..\"",
