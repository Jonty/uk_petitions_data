            "background": "The law should be changed to give police powers to seize equipment causing noise in unsociable hours. I believe that a time frame should be setup, in the hours of which any reports of excessive noise should be responded to by the police. If the noise is still an issue when they arrive then the offending equipment should be confiscated and the property owner fined. Repeat offenders should have stronger punishments. \nNeighbour noise can be torture in more than the obvious way, anxiety and stress can be a direct result of neighbours being constantly anti-social.",
