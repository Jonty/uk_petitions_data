        "background": "Get rid of Boris Johnson before he makes a complete joke of our Great Country around the world.\nHe has been a complete embarrassment to this Great Capital/Country of ours and will continue to be so as long as nobody does anything about it. He was a complete disgrace with his crumpled suite and his hands in his pockets for the closing ceremony in China and nobody can work with him as Mayor of London. He might save money by cancelling all the good things that have been done in the past and not having to pay all the staff that are leaving his office, but he will ruin London and make London/ Britain a laughing stock around the World especially in 2012. Please don't let him still be in office for our, the peoples Olympics.\nSo could you please start the quest going by signing this petition.",
