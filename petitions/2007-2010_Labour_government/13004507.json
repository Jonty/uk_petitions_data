            "background": "West Midlands Police are 1 of only 2 forces, out of 43 in England and Wales NOT to supply their front line, foot patrol officers, with stab vests. These front line officers are Police Community Support Officers - the ones that patrol your streets day and night and talk to people acting suspiciously. The Police may say it is NOT a confrontational role, but of course it is...we issue Fixed Penalty Notices, tackle Anti Social Behaviour and in some forces detain. Simply approaching a group of youths, asking for a name can turn in to confrontation. PCSO's aren't asking for the power of arrest as we are aware we haven't applied for the role of an actual Police Officer...we are simply asking for protection from the members of the public that could one day attack or kill a PCSO. Why shouldn't measures be in place to avoid this? Why leave it until an officer is stabbed before stab vests are issued? There are no excuses. Prime Minister, please task the correct Minister to introduce this.",
