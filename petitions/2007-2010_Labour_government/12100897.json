The NHS where budgets are a higher priority that a human life. The constant meddling in our childrens education has created a generation of children who are leaving school without a basic education. Future poverty by increased taxes as our country sinks deeper into debt. Our ecomony that was never in safe hands.  No control for the masses of illegal immigrates coming into this county and many who are working illegally.  Our service men and women fighting a war with inadequate equipment.  The Governments complete lack of respect towards taxpayers money.",
