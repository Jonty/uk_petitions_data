            "background": "Rather than use funds to shore up banks, why not use the money to clear down mortgages upto the value of \u00a3150k per household.\nThe banks still get their cash, they reduce their loan book at the same time, thus reducing their own borrowings and exposure.\nMeanwhile, the great british public have a resurgence of confidence, elimination of negative equity and start spending again - thus creating demand and jobs.\nIf there is a shortfall, the government could collect this by revaluing VAT or other measure.",
