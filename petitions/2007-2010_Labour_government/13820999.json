        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Apprenticeships are designed to support the acquisition of skills and knowledge in the workplace. They are based around vocational qualifications and are designed for young people and adults who have chosen to follow a non-academic route into further education and training. From September 2010, such schemes will include Functional maths and English qualifications, which are formal qualifications that need to be taught away from the workplace, and which are assessed by tests in exam conditions. There are no exemptions from these tests. This will result in a system where \u201cacademic\u201d learners can take A\u2019 levels and degrees without having to achieve either GCSEs or Functional Skills in maths and English, whereas a young person who chooses a vocational route (because they do not want to take more academic exams) is faced with 3 hour long tests at a level which, in the vast majority of cases, their employers do not require. Functional Skills will both reduce the achievement rate for apprenticeships, and will act as a barrier to learners taking up apprenticeships. It will result in an unfair system, heavily biased against vocational, workplace learning.",
