            "background": "I believe that the Prime Minister should attack the clubs and pubs which sell alcahol to both uner age drinkers and those at various levels of intoxication.   It appears that since local councils have taken over issuing licences for pubs and clubs nothing has been done to warn the licence holder, take them to court and remove their licence.   As an ex publican I had this drummed in to me when I received my licence in court and was told that any infringement of the law would result in my licence, and livelihood being taken away.\nSurely this should happen now and remove the pressure from the police and hospitals caring for drunks and why should these people have to stand the abuse and threats from a drunken minority.   Retail outlets who supply under age, either used by purchaser or passed on to the younfer generation should be stopped from reatiling alcahol.\nLikewise parents of under age drinker should be held responsible for their childrens actions and fined accordingly",
