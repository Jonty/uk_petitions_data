            "background": "It has been reported that political parties within Northern Ireland are planning to hold a protest against a parade to be held within Belfast city centre, by the returning Royal Irish soldiers. How can a party holding a government office within any country be allowed to openly insult those who serve and protect that country!? How can that country ignore such actions!? Such an act of open defiance undermines the authority and ability of that country to govern and should not be allowed to occur! Can a country truly govern with political representatives whose objective appears to be to undermine their own forces. We want the right to be able to openly support our troops without opposition from government officials.",
