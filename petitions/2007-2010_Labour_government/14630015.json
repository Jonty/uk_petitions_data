            "background": "One of the greatest factors in the rise in number of obese children is not necessarily a change in diet, but instead their increasing sedentary lifestyle, with many spending over 25 hours a week on the computer or watching television. According to research done by the parliamentary office of science and technology 15% of 15 year olds are obese, this is compared to 0.6% of boys and 1.3% of girls in 1984. It has been shown that if a child is obese by the time they are 15, they are 80% more likely to become overweight adults. With Britain in the midst of an obesity epidemic, it is time to combat the problem with incentives like this. If not the grim prediction that 86% of adults will be overweight or obese by 2030 will become a reality.",
