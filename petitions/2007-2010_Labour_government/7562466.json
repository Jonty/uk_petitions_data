            "background": "t is common practice in UK to grant the British citizenship in UK. But there are quite a few countries where regardless of any category you fit in will never grant you the citizenship of that countries even if you have married to the citizen of that country, which I believe is not fair at all. Just to make to these countries Governments realize and to make them think to change their immigration rules, the British nationality should be granted only to those whom home countries Government have the same reciprocatory arrangements for the citizen of other countries, especially the British Citizens. I know it might be unfair for the persons whom are the citizens of one of those countries but have been living in UK and are on the verge of being granted a British Citizenship. In this scenario those people should be asked to revoke the nationality of their country if they want to become a British National. They should be declare eligible for becoming a British national once they have provided a sufficient proof that they have revoked their citizenship of that country. This act will also demonstrate the loyalty of those who want to become the British National.",
