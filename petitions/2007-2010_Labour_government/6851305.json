            "background": "I am fighting against the unsustainable red tape continually bombarding SME's particularly around employee entitlements such as extended maternity leave.  Most small businesses cannot cope with the disruption and costs incurred by someone who takes a year\u2019s maternity leave, let alone cope with the demands of change of employment terms on their return.  Most SME\u2019s have very few staff, many do not have HR facilities so pay thousands of pounds in recruitment agency fees and yet they are expected to put up with running the risk of being messed about when the returnee suddenly decides she doesn\u2019t want to return to work the hours stated on her original contract.  We need the government to start listening to the voices of the 4.5 millions SME owners who produce half the GDP of this country.  We are the backbone of the economy and nobody gives a damn.  If they did they wouldn't allow Trevor Phillips - Head of the Commission for Equality & Human Rights - Daily Telegraph 29.09.07 to even suggest ludicrous annualised hours which he thinks should be introduced so that women can work whenever they like. His words not mine.",
