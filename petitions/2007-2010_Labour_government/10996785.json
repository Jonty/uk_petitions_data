That is a complaint rate of 0.00025%. This suggests to me that Brand and Ross were perfectly in tune with the demographic of their listeners. In reality he only offended those two listeners.  The rest have been geed up by the idiocies of the tabloids.  So, yes he was wrong.  He agrees.  He has apologised.  That's enough, let him get back to work.[Jonathan, if they do reinstate you 10% of your earnings for the relevant period would be a handsome gesture]",
