        "background": "The UK is supposed to be a democracy. A democracy is when the majority rule. The right to freedom of speech, when you exercise your right you can\u2019t infringe on other peoples right not to be interfered with otherwise you violate their rights. The basic principle of rights. The protest in Luton was a violation of our rights to a welcome home parade for BRITISH soldiers. An attack on British soldiers sent by our British Government, intimidation you could say.  Civil Disobedience is accepted when the law takes its powers to far and violates our rights. This event has been a violation of our right. We need to show that the majority (Democracy) of our people are in support of our soldiers. Muslims behaviour not being supported by the majority of the UKs population is an act of treason. I call for the government to stop allowing this intimidation of British soldiers; after all it is the same government that sent the soldiers there in the first place. Our government must convict these Muslims behaving in this manner of treason. If they do not convict them then the government has turned its back on their own soldiers sent to war by them. Please show support for our soldiers",
