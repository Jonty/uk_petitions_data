They do not choose to be shortsighted, longsighted or to have other eye ailments, yet they are asked to bear the costs of this inheritance themselves. These conditions are not determined by life style, they are hereditary. When one has broken leg, it gets treated on the NHS. When one is shortsighted, one has to pay for it. The cost of frames and lenses has escalated out of all propotions in recent years as the providers/opticians try to make more and more profit.",
