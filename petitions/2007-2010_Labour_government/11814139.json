            "background": "In the UK it is not possible to purchase a broadband service over a telephone line unless there is also an active telephone service on that line. There is no technical reason for this: it is available in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, and several European countries. BT appears to be abusing their near-monopoly position by imposing this unjustified expense on people who do not need or want a landline telephone service.",
