            "background": "The duty of companies to put the interests of its shareholders before the interests of its employees is an anathema to british trade and exacerbates inflation which effectively punishes the employees of companies. Taking away the protection of shareholders and putting a long overdue duty of care on employers will restore this nations manufacturing base, restoring inner cities and proliferating wealth rather than concentrating it in the hands of pension funds and merchant banks and (obscenely) a few private individuals. This government owes the public of the UK... it's time to pay up.",
