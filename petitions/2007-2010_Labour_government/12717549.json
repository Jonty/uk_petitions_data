Currently our MP's are in disaray due to the \"Expenses Scandal\" and their apparent lack of moral/ethical values.Terrorism theatens our national security and our economy is in chaos with ever increasing levels of unemployment.We have a mountain of debt which is expected to increase to more than \u00a3600 BILLION over the next four years.Some experts predict that it will take more than a decade to sort out our financial problems. Surely we must put aside party political in-fighting and work together to sort out this mess?",
