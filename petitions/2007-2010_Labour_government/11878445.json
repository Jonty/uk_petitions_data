            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The principle should be that exceptional bonuses (or additional emoluments) over and above certain threshold levels and paid to a senior executive in one year may be recouped by a company (or its administrator) in a later year if subsequent losses demonstrate such a payment was inappropriate given the performance in following years. For avoidance of doubt it should NOT be possible to demand repayment where a senior executive has consistently performed well but the Company has incurred substantial losses in other unrelated activities. Certain 'locked in' share schemes could be excluded.\n\nThe legislation to be retrospective so that it embraces the current problems within the banking sector.\n\nLooking at the recent high profile cases within banking this would enable bonuses paid  over the preceding four years to be recovered along with any 'top up' to pension pots.\n\nHowever, such legislation would be applicable to any company with exceptional losses and would enable a company to recoup monies where senior executives have previously paid themselves unusually large bonuses (or have been rewarded for having their contracts terminated due to failure).",
