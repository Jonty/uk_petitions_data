            "background": "Due to the lack of qualification of all of the British and Irish teams for next year\u2019s European Championship finals we propose that an alternative tournament is organised. The Five Nations of Football tournament would feature England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland teams in a round robin style tournament similar to the six nations that is played every year in rugby union. The matches would be held at each nation's home ground and every team would play two matches home and two matches away. This tournament would also generate interest in football and be important for the economy in a summer where an estimated \u00a31bn will be lost due to the lack of interest in the European Championship.",
