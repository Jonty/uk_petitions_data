        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The number of bins for different types of household waste is increasing. Each of these different types of waste is usually collected on a different cycle.\nThe likelihood of forgetting a collection, or putting out the wrong kind of waste for collection is increased. This can lead to waste being left to fester for up to a month. This increases the likelihood of vermin \\pest infestation, sources of disease and the unpleasantness of smelly rotting waste.\nTo prevent this, bin collection should be from the storage location of the bins on people's properties. To prevent bins littering the streets, they should be returned by the collection operatives to the storage location on the property.\nThe removal of this part of the collection service has not been accompanied by a reduced cost to the council tax payer, and should be restored.\nLocal authorities should have to provide a minimum number of collections of each type of waste, and a maximum time between collections. If the level of service is not met, the council tax payer should be entitled to some form of recompense, either in the way of a refund, or a credit against the council tax bill.",
