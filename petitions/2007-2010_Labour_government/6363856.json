            "background": "We believe that everyone owning a listed property should be made aware of that listing and what it means to them. When a listing is being considered there should be a period of consultation with ALL the parties who will be affected and a right of appeal against any decision made. Buildings should not be automatically listed simply because of age or someone famous was born there but because of architectural merit. The onus should be on EH to prove it worthy of listing, not on the owner to prove it isn't.\nWhere a building is listed there must be much more flexibility about what can and can't be done to the property and what materials can be used. For example uPVC double glazing CAN be installed sympathetically and greatly improve weather resistance. \nA more common sense, democratic system must be put into place to help preserve \nEngland's properties as living entities rather than dust collecting museums!",
