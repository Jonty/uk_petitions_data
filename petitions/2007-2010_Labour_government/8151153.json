            "background": "Reinstate the funding for the Gemini Observation programmes on the 8.1m telescopes.\n\nWhilst we may make a saving on this in the short term Great Britain's reputation will be damaged in the light of the international community for a long time!!\nThis will also make them reluctant to support us in any of our future endeavours.\n\nThis funding is a relatively small investment for this country which could reap great scientific rewards in the future. Please don't put us back in the dark ages! We seem to shun the scientific community these days rather than support and develop it.\n\nFurther to this we will not have any access to any of the large telescopes for several years to come in the Northern Hemisphere if this goes ahead, thus becoming reliant of other countries for data and information! \n\nThis looks like just the start of the shutting up shop scenario and withdrawing from the scientific community.\n\nPLEASE LETS KEEP OUR REPUTATION AND STANDING ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE!",
