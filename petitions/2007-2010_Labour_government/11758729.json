We know this because another man has confessed to the crime. Not only has someone else confessed to the crime - there is no evidence to suggest Michael Sheilds committed the offence - there is no DNA, he passed the lie detector test and witnesses have come forward to confirm Michaels account of his whereabouts at the time.Why is the British legal system keeping an innocent man behind bars, he should be free.\u00a0 We the undersigned request that this Political game be stopped the Prime Minister Gordon Brown intervene and call for Michael's immediate release or an inquiry as to why he is still behind bars.\u00a0 Let him home to his family where he belongs.",
