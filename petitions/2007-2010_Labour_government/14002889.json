        "background": "I would like the prime minister to enforce caps on mobile networks. By this I mean capping the bill. All mobile networks should do this as it benefits the customer and stops the customer being charged ridiculous amounts. \n\nNow if mobile networks refuse to do this then I feel at the very least they should include these features. \n\nOne when you phone to find out how many minutes and texts you have left the network should also tell you if your being charged for anything that isn't included in your monthly bill e.g. Premium rate numbers/Texts.\n\nThey should also Phone you when you do something with your phone that you don't normally do. For example phoning a premium rate number or accessing the internet etc. \n\nFinally it should be there job to tell you that you have spent over your monthly contract when say it goes to more than double your normal monthly contract cost.",
