Why do murderers get to keep their lives whilst these innocent dogs get killed for their owner\u2019s violent actions? We rehabilitate murderers - why can we not give second chances to dogs that have been brought up poorly - is it their fault they have been taken advantage of in such a malicious way? Surely destroying these defenceless animals is the 'easy' way out - their owners will still be out there able to do it again!",
