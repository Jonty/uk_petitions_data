        "background": "1) the majority of the country does not want it; last time I looked we were in a democracy?\n\n2) At a time when the public purse is in a mess the estimated saving of \u00a31 billion is something that I am all in favour of, whilst the estimated waste of \u00a35 billion makes me extremely resentful (esp. as you have been pushing this thing against the grain from day 1 - get the message Gordon).\n\n3) I cannot see, and cannot be convinced, that the supposed benefits of the I.D. card scheme are real and visceral.... no it will not decrease the terrorist threat and it will not make accessing benefits and medical care easier or better.\n\n4) I will never pay the proposed \u00a330-60... I have no money right now... and I refuse to pay for a Brown vanity project....\n\n5) Even if you manage to get this all through and introduced I will do anything to protect my I.D. and liberty... I will not pay, I will spend time in jail... and if necessary I will see your police force in Trafalgar Sq for a right old jolly up a la Poll Tax Riots... I do not want this... it goes against everything that I stand for and I am ashamed that it does not go against what I thought that you stood for.....",
