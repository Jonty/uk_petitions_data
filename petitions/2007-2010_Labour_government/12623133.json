            "background": "MPs should be given a salary that reflects their individual 'market rate', not just a uniform rate. However, this can be difficult to establish as different people are worth different salaries. To make things fairer, any new MP should be given a salary which is the average of their last three years' SALARIED INCOME. Any income from shares, pensions, etc, would not be counted. The upper limit should be \u00a3250,000pa, to attract the brightest. There should also be a lower limit of \u00a320,000pa, so as not to discourage the low paid, unemployed, voluntary workers, OAPs, etc, from taking office. Every year, this salary would increase by the rate of inflation. At elections, the proposed salaries should be displayed beside each candidate\u2019s name.\n\nGranting this petition would ensure that MPs were paid what the 'real world' thought they were worth. It is a simple and clear system that will protect the Commission from accusations of bias or being out-of-touch.",
