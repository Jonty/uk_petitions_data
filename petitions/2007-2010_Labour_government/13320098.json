        "background": "Linda Carty is a Texas Death Row inmate who was sentenced to death in 2002 for her part in the abduction and murder of a 25-year-old woman after a trial that  was catastrophically flawed.\n\nJustice for death row inmates in Texas has come under increasing scruitiny in recent times - In 2004 Texas saw fit to take the life of Cameron Todd Willingham, convicted of arson in which his children died. There is now considerable doubt about his guilt after fire investigators claim that the fire could well have been the result of a tragic accident. Cameron protested his innocence until he was executed.\n\nLinda is also a UK passport holder and a grandmother of 50. Her case is one of a few that has rpeatedly raised a high profile in the media. She was convicted on the strength of hearsay.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister, the leader of a country that is fundimentally against the death penalty, to intervene on behalf of this British Citizen who has not even received a fair trial.",
