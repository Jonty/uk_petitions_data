            "background": "Prisoners are presently charged approximately 10 pence per minute to call a UK land line and \u00a31 a minute to call a UK mobile. These exorbitant charges affect those who can least afford to pay. With average weekly prison earnings in the region of \u00a36 many prisoners find themselves unable to maintain regular contact with their families. Maintaining regular family contact is important for the rehabilitation of prisoners upon their release. If prisoners are unable to maintain contact with their families they are more likely to re-offend when released. The Ministry of Justice (who receive a hefty commission from BT) are profiting at the expense of the untold misery caused to prisoners and their families.",
