        "background": "As a response to the \"Jeremy Clarkson for Prime Minister\" petition, I feel it would be humorous and interesting to see how this petition would turn out. Sol Campbell, the current Portsmouth FC captain, is a player of the people and has hands on experience of a hard-upbringing. He'd immediately do good as PM; he'd outlaw all homophobic discrimination, have a decent understanding of how to develop Sport in the United Kingdom, he'd have good foreign relations (The vast majority of his goals against other countries have been disallowed) and of course, he believes in the freedom of movement for workers.",
