        "action": "reinstate transitional rate relief for 2009/10 and scrap the 5% increase in business rates in order to help struggling small firms",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We have launched this petition because small firms are really struggling to survive the economic downturn. Our members have told us that business rates is the third biggest problem for their firms, topped only by business and consumer confidence.\n\nThe FPB firmly opposes the Government\u2019s decision to increase business rates by 5% from April 2009, while also withdrawing transitional rate relief for 2009/2010, which provides a lifeline for firms hit with large increases in rates.\n\nThe Government must reassess these decisions in light of the recession or face being responsible for the closure of even more businesses up and down the country.\n\nThe Forum of Private Business (FPB) is a support organisation that represents 25,000 small and medium-sized businesses across the UK.",
