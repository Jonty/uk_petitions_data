            "background": "Planning Application Ref. 08f/2279 \nThe proposed site is accessed by the A561 which has become busier in recent years owing to residential developments such as Cressington Heath, the expansion of Liverpool Airport and the increase in activity at  Speke Retail Park. Plans to upgrade the nearby Sir Alfred Jones Memorial Hospital will increase traffic congestion in the area further. Fumes & noise from lorries will reduce the air quality and increase the health risks to residents; road safety will be affected.\nThe area is mainly residential with a large established and increasing population.\nThe large scale of the main building will dominate the skyline and will significantly reduce the visual amenity of residents. \nThe summary does not make it clear as to what other materials could be processed. In places, the phrases, \u2018is assumed to be\u2019 or \u2018is considered to be\u2019 are used. These are too vague for anyone to judge whether the necessary controls are in place.",
