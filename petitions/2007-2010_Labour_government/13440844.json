            "background": "Currently agriculture is being blamed for 60% of nitrates in our rivers.  However, water companies are still allowed to discharge treated effluent into our rivers, many of which raise the levels of nitrates to 10 times the levels normally found in the rest of the river.  The Environment Agency seems to be ignoring the levels of nitrates discharged by these plants and this is a particular concern when they are discharged into systems with a low flow rate.  Recently the EA stopped monitoring discharges up and downstream of our local STW but is still forcing farmers to store their slurry for most of the year.  The principle that 'the polluter pays' does not appear to be applied fairly to water companies.",
