            "action": "Scrap current legislation that forces elderly people to pay for their own residential care.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, if an elderly person cannot look after themselves any longer, they are forced to pay for their own residential care from their own savings. Even more distressing, the child of that person has to arrange to sell the property to cover the costs. However, people with no savings do not have to worry about paying to live in a care home, so this hardly seems fair. In Scotland, my grandmother receives palliative care four times a day on the state, whereas my grandfather in England has to pay hundreds of pounds per month for a carer to give his medication for just 10 minutes. If you want this to be made fairer in a time where vascular dementia is affecting more families, prompting this unfair settlement, please sign this petition.",
