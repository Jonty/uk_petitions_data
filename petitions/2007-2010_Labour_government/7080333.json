            "background": "Over the past few years some hospitals have introduced team midwifery to their hospitals whereas some Hospitals such as Leighton (Crewe), have withdrawn from this system.\nI believe that all Hospitals should introduce team midwifery to the Contract of every midwife.\nTeam Midwifery is different to the usual, because instead of the midwife being posted to one position (Labor Ward/ other wards/ community etc), the Team that the midwife is in, rotate to do each one. This is better for both the midwife and any patient because the midwife then has up-to-date experience in each position so that the patient can be ensured the BEST possible care, with the midwife last doing that post a few weeks earlier. This means if the midwife ever moves on to a post in another position, they will have up-to-date knowledge that position, thus the mothers/baby\u2019s health is NEVER at risk, as each midwife has the appropriate knowledge & this ensures that every midwife has the knowledge in every aspect of the job.",
