            "background": "Millions of tons of non-recyclable packaging is distributed by manufacturers and producers every day. This country has a limited amount of landfill space and is under increasing legislative pressure to increase recycling. We believe that the only way to meet these pressures is to tackle the problem at source. We believe that legislation should be introduced to enforce the use of recyclable packaging. From December 31st 2009, manufacturers and producers of all products must ensure that 90% of all the packaging for transport and display of their products is either recyclable or fully biodegradable within 1 year. The penalty for failure to meet this law would be equivalent to the gross profit of the item at point of sale.",
