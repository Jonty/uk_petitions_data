            "background": "In order to underline and maximise the effect of legislation on safety standards, and to enhance the safety of the public, it is necessary to prevent unregistered gas installers from operating.\n\nThese installers cannot be forced to register with the authorities since they are not known to them. Only some become known after unfortunate instances, usually when a death or serious illness has occured and an investigation has been carried out.\n\nIn order to prevent dangerous installations it is necessary to prevent the sale of gas appliances to anyone, other than those who carry the relevant registration and qualifications. This is much like refusing the sale of certain dangerous chemicals to persons without proper authority.\n\nIn the interests of public safety, it is necessary to introduce an ammendment to the Gas Safety (Installation And Use) Regulations which prevents the sale of fixed installation gas appliances to anyone other than the class of persons, approved for the time being by the HSE (currently those registered on the Gas Safe Register or with CORGI in some parts of the UK).",
