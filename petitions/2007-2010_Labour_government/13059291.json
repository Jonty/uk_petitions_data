It  sacked the chief accountant of the EU Marta Andreasen for revealing the amount of corruption and stopped her from becoming Vice Chairman of the Budget Committee when she was elected as an MEP in case of furthur criticism. The country is short of money but tax payers money is being handed to fraudsters.",
