            "background": "I request that the law be changed so that people who have not been charged with any offence do NOT have the allegations disclosed in CRB checks. I have recently lost my job because of a negative CRB disclosure relating to a malicious allegation that was proven to be false. Accross the country other innocent people are having their lives ruined by the disclosure of allegations made against them even though they have not been charged with any offence. The law should be changed to protect the human rights of innocent people. A ruling by the European Court of Human Rights said in respect of the keeping of DNA samples, \"The right to a private life is a protection afforded under the Human Rights Convention, to which Britain is a signatory\". surely this sort of ruling should apply to CRB disclosures.",
