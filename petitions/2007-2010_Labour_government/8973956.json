            "background": "As a member of the local community the proposed closure of this local PO branch would be detrimental to the residents especially the elderly and disabled. \nThe closest post office would be in the town centre of Hornchurch, which is up a steep hill for walking and 100 yards away from the nearest bus stop.  For the elderly and disabled and those non drivers this would mean having to carry a parcel a major distance to the Post office which at present is already over crowded and wait for sometimes up to an hour to be served. \nThree local branches have already been closed and now the proposed closure of more.  The post office is not just a place to deal with the mail and buy stamps it is part of the community and for some people who live alone visiting the local post office is there only point to see a friendly face.  There are a very large number of people that use this post office branch and when another local branch was closed the people were told don't worry you'll still have Hylands. \nNow apparently not.\nPlease let's try and save this valuable community asset.",
