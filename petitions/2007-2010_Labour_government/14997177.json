            "background": "We all know that it is a legal requirement to display a valid tax disc in your car's windscreen, this is to show we have paid money to use the road, however with the sheer amount of people driving around with no insurance would it not make sense to have an insurance disc in the cars windscreen to prove that the car is insured, this would have various benefits such as when an accident has occurred all parties involved has access to insurance details, if a car is on the road illegally due to no insurance it would give the public and traffic wardens etc the ability to report this crime as these cars should not be on the road, there is little reason not to display an insurance disc the cost is negligible and if if it reduces the amount of cars on the road that are not insured would bring down the cost of insurance as currently all legal insured drivers are being penalised with the costs of uninsured drivers, it makes perfect sense why have we not done this before rather than just focusing on tax?",
