        "background": "We believe that Disney gives hopes to millions of people, which is essentially what religion does for everyone. Disney carries strong moral messages about equality, and love and never judging people before you know them, and no-violence - which is exactly what Great Britain needs. Disney is amazing, and it would help so many people in their lives to remember that one day, good things happen and that a wish upon a star is possible. Even that behind every beast is someone who needs to be loved. So, by making Disney a religion, we are helping the whole of the United Kingdom realise that each and every citizen is as special as the last.",
