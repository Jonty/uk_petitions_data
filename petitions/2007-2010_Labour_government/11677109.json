            "background": "Passengers are unable to pack bottled water in their hand luggage before they enter the airport due to the liquid restrictions.\n\nSince the liquid restrictions, some airports and airlines are charging way too much for water. One airline charges \u00a33 for a 500ml bottle, for which it probably cost them 30p.\n\nPeople need to drink more whilst they are flying as they get dehydrated due to pressure and lack of oxygen in the cabin. With dehydration, the blood gets thickened and DVT happens.\n\nIf the govt doesn't do this, then someone will die due to DVT as they refused to pay \u00a33 on a bottle of water on principle.",
