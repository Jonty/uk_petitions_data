            "background": "The supporters of animal human hybrids have been silent on the benefits this research will bring, despite the misleading press coverage. The widespread ignorance of the related  science is being exploited by supporters of the HFE Bill. \n\nAllowing this research marks the end of the natural human development, or evolution. Mankind, cannot resist tampering with nature which often ends in disaster. Once started it will grow and grow. It will not be possible to stop the new inter specie life form evolving. We need only look at the atom bomb which has not been uninvented?    \n\nThe government remains keen to push through the HFE Bill against a tide of public opinion against the Bill i.e. muslims, other faith groups, atheists , and many more. WHY???",
