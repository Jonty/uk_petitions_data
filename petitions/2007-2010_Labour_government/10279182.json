        "background": "Following the countless blunders by ETS this years SATs results are late arriving in schools. In many Cases the schools will be on summer holidays and the children will not have recieved their results by the academic year. In addition to this there is concern amongst teachewrs as to the quality and accuracy of the marking with talk of a high proportion of papers, especially in writing being returned for re-marking. In light of these problems and the low level of confidence in the results I belive that the results this year should not be considered valid and therefore not published as the impact this may have on schools is huge.",
