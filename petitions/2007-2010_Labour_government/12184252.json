However, she, along with other wheelchair users would have to sit at the front and strain their heads and bodies  to look up at the screen. This is painful and not even possible for some people.Pembrokeshire County Council need to consult local wheelchair users about this issue.We would like a proper lift and access to middle and back rows so we can view the screen without contorting our bodies, or alternatively a large flatscreen television or some projecting equipment in the foyer/bar\\area. Please help us get a decent night out and sign our petition.",
