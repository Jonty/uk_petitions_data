            "background": "I would like to start my petition of with the fact that nearly everyone is faced with the risk of redundancy, whether it\u2019s your company going bankrupt, or simply your boss lying of a few wages. My father\u2019s work colleague had been made redundant, around a fortnight ago. He has been working for 25 years, and payed hundreds of thousands of pounds in tax. He has only received \u00a360 on dole, when someone else who has not worked at all, would receive the same amount. He is receiving the same rewards of someone who\u2019s exactly the same as him, but has done no work. I say NO. If you have been made redundant, after years of work, you should get greater benefits. Matthew Haythornthwaite 14.",
