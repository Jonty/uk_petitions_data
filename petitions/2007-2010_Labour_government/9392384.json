            "background": "The recent finding of the Diana Inquiry found what was obvious from the beginning - that Diana died by accident due to either the negligence of the paparazzi or the negligence of Mohamed Al Fayed's employee Henri Paul.\n\nYet since her death Mohamed Al Fayed has pursued his ludicrous campaign that she was murdered by MI6 on the orders of Prince Philip, despite there being no evidence whatsoever to support his allegations. The Royal Family's position prevents them from responding or defending themselves, and so it falls on the British people to retailiate on behalf of our head of state.\n\nWe believe that with his campaign Mohamed Al Fayed has slurred and insulted not just the British Government and the Royal Family, but also the British people. As such therefore, there is no place for him in British society and we ask that he be stripped of his right to remain in Britain.",
