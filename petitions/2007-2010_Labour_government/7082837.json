            "background": "Political Correctness is the most divisive tool ever utilised in the control of mankind.  It has killed freedom of speech and sets man against man, brother againsts brother.  And all this in the name of equality.\nCompetitive attitudes have been frowned upon and an air of total inclusion would appear to be the norm.\nNobody is allowed to lose, so nobody really knows what it's like to win.\nIt's little wonder that the UK fails to produce winning sports teams with any regularity.\n\nLet's turn the clock back some years and return to a genuine society, one which is not frightened out of speaking its mind in honesty, yet still cares for those less fortunate.",
