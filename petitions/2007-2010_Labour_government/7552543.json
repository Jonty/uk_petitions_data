            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Since coming to the UK Alhassan Bangura has demonstrated that he is a hard working young man with the talent and ability to become a top class professional footballer. \n\nHe is a very popular figure amongst the local community and has integrated extremely well, he also contributes to the area through his community work with Watford Football Club. He is fully self sufficient in terms of his finances and pays his dues in terms of Tax and National Insurance.\n\nBeing that Al has been resident in the UK since his youth and has just fathered a child a move back to Sierra Leone would be extremely detrimental to his and his family's well being. Whilst not a direct factor in this case it would also cause many supporters of Watford FC a loss in terms of a role model and a person who his genuinely liked. This is not about losing a very good footballer for our team but about making sure a fair and just decision is reached in Al's forthcoming appeal.",
