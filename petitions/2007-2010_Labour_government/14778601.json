        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If you were deemed to be too frail or unwell to make decisions for yourself, would you want your nearest and dearest to make the decisions for you? Would you want the person or people who know you best to ensure that your wishes are carried out? And if you are not in a legally recognised relationship, do you expect to be able to decide for yourself now exactly WHO your nearest and dearest are?\n\nCurrently the Mental Capacity Act dictates that legal responsibility for \u2018single\u2019 people is handed over to their nearest relative, no matter how elderly or how distant that relative is. We believe that everyone not in a legally recognised relationship should have the right to define who is closest to them. There is no legal definition of \u2018next of kin\u2019, which is why the Mental Capacity Act recognises the \u2018nearest relative\u2019.  We believe that the law should be changed to allow \u2018single\u2019 people to name their next of kin via a simple legal declaration.",
