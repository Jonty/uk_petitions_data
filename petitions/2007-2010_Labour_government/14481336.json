            "background": "Antifreeze kills 10,000's of our pets in the UK every year. It tastes sweet - many cats & dogs will lick it off the ground, then die from kidney failure within 48hrs unless treated by a vet immediately. In the USA there is an Antifreeze Bill 2399 in Senate & it's banned in 5 US states unless it contains a bitterant. An 11 year old girl got this Bill to Senate!  Antifreeze has also been used to spike people's drinks in clubs, more recently used in an attempted murder where the man was fed antifreeze in juice whilst lying in ICU in hospital. If it didn't taste sweet, it couldn't be hidden in food/drink AND cats/dogs/wildlife wouldn't be attracted to it. Most screenwash contains antifreeze yet few of these products contain ingredients or hazard warnings on the labels. There is no mention of the danger to animals. We want clear labelling outlining how dangerous it is; a bitterant adding to it; antifreeze manufacturers to take responsibility in full knowledge that they are possibly breaching the Animal Welfare Act 2006 by causing unnecessary suffering by failing to disclose the dangers of their product by not providing this information on their labels.",
