            "background": "Fuel costs are crippling the country and driving inflation to levels unseen for many years. The cost of fuel affects the cost of everything: shops and workplaces need heating; goods need to be moved; workers need to get to work. Fuel is an inelastic commodity that we can't choose to live without. High fuel prices are strangling the economy and pushing hard-working families over the financial brink. The majority of the price of fuel goes to the exchequer in tax, therefore HMG is best-placed to remedy this situation. For this reason we demand a minimum 50% reduction in the duty levied on fuel.",
