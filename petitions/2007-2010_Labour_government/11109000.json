            "background": "Why has the system in prison gone pear shaped? Because it is overcrowded. \n\nWhy is it overcrowded? Because nobody is scared of prison any more, a 'holiday' for them if you will. \n\nThese people who have committed a crime are NOT paying the price. \n\nIf someone murders someone else, it's 'life'. ie 40 years. But the moment they walk through the doors, its halved. THEN if they're \"good boys/girls\" its even shorter. So that's about...10 years for taking a persons life.\n\nIn that duration they get amenities that    hard working people couldn't even dream about. \nI feel they should be made to eat 'slop', have no privacy, and do all the rubbish jobs that no honest person should have to do.\nNone of the Xboxes and televisions that they have now. \n\nThey should hate prison so much that they NEVER want to go back. \n\nWhat should our government do about it?\nMake prison a 'hell on Earth' as it used to be. \n\nNo one should 'mind' going to prison.",
