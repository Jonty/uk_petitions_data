        "background": "England lags far behind the rest of Europe in the number of bank holidays we get. A bank holiday on St Georges Day would be a great opportunity for all the English (regardless of colour or religion) to recognise what binds us together - instead of concentrating on our differences.\n\nEverything from football to fish & chips, and cricket to curry could be celebrated on our national day.\n\nNorthern Ireland (part of the UK) has had a bank holiday on St. Patrick's Day since 1903, the Scottish Parliament has introduced a voluntary Bank Holiday on St. Andrew's Day and the Welsh Assembly agree that St. David's Day should be a holiday.\n\nThere is a danger that England could be left behind without an opportunity to celebrate its rich culture and heritage.\n\nWe ask for a Bank Holiday in England on 23 April or the nearest Friday to that date.",
