            "background": "Britain has a duty to broker peace between the Palestinian and Israeli people for its involvement in the 1947 partition and there can be no peace in the Middle East without establishing diplomatic relations with all the major political players. If we refuse to hold talks with one democratically elected government because of their use of collective punishment on a civilian population to achieve political aims we must refuse to talk to the other. As we have learned before in Northern Ireland those looking for an end to violence can only exacerbate the problem if there is no impartiality and even handedness. Either sever diplomatic contact with Israel or open channels to Hamas. Please take one step forward in ending the bloodshed.",
