        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The computer gambling machines in bookies need to be banned! They are the Crack Cocaine of gambling due to the high odds and amounts that can be gambled in a realively short time period. I also believe the main problem is the easy access issue whereby individuals find it far too easy to avoid the temptation to play and the fact that there are upto 4 FOBTs in every bookies. \nPlaying can usually start with a couple of pounds but soon escalates into 10's and 100's of pounds and I have personally witnessed this on many occasions. These machines bring out the nasty side of individuals and you usually see these being kicked and punched when so called random generator numbers do not come in - usually because someone has spent all there wage / savings chasing losses. \nI realise there could be underlying personal issues for gamblers but the fact is these machines do not assist and actually escalate gambling problems. \nI am however acceptable for them to be placed in land based casino's as the access can be more easily restricted to postively assist problem gamblers trying their hardest to avoid further gambling.",
