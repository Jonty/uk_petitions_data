        "background": "Proposed body scanners that give airport staff images of passengers as if they were naked are too intrusive, too similar to strip searches. By all means prevent terrorism, but not by all means. Since the very beginning of human history, we have been keen to keep our nudity to ourselves, and this step has crossed the line between safety and freedom: safety must not come at the cost of all freedom. And airport staff being only human, even if professional, will be unable to resist focusing on attractive people, particularly in the early days of the technology.",
