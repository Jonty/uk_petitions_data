            "background": "Bring back the birch for any one caught with a knife or a gun and show it on national TV. Nothing else could be a deterrent for crimes committed using these weapons. Use lottery funding to set up community centres open 7 days a week with activities eg. dance, music, cricket, tennis, football, plumbing, electronics, mechanics. Have regional and national competitions. The list could be endless but select a few. Bring retired police officers to maintain law and order in these areas around community centres and in all schools.",
