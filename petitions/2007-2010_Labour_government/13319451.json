            "background": "There are only 4 breeds of dogs classed as dangerous banned from being owned within the UK, yet so many others are loosing their lives due to being of the 'type'. I propose removing this term as with some of the crosses around most do look the 'type' but are in no way the breed of dog banned. For example a staffordshire Bull Terrier cross English Bull Terrier can look just like a Pit Bull Terrier but hold no other resemblance other than looks. These dogs are being put at risk because they look the 'type'. Blue Blood SBTs and Irish SBTs are also being put at risk as they are labled with the term 'type' and being put down needlessly. Most of the Terrier breeds are known as nanny dogs and are being destroyed for nothing more than looking wrong.",
