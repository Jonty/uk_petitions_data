They deserve to be treated well from the day they sign-up to they day they die, rather than being refused permission to live in the country they fight to protect. The armed forces deserve the best equipment they can have, rather than badly made and out of date equipment that is only used so that it conforms to what 'Europe' wants. If we do not stand up for our soldiers who will protect us?",
