            "background": "The Imperial War Museum (IWM) was set up by the British Government in 1917 to remember the First World War.  The remit was expanded to include \"all military operations in which Britain or the Commonwealth have been involved since August 1914\".  Yet, the IWM has mounted a major exhibition called \"For Your Eyes Only: Ian Fleming and James Bond\" until 1 March 2009.  This has nothing to do with war and is an insult to Britons involved in wars in the last century.  This dumbing down  also shows a remarkable lack of inspiration by curatorial staff.  The IWM is not the place for James Bond - such an exhibition should be held elsewhere.",
