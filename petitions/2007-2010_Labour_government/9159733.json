        "background": "I would like the Prime Minister to make it unlawful for local bus and national or local train companies from raising their fares by ridiculous amounts that far exceed the rate of inflation (say perhaps cap the raise to 2% above inflation). These rises in fares affect people on the lowest incomes, and do not promote the use of public transport as a feasible alternative to using your personal car for a journey that could minimise road and motorway traffic.",
