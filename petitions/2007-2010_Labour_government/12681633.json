We see Muslims now protesting on our streets, holding placards \"Support a caliphate\", \"Death to Infidels\", \"Behead those who insult Islam\". Isn't that enough to justify the reality of what could happen to this country once they arrive here. We urge the PM to think twice about this country joining.",
