        "background": "\"Academies are all-ability, state-funded schools\" according to the department for children, schools and families.  Unlike most state-funded schools they are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000.\n\nThis makes academies unusual in that they get to spend large amounts of public money with very little public accountability.  \n\nPublicly funded Further Education Colleges, Higher Education Colleges and Universities and most state-funded schools are all to the Freedom of Information Act there is no reason why academies should be any different.",
