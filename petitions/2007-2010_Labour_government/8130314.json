        "background": "This country is no longer a \"Christian Country\". \n\nWhile christianty remains, officially, the religion of Britain, the morals & actions of the general public no longer represent that which the church stands for. \n\nThe bible represents a period covering thousands of years, when people were susceptible to the fear of not being accepted into \"Heaven\", and when morals were much different. Times have changed and, with the advancement of technology & medicine, so have morals, yet the church still tries to control.\n\nThe church should be completely seperated from the State & should be treated the same as any other organisation. Discrimination laws should apply to the church. \n\nIt is the church that spreads vile filth against anything it does not agree with and it gets away with it. If it were not for the church and other religions like it, there would not be anywhere near the amount of fear or prejudice against people or things that were different.",
