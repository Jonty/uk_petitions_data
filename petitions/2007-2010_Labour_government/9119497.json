            "action": "Introduce legislation to compel all broadcasters to include Imperial units in all broadcasts including weather forecasts, documentaries and sporting events.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The exclusive use of metric units in popular programing is part of the political make-over to which the British people have been subject over recent decades.\n\nIt is understood by the petition originator, that many people prefer to use metric units and this petition is not anti metric.  People of both persuasions pay a lot of money to watch TV over and above the licence fee and both are entitled to maximise their enjoyment without prejudice.   \n\nThe metric only attitude is inconsiderate and dismissive. It also assumes the moral high ground and is therefore haughtily intolerant of the tens of millions of people who were educated, trained and have worked a lifetime in, or would otherwise choose to use Imperial units and who feel alienated by metric only broadcasts.\n\nThe determined insistence of all broadcasters in issuing weather forecasts with rainfall in centimetres, despite repeated requests to include inches, is calculated and politically sponsored institutional Ageism. \n\nThis prejudice is aimed at preventing contamination of the young rather than getting centimetres into the heads of the parents, who are considered a lost cause.\n\nMy name in 'search petitions'",
