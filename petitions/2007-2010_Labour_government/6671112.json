        "background": "RAF Bentwaters is a former Royal Air Force station about 50 miles NE of London, 10 miles ENE of Ipswich, near Woodbridge, Suffolk in the UK. It was used by the RAF during World War II, and by the United States Air Force during the Cold War, being the primary home for the 81st Fighter Wing under various designations from 1951 to 1993. For many years the 81st Fighter Wing also operated RAF Woodbridge, with Bentwaters and Woodbridge being known as the \"Twin Bases\".\nWith the handover of Bentwaters back to the Ministry of Defense in 1993, the facility was closed.\nIn 2003 work commenced on the Bentwaters 'Cold War' Museum\nIn 2006 V4 Technical Ltd  set up their headquarters on the site, developing web based software applications.\nI would like to see Bentwaters re-opened as an airfield for Civil Flying. The airfield has a lot of history and it would be good for aviation enthusiasts all over the country and tourists. It would also boost the local economy and bring money into the area.",
