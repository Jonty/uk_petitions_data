A spokesman from SLC, said earlier in the week that \"Using this figure allows us to get a true reading of the value of what has been lent as the value of the pound fluctuates. It does not, and is not intended to, produce any surplus for us,\".\n\nSurely using the annual figure would give a truer reading of value over the year. This years RPI in March was at a record high for 16 years. The rate had risen comparatively quickly over the previous year and has droppped steadily since that date. The actual average RPI for the finnancial year 06/07 was 3.73%, not 4.8% - that means interest is being charged at almost 1.1% over the rate of inflation.",
