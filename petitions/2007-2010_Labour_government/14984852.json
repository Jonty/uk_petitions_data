            "background": "Sir Ian Magee CB, at some expense to the taxpayer, identified what Solicitors, nfp providers and others who have commented upon legal aid reform for years have always said, which is that the LSC does not understand how legal aid works or how their suppliers work.\nThe MoJ has ignored reports from the Justice Committee into legal aid reform. \nThe Ministry of Justice allowed the LSC to fail to undertake effective analysis of suppliers and of the system and to push ahead with reform based upon  policy as opposed to evidence because the Ministry of Justice believes it knows what is best.\nThere has been a failure to conduct any research or proper analysis of legal aid, the justice systems, the funding of the justice systems or the funding of access to the justice systems. The reform has been piecemeal and ineffective. Meanwhile fees have been cut causing \"suppliers\" to withdraw from the legal aid system, thus adversely affecting access to proper advice. There has been no proper analysis of the adverse affects of fee cutting.",
