Bansky's art livens up the otherwise monotonous urban landscape by adding colour and originality to dull buildings and areas.\n\nMost graffiti is just a scribble of a name however Bansky's charming art shows talent. It brings a smile to our faces, it is neither pornographic nor obscene and in many cases it is beautiful. \n\nA Tower Hamlets councillor said of Bansky's art:\n\"It spoils the environment, makes our neighbourhoods feel less safe, and costs thousands of pounds each year to clean - money that could instead be paying for valuable local services.\" \n\nWe do not want this art to be cleaned, therefore the council do not need to pay for its removal.\n\nIt's a serious world out there, why not have one thing that makes us smile?",
