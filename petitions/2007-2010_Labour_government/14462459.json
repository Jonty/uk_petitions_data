They wish to be able to exclude someone from consideration based on characteristics such as their sexuality. We believe that this is wrong and that no group or organisation should be exempt from the Equality Bill and the important progress that it makes for the rights of many minority groups, especially in this case homosexuals.\n\nCommittee stage: House of Lords | 25.01.2010",
