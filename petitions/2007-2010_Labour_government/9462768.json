            "background": "At the moment we have a series of fixed fuel taxes which mean for a minor change in fuel costs, there is massive knock on effects to to consumers and industry.\n\nPortugal operates a system whereby the fuel price at pump is fixed, and the tax rate is varied with price directly. While this gives a less certain revenue stream to government, it would help to curb impact of rapidly spiralling fuel prices seen across all sectors. It would also provide a stable environment for those on low incomes to plan their spending.\n\nTherefore, we petition the Prime Minister to consider implementing a similar tax scheme in the UK.",
