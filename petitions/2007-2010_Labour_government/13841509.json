        "action": "seek resignation of Alan Johnson for sacking Professor Nutt for sharing scientific facts on the dangers of different drugs",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Alan Johnson has sacked Professor Nutt, the government's Chief Drugs Advisor for sharing his scientifically backed up opinions on the harm caused by a variety of drugs.  It is his job to present these opinions and to be removed from his role for daring to disagree with Alan Johnson's own opinion is wrong and a sign of weakness of the current Home Secretary.\n\nDecisions made by our government should be driven by fact, as we are seeing with the Obama campaign.  Politically based decisions which brush over scientific fact should be avoided... decisions made that neglect facts remind me of the Bush administration.\n\nPlease reinstate Professor Nutt, and allow him to do his job.  Get rid of Alan Johnson.  We don't need people who cannot work with science or facts in high office.",
