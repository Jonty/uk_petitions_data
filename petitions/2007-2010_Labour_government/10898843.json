            "background": "With fuel costs seemingly out of control, the governments appetite to increase the road tax based on engine size (when bigger engines use more fuel and hence, pay more tax through fuel purchase) and general cost of products (i.e. Parts and labour for servicing) increasing.  It is fast becoming a cost to use your personal vehicle for work - it would be easy to suggest not using the car, but for the vast majority of people in the same situation, using their car is an absolute necessity if we are to continue working in a highly competitive sector.  With all our earnings taxed it seems that paying four times for one thing (PAYE \u2013 Road Tax \u2013 Fuel Duty \u2013 VAT) is too much. To ask for further tax on a cost that we must bear to remain in employment is just unfair to the honest, working, tax paying, British employee.  The rate has been at 40p per mile for as long as I can remember. I can remember, however, only a few years ago, when petrol was only (and I say only with a wry smile on my face) 60p per litre \u2013 almost a 100% increase in 10 years.",
