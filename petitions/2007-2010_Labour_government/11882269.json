            "background": "Most taxation makes very little sense because it penalises activity that is good for individuals, families and the economy.  Therefore most taxes should be scrapped.  Income tax should definitely be scrapped.  And, a greatly simplified taxation system would eliminate an army of administrators, tax avoidance and tax evasion.  There should be a single tax called Progressive Expenditure Tax (PET) which taxes high levels of expenditure much more than conservative levels of expenditure.  This is not a new concept.  Talk to proponents of this idea with a view to putting into practice something that will work.",
