I worry for the mental stability of anyone who would do this. \n\nThe are some exceptions to this.\n-Foreign domestic team's kits are acceptable.\n-International team's kits are acceptable outside of tournaments involving the International team(s - plural due to people of mixed ethnicity) you support.\n-Non-professional team's kits are acceptable.",
