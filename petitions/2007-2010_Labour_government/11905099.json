            "background": "If the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is given its recognised independance by the UN, this would end many years of on-going plans to settle the despute between the two communities. Since 2004, there has been no effort by the UN to settle the disagreements between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots. If the PM were to accept this proposal and discuss it in a future UN meeting, this could solve many of the problems which are currently unsettled.",
