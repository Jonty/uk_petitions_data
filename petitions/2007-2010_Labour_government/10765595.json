There\u2019s too much money in the various leagues and cup competitions to change this anytime soon, but the people of the UK should be able to watch their national teams play as a matter of right. \nEngland, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should all be able to watch their own countryman doing their very best for their country. The people of the UK should be able to support their country for free \u2013 not held to ransom.\n\nSimply, this petition is aimed at getting national level mainstream sports on terrestrial TV. So all man, woman, and children can enjoy supporting their country without paying for the pleasure.",
