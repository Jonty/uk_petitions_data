            "background": "We would like the British government to approach China re its animal abuse asking for an International Animal Aid charity to be based within that country (currently there is none).  Asking also that the government cease to support dog farms (where dogs are killed for meat) that these be  abolished.  That cats and dogs stop being killed in market places for fur or meat.  That games such as feeding goats to lions,  setting lions against horses etc, be eradicated.  That experiments which burn dogs alive in Chonqin be abolished.  That an animal protection law be introduced in China.",
