The Ambulance Service are trained experts and care for their charges in a manner that far exceeds the remit.\n\nPrivate taxi-firms are sometimes used and the standard of care can be appalling. I worry for my well-being and that of other users, the attitude of some private hire drivers can have a detrimental effect on the mental well-being of a patient at the very least.\n\nMy treatment by a few mini-cab drivers leads me to believe that patients health may be seriously compromised or worse if this false economy should continue.\n\nLet us act and stop this potential travesty immediately before someone dies as result of this so-called cost cutting measure.   \n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nGlenn Anderson - Save Our (NHS) Staff -  (SOS-NHS)",
