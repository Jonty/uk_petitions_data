            "background": "Vehicles are now subject to vehicle excise duty (VED) which is graduated, based on the Co2 emissions of the vehicle.  While this may be a useful method of differentiating the most \"polluting\" vehicles, it is only useful to an improved environment if that additional government revenue is put back into some kind of carbon offset scheme or actively funding environmental research.  The purpose of this petition is to request that information to be made public, demonstrating that the graduated VED scheme is actually contributing to future environmental improvements, funding research into lower vehicle emissions etc..",
