            "background": "This regulation is impractical and unreasonable. Segregation by cabins makes no difference in comparison to segregation by shift. Women are being refused work and discriminated against due to the fact that this regulation dictates that women and men cannot share a cabin for any reason while working on offshore installations. Due to this women are suffering loss of earnings, experience and opportunities for promotion; this is an indirect discrimination against women.",
