            "background": "Single people who have worked and struggled all their lives pay the most in tax and contributions. Why should we continually pay for those who choose to have children and never see anything in return. It's time that we received some kind of recompense for not being a burden on the state and the Government should review their pensions and fairness policies and enhanced pensions for single childless people. We are sick of subsidising others especially when we see those on benefits with a better standard of living than we have and knowing we are working to pay for it and that we will see nothing in return for 50 years of work and paying and paying and paying. We have always been passed over and it's time we stood up and made our voice heard. There are a lot of us out there and we should unite and let them know that we want fairness.",
