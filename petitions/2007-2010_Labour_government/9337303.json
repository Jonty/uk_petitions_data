In fact, a recent study quoted in the Journal of the American Medical Association stated men in their 30s and 40s get 82% less deep sleep than men in their 20s. By the time they reach 45, men experience almost no deep sleep. \n\nWomen, on the other hand, enjoy more deep sleep than men, but that advantage vanishes once they reach menopause. \n\nWhy is this a big deal? \n\nProbably because a) half of parliament is asleep half of the time b) half of my neighbours keep me awake for the other half.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to campaign (quietly) on this matter and urge local councils to instruct ASBO neighbours - please make tougher penalties on noise and enforce them.",
