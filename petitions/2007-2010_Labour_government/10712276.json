            "background": "An owner of a property that has  perhaps been inherited faces large council tax bills even though that owner may live well away from the area. The relief offered on empty properties is only 10% yet the owner is not using council services. A property in single occupancy attracts a 25% discount and  the occupant has full use of council services. With the housing market in the doldrums, the unfortunate owner of an empty property for sale faces paying tax on his sole residence and virtually the same amount on the vacant property. This is unjust and we urge the Prime Minister to rectify the situation.",
