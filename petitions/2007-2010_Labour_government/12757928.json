            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I am signing this petition as I strongly oppose the granting of planning permission for another A5 Hot Food Takeaway. The area already has Nine all within a few hundred yards of each other, plus three Public Houses which also sell food. Another one would bring more late night disturbance & litter. It would also add to the parking congestion on the road as the application does not create any additional parking spaces. I also understand that the proposed block of shops is of mixed use and that there are seperate Residential Apartments above with living rooms/bedrooms to the front, which is right above the entrance to the proposed Takeaway, a late night licence would be detrimental to the peace & quiet and enjoyment of these residents along with other residents within the immediate vicinity.",
