            "background": "Community projects such as health promotion initiatives, befriending schemes and community empowerment schemes need a minimum of three years funding.  This will ensure the project has time to reach its intended service users and become established.  Short term funding devastates service users as they are often unable to continue their activity elsewhere, or without support.  Successful projects that help many people are not guaranteed continued funding.  Therefore they need at least three years in order to make a lasting impact on people's lives.",
