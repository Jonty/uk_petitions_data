The new interest rate of 4.8% makes this debt a crippling one, and is unacceptable. The interest rates if any, should be staggered so that the larger debts naturally incurred by the needier students, attract less interest, etc., on a sliding scale. This makes sense if it's not possible to scrap loans and interest entirely, and is much more ethical than the current blanket approach of high interest across the board!",
