            "background": "Promote the idea, between our European partners, to permit countries that lie outside of Europe to join the European Union provided they meet the requirements of the European Union bar location.\nCountries like: Canada, Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand et al; would be an asset to the European Union. They are great trading countries that would benefit the European Union internal trading market, boosting the wealth of both the existing members of the European Union, and their own. With these type of countries, allowing free movement of labour wouldn't be a problem due to the existing wealth of these nations; migration would probably be equally in both directions.",
