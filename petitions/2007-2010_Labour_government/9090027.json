            "background": "and to instead offer a more humane method to those who are determined to be terminally ill (this treatment is to be agreed by all close family members together with a group of at least 4 fully qualified medical experts). Once agreed, to then offer a suitable medication to bring a speedy end to the suffering of the individual in a dignified manner, as is already extended to most domestic pets in the UK today.  This would not only save the NHS much needed money but would also alleviate the current pain inflicted on relatives who are required to watch this slow and agonising demise of their loved ones.",
