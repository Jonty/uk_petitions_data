            "background": "I am inclined to remain within the EU, however respect the right for others to disagree.  I feel that further information for/against the decision is vital for an informed choice.  This information needs to be correct and accurate, and not just wild speculations, emotive manipulations, scare-mongoring, etc. (eg manifestos that are never fulfilled...)\n\nThis petition is calling for accurate presentation of relevant information by both camps, leading to a UK referendum.  Some of the components may include the overall financial contributions made by the UK since 1972, the UK's net benefits, and reclaiming any excess funds.\n\nIf the result is that the UK leaves the EU, then we would need a new referendum before rejoining.  (I didn't get the chance to vote in 1972.)",
