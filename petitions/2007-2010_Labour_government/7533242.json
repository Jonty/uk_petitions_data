Whilst my loyalty tells me it is still within in their beliefs, I am an outsider who now sees a shaping within our respecting policing authority, which shows neglect due to questioning. What person wants to put their life at risk, say goodbye to their familly each morning, and risk what no other man would for such minimal respect? Whilst the commercial view states the police have received a mere 2.5% payrise this year, delve in closer, and you will see they have actually received an insulting 1.9%, putting them in a possition, lower than the inflation rate to which the government have been supporting for the past 30 years, and are now trying to fix; although it were never broken. These people say bye to their family each day so you dont have to. And now I ask, as an outsider, Why? This Government have contempt for our police force!",
