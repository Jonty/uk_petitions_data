        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I have lived in London all my life,my 2 children(10YRS & UNDER) & I live in a 1 bedrm flat, on a housing estate.I was told that I'd have to wait between 8-10yrs, before I'd be able to transfer, as there is a large need for 2,3 & 4 bedroom properties.Everywhere I see empty properties old & new.I know many people trying to get out of small flats into suitable accommodation.The people I see moving into property are from other countries, most can't speak english,most seeking assylum- if things are that bad in their countries, & they'v been living rough, why can't they move into the 1 bedroom flats & let us have the space we all so desperately need. The government needs to know that it's ruining the spirits of it's nation by giving foreigners first choice on homes & jobs,The government are making british public hostile towards different nationalities. We don't mind helping citizens from other countries- but charity SHOULD start @ home. Please sign my petition if you agree with part/all of my opinion,whether you're black, white, asian,or dual-nationality, if you were born or raised here- you're british, YOUR VIEW DOES COUNT.",
