We  make sure our events are safe and comply with all Health and safety regulations. We are insured and members of organised groups and clubs.\nIf re-enactors are banned from having deactivated firearms, a whole hobby will be wiped out, many hundred\u2019s of businesses that supply uniform, kit, vehicles will close down, Thousands of hobbyists, model makers and visitors will no longer have the chance to see re-enactments in the open air.\nThis proposed crime bill will effectively make criminals out of hundreds of thousands of law abiding people in the UK without a thought for their rights, just because of a few uneducated individuals wave imitation firearms in the streets.",
