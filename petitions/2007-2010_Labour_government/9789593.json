            "action": "introduce legislation (THAT'S THE BIT WE WANT HIM TO DO!) to ensure that any LEFT HAND DRIVE commercial vehicles intending to be brought into the UK from other parts of the EU are properly MOT tested; road taxed and insured in advance of their arrival in the UK.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Implementation of new EU competition rules means that more foreign, unregulated, LEFT HAND DRIVE heavy goods trucks will be using our roads.  LEFT HAND DRIVE trucks being driven on RIGHT HAND DRIVE ROADS in this country are inherently dangerous.  Additionally, it is commonly known that the regulations regarding maintenance of vehicles and driving regulations for drivers are nowhere near as stringent elsewhere, as they are in the UK.  The government must impose proper inspection, registration and taxation of these vehicles - so we know how many there are on our roads, and that they are safe and safely driven - BEFORE they enter the country.",
