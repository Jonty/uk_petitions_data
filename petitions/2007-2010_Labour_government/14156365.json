            "background": "Communities and Local Government has a current target of 'zero rough sleepers by 2012' Any one who has been rough sleeping in the past or who currently work with homeless people know very well that this wont happen unless the homeless and rough sleepers counts are reviewed. A typical rough sleepers count in a single Borough is only undertaken once every year and with only a few hours spent looking. These counts are a good thing. However, health and safety restrictions do not allow volunteers to search derilict buildings and not enough time and effort is put into the count to ensure an acurate figure is submitted by local authorities to local government. This means that lots of people may still be sleeping rough despite local government figures that dont count many at all. A review of the way rough sleepers are counted and homeless people are catagorised would ensure that people suffering from homelessness would be acknowledged and people being offered the right support. Vote now to get a review of these current procedures and give homeless people a better chance to once again become a part of our communities.",
