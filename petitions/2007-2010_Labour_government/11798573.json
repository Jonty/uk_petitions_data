        "background": "Politicians and their servants are extremely prone to being encapsulated within an artificial news environment, hand fed to them by special capitol news media feeds and activist government and non-government security groups.\n\nReliance on one or two polling organisations can also keep elected government officials isolated from real national issues and problems as a result of religious agendas or un-spoken affiliations of such micro-networked groups.\n\nThe simplest safest and most cost effective method of breaking down such barrier risks is to actively recruit from the regions for all capital government vacancies, thus ensuring the continued flux and dynamic health of the nations capital as a pan-regional basis for thought and discussion on the health, welfare and future of the nation.",
