            "background": "China's treatment of the indigenous Tibetan people is nothing short of oppression.  The Chinese army's brutal methods in repressing legitimate protest has resulted in many deaths, the exact number of which we are unlikely ever to know but we can be sure that many more people will have lost their lives than the Bejing government will ever admit to. China's  record in civil rights is atrocious.  If our sportsmen and women compete in Bejing then they and our government will be giving tacit approval to this oppressive regime. Please support this petition, if Speilberg can walk away then why can't we?",
