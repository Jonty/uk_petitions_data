            "background": "My father turned 60 several weeks ago. As his birthday was after 15th September, he is not entitled to his winter fuel payment. Nor does anyone who has turned 80 since 15th Sept, receive their increase. \n\nI think the govt should move the cut off date from Sept 15th to end Feburary, so if anyone turns 60 or 80 during the winter, they should receive the full entitlement within a week of their birthdays.\n\nThis means, everyone who is entitled to the winter fuel payment will receive it during the winter.\n\nMy father is entitled to free bus travel, free prescriptions etc since he turned 60 - why does he have to wait another year for receiving his heating allowance as he was born 10 days too late?",
