        "background": "With many of the jobs, having applications in their hundreds, it is about time that this country looked after its own, and stopped the importation of immigrants who are not EU. \n\nImmigrants take our jobs, housing, fill the schools, and use the NHS, causing mayhem to us Britons, especially in London. \n\nWhy should someone just decide that they want to come to England to work (never mind going onto benefits), and be accepted, when the country has high unemployment with many people going after each job means there are not enough jobs around. \n\nAnother area of concern call centres, I cannot understand most of them, the local hospital where I live has just employed yet another foreigner for the reception, people who speak good English are more suited to the work. SO why are they not getting them? perhaps because the immigrants have more experience or qualifications and they are hired on that merit. Or where I live in Lewisham immigrants seem to be favoured above English.",
