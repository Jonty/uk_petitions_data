Money to update photos every 10 years for passports, driving licenses and now probably ID cards, what a rip off.\n\n\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 all the time for this and that.    I DO NOT AGREE WITH ID CARDS, I HAVE ID ENOUGH.  All this because the government has let too many foreigners into this country and can not control who is living here.",
