        "background": "The welfare of children is paramount. child pornography is exploitation of our children of the most reprehensible kind. The government must take all steps necessary to prevent the possession or circulation of this extremely despicable material.  The government must put in place as a matter of extreme urgency, the powers needed by the police to destroy all child pornography in any format and regardless of the source, on the completion of their investigations. No individual or organisation (other than the Law enforcement agencies for the purpose of their investigations) within the authority of the UK government should be allowed to have in their possession child pornography in any format. The destruction of the images must include the equipment and storage devices used. This is essential to prevent the recovery of images from any of these devices. (e.g. Hard drives).",
