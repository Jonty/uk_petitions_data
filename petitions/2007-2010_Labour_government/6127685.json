        "background": "Banks Putting Cases On Hold affects consumers\n\nThe Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has recently launched a test case against a number of Banks in the High Court. The aim of this case is to determine the legality or otherwise of unauthorised overdraft charges. In view of this the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has granted all banks a waiver (with effect from 27 July 2007) under which banks do not have to continue to process claims already made. (Cases of genuine financial hardship are excluded from this waiver). The waiver will continue until the outcome of the Test Case, or for such time as the FSA feels is appropriate. The FSA has separately stipulated that any outstanding offers of redress made by the banks must be honoured by the banks provided that they are accepted by you within 2 months (by no later than 26 September 2007). \n\nIt is unlikely that a court ruling will be received this year. In any event, in view of the importance of this case, it is expected that any such ruling will be appealed in a higher court, resulting in further lengthy delays, conceivably even beyond 2008.\n\nThis delay unfairly favour the banks and does not act in the best interests of consumers.",
