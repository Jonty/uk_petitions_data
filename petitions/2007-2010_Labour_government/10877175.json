            "background": "The current unprecedented world financial crisis has caught almost everybody by surprise, not least of all the BIG UK Banks and their shareholders.\n\nThe government has acted extremely effectively in the rescue of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley with the major aim being the protection of private depositors funds.\n\nWhat now appears to be being ignored is that millions of UK citizens are small Private investors in UK quoted banks.\n\nHundreds of thousands of inividulas as employees of these banks have saved through government approved share option schemes to build relatively small holdings as have millions of savers who have acquired and retained shares through floatations. All have acted responsibly to build small amounts of wealth for retirement planning or other future requirements.\n\nWe the undersigned petition the prime minister and the chancellor to give complete protection to these private individuals, if as it now seems likely the big UK banks are forced to go through some form of partial nationalisation or debt for equity swap.",
