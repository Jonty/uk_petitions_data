All have acted responsibly to build small amounts of wealth for retirement planning or other future requirements.\n\nWe the undersigned petition the prime minister and the chancellor to give complete protection to these private individuals, if as it now seems likely the big UK banks are forced to go through some form of partial nationalisation or debt for equity swap.",
