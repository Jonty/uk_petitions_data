            "background": "Bus companies should have to run regular on an evening and at weekends or lose their licence. If you want to get people out of cars and on to busses, you will have to provide public transport that allows people to move about freely in the hours that most people are off work... Such a measure would get more people out of their cars, and create more jobs in the public transport industry, and give the tourist trade a boost.",
