            "background": "Sierra Leone enjoyed a peaceful Presidential and Parliamentary Election in 2007 \nSLPP, the opposition party has shamelessly embarked on the smear campaign of violence, incitement and preaching hatred. We condemn this act as irresponsible from an opposition party that should mean well for the people of their country and not harm them and to check mate Government on relevant issues.\nThe opposition should not be jealous of the achievements of a  government but to think of positives ideas to make political gains rather than cause problems each time Sierra Leonean are jubilant for the good works of President Koroma. Services they could not provide such as Electricity Supply and most recently the facelift projects which has seen the first clock tower refurbished since its first erection and after the rebel war. Just to name but a few\nSupporters of the ruling party in the UK view this effort of the opposition as a campaign to tarnish the good image of the party and its leaders \nWe therefore call on you, Prime Minister, Gordon Brown to use your good offices to help bring this campaign to an end. We encourage them to work with the ruling party constructively to move the country forward",
