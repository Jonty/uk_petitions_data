            "background": "The review of the Points Based System includes a proposal to raise the minimum level of qualification above NQF level 3. That would stop overseas students taking GCSE's and A-Levels in British independent schools. If the proposal is accepted, many schools would close, and thousands of teaching and administative jobs would be at risk. There would also be a knock-on effect on the economy.",
