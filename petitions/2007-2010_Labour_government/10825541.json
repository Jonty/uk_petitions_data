        "background": "The Government should not advertise vacancies in the Guardian newspaper, which few working class people are ever likely to want to read.  \n\nA substantial sum will be saved by advertising all government vacancies on the government website, which is already there and will cost nothing extra to taxpayers.  It will be free to view and available to all, whatever our social class.  Those without computers can access them at job centres or the local library. \n\nThis is certainly not social inclusion. Stop putting those vacancies in a middle class newspaper!",
