            "background": "Hemp is an invaluable source of fuel oil, clothing and food which was only outlawed with the 20th century due to it's cannabis-strain related overtones.\n\nHemp seeds are high in protein and minerals. They are a source of food and general trade which have been denied to the British nation for too long.\n\nThe use of Hemp products would reduce the amount of fossil-oil based products as the properties are similar.\n\nThe cultivation of Hemp for industry usage would greatly reduce the 'Carbon Footprints' of the current population.\n\nHemp is also a source of natural and medicinal therapeutic utilisation, constricted due to the 'immoral' nature of the plant.\n\nThe UK would thrive immensely from this MegaCrop.",
