            "background": "We the undersigned would like to see long term waste grounds in inner cities and rural areas turned into low cost allotments to help more people become self sufficient.  There is much interest in allotments, especially now in the current climate and that more and more people are moving into apartments & flats that have no gardens of their own.  There are not enough to meet the demand.  This is also a great move for the environment.",
