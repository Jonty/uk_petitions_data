        "background": "Currently people of the age of 16 to 18 receive a minimum wage of \u00a33.30 and people below the age of 22 only get \u00a34.45 an hour. Why should the young people of this country be allowed to be more exploited by their empolyers than older adults? People should have a right to an equal fair minimum wage regardless of their age differences. Why should companies be encouraged to hire people under the age of 22, make them do the same work as anyone else and then sack them when they reach an age that requires the full minimum wage. During the younger ages we have to pay for uni fees and such,what is the use of increasing it later? Why not keep it the same \u00a35.35 rate for everyone?",
