        "action": "ensure that developers who build residential housing in back gardens have a statutory duty to compensate owners of adjacent properties for any nuisance, reduction of quality or loss of value of their properties which results from the development",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The development of residential properties in back gardens in general reduces the quality of an area, impacts adversely on biodiversity and can cause a reduction in the quality and value of existing surrounding  properties.\n\nExisting planning laws are too weak to reduce the incidence of this type of development which continues apace.\n\nStatutory procedures should be introduced to ensure a developer is required by law to compensate existing property owners for any loss of value to their properties. This should include the provision for advanced payments and a requirement for such monies to be held on deposit prior to commencement of a development.\n\nThe government itself is required to follow statutory procedures and provide compensation if it wishes to construct a road or other public works. \n\nThe existing situation with regards to back garden developments is inconsistent with other law.",
