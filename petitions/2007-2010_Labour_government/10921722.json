            "background": "The London Astoria, one of the finest and most historical venues in London is being destroyed to make way for faceless shops and flats for the olympics and rail links. The venue, which was opened as a cinema in 1927, is one of 13 buildings around Tottenham Court Road tube station that has been the subject of the compulsory purchase.  This is an injustice to the heritage of London, and is being destroyed for the olympics which nobody wants in the first place.",
