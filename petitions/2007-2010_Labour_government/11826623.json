        "background": "The Family Justice Council FJC key research paper 'Child contact with non-resident parents' by Hunt and Roberts (2004) contains the following statement,\n\n\"It is often claimed that research shows that contact is good for children. In fact the evidence is contradictory.\"\n\nYet Professor Smith, who the authors' cite, states in correspondence, \"the nature of the relationship with the non-resident parent was important\" (2007).\n\nRecently Hunt has co-authored a report for Gingerbread which according to the charity magazine was intended to counter the claims of, \"organizations like Fathers 4 Justice\".\n\nBridging these two reports is a study also co-authored by Hunt (2008) used in the press to show that the family justice system is working properly when much of the evidence is to the\ncontrary.\n\nWe believe the scientific proof shows children benefit from a relationship with both parents, post separation, and that this is best achieved through 'shared parenting'.\n\nUnless the FJC can acknowledge and support this principle we respectfully suggest that it is no longer fit for purpose and ask the Prime Minister to agree to our petition.",
