            "background": "There are numerous fast food outlets and supermarkets, which sell food products that contain meat from animals that have been religiously/ ritually slaughtered. Customers who purchase and consume these products are doing so without knowing it. Many see this practice of ritual slaughter as being cruel to animals, which the RSPCA acknowledge. Scientists who carried out research into this concluded that it causes unnecessary suffering to animals. I for one consumed such products, which otherwise I would not have purchased. Nonetheless, whether to purchase such product or not should be left entirely up to the consumer making a conscientious decision. However this decision can only be made if the customer is made aware of it in the first place.",
