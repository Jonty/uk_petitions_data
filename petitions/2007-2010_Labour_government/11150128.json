            "background": "Abolish the LEZ for transit size vans due to the amount of small business's that will be forced to close due to the lack of funds to buy new vehicles just because they are older than 2002 models even if they would meet the new emission levels. Lets face it, most people look after their work vehcle, ie. service, mot, and general maintenance and the newer vehicles have the same engines as the older ones. If an emission test could be run in line with the MOT, this would prove the vehicle is compliant with the emission required and therefore would pass!",
