            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Training providers are seeing an increasing number of young people falling into the gap between \"entry to employment\" (e2e) provision and the Apprenticeship programme.  For many, despite having received e2e support, they are clearly not ready to progress onto a L2 Apprenticeship.  2007/08 L1 trials within the East Mids were successful in bridging this gap, supporting progression into employment.  With providers now judged on full achievement stats and the threat of losing delivery, the system itself removes the ability for providers to offer choice and opportunity to students of border line ability, limiting progression and placing them into a void within the educational system.  To support the governments aim to increase Apprenticeship participation, L1 provision is required OR the removal of limitations placed on providers, allowing concentration on the needs of the learner.  Failure to do this will result in individuals accessing support through unemployment programmes later.",
