            "background": "At the moment teachers are presumed guilty until proven innocent. The head teacher is the judge, jury, and prosecution in the current system. It should be impartial therefore the Head does not get to decide as they may have personal feelings towards the teacher. Not every child likes every teacher and there are a number of false accusations that ruin careers and lives. Teachers should be allowed contact with the school and staff or how will they be able to compile evidence of their innocence. The system needs a complete overhaul so that justice is served.",
