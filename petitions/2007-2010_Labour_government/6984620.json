        "background": "House prices have tripled in 5 years in many areas. This has effectively resulted in a lottery win for half the population and life sentence of poverty for the other half.\n\nThis unprecedented financial inequality could have been prevented if the government had equalised supply and demand by authorising a sustainable house building program.\n\nHowever, the government has failed to recognise the scale of the problem, and has failed in it's duty to ensure a fair and just society with equal opportunity for all.\n\nI therefore believe the prime minister has no choice but to resign.\n\nPlease support this petition.",
