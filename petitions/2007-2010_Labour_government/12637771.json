We, the citizens, have the right to expect that our elected political representatives perform their duties without self-interest and wholly for the benefit of the electorate in return for an open and transparent remuneration.\n\nWe, the citizens of the UK, no longer have any confidence in the honesty or integrity of those we previously elected. \n\nWe elect our MPs so that they may govern in Her Majesty's name for our benefit. They have signally failed in this responsibility and are now governing to the detriment of the country, the citizens and the crown.\n\nWe therefore demand the immediate dissolution of Parliament.\u201d",
