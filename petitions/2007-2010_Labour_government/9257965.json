            "action": "scrap the current legislation that forces every lockable room in a student house to have its own TV licence",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At the moment, every room in a house occupied by students that can be locked with a key, needs its own TV licence if the occupant wants a TV in their room.\n\nIt seems very unfair that this applies to students only, and not to any other section of the population. Why has it been chosen to apply to one of the poorest groups of people in our society?\n\nIt is important to note that a student house has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with a hall of residence. A student house is a perfectly normal house that is rented independently and has nothing at all to do with the university.\n\nFor anybody else in society who is not a student, the rule is just that each property needs one TV licence and that covers every TV on the property. Yet students who live in perfectly normal properties have to pay for each room. It is another way of making basic life amenties impossibly expensive and inaccessible to students.",
