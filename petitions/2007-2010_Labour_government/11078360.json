As a child from the care structure of the sixties I am proud that the social services of the day shared information regarding our family and that as a result of this open book approach we were taken out of the family home regularly enough for our parents not to be able to harm us. There should not be any limit as to how many times a child can be removed from the family home and the childs return should be based only on what is right and not what is perceived to be in the good practice book. I am not a politician just a survivor.",
