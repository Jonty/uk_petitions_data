            "background": "On 6 October 2005 the European Court of Human Rights upheld its ruling that: \"[The] removal of the vote... runs counter to the rehabilitation of the offender as a law-abiding member of the community and undermines the authority of the law as derived from a legislature which the community as a whole votes into power.\" \n\nIt was also shown that there is \u201cNo evidence disenfranchisement help[s] to prevent crime.\u201d \n\nBeing in prison does not remove the responsibility of paying tax, and so it should not remove the right of a vote.\n\nThe current system creates a false divide between those who are sent to prison, and those who escape with lighter sentences for similar crimes. \n\nWith prison overcrowding at such a dangerous level, it is almost impossible for wardens to do their jobs as well as they would like. This can only lead to a decrease in time spent on rehabilitation, leading to our re-offending rate of well over 50%.\n\nIf prisoners were given the right to vote, the government would have to pay more attention to the failures of the prison system.\n\nThe government's current position is illegal. Unless it is planned to withdraw the Human Rights Act, the government must adhere to this ruling.",
