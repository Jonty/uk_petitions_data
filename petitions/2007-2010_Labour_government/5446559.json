            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Government's justification for not scrapping speed cameras is based on the enforcement of the 30MPH limit in built up areas.  This is based on the premise that people hit at 30MPH  have an 80% chance of survival while those hit at 40MPH have only a 20% chance.  My petition acknowlewdges that cameras can be used to reduce road accidents in selected urban areas; around schools and care homes for example.  However, there is scant justification for speed cameras on A roads and motorways. The A1 between Berwick and Edinburgh is a prime example of a 'revenue generator' with cameras placed strategically on long straights where overtaking is more likely and not where accidents have actually happened.  This is designed to trap motorists and generate revenue and not to reduce road accidents - several high ranking Police Officers have publicly admitted as much. This intolerable scam must be stopped: place cameras around schools and in targeted urban areas - not on motorways and A roads.",
