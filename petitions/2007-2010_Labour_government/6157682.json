We need to learn more and approach their care with more intelligence.\n\nThe act of hitting horses, allowed by the government, for entertainment, sends a message to the population that violence is acceptable.\n\nWe don't allow the beating of cats or dogs in sport, so why horses.\n\nThe practice is archaic and suggests we are still a way from being civilised.\n\nI personally feel we have to have zero tolerance approach to violence to protect the vulnerable-human animal as well as non-human.\n\n\nIs the will to stop violence too advanced an idea in 2007?",
