            "background": "Gvet needs to do more so multi - disciplinary teams work effectively together - research projects are already underway which centre on attempts to help different disciplines understand each other. \n\nLegally, nurses and midwives deal with normality, but are still at the bedside observing and symptom - detecting. If junior doctors don't listen, come or heed advice - the patient loses out. To streamline hospital management please design a CCF management protocol - this is one example, in my experience, when a patient didn't receive medication, because it wasn't prescribed for that time - but symptoms dictated it's necessity. This is not intended to be a source of conflict, but just to draw attention to a loophole in the roles of different speciality medics. The petitioner is encouraging the PM to facilitate greater consistency, yet flexibility in case management.",
