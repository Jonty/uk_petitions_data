            "background": "We are fed up with the way this country is being run. The Government seems to be more in favour of the criminals who run these streets than the victims who live in fear. The laws of this country are getting softer and softer and still the Government asks why crimes are getting worse and criminals younger and more plentiful. We want the laws to toughen - no matter what age the criminals are, for life to actually MEAN life, for sentances to be SET instead of made up by the judge i.e rape/murder = life no matter what age the criminals. We want the government to listen to US and not the people ruining the country we once called home. It's not a difficult thing to do! If the laws are tougher the criminals will think twice.",
