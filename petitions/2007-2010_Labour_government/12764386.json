            "background": "On Thursday 16th April 2009 a small number of 'leaking' Intravenous Fluid bags stored in the cupboard of the Paedeatric ward were found and disgaurded.  On 18th April a 3 year old girl died on the ward.  Then on the 19th April a further 30 bags were discovered.  Due to this the childs death was investigated and her family were subjected to a 6 week ordeal to determine the involvement of the damaged bags with their daughters death.  Luckily, the child was not involved but due to the hospitals poor security there is a potential for children  to be affected in this way in future.\nWe need to increase security to prevent another family suffering in this way.",
