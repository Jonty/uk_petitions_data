            "background": "Last year the lower limit of stamp duty exemption was increased to \u00a3175000 until 1st January 2010. The latest budget abolishes stamp duty for property below \u00a3250000 as of 25th March 2010. This leaves a two and a half month gap where many first time buyers have lost out on thousands of pounds. Many of these people were most likely trying to complete before 1st Jan 2010.",
