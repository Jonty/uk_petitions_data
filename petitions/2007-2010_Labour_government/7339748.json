        "background": "It emerged on 20th November that once again our government has grosely abused thier \"trust\" with sensitive data of the country and also our financial stability. As if finding out that we could pay for the mis-handlings of the Northern Rock Crisis. Mr Brown's Government has now jeapordised the financial stability of the majority of the population by allowing his government to lose such sensitive information; such information as Name, Date of Birth, National Insurance Number, Bank account details and also Child Benefit Number, let alone our home address!\n\nI feel that this government is incompetant and wish to ask Mr Brown to call an election in order to let those whose security his government has breached decide his future and the future of Britain.",
