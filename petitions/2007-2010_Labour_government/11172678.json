        "background": "I believe doing so would\n1) Improve tourist access to these towns (particularly Ripon + Harrogate)\n\n2) Wetherby appears to be thriving, and expanding, yet doesn't have a railway... adding a rail link now may be a good idea before there's no room left to put one.\n\n3) Come in handy should part of the East Coast Mainline between York & Northallerton need to be closed either due to maintenance or an incident.\n\n4) Have freight potential, as I understand there are 3 major breweries in Tadcaster.",
