            "background": "Jobcentreplus is a vital service. We assess, pay and administer benefits. We also help people to get jobs to make their lives better. At a local office level, working conditions are becoming unbearable. We have at least 10% less staff then we did a year ago.We are committed staff who want to do the best job possible,but are finding it increasingly difficult in the current climate.Jobcentreplus staff on the frontline still deal with abuse and difficult situations on a daily basis and we deal with it admirably,but we are becoming more and more stressed due to reduced resources. Please stop this abuse of our goodwill before we go into meltdown.",
