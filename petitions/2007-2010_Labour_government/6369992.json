            "background": "RAF Binbrook opened in early 1940.\n\nAfter WWII Binbrook hosted the Canberra, the RAF's first jet bomber and later transfered to Figher Command in 1960, hosting sqns flying the Gloucester Javelin and the the English Electric Lightning.\n\nThe airfield does need a lot of work. The QRA sheds at Binbrook are extant and visible from the road. They are now marooned from the main runway which has been excavated and removed as hardcore along with most of the taxiways. The sheds are used to store the contractor's machinery and are deteriorating badly. The former 'Fightertown' is now a sorry sight.\n\nIt would be good to see this restored to its former glory and for civil flying to take place.",
