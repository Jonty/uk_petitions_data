            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To my knowledge a pensioner finding themselves in a position of having to pay for nursing home care does not receive any allowance against tax for nursing home fees. Where the pensioner is forced to sell his/her home or let the property, any income derived from investing the proceeds of the sale or rent is taxable, subject to the normal personal allowances. Having invested in independence all their lives that independence is effectively taken away and the income tax increases the burden of costs of care. Allowing the care home fees to be set against income would make the available funds  go further benefiting the elderly and the state. Care home fees considerably exceed the old age pension and state allowances received. Todays pensioners were promised cradle to grave care under the National Insurance scheme.  Governments have failed to deliver and the present system is a national scandal.",
