            "background": "To have more control on waste pollution, people should be allowed only to throw away one rubbish bag or kitchen waste, which includes nappies and toilet tissue/waste per household. \nAll of this with a council ref no. on bags to have more control.\n\nControl on Business should be applied by assigning Environmental  Mng Syst/dep, in charge of minimizing waste that goes to landfill, creating green projects and educating the community.\n\nFines should be issued to the ones that do not follow guidelines.\n\nMethane  Gas Should be more used as energy source as it is cheap/free and reduces kitchen/organic waste going to landfills.\n\nMoney giving away by government to campaigners, etc to convince people to recycle will be saved as a compulsory law will be changing the circumstances bringing more respect to this land regardless if people are British or not.\n\nIt will be an excellent opportunity for other countries to follow as it will contribute hugely to the economy of the country, create jobs, reduce health issues, minimise pollution and obviously improve climate change problem.\n\nWe appreciate your support as it will bring more positive things to everyone.",
