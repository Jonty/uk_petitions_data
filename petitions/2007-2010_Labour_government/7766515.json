It cannot be politically nor morally right that politicians who have no right or authority over medical services in their own previous constituencies in Scotland can be permitted to make decisions over the provision of medical services in England, where there is not one single person who lodged even a single vote in favour of the people who are now in direct and punitive control of the provision of their medical services.",
