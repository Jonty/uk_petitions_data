            "background": "The social services of Edinburgh have taken two young children from there grandparents  who have been fully capable and lawful in there upbringing of the said children in favour of placing these children in the custody of two same-sex men. The service stated that the said grandparents were too old and too unfit for rearing them despite both being approximately 50 and only suffering from minor illnesses. This discrimination was met with alleged threats of never being able to see there grandchildren and bullying by the service if they ever spoke out or contested the services decision. These grandparents are the most capable and natural persons for charge of these children, yet despite the children being most comfortable with the grandparents the service have became bigoted and entrenched in giving these children to two unrelated unknown same sex men. Despite one of the children having an innate fear of men, the council are determined in executing this decision and we the people of the united kingdom hear by compel the prime minister to veto this action for the better welfare of the children by giving them to there natural relatives who have a good record of looking after them.",
