The charity had invested \u00a35.8million in the British bank Kaupthing, Singer and Friedlander Limited.  The bank held the highest possible safety rating and offered the best interest rates when Naomi House was advised to invest there. As a result of the banking collapse Naomi House has been forced to suspend its hospice at home service and will not been able to realise plans to fully open a new unit for teenagers.  Families are suffering because of a situation not of their making.   The hospice has tried very hard to juggle finances to prevent the cuts, but it has been impossible to manage without the money that has disappeared. The emergency support offered by the hospice is not provided to families anywhere else; teenagers, with life limiting conditions, have nowhere else to turn for the palliative care support they need.",
