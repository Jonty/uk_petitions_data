            "background": "Stamp duty on buying UK shares is levied by the Treasury at 0.5%. \n\nOf the world\u2019s financial capitals, only London carries such a burdensome rate of tax. The UK also has by far the highest rate among the G7 nations. US investors pay just 0.0003%. \n\nGermany, Italy and Japan don\u2019t charge stamp duty at all.\n\nIt is absolutely essential for British prosperity that we should be fully competitive in taxation on finance and business.\n\nStamp duty on share purchases blunts UK competitiveness.  It also imposes an unfair and unnecessary burden on UK private investors.\n\nWe therefore call on the Prime Minister to abolish stamp duty on buying shares.",
