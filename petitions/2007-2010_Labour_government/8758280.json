            "background": "Currently, motorists having to face an already psychologically punishing drive into London are threatened by another menace. Many who innocently miss making payments on their congestion charges - for any of several possible reasons - are denied the right to a reminder that their payment has not been recieved. Instead they recieve a menacing letter in the post, branding them as offenders and demanding fifty pounds. This is a large sum of money to lose, and often robs a driver of all commercial profit they would have made from that journey - so all their stress, fuel usage, and vehicle wear have been in vain. Those who protest against the unfairness then face a threat against their homes by bailiffs. This is abhorrent to any fair and equitable society.\nA fair system would allow the driver such grace, and then set a rate of interest, to be added to the fee due for each week that the payment is delayed.",
