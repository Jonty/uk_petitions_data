        "action": "Consider the impact of mechanical vibrations transmitted down through wind turbine installations on peat, soils, invertebrates, fungi and bioaerosols lying at the base of the food chain when the Government is considering applications for onshore wind farms and to commission research into the impact of such vibrations on such habitats and species.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A mycologist; I believe land based wind turbines may be more dangerous than we know because the impact of their mechanical vibrations transmitted directly into the surrounding terrain has been overlooked; never researched\n\nSuch vibrations are likely to devastate crucial bio-aerosols; invertebrate, flora and fungi species; even individual living cells will be distorted and moved\n\nThese vibrations may in relatively short time also destroy the fertility of soil; collapse peat leading to bio-polluted water run off with harmful impact on distilling, tourism and other industries for miles around\n\nThe fact is we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. Academic, peer-reviewed evidence for this threat on request",
