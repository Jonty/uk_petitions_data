            "background": "A mycologist; I believe land based wind turbines may be more dangerous than we know because the impact of their mechanical vibrations transmitted directly into the surrounding terrain has been overlooked; never researched\n\nSuch vibrations are likely to devastate crucial bio-aerosols; invertebrate, flora and fungi species; even individual living cells will be distorted and moved\n\nThese vibrations may in relatively short time also destroy the fertility of soil; collapse peat leading to bio-polluted water run off with harmful impact on distilling, tourism and other industries for miles around\n\nThe fact is we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. Academic, peer-reviewed evidence for this threat on request",
