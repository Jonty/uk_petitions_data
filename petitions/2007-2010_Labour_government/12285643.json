            "background": "The BBC wastes our hard earned money. Those who work for it, live exhorbitant lifestyles. They don't have to answer to anyone.\nWe, the public, are FORCED to pay. We have no freedom of choice..I resent \u00a318million being paid to the likes of Jonathan Ross. No one should be paid that embarrassing amount of money and certainly not out of the Public's money. Nearly every week, I read something in the papers telling of yet another abuse of our money by the BBC..\nThe other stations, who are funded by adverts, show equally good programs . Popularity by ratings show how well each program does and it is then therefore further funded by advertising. Adverts give me time to go to the loo or make a cuppa. also, I learn what is new in the market by adverts. They serve many purposes but mainly they take the burden off the consumer. We are FORCED TO PAY THE BBC. We even fund the new vans they use to sneak around to see if you are watching. If you don't pay, you are threatened and forced to pay one way or the other. This is a police state.With the Recesssion, we can't afford this expense on top of heating, electric, Council tax , petrol etc etc. The BBC is out dated and should no longer be allowed to take our money to fund them.",
