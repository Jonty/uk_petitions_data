            "background": "Currently the advertising industry is self-regulated. There is a code of practice called the CAP which the ASA only enforces retrospectively. This code does not cover issues such as whether an advert promotes unhealthy behaviour or the unacceptability of aggressively marketing to those who have no need for the product concerned. I would propose that the government regulate the advertisements, employing experts across many fields in an attempt to bring scientific rigour to the business of advertising so as to better protect the public interest. I also propose that adverts be vetted for suitability before they are aired, not after. It is a ridiculous situation currently, where we are asked to trust those to behave in a responsible manner whose job it is to part us from our money!",
