            "background": "I petition that National Service should be brought back for all young men, whatever their nationality, over the age  of 17. It would rid the Country of the  violent, yob culture which is now prevalent throughout the UK, It would serve to put the unemployed back into  work as well as teach them a trade, which they could use when they had served their time.  It would save the tax payer money in the long run, eg: nhs costs for treating injuries. Repairs to public and private property from the damage they cause, cars, buildings, sign posts. The police force would benefit from having to use less man power,so they could concentrate on more serious crimes.Immigration would probably go down as less young men would want to come here. The young men themselves would learn how to conduct themselves and respect their elders and other people's property.",
