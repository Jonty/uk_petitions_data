            "background": "I have been shocked by the interest rate that companies can charge in the uk, for instance an advertisement for quick cash loans at quoted Typical 2356% APR. and well known businesses who target the unemployed with typical apr of 49.9% to buy washing machines and other household goods,\nin times when the bank of england base rate is at historical lows it would seem these companies are no better than loan sharks, also if a family is living on means tested benefit it is unthinkable that they can afford to pay these extortionate rates and indeed this may add to crime if thats their only way out, my petition is to ask for the government to set strict limits for top end interest rates, may be based on a factor of b.o.e rate ( say 5 times base rate.  may be then the low income families can keep some control on their debt and prevent the misery of poverty .",
