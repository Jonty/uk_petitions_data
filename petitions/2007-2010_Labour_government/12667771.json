            "background": "This petition asks that banks and bankers should be held totally liable for their actions and that this should include prosecution where applicable.\nThat banks should be severely disciplined for any breach of their Code of Conduct, the FSA Principles or the terms of the Government bailout.\nThat banks should be entirely transparent in their dealings.\nThat malpractice, maladministration or negligent action in a bank which  results in unfair treatment of its clients, including historic cases, should be immediately resolved and the victims compensated.\nThat the Government forms an entirely independent body as an additional and totally impartial regulator and that this body is the public watchdog of a new improved banking system. This body would include representatives of SME,  consumer action groups and the public.\nThat the actions of those 'Masters of The Universe' who have received millions of pounds while bringing the Country to its knees, should be fully investigated.",
