            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently Mortgage Lenders charge a fee by adding it to the mortgage if the borrower falls behind in payments. This advisor is working for and appointed by the lender not the borrower so why must the borrower be charged. The 'advice' that usually comes out it to advise the lender if they should continue to 'lend' or not, rather than help the borrower. While it might be true that someone is not in a good finacial position and the lender does need to take action to stop mounting debt It seems also to look that the lender is 'helping' and being supportive, before they take any further steps by saying 'you need an advisor', they should pay for this advice it is an immoral way of making money out of someone who is already in difficulty.",
