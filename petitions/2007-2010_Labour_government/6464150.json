            "background": "ITV BORDER has provided local news and programming to Cumbria, South West Scotland, the Scottish Borders, and the Isle of Man for almost 50 years, and has one of the highest rated regional news programmes in the country.\n\nUnder proposed changes by ITV, (if agreed to by Ofcom), this service would be amalgamated with the existing ITV Tyne Tees service, which we believe would significantly reduce the quality and amount of news and programming we would receive specific to our local area. \n\nWe the undersigned consider this shift in local television provision to be biased in favour of urban centres, to the detriment of our communities, and yet another example of how people in rural locations are marginalised.  \n\nWe are therefore seeking Government support in opposing these changes.",
