            "background": "Under the Government\u2019s Primary Capital Programme it is a proposal to close Hart & Elwick primary schools.  Both of these schools are classed as Good with outstanding aspects and are achieving over 90% in English and maths.  They have been recognised as outstanding in the area of personal development and well being.  In short schools at the heart of the community producing well educated well rounded individuals with a good attitude towards learning.  Is this not what education should be about.  Both of these schools are well supported, in good condition, provide a quality school environment, play a vital role at the heart of their community, place a high importance on family integration and prepare children for their secondary education.  \n\nHartlepool has almost a 50:50 rural / urban split, if these closures go ahead there will be no schools serving the rural community.  These closures would be paramount to educational vandalism.\n\nPlease sign our petition and help stop this ludicrous idea.  Thank you for your support.",
