        "background": "Harriet Harman no longer has the trust or the backing of the public. \n\nThe new Equalities Bill, as proposed by Harriet Harman, includes an intention to legalize discrimination against British males in favour of female and ethnic minority candidates. \n\nSo called 'positive discrimination' is anything but positive and could lead to mass resentment and an undermining of authority in the work place. Choosing applicants because of their 'race or gender' denigrates the achievements and the merit of the applicants. The proposal could lead to resentment amongst those whom it is to discriminate against, and could lead to the perception that female and ethic minority candidates are only successful because of this legalized discrimination.\n\nLegalized discrimination in the workplace is specialized apartheid. It will never be a positive force for change and must stopped.\n\nWe request that the minister is removed from office for her blantant and continual misrepresentation of the public she is supposed to be serving.",
