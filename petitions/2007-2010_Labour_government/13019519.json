            "background": "A lot of people with certain disabilities (including those with Osteogenesis Imperfecta) are to drink 2 pints of milk per day. At a large supermarket chain, this would cost 86p. This costs \u00a3313.90 per year per child. In the current recession, the prices are going up and people\u2019s earnings are going down. People should be given vouchers to collect 2 pints of milk per day or a weekly voucher for when they go shopping. This could be collected from the post office or sent via the post, in the formation of a book (similar to the rations book).",
