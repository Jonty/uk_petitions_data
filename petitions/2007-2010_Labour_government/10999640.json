            "background": "Preston City Council is currently planning a major development of the city centre resulting in the destruction of Preston's historic Bus Station, the closure of several businesses and even the destruction of some people's homes (including one 94 year old lady). Despite many objections to these plans Preston City Council is more than happy to continue with the development using compulsory purchase orders if necessary simply because a large financial backer is supporting the project.\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to make Preston City Council listen to it's residents and put a stop to this project which is going to devastate many people, knock down historic buildings and force several small businesses to close",
