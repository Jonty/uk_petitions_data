        "action": "Introduce a 35 year rolling road tax exemption for historic cars",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently the 25 year rolling tax exemption for historic vehicles has been suspended on environmental grounds. The government\u2019s stance on environmental grounds is substantive however historic vehicles are being lost due to the suspension of a rolling exemption creating a historic \u201chole\u201d in the tax legislation which is neither fair nor equitable. The number of vehicles over 35 years old is relatively small and the cost of maintenance alone results in the total mileage conducted by these vehicles as being miniscule in terms of carbon emissions. A rolling exemption revamped to being 35 years  would give a small initial increase in that the current cut off date would change to being only 1974, a change of 2 years on the current situation. However the reversion to it being a rolling exemption would allow for the retention of a sample of vehicles from each year for future generations to enjoy as historic vehicles. We urge consideration of this proposed change which meets the government\u2019s environmental approach whilst supporting the history of our nation.",
