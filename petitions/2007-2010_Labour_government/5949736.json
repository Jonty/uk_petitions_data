        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The BBC plans to launch an on-demand tv service which uses software that will only be available to Windows users. The BBC should be allowed to target software platforms that are in wide use, for whilst it may initially exclude certain people from watching - the BBC has allready announced plans to provide the iPlayer for the Mac, and has never ruled out developing it for other platforms such as Linux.  The BBC provide 'services for everyone, free of commercial interests and political bias'. However historically, they have often launched services to 'the few' initially, and then expanded it to be more inclusive over time, rather than waiting for the technology to be developed fully and doing 'one big launch' - this is the sensible approach, and allows the BBC to 'roll out' services, rather than needlessly excluding everyone from accessing newer technology, when it could so easily be launched now.",
