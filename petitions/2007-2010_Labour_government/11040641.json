The only choice is to fill out the ballot paper incorrectly to make it void. This is then reported as a spoilt ballot paper and not as a rejection of the candidates.\nIt is important in a democratic society that we have the right not to vote for any of the candidates.\nMaybe then all political parties would see how discontent the general populace are with them by the number of \"None of the Above \" votes that are cast.\nThis will enable many people to still execute their democratic rights without having to elect a person they do not feel is worth of the job.",
