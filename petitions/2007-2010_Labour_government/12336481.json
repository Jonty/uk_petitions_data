Did you you forget the oyster? \n\n2)Your child gets in trouble for vandalism. You're left with a hefty fine. Were you at the scene whispering from the sidelines? Did you provide the spray can?\n\nWhy should you get fined for things your child has done outside your control? Fair enough that your child may be financially incapable to pay the fine themselves, but if they are put on probation or tag and have to do community service. Shouldn't this be enough?",
