            "background": "It came to my attention recently, when my nephew, who has been unemployed for approx two years, tried to get onto a Building skills training course.\n\nThe Catch... \nIf he does this course, he will lose his Job seekers allowance.....no other allowances or support would be available.\n\nTherefore, he cannot do this as he would have no means of living, or paying bus fares to the training centre.\n\nThis is a free training course in plastering, plumbing, bricklaying and carpentry over a 12 weeks period, run by the Croydon Enterprise Scheme.\n\nAt the end of the course you get an industry-recognised certificate, enabling the holder to work on construction sites.\n \n\nIt's Utter Madness, in these times of high unemployment, that the government (or their agencies) are preventing people who want to work from getting the skills to obtain work.",
