However, that does not necessarily mean that an offender will spend the rest of his or her life in prison.'\nThis is unacceptable to the taxpayer and anyone of any moral fibre. When someone is handed down a 'life sentance', they should indeed remain imprisoned for the rest of their lives, and anything less is misleading to the public, deceiving them into thinking that justice is being done.",
