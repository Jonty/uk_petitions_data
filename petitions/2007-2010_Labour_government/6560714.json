            "background": "The goverment are wondering what to do about child poverty? Wondering how to get parents of benefits and into work? Well stop allowing and facilitalting the cruel 'Family court arena'. The parents get put in the arena like a couple of dogs pitting it out to see who can fight the longest. Single parents living under the stress of this life of trawling backwards and forwards to court at the beck and call of their childs father cannot sustain any decent job and be a good enough parent. The threat as it stands is biased towards the mother if she disagree's with contact she is threatend with prison or loss or residence of her children this needs to be equal to fathers aswell that let their children down. They may then only consider court if it really is all about them being a good father to their child/ren rather than controlling the mother that has dared to leave them!",
