He sent a cheque for \u00a3365 ( 2 weeks of his salary) with his passport, application form and all required documentation on the 21st August to Indian Visa Supermarket, The cheque was cleared through the bank on the 25th August and since then he has phoned every day without any news. His passport and documentation has not been returned and no-one appears to know when the embassy will respond. Unless he can reach Goa by the end of October he will lose the offer of employment.Under the present system he willlose \u00a3365 and cannot look for other employemnt abroad because he has not got his pasport back.
