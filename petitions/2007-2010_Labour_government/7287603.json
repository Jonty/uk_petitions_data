The hunt will include humpback whales for the first time.\nJapan plans to kill 950 whales. Australia, Britain and New Zealand condemned the decision to go ahead with the catch. \nHumpback whales, protected under a 1966 moratorium are renowned for their complex songs and acrobatic displays.\nOnly Norway and Iceland openly defy a 1986 moratorium on commercial hunting of all whales. Japan argues that it abides by the agreement with its \u2018scientific research\u2019 but meat from the hunt goes on dinner plates.\nBritain is considering making a \"high-level diplomatic protest\" to Japan, said a spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.",
