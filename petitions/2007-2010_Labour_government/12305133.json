        "background": "In April 2006, the Home Office retrospectively changed the conditions for Work Permit and HSMP visa holders, extending the requirement to achieve Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) to five years instead of the original four years they were promised. The retrospective change to the ILR requirements was challenged in the High Court by a group of HSMP visa holders (HSMP Forum Ltd) through a judicial review. The judgement on the 6th of April 2009 requested the Border Agency to apply the original ILR conditions to all pre-April 2006 HSMP visa holders. Since Work Permit scheme was also a route to ILR, we request the Prime Minister to request the Border Agency to apply the same conditions to those work permit holders who were originally eligible for ILR in four years (pre-April 2006).",
