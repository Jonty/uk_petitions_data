        "background": "Living with a disablement is quite challenging in itself especially when you have to use a power wheelchair which when travelling abroad having your chair in the hold you are always fearful that something will either get broken or misplaced where at your destination sometimes you discover you can\u2019t operate your wheelchair, also when having to be carried onboard to the seat its quite undignified to the individual.\n\nWe would like to appeal to the government to enforce a ruling towards airlines where aeroplanes should be made to allow disabled passengers that use a wheelchair to travel in their chair which would be clamped down and have a seat belt device... my idea would be to have one designated zone reserved for wheelchairs having a row to fit four power wheelchairs!",
