            "background": "Adults of both sexes who buy and sell sexual services should not be criminalised. Sex between consenting adults should remain free from state interference. The government should listen to the opinions of those who work in the sex industry, and ignore those with fundamentalist 'feminist' or religious views who seem to have little understanding of the realities. I believe that there is plenty of evidence that the majority of those who sell sexual services in the UK do so willingly, and that the majority of those who buy sexual services are not abusive. There are far more enlightened 'models' operating in such countries as Holland, Germany, Australia and New Zealand. The proposed 'Nordic model' would result in prostitution going 'underground' to a greater extent and would result in worse outcomes for the providers of sexual services. It is virtually impossible for normal human sexual urges to be eradicated by the proposed 'Nordic model'.",
