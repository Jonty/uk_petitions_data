Norman was a P.O.W in Germany for over 3 years and lost a foot at Dunkirk. He is petrified about returning home on his home with very little care. Is this the way we should be treating the Heroes who gave us what we have today. Ex-sevicemen like Norman have given this country a lot, let us not ignore them in their time of need.",
