            "background": "We the Citizens of bath request that the Thermae Bath Spa be closed down to reduce council tax bills. This project which was 5 years late in being delivered and over budget by 3 times the original estimate is a white elephant. It is situated in a back street with no parking and poor access. The on going law suits between the developer and bath city council has been going on for many years at the tax payer\u2019s expense. It is state in local press that residents will be funding this project indefinitely and it is very unlikely that the council will ever get any income from the business. We therefore recommend this business be closed and the assets sold to payback some of the costs and reduce the burden on local residents. Please support this cause",
