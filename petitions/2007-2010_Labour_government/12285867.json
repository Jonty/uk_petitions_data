            "background": "In March '09, the Army\u2019s first ever 'show room' opened, between high street shops, in one of London\u2019s poorest / worst boroughs for gun crime. The \u2018show room\u2019 exploits Hackney\u2019s high unemployment rates; offering unbalanced, glitzy views of Army life as an escape from poverty. \n\nIn reality, in Iraq alone, nearly 200 British soldiers (+ 100,000s of civilians) have been killed; many more returning home physically and mentally maimed.\n\nThe \u2018show room\u2019 however, presents the excitement of the Army\u2019s exploits abroad without depicting the traumas of war.\n\nBoasting a \u2018virtual battlefield simulator\u2019, it encourages visitors (over 14 years old) to shoot their friends with replica AF80 hand guns, and test drive virtual tanks. The campaign group, Mothers Against Guns, describes this as \u201cgrossly insensitive in a borough plagued by gun violence\u201d.\n\nThis obscene sanitisation and glorification of war is a waste of tax-payers money; diverted from health, education, and building sustainable communities.\n \nHelp shut down this \u2018show room\u2019 and stop the Army from opening more around the country.",
