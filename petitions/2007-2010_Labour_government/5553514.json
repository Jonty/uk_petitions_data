        "background": "Manual handling training is provided for all professionals working with elderly/sick/disabled people in order to teach them how to lift/reposition those they care for whilst protecting their own backs.\n\nNo such provision is offered to parents of disabled children, who lift and carry them far more than the professionals who work with the children.  As a result a large proportion of  these parents and carers end up with back problems causing them long term discomfort which not only makes their caring duties more challenging but also costs the NHS money in physiotherapy (where available).",
