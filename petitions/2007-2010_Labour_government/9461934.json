        "background": "Have you noticed how the roads in our towns and city centres are getting more and more congested?  It's true.  More and more cars are being used to make an increasing number of journeys on the relatively fixed number of roads! The result: jams, fumes, noise and road rage.\n\nThe Highway Act of 1835 renders the Segway illegal in the UK, everywhere other than on private property (and only with the owner's permission).\n\nModern legislation is required to legalise the use of the Segway on cycle paths in the UK. Modern legislation should also seriously consider whether it would be appropriate to use Segways on Roads and pavements.",
