        "background": "There is a move to prevent GPs dispensing prescriptions. As a result some people in Suffolk will have to travel 10 miles to their nearest chemist. This will be a serious problem for people with no transport, some villages have very little, if any, public transport. And although people with transport will help, the independence for some will be taken away. Also surgeries could close with the loss of this service as often, particularly in rural areas, this is their only real income.  \n \nIf you wish to add our voice to stop this then please add your name to this petition.\n \nTo add your name, click on \"forward\" at the top of this page, add your name to the bottom of the list and send it to all your friends, also include this email address into the email list. \n \nNo one will receive a reply from us unless requested and no third party will contact you either. Your privacy is of vital importance and is protected at all costs. \n \nThe closing date for this petition is 24th November when, only the names will be sent to the Dept of health. (No email addresses will be sent to DoH)",
