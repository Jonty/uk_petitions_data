        "background": "British Board of Film Classification (Accountability to Parliament and Appeals)Bill seeks to\n\n- make provision for parliamentary scrutiny of senior appointments to the British Board of Film Classification and of guidelines produced by it\n\n- to establish a body with powers to hear appeals against the release of videos and DVDs and the classification of works in prescribed circumstances\n\nAt the present time the BBFC is an independent, non-governmental body that classifies films for release in the UK and provides guidance and information for film viewers.\n\nThis Bill would herald a step back to an era of censorship where the Government would decide what adults can and cannot watch.\n\nIf you believe in freedom of artistic expression and the ability of adults to decide what they watch please sign this petition.",
