            "background": "In light of the continuing recession which has been caused by greedy corporations, if feel that the goverment has not gone about this in the correct way. I would like to propose that the goverment in lieu of giving banks billions of tax payers money they should invest in the people of this country. What i mean by that is for intance Mr X has say a \u00a3200k mortage, a few credit cards and say a car on finance. Surely it makes sense to say to Mr X we will pay off all your debts and for 2 years you will live debt free, during this period an agreement can be reached to start paying back at end of the term. In essence everyone is getting what they want as banks and finance companys will get there money back and with more disposable income the people of this ccountry will start to spend, simple!",
