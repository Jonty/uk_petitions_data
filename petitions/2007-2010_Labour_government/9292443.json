            "background": "At the present time if any licence holder decides for any reason to surrender their television licence(e.g moving abroad or with new spouse/partner who already has a licence, etc) they only recieve a rebate if there is a full 3 months credit with that licence. One day less than that and they will recieve nothing. Make T.V. licensing calculate by the day how much is oweing to the licence holder and rebate the full amount.",
