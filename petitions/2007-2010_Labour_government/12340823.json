        "background": "Recent press coverage has brought to light the lack of facility available for those who were baptised as children or adults by the Church of England to remove themselves from parish registers and have official confirmation that they are no longer members of the church.\n\nThe reason for persons requiring such a facility can result from a loss of faith or the conversion to another faith, and is something many people would consider as an important step in their lives.\n\nThe Catholic church provides a simple and efficient procedure, and it is the undersigned's request that the Prime Minister ask the Church of England to provide the same.",
