            "background": "People with Mental Health disorders are not eligible to take part in jury service.\nThis contradicts the governments attempts to get people with disabilities back to work. If people can work why cant they take part in a jury? What about all those people who are living with a mental health disorder who are living normal lives, working, getting married and having children etc. Should they not be treated equally. A mental disorder does not define who you are. Its a part of you but its not all of you. Plenty of people who are diagnosed with Mental Health issues are now stable and would be perfectly capable of sitting on a jury. Time to Change should address this issue. Please sign this to help the government change this.",
