            "background": "All Paris has offered for its conditions (allowing the French to command NATO and to create an autonomous Common European Military) is 1,000 soldiers that would be constrained by caveats anyway. If accepted, French conditions would divide NATO in half and ultimately cause its demise. The British people should be allowed to decide, by referendum, if the division and the ultimate collapse of NATO is what they want, and if the price is worth paying.",
