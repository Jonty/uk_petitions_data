            "background": "Reference to example of other EU countries, like France, Sweden, Denmark and others; we request the government to abandon its intention of returning Iraqi asylum seekers indiscriminately. The Iraqi Christian minority cannot return to Iraq as they are being particularly targeted by Islamic terrorists. Their vulnerability was highlighted by the kidnapping and killing of Archbishop Rahho. If they are returned they face destitution or murder regardless of the security situation. All evidence indicates that Iraqi Christians have integrated in the British society and a larger number should be welcomed. There might be a sense in returning Kurdish refugees to Kurdistan but certainly not those who live in especially dangerous areas such as Mosul. The French government has specifically highlighted the perilous situation of the Christians by deciding to accept 500 Iraqi Christian refugees. The reason given is that the displaced Christians have no support from countries outside Iraq, while Muslim refugees are supported by many Arab and Islamic governments.",
