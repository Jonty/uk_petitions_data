            "background": "Stoke-on-Trent high schools are set for massive regeneration with a plan to close and re-organise our schools.  With the new proposal communities will be segregated, student's are to be pushed into large academies where numbers will be in excess of 1200 children per academy.   Many staff could be left unemployed, yet more job loses for the midlands.  How can this fit with the every child matters agenda? Or are stoke children exempt from this?  What does a private company (SERCo) really know about the education and future of our children?  Why should Stoke-on-Trent suffer?  Many of our schools are already good with others rapidly improving.  Why when the vast majority of our children are happy should we create distressing changes, disrupting their lives at an already difficult and challenging time.  Instead of regenerating schools with closures give schools the funding they desperately require to continue to provide our children with a safe and happy environment, where children and their education and teaching and learning really does matter.  Ask yourself what does SERCo have to gain from our children and their schools?  Most of all what do our children, your future have to lose?",
