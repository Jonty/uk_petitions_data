            "background": "you all lok a bit perplexed when seen on TV on the front bench about why public sector management isn't functioning right and why the public (and service users, like soldiers) are complaining about the care they're receiving ... can I suggest one idea might be to examine time sheet management - look at jurisdiction of who signs, on the wards how staff are paid, liaising with banks. Also cancellation and rotation is a matter.\n\n\nProfessional people with families to support simply wont put up with these shoddy employment practices - like not being paid before heading off to\nM & S rather than work in the heatlh service. As a govt, your minister DO have a legal vicarous liability in this matter.",
