Please you the public must love our countryside and want to keep it preety for future generations.  I see not only the young throwing litter but the elderly aswell.  I thought we needed to respect our elders, but how can we when they are not teaching their children and grandchildren to stop throwing their litter.  If people drop litter they should impose a fine to stop them from doing it again.  Even in the Peak District there was plastic bags everywhere, please stop throwing litter.  We need more bins, please support your own country unless you do not care that this country looks like a refuse site.",
