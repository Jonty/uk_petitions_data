Even Energywatch has stated that there is no real competition in the energy market! This ISN'T competition! This is a cartel!\nIs this what privatisation was meant to bring?\n\nTHIS IS NOT RIGHT! THIS IS NOT DECENT IN A SO-CALLED CIVILISED SOCIETY!\n\nPeople are freezing in their homes, choosing between heating and eating!\nYou may help some groups, but most of us are struggling now to survive as a direct result of fuel poverty!\n\nPeople are GOING TO DIE in their thousands, so shareholders and directors can get rich!\n\nRe-nationalise - NOW! Before it's too late for people who are freezing/ starving and dying! Or are you that far gone to care about the ordinary man and woman in the street?",
