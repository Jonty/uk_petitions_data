            "background": "The PM is talking about a Government that is fair for all, however in the past people were given the right to buy there council house, then the Labour Government introduced a cap on the discount that was allowed. This has led to inequality, for example my neighbours bought there house for \u00a330k and got full discount after the min. required time, I have been in council housing for over 20yr and I am being capped. I am expected to pay over \u00a3110k rather than the \u00a350k I would be paying with equal discount. Fair for all means equality, REMOVE THE CAP.",
