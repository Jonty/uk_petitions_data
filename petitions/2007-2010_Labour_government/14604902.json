People may download illegally because it is too expensive otherwise.  99p for a song!  iTunes is overpriced, and Amazon, HMV and Tesco have now upped their prices.  I always buy songs legally, but am finding it harder not to download illegally, as to do the right thing, and buy songs legally is too expensive.",
