            "background": "Why do we never see criminal charges brought against MP's, are these people above the law! Fraud is Fraud no matter who you are. Frauding the Government is a very serious offence, why do these people get away with it. It makes my blood boil when joe bloggs on the street in most cases would be facing a custodial sentence for Frauding the Government. Vat, Income Tax and Benefit Fraud are only 3 examples that spring to mind, yet these people are lucky if they get a slap on the wrist. Why are the Police not involved, this is something i'd really like to know because i don't understand why not. No more! please sign my petition and hopefully bring an end to this shocking abuse of what is after all our money.",
