        "background": "Farmers use the noisey bird scarers as they claim to need them, but they are very noisey for people living near by and have been proven to be very ineffective. Living near somewhere that uses them is like having someone discharge a shotgun outsude your house every few seconds, I have complained to the local council but they claim there is nothing they can do, so I would like their use to be banned",
