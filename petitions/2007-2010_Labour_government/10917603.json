        "background": "Dear Prime Minister\n\nThe Trasury fails to give clear guidance on proper procedures about how to claim \"tax back\" for \"tool expenses\". Tax offices differ in their interpretation of the facts contained in Section 336 ITEPA 2003.\n\nMany Tax Offices are giving incorrect information and although this is taken up with each office, there has to be clear consensus of \"interpretation\" of the rules across all tax office.\n\nSome offices are rejecting claims and others are making numerous mistakes that after these mistakes are seen in hindsight, tax offices seem unclear about moving forward.\n\nWe ask that HMRC produces a booklet, obtainable easily with clear guidance for the public, how to obtain a legitimate tax refund. Comments like those made by HMRC officers are not necessary as they are a hindrance to claiming tax back. We need a system that will deliver refunds quickly and efficiently and without undue delay.\n\nSIGNED\n\nTHE AUTO MECHANIC & \"OTHER EMPLOYEES\"",
