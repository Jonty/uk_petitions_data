            "background": "At present there are a number of different rules, though out the country for disabled motorists, when it comes to parking and road tolls. \n\nEngland and Wales, should be the SAME as Scotland, and therefore, the time limits on parking should be removed, as it is in Scotland, and the need to use or display a parking clock with the badge also removed.\n\nSome towns set different rules for parking with a blue badge than others (especially in London) leading to confusion, they should all follow the SAME rules. \n\nAlso, various road tolls have various different rules for obtaining an exemption, again this should be made the SAME for all road tolls, and should be by showing a valid blue badge, rather than some of the more complicated ways currently used by toll operators.",
