            "background": "As a young person,being put in a secure psychiatric unit was the most traumatising event of my life. Young people were restrained unnecessarily, given medicine against their wills and put in seclusion for up to 24 hours at a time without any toilet breaks, food or water. A young person's place is at home with their families, not in a place where the prison option might be preferable. Whilst I appreciate that open psychiatric units do a fantastic job, young people deserve the respect that an informal patient has. These horrendous places claim to be intensive care unit- therefore give the patients intensive care.",
