        "action": "review the current sick pay system to improve public health by encouraging people with contagious illness to take time off and stay at home",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "While most working people are financially covered for periods of sickness by there employer not all are. These people are currently covered by government paid statutory sick pay. The problem is that in both situations you have to have been ill for several days before these benefits kick in and then they are only a fraction of the usual wages. The benefits are not paid immediately or to the full rate to deter people from taking advantage and to get them back to work quickly. \n\nThe problem with the current sick pay system is that it also deters people with illness that present a public health hazard (such as swine flu) from taking time off. Some cannot afford to take time off and ignore doctors advice going to work anyway, potentially infecting work colleagues and the general public. This is particularly true of people in low paid jobs, such as shop workers who can come into contact with hundreds of people a day. \n\nI propose a system where by if a doctor signs you off work due to concern for public health you would get paid in full, and there would be no waiting period. This would enable individuals time to get well without the financial worry, and reduce the chances of making more people ill.",
