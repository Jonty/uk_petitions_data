        "background": "I wish to petition the Prime Minister to change the law and stop County and District Councils ripping all of us off by setting meters in council car parks to not give out change. It is disgusting that we, the British public have to pay extortionate parking fees as it is without councils having the cheek to rip us off even more. It's time this came to a stop. In this day and age, the giving out of change is the least that can be expected. One would be enraged if whilst purchasing goods at a high street store, the attendant refused to give out change. As this is the case, how can the local councils refuse? It's time the government stopped making a mockery out of people, you tax us enough without these sly little tactics.",
