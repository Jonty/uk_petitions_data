        "background": "Every day I go out- walking or driving, I see at least 3 people using their mobiles whilst driving. The recent penalty increase has obviously not worked. I have been touched and angered by the recent death of Victoria Mcbryde- who was killed by a driver who had been texting and phoning whilst driving at 70mph. I cannot find the petition from Victorias` family on the PMs web site, so I have started another now, after I heard Victorias family on BBC PM programme. I do hope Victorias family are upset by my action. Thank you.",
