            "background": "At present the CSA will only recognise one parent as being the 'Resident' parent when mum and dad are separated.  The CSA considers the parent that claims the Child Benefit to be the Resident Parent, even when that parent actually has the child less than the 'non resident' parent and will order that parent to pay the other.  This is completely unjust.  We want a change in the CSA to recognise shared care.  In our situation mum has our little girl on a Mon and Tues, she is home with us on a Wed, Thurs and Fri and we alternate weekends.  We are ordered to pay mum.  Simply because she claimed the Child Benefit when our little girl was born and we never changed it to ourselves.  (we are in the process of changing it now) but have to pay mum in the mean time.  We buy our little girl's clothes, school shoes/uniform, books, toys and food.  It is a ridiculous situation.  Completely immoral.  The CSA refers to us as the 'non resident parent'.  Is this what you want for your child?  This needs to be changed, please give your support.",
