            "background": "Marillion are one of the most enduring and innovative bands in the country today. In their 25 year recording career they have released 14 albums. That's more than U2 and the Rolling Stones!\nThe Bristol Colston Hall have chosen to put Paul Young's name on their \"roll of honour\" above the bar. Whilst he may be a worthy purveyor of '80s pop; playing the revival circuit in holiday camps across the country is no match for Marillion's ability to remain at the cutting edge of music. Coupled with that they have embraced new technology being internet and multi media pioneers.",
