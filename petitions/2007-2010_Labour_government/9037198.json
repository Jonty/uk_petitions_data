            "background": "I'd like the prime minister to ensure that lottery grants/funds get distributed evenly based on population %.\n\nThe searches were done from the lottery grants website and based on 1 search only with the religious keyword (EG Christian) within the 'receiver' field.\n\nPopulation data was taken from the national statistics website and is from a sample they took of 60,000 people. I've chosen \u00a365million as a base-population figure for the uk (again taken from the website). Please note that the population sample is from April 2001.\n\nThe results are :\n\n46,540,000 Christian people making 71.6% of population. \u00a311,794,558 in lottery grants, making \u00a30.25 per person\n\n1,755,000 Muslim people making 2.7 % of population. \u00a35,258,197 in lottery grants, making \u00a32.30 per person\n\n650,000 Hindu people making 1 % of population. \u00a33,773,834 in lottery grants, making \u00a35.81 per person\n\n325,000 Jewish people making 0.5% of population. \u00a38,924,609 in lottery grants, making \u00a327.46 per person.\n\nIn a multicultural society all faiths should be equal, so lottery grant-distribution should be looked at.",
