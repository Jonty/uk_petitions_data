            "background": "Germany is the alliance's least solidary member. The Germans:\n1) Have deployed 3000 soldiers to northern Afghanistan but did not allow them to fight or even deploy to the south. Even if they deployed 300,000 soldiers there, they wouldn't have helped.\n2) Have REFUSED to provide extra helicopters for ISAF, which ISAF DESPERATELY needs.\n3) Refused to back further UN sanctions against the Iranians, who are developing nuclear weapons.\n\nNo other state has been as disruptive as Germany. And while the French are trying to rejoin NATO's military structure and are sacrifying their soldiers in Afghanistan, the Germans are not just refusing to help, but even disturbing.",
