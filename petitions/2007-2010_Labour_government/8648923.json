For some reason Top Gear consistently ignore the Ultima GTR despite the factory, in desperation - independantly running a much faster time on the Top Gear test track.  As a BBC program, Top Gear should be supporting the British Car Industry.  They should be actively promoting British made cars.  There have been many requests for them to feature this car, but so far they have fallen on deaf ears.",
