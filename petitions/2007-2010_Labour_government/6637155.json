        "background": "The recent spate of unpublicised contamination of marijuana crops sold in the UK has left millions of casual users at risk from silica poisoning - an extremely serious and potentially lethal disease. This is a direct result of marijuana only being obtainable on the black market and being removed from government quality controls. \n\nBy refusing to legalise a drug that has  been shown to have the most harmful consequences when smoked in excessive amounts by the young, the government is placing many millions of people at risk of a deadly physical ailment, instead of protecting a few from possible mental side-effects brought about by serious over-use. \n\nLegalise marijuana and protect its smokers.",
