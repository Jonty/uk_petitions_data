            "background": "The UK is an island surrounded by very stormy seas and very bad weather (most of the time). What happens when there's a storm or relatively bad weather? You get wind - and in the UK theres a lot of it. Surely the creation of many many more (than there already are) wind-turbines on and off shore would benefit the UK greatly. We could become one of the worlds leaders in the generation of wind-power. Just look at Denmark, it has countless amounts of wind-turbines (as seen by myself). Additionally, in Denmark around 90 percent of the national output is exported, and in 2003 the industry employed some 20,000 people and had a turnover of around 3 billion euros. Taking into account the smaller size of land that has to be powered in Denmark of that to the UK, it could still work as an economic advantage as well as an environmental one.",
