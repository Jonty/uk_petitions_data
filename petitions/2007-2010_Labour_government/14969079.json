            "background": "The State Pension age for women will increase gradually from 60 to 65 over a ten year period, starting April 2010. The qualifying age for concessionary bus travel, for both men and women, is linked to the State Pension age for women. Therefore, the qualifying age for concessionary bus travel will also increase from 60 to 65 over a ten year period, starting April 2010. We think that represents a double financial burden on women and is unfair to men. Therefore we would like to see the qualifying age for concessionary bus travel remain at 60, for the foreseeable future.",
