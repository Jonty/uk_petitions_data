            "background": "This is a counter-petition in opposition to the one requesting public funding to keep the Vulcan flying. The people who wasted vast sums of money getting the Vulcan aircraft back in the air must have realised how much it would cost to keep it flying. Therefore. they should have ensured that sufficient ongoing private funding would be achievable before they set out on this foolhardy venture. 7 Regiment Army Air Corps (Volunteers) is about to be disbanded as a cost-saving measure. If any funding were to be made available at a time of economic recession it would be totally inappropriate if it were to be directed to an expensive and unnecessary relic of the UK's former military inventory rather than much-needed additional support for our current Armed Services.",
