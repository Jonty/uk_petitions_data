            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Absent parents, regardless of personal financial circumstance, are having to pay for their children irrespective of their ex spouses or partners income. In many cases, ex partners have had to sell their houses or have had goods seized to make these payments inrrespective of the wealth of their ex partner. There have have been a number of related suicides because of this. The courts and the CSA clearly favour the parent who have the children regardless of guilt or wealth to the detriment of the absent parent. The absent parent does not enjoy tax relief or child benefit even when they have the children. The wealth of both parents or partners should be taken into consideration if we are to avoid further deaths or payment induced poverty. Please sign this petition and help rid us of these evil laws that are killing people.",
