        "background": "I am sick of hearing on the news about innocent children and adults who are terrorised by their parents or strangers and end up being killed for no reason.  I want these offenders to pay for the abuse and harm they do, I want capital punishment to be reintroduced to avoid these monsters being tucked up in a cushty jail for 3 years, playing the latest Xbox game and not being punished for their actions. They need to take responsibility for what they do.  With advances in science we can get the right people who commit the crimes!Then we can use the money saved on jail expenses to help our societies to become better places!",
