Many people these days view the police as a joke and know that they won\u2019t be dealt with in a physical way, even if they assault the police.\nIf is completely ridiculous that the police should have to put up with abuse and threats.  They have a baton, however, many of the police offers I have spoken to are afraid to use it, because of the consequences, to defend themselves when confronted by an offender who cannot be restrained by the use of word or CS-Gas.",
