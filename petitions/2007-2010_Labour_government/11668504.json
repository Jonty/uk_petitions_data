            "background": "I have worked in Social Care for over 9 years. Sadly things are not improving, in fact they are getting worse. Harriet Sergeants Handle with care report details the failings of the Care System. Many Social Services knowingly allow children to be abused at home or in care, Baby P, Victoria Climbie and Shannon Matthews are just three that made the news. Private care companies charge thousands and benefit from each abused child. The Care System is failing and costing the tax payer money, and children are on a daily day abused by paid staff. This must come to an end. I dedicate this petition to the dry mouthed, terrified child that somewhere right now in a UK Private Care homes prepares to meet their abuser.",
