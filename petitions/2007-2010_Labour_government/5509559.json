            "background": "Its a fundamental element of democracy for the members of government representing the people to be voted for by the people. Short of a death, the leader of the elected government is voted and approved by the electorate (Thats you and me, the public on mass.) as representing a party with a set of policies to lead the country forward. Yet we are now being lead by a Prime minister none of us voted for !! ?? !!\nA one candidate leadership election is not an election. \n\nEnglish democracy has been a model of example and the basis for development across the world, Don't let us be an example of a potential big brother state of the future.\n\nPlease sign this petition calling for an official Labour party leadership election, or if no one is willing to stand against Mr Brown, a general election at the earliest possible date. Let us decide on who we want as prime minister and restore democracy to Britain\n\n Sign this petition now, show you care about your country and believe there is a better way forward",
