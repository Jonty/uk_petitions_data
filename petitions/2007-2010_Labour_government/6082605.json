            "background": "The idea that children can cross international boarders on a passport containing a photo that bares no likeness to the child is pointless.\nHaving a child's passport updated every year to protect from abduction, or misuse by another if you are unfortunate enough to have your passports lost or stolen speaks for itself. Travelers ignoring this would then be refused passage and unable to leave the point of departure until they have proved to be legitimate parents/guardians of the child/children they have in there charge. With a bit of luck the rest of the world will follow suit.",
