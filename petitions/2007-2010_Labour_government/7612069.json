        "background": "Stephen Green, sole member of Christian Voice, has spent several years tirelessly trying to bring a Christian slant to alternative comedy in this country, campaigning against the BBC showing Jerry Springer: The Opera on the grounds of blasphemy rather than it not being very good, campaigning against homosexuals, Muslims and cancer sufferers as part of 'a religion of peace and love'. Truly this is British satire at it's best.",
