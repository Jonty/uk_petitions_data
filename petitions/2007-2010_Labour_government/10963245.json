If the food and drinks industry were to do like wise that the consumption of their food and drinks can cause serious damage to health and even death, their products would be withdrawn from all the shelves and on it goes for every industry. Retailers would just not be allowed to sell such products to the general public. Yet, the Government actually states on every cigarette packet that \"This is a Government health warning: cigarettes can cause serious damage to health and even death\" and then allows it to be sold through every outlet.  It is allowing faulty and dangerous goods to be sold generally with full knowledge. Revenue received by the Government from the cigarette industry is an odious resource.  Surely, the Government can be prosceuted.",
