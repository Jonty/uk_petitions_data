            "background": "Playing the system to line one's pockets from Taxpayers money is wrong, whether it is done by Benefit cheats or MP's. It is actually even worse when done by MP's who are paid good salaries but then become greedy. Not only have they misused public money, but have seriously abused their positions. They must be brought to book. If they are allowed to get away with it by simply saying sorry then the same rules must apply to benefit cheats. There can NOT be one rule for the rich and famous and a different rule for the poor or \"ordinary\" people. Where is the Justice system here. The Prime Minister must lead the way and demand prosecutions.",
