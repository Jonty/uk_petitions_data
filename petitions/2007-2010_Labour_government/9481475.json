        "action": "Introduce laws banning the purchase of crude oil without intention of taking possession.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With crude oil prices being distorted by investors speculating that prices will rise, the price of oil is currently increasing at an unprecedented rate.  This does not reflect true demand for oil.  We believe that if it were illegal to purchase oil without intention to take possession, speculators will move to other forms of investment, such as housing etc., thereby relieving the upward pressure on prices.  As a consequence there is scope that the housing market may not falter as much as predicted and that inflationary pressures will decrease.  We believe that the government should ban all companies, investment funds and individuals registered, represented or resident in the UK from purchasing crude oil if they are unable to take possession of the oil. This may be implement via a licencing system.  By working with other governments worldwide we believe this system will work.  The same could also be be said about other commodities.",
