            "background": "Royal Mail workers, like the Police, should be prevented from taking industrial action. By constantly disrupting postal services they greatly and disproportionately inconvenience all individuals and organisations, causing delays, extra costs, and other hardship to innocent people.  The Royal Mail has a legal remit to deliver post trusted to it, and this should not be subject to industrial disputes.  If needs be, the government can set up an independent industry ombudsman which could hear grievances and settle arguments, whilst guaranteeing that the post continues to be delivered.",
