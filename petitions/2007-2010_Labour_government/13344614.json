        "background": "Sir David Attenborough has been responsible for creating some of the best television ever broadcast on our television screens. Beginning with Zoo Quest as his first programme in the 1950s he was appointed controller of BBC2 where he commissioned programmes such as Match of the Day, The Likely Lads, Whicker's World and The Old Grey Whistle Test.\nTurning down the chance to become Director General of the BBC he returned to making television programmes that have included Life on Earth, The Living Planet and The trials of Life.\n\nHis work on promoting the environment, ecology and biodiversity has been a mainstay of his work that deserves recognition above the knighthood he has already received.",
