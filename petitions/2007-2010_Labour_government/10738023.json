        "background": "Sri Lankan Government is keen on a military solution to the ethinic conflict.  Thousands of people are being killed and human right abuses are widespread with the world essentially blind to the conflict.  We, British have a close relationship with commonwealth countries.  Tony Blair brokered a peace deal in Sierra Leon allowing a deal with the Government and rebels.  Northern Ireland is far better that before.  Tamil tigers do not pose an international threat.  They have been fighting on a local issue ie autonomy for tamils.  A British / EU / US / Indian brokered peace deal is what required to save thousands of innocent people including many children and women who have taken the brunt of the latest war.  We urge the Prime Minister to intervene immediately.",
