            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Although Guy Fawkes was rightly condemned for treason for attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament, it is wrong in the 21st century and the current multifaith society to continue to hold November 5th celebrations.  It was as much about the persecution of Catholics as it was about simple treason.  For these reasons, it should not be commemorated, especially in the light of new legislation showing respect to other faiths.  Many people are also injured on November 5th.  It is better to have fireworks at other celebrations such as New Year, and encourage more attendance at organised events using fireworks.  Thank you.",
