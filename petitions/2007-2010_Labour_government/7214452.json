        "background": "Basically it's like this. I had a car that i had owned 4 2 yrs & had planned to keep for the rest of my life as i loved that car & had spent a lot of money (\u00a37000+) on maintanence & restoring not inc. t&t & insuring every year. I had been made temporaraly homeless so had to leave my car outside my friends in an off street parking bay. It was covered up as had no t&t. It was not t&t as i had to spend all the money i had repairing it after it was stolen but only after being outsides my friends for about 2 weeks i got a call from my friend saying the Police or Council had come & taken it away to be crushed. I was not happy as i had only just spent over \u00a31000 on the repairs caused by the thieves & by this time had a place to live so i could once again get my car on the road. Since then i have not owned a good, safe car & do not maintain my cars as it seems a waste of time & money if the councils & police can just come anytime they like & remove my car. Anyone that has had similar experiences then please sign my petition as its not on. I have friends that have had the same problems as me in the past so have now had to fence their gardens off etc to stop prying eyes.",
