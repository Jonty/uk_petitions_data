            "background": "Leeds tram was canceled in 2005. This is despite an election commitment to build 25 new tram systems, and the fact that Leeds is the largest city in Europe without a Light rail or metro system. The government claimed at the time, and in a response to a previous petition on the issue, that it could be served instead by a \"high quality bus system\". If so, then why have all the other major European cities gone for a light rail rather than bus-based system? Probably because buses have a long-term higher operating cost than trams (due to shorter life of vehicles, and higher running and maintenance costs of buses), but primarily because research has shown that the travelling public do not see buses as an attractive alternative to trams. Buses are slow, and are seen as being dirty and smelly. Just face it, PEOPLE DON'T LIKE BUSES!",
