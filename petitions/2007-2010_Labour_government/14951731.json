            "background": "Foreign students contribute over five billion pounds to the British economy every year. But the Feb 10, 2010 regulations introduced by the UK Border Agency have tried to undermine their contributions. We, therefore, would like to draw attention to abrogate those rules and maintain status quo ante including ensuring right to work for all the foreign students for up to 20 hours per week during the term time and full time for their dependants, making arrangement for transfer of visa to other college for students whose college\u2019s sponsor license has been suspended and/or canceled without any financial burden to student as long as they have valid visa and ensuring congenial environment for overseas students and their dependants to live, study and work in the UK.",
