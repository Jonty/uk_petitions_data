        "background": "With the recent discussion around the subject of devolution and the very vocal support of the Union from the PM and other MPs, perhaps it is time that they put an end to the absurd practice of businesses in England refusing to accept Scottish banknotes as payment. These notes are afterall legal tender. If supporters of the Union wish for Scotland to be seen as an important part of the UK, then perhaps they will help erase Scottish bad-feeling towards English businesses caused by the refusal to accept Scottish money.",
