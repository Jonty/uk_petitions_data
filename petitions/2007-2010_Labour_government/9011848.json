        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Small local rural post offices serve an important function for the community and prevent unnecesssary car journeys to adjacent towns, but they sometimes have insufficient demand to be viable.  A mobile post office, on the other hand, can spend small periods in each of many locations, adapting the weekly schedule as required to cope with demand.  This results in an environmental benefit, while saving on subsidies to small PO's. Most problems with trials only a few years ago have now been addressed, by advances in mobile telecommunications that would allow the facility to remain online whenever open for business.  \nIf viable, these could no doubt be created as a public/private partnership.\n(They could collect from mailboxes along their route too)",
