            "background": "This is to create for dentists that have just finished there studies have a 3 year contact to stay within the NHS on completeing there course. This will make sure that we have enough dentists for the NHS and i think its only fair as we the tax payer, pay for some of their studies. And will also ensure we have dentists for everyone. So when they start thier course they sign a contract that they will stay in the NHS for 3 years. I Think 3 years is not a long time for them and after the 3 years they have the choice to stay in the NHS or go else where. This will ensure that we have a constant intake of NHS dentists.",
