            "background": "Stop plans to build nuclear power sations\nIt is a fact that the waste form nuclear power plants is immensely toxic to all living things, and takes many thousands of years to become even relatively safe. The government are not only proposing to build more Nuclear power plants, but also to pay councils a fee to store the industries highly toxic waste in supposedly secure underground bunkers. This is a legacy that we the public do not want to pass on to ours and others children.\nChernobyl is proof that these facilities are not failsafe and the resulting impact on people and the environment was irreparable.\nThere are still many options open besides using nuclear energy and fossil fuels, and the Government should take all steps to utilise these rather than using methods that can have very grave consequences for humans and the environment",
