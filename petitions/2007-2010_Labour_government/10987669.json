            "background": "The recent misguided broadcast by Russell Brand and Jonathon Ross regarding the grand daughter of the actor Andrew Sachs has been the subject of the usual over the top media campaign with the BBC receiving 27,000 complaints even though 26,998 people haven't even heard it. Yet in this week of political turmoil as a result of the alledged conduct of MPs and Lords, despite further concerns over the economic crisis that this country is facing and despite the death and misery that continues to occur across the Globe, the Prime Minister took time out to place pressure on the BBC to sack Brand and Ross confirming that he is at heart a Daily Mail reader. Instead he should be applauding the BBC and Radio 2 in particular for pushing broadcasting to its artistic limits, providing a voice for the forgotten generation (the 30-45 year olds) and securing the services of two extremely clever and funny guys. An apology from both to the real person offended in all this (Andrew Sachs) should have sufficed. I therefore petition the Prime Minister to remember not to sweat the small stuff, get on and govern this country and make amends for his action by calling for the re-instatament of Ross and Brand.",
