Could the police explain why there was one installed a few yards from a relative's house. She has lived in the same house since 1973 and has only have seen 2 accidents in that time. Another one is a revenue generating one as it's just placed near a 40mph/50mph zone. There are no signs telling us where does the 40mph start. So everyone who I know who has been caught by this camera were going 48-51 mph. Plus, they cannot find a reason for the road to become 50mph to 40mph",
