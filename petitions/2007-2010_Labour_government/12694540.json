            "background": "Will you honour your promise? The Jewel in our Constitional Crown,is the Coronation Oath made by our Monarch on taking office. Central to the Oath made by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II  was the following question from the Archbishop of Canterbury on June 2nd 1953:\n \n\"Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel and the Protestant reformed religion established by law?\"\n \nIn answer to this question the Queen answered,\n \n\"ALL THIS I PROMISE TO DO.\"\n \nEvery member of our present government and established church has made their commitment by oath or affirmation to the Monarch.Because of the Queens Oath, this is a commitment to govern and educate Britain in the ways of the living God. All members of the Britsh Nation are as obligated to the Queens Oath as she herself is. \n \nWithout faith it is impossible to please God and He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. \n \nSo we are calling upon you to call this Nation to rise up in prayer and action and challenge your church and government to honour their promise to the Almighty God, to turn this Nation to the One true God of the Bible.",
