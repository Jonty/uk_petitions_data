            "action": "Call upon the Government to pass a law, amending the British Constitution, which does exist in written form, though not in one single document. The new law should make it impossible for the Westminster Parliament to transfer powers to the European Parliament without the explicit consent, by referendum, of the British People. This is an issue which should have cross-party consent. If possible, the law should be applied retrospectively, indicating that the current Prime Minister\u2019s assent to the Treaty of Lisbon be declared null and void.",

            "background": "I have searched the resolutions listed here. Although some make points which are similar, none, as far as I can see, make this specific point.\nSome make a call for constitutional reform. This is definitely right and should be pursued.\nThe first step should be to introduce legally binding, obligatory by law referendums for any transference of power from the Westminster Parliament to the European Parliament.\nThis should be an issue which has cross-party consent and should have been passed decades ago. British Prime Ministers in the 1970\u2019s used to allow referendums  on this. At this time, the British Constitution, should have been amended to ensure that all subsequent Prime Minister\u2019s were legally obliged to do so.",
