            "background": "Bearing in mind the ill feelings surrounding MP's expenses which to be honest are a disgrace of the highest degree.. \n\nI am starting a campaign to ask the government for a \"gesture of goodwill\" in this current economical climate and let UK tax payers have either a rebate of the past 12 months tax that has been paid by them, or a tax holiday for 12 months. \n\nThis would help to re-dress the fair balance of us being able to spend tax payers money on ourselves instead of MP's doing it for us and surrounding themselves with luxurious items from my money.. \n\nI'm not a greedy person, and I would settle for a \u00a3600 widescreen tv, and not the \u00a32,500 ones that MP's seem to like.! -Come to think of it, if MP's are so busy that they need a second home as they are at work so much, why do you need a tv ?\n\nPlease sign the campaign to get your tax back.. -you have earned it, not them.. \n\nIf you are not happy with the goods or services you recieve from a shop, you show your reciept and ask for your money back.. -So, dear Prime minister.. I have my payslips which are my receipts, I am not happy with what I have seen and received for my money.. please can I have a refund.!!",
