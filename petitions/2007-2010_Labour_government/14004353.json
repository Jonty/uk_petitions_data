        "background": "The Ickham Residents Action Committee was formed in 2009 to object to uncontrolled development in close proximity to our historic, medieval Kent village which is in a Conservation Area. IRAC has overwhelming support from residents and other groups. The surrounding landscape has been created by centuries of traditional farming on Grade 1 Agricultural Land. IRAC is campaigning against a retrospective application for planning permission for 17 hectares of permanent polytunnels with tabletops on the edge of Ickham. IRAC supports a healthy rural economy but not at the expense of environment and amenity. Our first aim is to persuade Canterbury City Council to reject this application, or to implement IRAC\u2019s compromise of a reduction of six blocks with thorough screening of those remaining. Our second aim is to persuade CCC to formally ask Kent County Council for Planning Guidance on polytunnels, in particular for those in, or close to, Conservation Areas, AONBs and residential communities.",
