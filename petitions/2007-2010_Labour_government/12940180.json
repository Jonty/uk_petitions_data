            "background": "We recognise that the long overdue major works required to improve traffic flow on the M62 in West Yorkshire between Junctions 25 and 30 may have to be done 'on the cheap', using Active Traffic Management rather than proper 4-lane widening as was originally proposed, in these tough times.\n\nHowever motorways are among the safest roads in the country, so we consider the proposed installation of speed cameras on the many overhead gantries to be erected in this scheme to be unnecessary considering there is little safety benefit.\n\nWe have heard too many stories of the gantries and cameras on the pilot M42 scheme being set to inappropriate speeds such as 40mph for incorrect or expired reasoning, forcing motorists to travel at reduced speeds which can increase the risk of accidents due to traffic bunching and generally not flowing naturally.\n\nImplement the cheap solution if you must, but keep Speed Cameras off our motorway.",
