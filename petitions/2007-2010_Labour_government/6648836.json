            "background": "The tube is almost a life-line in London. It generates a lot of business at the expense of people who are merely trying to get by.\nThough I am not an economist I am sure that there exists a business model to operate the tube with no cost to travellers.\nOwnership should not be by a publicly listed company, it should be by a co-operative representing the travellers.\nSponsorship by major businesses in London would also help.\n\nIt does sound very hard, but I'm sure the British spirit is there to pioneer something so incredible as a free city-wide transportation system.",
