            "background": "I do realise this would have an impact on climate change but it would also increase safety; especially with the clocks going back this weekend.  The impetus for this petition, however, was a news story about two children who were KILLED crossing a road; the drivers were unable to see them because THE ROAD WAS UNLIT AT THAT POINT.  I would also make the point that well-lit roads and pavements increase safety for women at night.",
