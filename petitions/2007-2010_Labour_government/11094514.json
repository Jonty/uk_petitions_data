The cost of running the post office would no longer be a burden to the Royal Mail and if the feeling was so strong the community could subsidise it running.\n\nThis proposal wold remove the main bone-of-contention; unprofitable post offices. This would be a satisfactory free market solution that members of the public form all political sides can agree on.",
