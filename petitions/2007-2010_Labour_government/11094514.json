        "background": "The simple answer to closing Royal Mail post offices in rural areas is for the Royal Mail to offer franchises. The cost of running the post office would no longer be a burden to the Royal Mail and if the feeling was so strong the community could subsidise it running.\n\nThis proposal wold remove the main bone-of-contention; unprofitable post offices. This would be a satisfactory free market solution that members of the public form all political sides can agree on.",
