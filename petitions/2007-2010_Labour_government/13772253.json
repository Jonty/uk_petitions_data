This national youth organisation that has over 40,000 members has been hit extremely hard. One of the many problems is that there is to be no pay for any of the adult instructors until April 2010. This could signal the start of the end of this valuable youth organisation that has been in existence for 150 years. At a time when the government is meant to be trying to do more to keep kids of the streets, they are about to see an extra 40,000 children on street corners!",
