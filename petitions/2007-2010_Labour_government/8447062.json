        "background": "It is clear that the public are growing tired of the playground theatrics of the House of Commons during Prime Ministers Questions and the event threatens to alienate voters.\n\nThe Prime Minister, alongside his reform agenda, should take this opportunity to downscale the event or abolish it completely, and instead hold weekly or fortnightly debates. These debates could be held in London, or more frequently in other areas of the country to engage with the general public.\n\nTo further engage the public it should be investigated to see the viability of including new technology in allowing the public to submit, vote upon, and review the party leaders answers to, questions they care to have discussed to such an event.",
