            "background": "A nurse recently stuck off by the Nursing & Midwifery Council for secretly filming neglect and bad practice in a Brighton Hospital, should be reinstated to continue her nursing career.  This should be followed by a rooting out of those responsible in all NHS trusts where an environment of fear leads someone to go to this extreme to reveal the truth about our NHS. The implementation of a process that encourages reporting of issues without repercussion is urgently required, thereby protecting both those working in the NHS and those who use it.",
