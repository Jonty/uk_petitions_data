            "background": "Sporting activities are too expensive for most families nowadays. The government spends a lot of money on the promotion and teaching of healthy living but fails to put their money where their mouth is.  We feel that sporting activities for children such as swimming should be free in ALL areas, not just by some local governments. Also more affordable for adults who accompany their children.  We all know that to eat healthily costs a fortune nowadays too, let's see the government looking into why it is so expensive to buy healthy foods and less expensive to buy fatty foods.",
