        "background": "Marked fixed position speed cameras cause a hazard on our roads due to bunching up of traffic and panic reactions from motorists. They do NOT target the most reckless and irresposible motorists and they unfairly descriminate against professional drivers and frequent motorists who are more likely to set them off by law of averages. There are better ways of improving road safety and these cameras should be melted down and recycled into something more useful.",
