            "background": "At present it is difficult to get divorced after a non molestation and oustre injuction if the evicted spouse does not agree to it. It should be made easier or without the violent partners consent.  The situation would then not be constantly fuelled by having to ask the other party for a signature. Especially if the other party is of no fixed abode and refuses to provide an address. Solicitors don't like these cases and seem to sit on them whilst claiming legal aid for clients. It puts the violated partner and children in danger of the enraged  spouse.",
