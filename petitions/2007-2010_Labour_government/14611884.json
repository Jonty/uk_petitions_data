I get, on average, three to four of these every day at all hours.  Asking them to remove my number never works and I, nor anyone else, should have to waste our time trying to get our telephone numbers removed from computer generated lists where the call has no relevance to the person.  I do not need a loan or help with my debts as I have none, so why am I being called.  They are  nuisance calls and should be treated as such and should be banned or the company calling should be prosecuted.",
