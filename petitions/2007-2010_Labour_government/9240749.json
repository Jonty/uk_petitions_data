            "background": "Currently a typical person can apply for a mortgage direct with a lender, by using a price comparison website, or via a mortgage broker - this in my belief means that consumers do not receive proper independant advice in their best interests. I propose that the Prime Minister orders a review into this, and suggest that lenders can only accept mortgage applications from whole of market, independant advisers who are paid a fee by the consumer (no commission or incentives from lenders)- advisers could then drive initiatives for long term stability e.g. long term fixed rates wihtout onerous penalty clauses & ensure that adequate appropiate mortgage protection is compulsory to tackle, and reduce repossessions. Rememember Lenders only act in their own interests to generate profit for shareholders / members of societies. If you want fair treatment for your probable largest debt in your life vote now please!",
