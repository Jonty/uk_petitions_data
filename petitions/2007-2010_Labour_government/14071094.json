            "background": "How can a Invalid Carers allowance be treated as a taxable benefit? If I am unemployed and receive Jobseekers allowance this will end if I find a job, my status as a Carer of a disabled Child will never end until my demise, I cannot work because of the lack of help given to care for my child if I do work, I do not claim for anything else, I am married and our family tax credit is reduced because my Carers allowance is treated as tax deductable, surely this is wrong, how much money do we carers save the state. It is no wonder many of us slip into poverty, because of our reduced earning powers etc. We are a forgotten minority with so many matters. Ending Invalid Carers allowance being treated as a normal benefit would be a beginning to giving us real help.",
