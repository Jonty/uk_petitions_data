They use s well documented 'Bait and Switch' style scam to rope in new victims and extract huge amounts of money from them. They are equally ruthless to their critics, who are known as Supressive Persons (SPs). In the words of L. Ron Hubbard (the founder of CoS) himself, SPs may be tricked, lied to sued or destroyed. Is this organisaation worthy of the name religion. I say no!",
