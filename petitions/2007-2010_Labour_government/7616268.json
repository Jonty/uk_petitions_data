            "background": "Currently, between 50% and 60% of the nett price of fuel is Fuel Duty. VAT is added on top of this which automatically increases the Fuel Duty by 17.5% - i.e., there is a tax levied on the tax.\n\nAs far as I can tell, VAT is a tax levied on the difference between a commodity's price before taxes and its cost of production. It therefore seems to me that VAT on fuel should be charged just on the price BEFORE Fuel Duty is added.\n\nI call upon the Prime Minister to correct this injustice and stop this Double Taxation.",
