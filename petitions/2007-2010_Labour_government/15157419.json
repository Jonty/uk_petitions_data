        "background": "For a few years now, our colleagues in the nursing profession (to their credit) have begun to take on some of the roles traditionally undertaken by doctors. I this fear has now got out of control and is detrimental to patient safety.\nThere  are many trusts now that have specialist nurses working instead of junior doctors. This is most evident at night and in accident and emergency departments. In doing so, valuable experience is being taken away from doctors.\nSecondly, nurses are trained in a different way to doctors. A doctor studies extensively at medical school before applying knowledge of disease process and relating it to clinical experience. However, what happens when a nurse encounters something they have never seen before? That's where basic understanding comes in and allows you to think outside the box.\nWe need doctors to do the job of doctors and nurses to do the job of nurses-role blurring is bad for healthcare.",
