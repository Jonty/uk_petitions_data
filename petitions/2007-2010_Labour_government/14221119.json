            "background": "Most jobs advertised within management throughout the UK are internal vacancies. Employers are forced to advertise publicly for posts that they have no intention of filling with an external candidate. Millions of pounds are being wasted needlessly. This behaviour is immoral as it falsely builds up the hopes of external candidates, who may have been out of work for long periods.  External advertisements should only be for external vacancies, because there are no suitable internal candidates.",
