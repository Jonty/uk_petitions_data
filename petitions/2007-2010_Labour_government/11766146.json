            "background": "As UK workers continue to lose their jobs, homes and automobiles; hard earned taxpayers money (that enabled the economic stimulus package and financial institution bailout) is being flushed away as executives shamefully pull down on bonuses.  This is irresponsibile and a poor use of taxpayers funds.  \n\nIt seems that bonuses are frequently disconnected between compensation and the long-term strategic success or failure of corporations\n\nWe request that you administer, control, regulate and place tighter restrictions on pay for executives of institutions that receive government assistance.",
