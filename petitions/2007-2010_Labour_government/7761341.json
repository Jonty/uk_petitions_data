            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "From Feb08,the Low Emissions Zone (LEZ)is being phased into London to reduce pollution & improve air quality.This policy has financial consquences for the many older commercial vehicle owners (\u00a3200 fine for non-compliance per day). Many old vehicles are converted to horse lorries & continue a useful but easier life for many years for their amateur riders, who often keep horses on a shoestring.It will not be possible, or financially viable, to modify many older lorries to comply with the new standards. TfL's advice is to either: purchase a new vehicle (beyond the financial capability of many amateur riders or small businesses), modify your existing vehicle (not possible with older vehicles)or avoid LEZ(gone are the hopes of competing the family pony at Olympia).The introduction of an age-related exemption for compliance(e.g.+10yrs)would affect only a relatively small number of vehicles,but would give a valuable reprieve to those amateur riders & businesses with low-profit margins that can ill-afford to comply with LEZ.Otherwise riders will revert back to polluting,gas-guzzling 4x4's & small businesses will cease trading putting people out of business.",
