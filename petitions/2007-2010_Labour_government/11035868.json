            "background": "Many outdoor Remembrance Services are completely disturbed by overhead flights near airports.  This would just mean the ban on flights whose flightpath is likely to go over a service.  The duration would be from 10.55am to 11.05am on Remembrance Sunday.\nOur service today was disturbed by at least 7 flights within that 10 minutes and each one meant that the prayers could not be heard.\nHow can we seriously consider the debt society owes to those who gave their lives for us, when we are continually distracted.  The erosion of remembrance continues, we need to stand firm so that lessons learnt are not forgotten and we remember their sacrifice with gratitude.",
