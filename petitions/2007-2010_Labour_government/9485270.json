        "background": "More and more gardens are being levelled as houses are pulled down to make way for new building.  This often occurs during March to June during the bird nesting season.  If birds are nesting it is against the law to disturb them whilst building a nest or incubating eggs.  Some of this destruction could be avoided if there was an obligation on the part of a developer/builder to employ a registered wildlife surveyor/consultant to check the wildlife resource of a garden before work begins.",
