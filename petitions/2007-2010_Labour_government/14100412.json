            "background": "I grew up paying half fare on the buses and trains.\nIf people choose to have children then they should also pay their fares.\nWe are in a recession and since the introduction of free travel for under 16's, they jump on and off of buses abuse other passengers and are a drain on the taxpayers.\nUsually children attend a local school and there is no reason why they cannot walk !\nI also think cars should be banned for a mile radius from any school to stop congestion and overweight children.",
