            "background": "44,000 women a year are diagnosed with breast cancer, and the incidence is increasing in younger women.  The current screening programme excludes women from the age of 40. Breast cancer tends to be far more agressive in pre-menopausal women, and early detection is vital to catch the disease before it starts to spread.  Let's make this available to women who would like screening from 40 years age - on the NHS.",
