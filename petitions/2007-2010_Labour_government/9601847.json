            "background": "We all know the Government isn't serious about global warming, petrol prices, traffic congestion etc., but if it ever does decide to act, here are a few quick hits :-\n4. Put a 50 mph speed limit on all urban roads and bypasses. Give us back our quiet neighbourhoods while helping save the planet.\n5. When someone moves house to a more expensive property, only charge stamp duty on the difference in house values - and only if the new house is worth more than the old one (obviously). That would help people move house when they move to a new job. Becoming a nation of gipsies due to the abandonment of unions, is doing no good for traffic congestion, petrol consumption, and sound family life.\n6. Think about the effect on traffic and people next time you rationalise a few hospitals, schools, or government depts. Big units may be more efficient in some ways, but there are downsides too.",
