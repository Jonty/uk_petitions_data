The UK public have been kept in the dark e.g. a managed low profile in the mass media. In the longer term, we face the dilemma of what it will mean to be 'human'. This research will also increase the risk of animal suffering as the natural barriers between animals and humans are removed e.g. greater experimentation with ' animals' to satisfy research. N.B. Reliable alternative research is available e.g. adult cells for stem cell research. \nFor the government to proceed with this legislation without clear explanation of the benefits and risks is simply outrageous. Before legalising research that threatens the future of the human race as we know it, the government must facilitate a proper debate, engaging fully with the the British public.",
