            "background": "As tax payers we are now owed a huge amount of money by not just Northern Rock but by most of the high street banks. How can the employees of these banks be paid huge bonuses at a time when the banks are losing money. \nAs part owner of all  banks should the public not be given some say in how any potential profit is used. When so much money is owed to the treasury then surely the money could be better spent.\nIf the banks have apparently so much spare cash that they are able to pay bonuses for people who are doing a job that they are already well paid for then surely they should be in a position to increase their lending which would help both homeowners and small business'.",
