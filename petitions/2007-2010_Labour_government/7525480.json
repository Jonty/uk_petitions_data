We should encourage companies to use non-animal research, we have the technology so use it. The United Kingdom to be a leader in animal liberation. Experimenting on animals is outdated and we need to urge the government to ban it all together, and the companies that supply the animals. They are nothing better than dealers in the slave trade. Thank you.",
