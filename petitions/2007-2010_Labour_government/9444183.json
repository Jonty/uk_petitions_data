            "background": "Tina is a care in the community case, having lived in the community for many years. However Tina is known as the Bin Lady, constantly digging through all the other residents bin, removing bags, splitting them and removing content. Whilst it is not an illegal activity, many of the content removed is taken into her house, causing a rat infestation, smell and a serious Health & Safety Issue. This matter has been reported to the local authorities and social workers over the past decade and still the residents are traumatised by this invasion. Tina clearly fails to take her medication, each summer turning on local young children on occasions in the past actually assaulting them.\n\nPlease help us to have Tina placed in care were she belongs and can be looked after properly",
