Also we the undersigned, would like to see taxes imposed on private jets and cargo flights (which currently does not exist) in relation to their emissons. We believe that this would be a fair and sensible way of charging air tax, would give the customer incentive to fly on newer, more fuel efficient aircraft and would mirror in a fair and just way, what the government has already implimented in relation to car emissions.",
