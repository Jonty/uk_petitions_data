            "background": "This petition is for the millions of foreign residents like me who:\n\n1) are happily married to British Citizens for not less than three years. Three years are a long and intolerable time when the marriage is made for ulterior motives, and a happy and natural introduction to a future together when the relationship is genuinely based on reciprocal love and respect;\n\n2) who honestly work and pay taxes and give their contribution to this Country's growth; \n\n3) who are proud to live and serve in this Country.\n\nThe average salary is \u00a3 1000.00 a month, once taxes have been paid and by paying \u00a3655.00 there would be no chance to keep up with the expenses and bills to live.\n\nBy signing this petition, you share my opinion that the British Citizenship, just like marriage, should be deserved and based on respect, honesty, devotion and love, not money.\nThis is about the rights of millions of families resident in the UK.\n\nThank you.",
