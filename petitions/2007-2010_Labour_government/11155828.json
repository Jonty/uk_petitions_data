        "background": "The Design and Technology Association is concerned at the increasing number of calls received from anxious D&T teachers about the growing size of their classes. As an Association which actively represents its members at national level, we have taken this trend very seriously. We are concerned about the quality of experience pupils receive and the stress on teachers managing classes in rooms not designed or equipped for them. \nIn October 2007 the National Association of Advisers and Inspectors in Design and Technology wrote to the Schools Minister, Jim Knight about the issue of class size. His reply made the point that since health and safety is the responsibility of the employer, it is up to employers to make decisions about class size. For the majority of schools the local authority is the employer, although this will not necessarily be the case for voluntary aided schools, academies, foundation school, trust schools, city technology colleges and independent schools where the employer is usually the governing body. The Design and Technology Association will be writing to all local authorities to remind them of their responsibilities as employers for health and safety.",
