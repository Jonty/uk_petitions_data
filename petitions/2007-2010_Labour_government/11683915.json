            "background": "As a doorman i have often seen to many drunk people behave in an inappropriate manner.\nI would like to see different grades of fixed penalty notices issued starting from \u00a380 and working up to \u00a3500.\nThese fines would be issued depending on the nature of the crime committed.\nAppropriately, \u00a380 fines issued for things such as hurling abuse and urinating in streets ect. And \u00a3500 fines issued for trying to fight of police while resisting arrest and threatening behaviour.\nI think that the levels of bad behaviour is being taken to lightly and for some offences these people are being given the choice of arrests or fines.\nTo young single people with little or no responsibilities \u00a380 is not punishment.\nAlso, i would like to see charges issued to people who drink to excess and later in the night require medical assistance.\nthis ties up vital emergency services just because someone was unable to limit themselves when it comes to alcohol.\nAppropriate charges should made to these people who take up the ambulance services vital time as i believe this will help curb binge drinking.",
