        "background": "Ban all competitions on TV shows which are not a competition but are a lottery. They usually are fronted by a TV personality & give a choice of 3 answers, the correct one being obvious Eg- Which of these animals barks-\na) A mouse.\nb) A cat.\nc) A dog.\nThe sole reason for the competition is to raise revenue because to answer the question, you have to use premium rate telephone numbers or texts- and these raise considerably more than the prize offered.\nThey are a symptom of today's scam society, which has permeated throughout life today and would be one small step to rectify this.",
