            "background": "We agree that someone grossly exceeding the speed limit should be heavily penalised however this should be done on a proportional not a flat rate basis.\n\nSpecifically speeding penalties should be on a percentage over the speed limit not a flat miles an hour.  A person doing 50mph in a 30 zone is exceeding the speed limit by 67% and this is highly dangerous.  This should be equated to someone doing 117mph in a 70mph zone (67% more) and not compared with someone doing 90mph in a 70 zone.",
