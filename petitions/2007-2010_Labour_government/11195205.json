            "background": "ART THERAPY equals SELF ESTEEM.\nPresently I am seeking funding to be able to offer my art classes to people with learning difficulties. I would like to be able to pay for a venue, support workers, user transport, and my time to be able to offer free classes to centres for people with special needs. I have a venue that I could use, but need some funding to set it up.Presently I am working at Centre 404 in Camden Road in Holloway with several groups; children, teens and adults with learning difficulties,I would like to able to expand my operation. I have worked previously at the Camden Society and the City Lit. The value of art and music therapy is of tremendous use to individuals in assisting them with communication skills, the expression of emotions and as a way of developing teamwork, motor skills, eye hand co-ordination and ultimately self-esteem. I have designed a series of fun, easy participation art classes. I am open to any suggestion that you may be able to offer to raise funding for this very worthwhile venture.Yours sincerely GERRY LAFFY 07986-376844\ngtheartist84@hotmail.com",
