            "background": "The cutbacks made on the Forces are ridiculous. Troops are being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan without proper equipment due to cutbacks. If the Government is planning on keeping the troops in the Middle East then they should provide them with equipment and armour etcetera that will work. Also to not cutback on the other forcesa, the Navy are facing upto mothballing ships and this isn't acceptbale. We need to stop weakening the Armed Forces now, they are risking their lives for us so lets show them some respect.",
