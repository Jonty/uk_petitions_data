            "background": "Whilst the number of deaths between youths, are ever increasing, nothing (that I am aware of) is being done. With no respect nor fear of the law or consequences, the death toll is ever rising. The youth of today have lost their fear (a small amount is needed to keep them on the right path - worried of what parents will say/do if done something wrong) needed of their parents, the police and the community as a whole.\n\nPossible suggestions are for 3rd year pupils (the age before they loose control) to spend a week in a poor country (S.Africa) working with the disadvantaged i.e. orphans of Aids, to teach them the value of life and how fortunate they are.\nOr work experience at an orphanage or at homeless shelters is another example.\n\nFunding should be taken from the ever increasing TAXES i.e. working tax, fuel tax etc.\n\nIf something is not done, then the death toll will increase, and, if not already, eventually everyone will know a child who has been killed in this way.",
