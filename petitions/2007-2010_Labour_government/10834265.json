Respect and consideration seems to have been ignored even though the university\u2019s own handbook states that fact.\n\nBeing one of the youngest residents at 60 years of age I feel it\u2019s my duty to those at 70+ to bring this to your attention. Those residents in the higher age bracket are from a generation who were taught to grin and bear it \u2013 but why should they?",
