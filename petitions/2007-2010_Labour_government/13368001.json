        "background": "Banwell library has been used for many years by the local residents of the parish. It is now under threat of closure by North Somerset Council. The residents of Banwell will miss the library as it used by people of all ages. We are a deprived rural area and many of the children rely on the library to use the computers and do there homework. There are also not many facilities in Banwell for the people to use so the closure of the library will be a great loss.",
