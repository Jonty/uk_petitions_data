This would allow people who wish to exercise their right to vote but see no clear distinction between the existing parties, or just wish to voice their discontent at the current state of politics in this country, to register their democratic opinion. In the past various parties have blamed low turn-out to the voting polls on \u2018public apathy\u2019. This may not be the case. We believe the \u2018Vote of no confidence\u2019 box would remove this ambiguity, allowing the government a clearer perspective of the public's changing attitudes, while also granting the hitherto silent voice of those wishing to abstain from voting for a particular party, to be heard.",
