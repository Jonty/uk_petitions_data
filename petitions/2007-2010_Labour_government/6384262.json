I find it quite frustrating not to be able to respond to these criticisms, as I imagine other petition creators also do, which is why I have created this one.  \n\nIn fact I don't feel the need to respond so much to actual criticism as to remarks which are patently untrue (certainly in my own experience) such as (in response to my \"NoMoreLowPay\" petition) that people choose what jobs they do; I was never able to! had to take whatever job I was offered or forfeit Unemployment Benefit/Jobseekers Allowance!  \n\nIf it is not possible to approve this petition I would ask that the point it makes be taken on board and, please, acted on.",
