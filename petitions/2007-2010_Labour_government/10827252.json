Kudocties is different because it is run by and used by people who live and work in London right now. They know it inside out. \n\nWith the huge numbers of visitors expected to arrive in the capital in the years running up to the 2012 London Olympics, it is vital that everyone - both resident and visitor - can rely on one source of information about the host city that's based on real peoples' opinions and experiences.",
