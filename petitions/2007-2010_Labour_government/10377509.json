        "background": "the financial industry does not recognise carers as a group. To get car insurance for example, one has to declare oneself as a \"Househusband/wife\". It seems once again that once one becomes a carer, saving the government a small fortune and living on a pittance, one simply ceases to exist in the eyes of the rest of the world. Even the unemployed are recognised by these institutions but not it seems us.",
