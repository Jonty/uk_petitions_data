        "background": "I am 18 years old and i want to become a pilot.the course is roughly \u00a360000.\ni do not own a home and so cannot get a loan.also the career development loan is only \u00a3300-\u00a38000.with this loan it could take upto 8 years to become an airline pilot. i have read reviews on the web and it is understandable that the government does not have a scheme to help young cadet pilots.i believe if you have a dream you should follow it.if you start a government funding or a government training camp in the uk then it will be good for young future pilots.i dont speak for myself, i am speaking for many people who have a dream to become a pilot but cant afford the training financially. and as citizens i no only the government can help us become pilots.thank you for considering and signing my petition.",
