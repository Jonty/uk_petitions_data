        "action": "stop issuing licences to extract fossil fuels and progressively revoke existing licences",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Climate change threatens most species including ours. We can stop it at source by not extracting. Government can do this by revoking licences for UK fossil fuels. Other countries may follow. The fuel can be used by future generations who otherwise will have none, once CO2 is reduced. This is fair on the future. Exceptions can be made for fuel needed to create the transition to fossil fuel free society. This will ensure UK gets there while it still can, faster, save UK resources for the future, show other countries how to stop climate change dead, and galvanise the people to make drastic changes now. Unlikely, but possible through legal pressure brought by young people on the government. Who can help?",
