Complaints can also be made to the District Auditor.\n\nThis 'Right' comes from the Audit Commission Act 1998 section 15.\n\nHowever sub-sections (4) and (5) ban the public seeing details of deals made by unelected and unaccountable (to the public) council officials who regularly use public money to end the employment (\"pay-off\") of corrupt, bad or incompetent staff.\n\n\"Pay-offs\" can cost council tax payers several hundreds of thousands of pounds for a single paid-off individual.  \n\nCouncil tax payers must have a Right to know how their ever increasing council tax money is being spent.  \n\nGive the public full and total access to their local council accounts and end the discrimination of s14(1) which bans some council tax payers living in England (for example USA, Norwegians, Swiss, Chinese, Brazilian citizens) inspecting their local council's accounts.\n\nThank you.\n\nCampaign to Reform English Local Government.",
