            "background": "Every year thousands of sea birds and mammals are accidentally killed when caught in fishing gear intended for other marine life. This is unnacceptable and has to stop. We call on the government to legislate to not differentiate between accidental bycatch and deliberate killing, and to treat crews who kill sea birds, for example, in their nets the same as those who would kill them deliberately with guns. Our marine ecosystems are fragile and their indiscriminate destruction by greedy fishermen cannot be allowed to continue, and we call on these careless individuals to be made accountable for their careless actions.",
