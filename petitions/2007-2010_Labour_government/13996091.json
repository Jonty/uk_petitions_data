            "background": "The number of people who do not know basic first aid is worrying. Through short advertisements, such as the current one showing what a stroke was and how to react to such circumstances, I believe we can teach the general public simple but potentially life-saving skills, and possibly save the NHS money in aftercare. For example, if burns are treated promptly and correctly, the need for a skin graft decreases, and the wound is more likely to heal well. Simple, 30-second advertisements could make the difference between life and death.",
