        "background": "The recent ruling in the supreme court was made that the OFT does not have the power or jurisdiction to regulate banks with respect to the grossly unfair charges they make against ordinary consumers.  Those affected are generally those in financial hardship and least able to afford it. They are also self-perpetuating in that a charge levied can cause unauthorised overdraft which in itself generates another charge. By changing legislation the Government could grant the OFT this power and allow them a redress the balance between the taxpayers and banks.  Having bailed them out and saved them from collapse it is disgusting that they should be allowed to continue in their punative approach to charging extortionate fees for small amounts of unauthorised debt.",
