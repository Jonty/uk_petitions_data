They believe that the solution to every problem Britain faces is to tax it which is lately evident from the preposterous changes in vehicle excise duty (road tax). All this does is add more to the coffers of this greedy government whilst degrading ever more the standard of living for the ordinary person. I move for a general election to show a feeling of no confidence in this inept government.",
