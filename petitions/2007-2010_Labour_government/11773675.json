        "background": "I would like the prime minister to put a stop to the banks charging fee's while the high court case is ongoing. I find it totally unfair that banks can charge as much as \u00a340 for going a few pence over an overdraft limit while the consumer has been told that all claims against the bank have to wait until after the court case has been heard and finalised. I find it totally unfair and grossly one sided that the waiver does not apply to both sides of the argument. They should be made to stop all charges until the case has been concluded. especially after the amount of money the British taxpayer has had to bail them out because of their greed.",
