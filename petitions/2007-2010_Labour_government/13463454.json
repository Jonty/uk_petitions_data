            "background": "Since the implementation of the A1073 Eye Green to Spalding Improvement Scheme, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire to Spalding, Lincolnshire, Newborough has practically been made an island with no suitable straightforward car-worthy routes being made available and several roads being closed in several directions at any one time. Because residents/visitors/commuters have been forced to use unsuitable roads, many road users have sustained expensive damage to their vehicles including costly suspension replacements and damage to the car chassis and wheels/tyres etc.  On top of that, many people cannot afford the extortionate increase in petrol costs sustained through such consistently badly-managed road closures and are looking to seek compensation.\n\nThere is extreme concern as to what would happen if a resident of Newborough or surrounding area(s) were to require an emergency service and the very real possibility that someone could in fact die as a result of emergency services being unable to reach them in time.\n\nPlease can something be done about this.",
