            "background": "The proliferation of surveillence being proposed goes way beyond that needed or wanted by ordinary normal people and has everything to do with control coercion and exploitation of an expendable asset; Us!We do not wish to be indexed, catalogued, scanned, surveilled, tracked or archived.We are people with a free will, we do not wish to be opressed by an all seeing eye, a \"big brother\".\nThe idea that we should all be on some vast database/s shows the true nature of our supposed \"servants\", they have pretensions to be the oligarch!This has nothing to do with our safety or security, it is for theirs from us.\nCriminality cannot be eradicated simply via the use of cameras, and tracking and scanning, it is a symptom of a defective system, a system comprised of has haves and have nots.\nA cashless society gives a tier of total state control of individual free will, as once implemented ( along with the other measures proposed) no aspect of your finances will be safe from prying eyes. Credit only systems are a control freaks dream once linked to ID/ DNA databases. We do not want them.\nSuch systems of control would be fine if only those adminstering them were both benvolent and benign; They are not!",
