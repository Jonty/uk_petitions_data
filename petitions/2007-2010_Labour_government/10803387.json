        "background": "Every few months there appears to be an astronomical increase in the amount we pay on our utility bills and it doesn't appear to have an end in sight. What makes it hard to swallow is that EDF (a French company owned partly by the French Government and who controls energy supply in the UK) are unable to raise their rates in France above 5% a year and therefore in order to keep their profits rolling in they exploit the UK market. The other utility companies also exploit the UK population and soon over 10% of the UK average wage will be spent on gas and electric. These large increases have to stop.",
