            "background": "Magheralin takes its name from the existence, at this location, of a very early ecclesiastical site. The parish church was built in medieval times and its remains form part of the ruined church in the old village graveyard. The settlement has a strong village character.\nAlthough a beautiful and historic village the recent boom of housing developments in the area has detracted from the villages natural beauty and left some major eyesores whilst at the same time leaving the small country roads overwhelmed by the traffic. The increase in population in such a small area has also seen a rise in vandalism due to bored youths with nothing to do.\n\nA recent development on steps road has been abandoned half finished and yet another has been started on the same stretch of road not two minutes walk from the first. I harbor a great sense of pride for our village however I feel that if another housing development was to be allowed it would be the death of what once was a beautiful village.",
