            "background": "Why do the Ministers believe that having drinking hours extended, relieve the problem of drink problems in our streets and towns!  They seem to be under a great illusion that we can become Continental and have civilised drinking in cafe bars etc. This will never happen, and while we are waiting for it to happen, things are getting worse.  I say, go back in time when the pubs closed at 11pm Mon - Sat, and 10.30pm Sunday, AND the night clubs closed at 2am. The happy hour should go, (well I say hour,obviously, an hour in a pub,is not the same as an hour on a watch!!!) Also if supermarkets have the all day licence, then this doesn't help the situation either. Can we all see sense and in this case instead of \"moving on\" lets regress to progress.Looking at it from a financial point of view, it may save our NHS a great deal of money, in A&E, Paramedics and hospital admissions, not to mention the health of all concerned.",
