        "background": "I am sorry to hear this petition was rejected for being \"outside the remit of Government\".  I disagree.  The Government IS the legislating body. Please will you reconsider.  Thank you.\nThe work-life balance is all wrong.  It is too heavily tipped in favour of companies (be it private or government institutions) and against the private individual.  Most of us work very long hours from Monday to Friday, and then spend a great deal of Saturday and Sunday catching up with chores, leaving practically no time to dedicate to family and personal relationships.\nFamily and personal relationships are the very fabric of society and the very essence of what makes us human.  Relationships can tame potential criminals and reform them once they have fallen; relationships often take the heat off the State when it comes to taking care of society's most vulnerable: the old, the very young, the infirm.  The recession has proved that the mere bottom line cannot replace the human network, or satisfy its need to reach out and nurture.\nOn this basis, it is only fair and right that the balance is made more just by adding one extra day to our weekends.",
