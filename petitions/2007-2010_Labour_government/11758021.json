            "background": "when a marriage breaks down the children are automatically deemed to be better off with the mother,irrelevant of the equal role the father has played in their upbringing.A seperated mother can deny access at any time,preventing fathers from seeing their children for months sometimes years .The father has no choice but but to make a very expensive aplication to the courts for contact with his own children.As most mothers are eligible for social funding for legal matters regarding divorce and contact ,they can prolong the process keeping the father away from his children for longer.A vast majority of fathers are left in debt through the break up and contending with the solicitors bills ,without the most precious things in their lives,their children and often with no home.Too many mothers are useing their children through spite to hurt both emotionally and financially their ex husbands which in case is damaging the children who do not understand where their daddy has gone.,",
