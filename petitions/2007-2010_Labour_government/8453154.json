            "background": "Since a smoking ban in enclosed public places came into force in England in 2007, there's been an increased in the number of commuters who smoke while crossing London Bridge on foot especially during the morning peak hours.\n\nWhile we respect these smokers' decision to do what they like, the fumes from the cigarettes is highly annoying to many commuters who do not smoke or are alergic to it. \n\nSome commuters also take the opportunity to have a light aerobic work out while crossing London Bridge. However cigarette smells has created an unpleasant atmosphere for these people who are simply trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nCan we therefore ask the Government to designate a special non-smoking pedestrian walk way on London Bridge?",
