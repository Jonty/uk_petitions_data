            "background": "Dear neighbour, As per finding this out from the local press not from Aberdeen Council. They plan to move Oakbank School to the Boyd Orr area. We need to take action if we don\u2019t this will leave us open to these \u201ctroubled children\u201d which include violent low lives who are in this school for a reason. If you are happy with cars being vandalised and stolen, houses being broken into and vandalised. Then by all means don\u2019t voice your objections to this but I personally will be writing to the council with my objections. We have a quiet peaceful area here don\u2019t let this be destroyed. \nPlease read the article from the Evening Express dated 01/04/2009 \nNew locations revealed in hunt for Aberdeen school site, The search is on for Aberdeen's Oakbank School which closed last year. \nA FORMER Aberdeen school could be turned into a centre for troubled children. The Old Dutch School Planning permission would not be needed to set up a school at the Kincorth site. Please sign this petition to air your veiw against the move of Oakbank to the Old Dutch School. \nSincerly, Concerned Neighbour",
