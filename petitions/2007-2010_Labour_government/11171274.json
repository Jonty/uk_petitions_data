            "background": "Clearly the directorial class that control our major companies and institutions have failed the general population while at the same time unfairly remunerating themselves steadily for at least two decades. Our society will never be significantly more equal or run for the genuine public benefit until the imbalances in power that allowed this situation to come about have been corrected. The government has the legislative means to correct those imbalances and facilitate the development of a fairer and more responsible society. For example:\nVotes by share-holders should be secret (by simply applying the same rules as already apply to Trades Unions when balloting on strike action).\nFund managers should, however, be forced to report their voting and investment decisions and stand for re-election by the fund-holders each year. (If the pensions and investment companies concerned do not field sufficient suitable candidates the government should field candidates of its own.)\nCorporation tax of public limited companies should be structured to encourage share ownership by employees, with less tax for more equal ownership.",
