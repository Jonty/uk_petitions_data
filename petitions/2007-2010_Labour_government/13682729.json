            "background": "SYFA & SYFRS are to dismiss 744 operational firefighters because they will not sign a new contract that is being IMPOSED, as a tax payer, I feel every avenue to NEGOTIATE a settlement should be exhausted to ensure strike action can be lifted by the FBU. I am therefore asking that SYFRS & SYFA should agree to use the services of the National Joint Council (NJC) in order that this dispute can be brought to a NEGOTIATED agreement.  I feel it is the least they can do on behalf of all the Operational Firefighters in South Yorkshire and just as importantly for ALL the Tax payers of South Yorkshire.",
