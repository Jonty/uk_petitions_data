The IOC should not even have considered China as Olympic host.  Tibet would have made far more sense.\n\nIf most countries pull out at this late stage it will mean financial ruin for Peking.  A golden opportunity to rectify so much misery in Eastern Asia.\n\nWe owe it to all the Tibetan, Burmese, and Chinese victims, past, present, and future!",
