        "background": "Not only does Peking support the barbaric dictatorship in Burma, but Peking has ruled Tibet by fear, in an illegal occupation spanning over half a century.  The IOC should not even have considered China as Olympic host.  Tibet would have made far more sense.\n\nIf most countries pull out at this late stage it will mean financial ruin for Peking.  A golden opportunity to rectify so much misery in Eastern Asia.\n\nWe owe it to all the Tibetan, Burmese, and Chinese victims, past, present, and future!",
