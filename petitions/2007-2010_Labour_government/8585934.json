This information is currently available within the vehicles but can only be accessed by OBD/EOBD diagnostic systems and some of this information can only be assessed by using manufacturer specific equipment.  The add on cost to vehicles to display this information would be minimal and would open up the market to independent vehicle service and repair garages.",
