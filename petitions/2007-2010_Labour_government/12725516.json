            "background": "In light of the death of Ryan Walker, a 15 year old Derbyshire resident, we the undersigned are requesting that the 'blue lagoon' quarry in Ashover, Derbyshire is filled in and that others like it across the UK are also closed in order to prevent future fatalities. Ryan Walker passed away on May 31st 2009 following swimming in the 'Blue Lagoon'. It is clear upon visiting the site of his death that there are no significant means of preventing individuals from trespassing. We the undersigned feel as though it is unreasonable to expect a simple sign and low fencing to suffice and we feel that in light of Mr Walkers death higher fencing at the absolute least is required, but only if filling the quarry in is not possible. There has already been one death too many, please take note of this petition and the signatures supporting it and do something to protect others from such a tragic end.",
