That three million jobs depend on those exports \u2013 probably true.   That (word for word) \u201cMillions of jobs are dependant on our membership of the EU\u201d.   This is incorrect.   He forgets to mention that they export more to us than we do to them.   It is inconceivable that Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagon, Bosch, Fiat, Renault, etc. and companies producing white goods, food, wines, clothing, etc. would stop trading with us.   They need our market.   The EU would not place restrictions on our goods knowing that they would face the same.   Free trade would continue as a necessity.",
