I believe that changes in the law should be made to permit people to access this clinic without any condemnation and prosecution of themselves or their families for assited scuicide as every human deserves the right to a dignified death rather than a slow, painful and often undignified death and hopefuly in the future something similar may be introduced into Britain to save the expense and exhaustion of travel.",
