            "action": "amend the proposed legislation for the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We, the undersigned, respectfully request that the Food Standards Agency\n\nincorporate an opt-out clause for traditional wind and watermills into\nany legislation requiring the mandatory fortification of flour with\nfolic acid.\n\nWhile not opposed to the general principle of fortification we, the undersigned, believe that traditional wind and water mills must be allowed to opt out of these proposals. Most will not be able to afford the devastating cost of buying and installing the equipment needed to meet the new requirements,nor, in some cases, be permitted to install such equipment due to the listing of these historic buildings or have the space required within the confines of the mill. \n\nThe proposed legislation (as drafted) may cause many working historic wind and water mills to cease production, sounding the death-knell for a\npractice that has been part of the country\u2019s life since Roman times. \n\nIt is ironic that at a time when so much of the national agenda is focused on the production of natural, local produce, our traditional,historic mills are threatened by legislation that may force them to close.",
