            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As one of the bigger state secondary schools in the borough, I think that Waldegrave School For Girls should be entitled to a free school bus. That will ensure that girls are getting to and from school safely. \n  The school bus would not only benefit the girls that attend Waldegrave, but will also benefit everyone else travelling at around the same time as them.\n  It will take more traffic off the roads,since parents won't be dropping their children off to school,(note this is eco efficent). \n  Make the travel for others on the normal buses more pleasant, as the buses won't be packed with school children.\n  Ensures parents that their children are getting to and from school safely, on time and hassle free.\n  Currently, Grey Court have a school bus service (371) which arrives at an allocated time to collect the children from Richmond through to Ham.\n  This is proof that the idea does work, so I would be gratful if you would take the time to sign this petition. THANK YOU.",
