            "background": "General Eisenhower Warned Us \n \nIt is a matter of history that when the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, General Dwight Eisenhower, found the victims of the death camps he ordered all possible photographs to be taken, and for the German people from surrounding villages to be ushered through the camps and even made to bury the dead. \n\nHe did this because he said in words to this effect: \n\n'Get it all on record now - get the films - get the witnesses -because somewhere down the road of history some b------ will get up and say that this never happened' \n\nThis week, the UK debated whether to remove The Holocaust from its school curriculum because it 'offends' the Muslim population which claims it never occurred. It is not removed as yet.. However, this is a frightening portent of the fear that is gripping the world and how easily each country is giving into it. \n\nIt is now more than 60 years after the Second World War in Europe ended. This petition is being made as a memorial chain, in memory of the, 6 million Jews, 20 million Russians, 10 million Christians, and 1,900 Catholic priests.",
