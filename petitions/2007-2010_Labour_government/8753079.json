        "background": "We recognize that:- the body of Treaties leading towards an ever closer union can only be considered to be Constitutional in their nature; and, any derogation from the Constitutional aspirations embodied in Treaties between European States must be considered to be a fundamental divergence from understandings to allow the free movement of people, services and goods with respect to general beneficial consequences within the Union, hence requiring confirmation from the people of Europe concerning those regions who should be considered members. Further those wishing to drive economic concerns of expansionism beyond cultural considerations of the unity of the People of Europe, be that they have in their aspirations such eventual goals or otherwise, must be held to account.",
