            "background": "Pearl and Stephen Thrumble are the parents of John Thrumble, an Essex soldier with the Royal Anglians, who was killed by US \u201cfriendly fire\u201d in Afghanistan on 23rd August, 2007.  They need help to stop Semirjan Dalti, whom they have fostered for six years, since he was 12, from being deported back to Kosovo.  \n\nHe now lives on his own, pays his taxes and works for a London office clearance firm - but when he turned 18 on August 31 he lost his \u201cleave to remain\u201d status.  This news tragically coincided with the return of their son's body from Afghanistan.  Semirjan's fate will now be decided by a court appearance.  This happened once before and John petitioned against it then.  He would repeat it if he was here now.  Mrs Thrumble said \u201cConsidering we lost one son and he was fighting for the rights of others, hopefully Gordon Brown can help Semirjan stay.\u201d\n\nShe said the uncertainty about Semirjan's future, added to the grief felt after losing John, was \u201cexhausting\u201d for all of the family.\n\nShe added: \u201cBy law, he's not our son but we class him as one of our own.\u201d\n\nPlease help keep Semirjan from being deported by signing this petition.",
