            "background": "The government is reported to be considering a central government database of \"...all phone calls made and email sent in the UK...\" as a \"crucial tool\" for protecting national security. Such surveillance is incompatible with a free country and a free people, as well as flying in the face of the government's demonstrated inability to be trusted with such information.  We call upon the Prime Minister to abandon and disavow all such plans, and to prevent further waste of public funds developing such civilly untenable and administratively unworkable schemes.",
