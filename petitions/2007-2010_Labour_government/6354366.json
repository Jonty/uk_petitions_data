How can we fight terrorism if we cannot manage the simple things?\nLets get it together, disband all forces and the attendant ivory towers, have one database for information, a single uniform, radio communications system and freedom to move between areas without having to effectivly resign and then rejoin if officers want to move a few miles away.",
