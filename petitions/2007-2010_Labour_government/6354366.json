        "background": "The current situation is there are 43 english and welsh forces who have little idea about what goes on in surrounding forces, this makes simple enquiries cross border difficult, it also makes for an inefficient system and inevitably the public unfortunate enough to live near force boundaries lose out. How can we fight terrorism if we cannot manage the simple things?\nLets get it together, disband all forces and the attendant ivory towers, have one database for information, a single uniform, radio communications system and freedom to move between areas without having to effectivly resign and then rejoin if officers want to move a few miles away.",
