They not only try to save people's babies, but they also treat everyone as an individual. They recognise people's fears and distress and work positively to find a happy ending. The professor shouldn't have to raise \u00a31million to keep these services going, it should be provided by the goverment. Maybe our new Prime Minister will understand the importance of their work?",
