        "background": "\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\" (Article 3 European Convention on Human Rights)\nPeople in mental health institutes in EU countries, such as, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and The Czech Republic are subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment every day in 'Social care homes' which have made little progress since soviet times and are poorly equipped and over crowded. \n\nSocial care homes are made up of people with mental health problems, intellectual disabilities, alcohol problems and drug addiction. \n\nIn June 2004 an undercover reporter for The Times newspaper found children as young as 4 or 5 years old in a care home near Prague locked up in cage beds for most of the day with no toys or stimulation and in the same room as an elderly dying man.\n\nThe Mental Disability Advocacy Centre and Amnesty International both condemn the treatment of patients in these institutions.",
