Funded mostly from council tax, the Freedom Pass also gets government funding, reflecting London\u2019s contribution to the national concessionary bus travel scheme.\n\nIn April 08, a 3-year funding deal was agreed but in July 09, Transport Minister Sadiq Khan re-opened it.  The Department for Transport, DfT, is now consulting on \u201cLocal Authority special grant funding in 2010/11 for the national bus concession in England\u201d, with London losing \u00a329m, almost half its agreed funding for 2010-11. The consultation closes on 30/12/09.\n\nLondon\u2019s Borough Leaders oppose the DfT re-opening a 3-year funding deal, which loses London nearly \u00a329m, and demand the Prime Minister intervene to protect the Freedom Pass\u2019s funding.",
