This will result in the loss of a major visitor attraction in Burton-upon-Trent and the loss of many unique artifacts illustrating the town's heritage, which will be re-located to other Coors sites around the world.\nWe, the undersigned, call upon HM Government to take any and all necessary steps to save this vital part of the heritage of the town and of brewing in the UK and to protect the area's economy.",
