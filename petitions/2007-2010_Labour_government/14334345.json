        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Software vendors are currently able to write software that contains any number of secret features, functions and generally input anything. I wish for this to change so that any program that is bought should also contain the sourcecode.\n\nPrograms are writen using a computer language creating source code file/s, that are compiled into executable programs.\nWhen the source code is compiled the end user is unable to see what comprises the source code. This creates the possiblilty of the programmer/software company to input any feature into the software. We believe that this is dangerous to the consumer for the software not to be checked for viruses, spyware and code that treatens personal security, freedom and data.\n\nSoftware is copyrighted to prevent unauthorised use of programs. So we the consumer petition that the source code be released alongside the program when bought.",
