            "background": "Most of us are well-aware of the way in which the Chinese Communists have invaded, suppressed and plundered their defenceless neighbour, Tibet. \n\nWe are also aware of the mounting  evidence of human-rights abuses which this Marxist regime has committted against some sectors of its own Chinese people. \n\nWe the undersigned do not think that Britain should be subscribing to such a regime, by way of sending our athletes.\n\nWe take the stance that if Beijing wants the Olympics, then the CCP must make a REAL -and not token- gesture in the direction of improving human rights. Military withdrawal from Tibet would be one such gesture.",
