            "background": "The Times (6/5/08) reports that barristers are refusing to take cases, because fees are inadequate. Britain has always been rightly proud of it's judicial heritage, yet it's barristers within the legal profession are alleged to be practising selection bias. \"The bar operates a \"cab rank\" principle\", (reports the article) \"which means that\nbarristers are meant to take the next case that comes along, if they are free and competent to do so. But they can turn down a case if the rate of pay is not fair and reasonable for the amount of work involved\". The petitioner is asking the P.M. to question representation - isn't this what legal aid was for ? Why then does it appear to be not working equitably for all equitably bringing justice for everyone, including those who have false allegations made against them, trade union members, victims and their families ? Perhaps better legal / trade union links would be better in a litigatious age.",
