At the moment it is decent people being killed whereas the yobs/hooligans/criminals are having a right laugh at the british justice system which gives preferential treatment to the criminal. At least then the majority of the scum will be taken off our streets and cannot complain about being bored. Bring back conscription for these yobs.",
