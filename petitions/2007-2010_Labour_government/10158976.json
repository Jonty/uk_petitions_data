If he claims this is outside his remit (because it is a matter for Mr Speaker) then he should direct that the taxpayers of this land should be able to set the cost of their food, fuel and mortgage payments against their income tax bill for this year - which is somethng which is WITHIN his remit.",

            "background": "These people are not living in the real world where people have to meet rising costs out of falling or steady incomes.  Only when the people making the rules suffer the same as the people who pay for them will be have people who can speak authoritatively about why people should not be miserable.  While I am paying for scottish constituency MPs to fool around with my sovereignty and my taxes then we should not have an upstart of a prig like Tom Harris telling me not to be miserable.",
