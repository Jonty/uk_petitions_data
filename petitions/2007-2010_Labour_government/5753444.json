        "background": "The Early Years are crucial! Primary Education has been underfunded for generations. Increased funding would reduce class sizes, allow for personalised learning, enable primary heads to properly resource and equip their schools and give all our children the excellent start to their education to which they are entitled.  The funding needs of primary schools are different, but no less, than those of secondary schools.",
