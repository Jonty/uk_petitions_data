            "background": "If the banks can be given billions, if discussions to save retailers and car manufacturers are given action. While tax cuts that give minimal amounts back in the future may be of some assistance, wiping out student loans and returning to FREE UNIVERSITY for all would create a better skilled economy and provide more money in a great deal of students and parents pocket, thus really kick starting the economy. If the government is to rack up debt, it should do it for a justifiable reason that benefits the wider public, and the country as a whole.",
