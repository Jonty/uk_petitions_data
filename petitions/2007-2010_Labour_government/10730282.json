I have read that doctors are reluctant to discuss life-extending treatments with patients because - disgracefully - it can take up to three years for medication to be approved by N.I.C.E!  I have yet to see ANY reports of any BENEFICIAL effects of this Institute so what's the point of it?  Why not spend whatever it costs on treating seriously-ill patients?",
