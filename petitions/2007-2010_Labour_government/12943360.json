        "background": "Our servicemen put their lives on the line for us all, and yet very often they go into war torn areas with sub standard equipment as we have all heard via the news, and have all seen through the unnecessary loss of mens lives. They go out willing to risk life and limb for the protection of this country and the innocent peoples of the nation they are fighting in, and yet their wages are less than the wages of other front line jobs within our own country. Surely our men deserve the recognition for what they do, every man is worthy of the work they accomplish. We should be honouring them not just in words but in practical ways. They should not be expected to fight and live on a shoe string. God bless them all",
