            "background": "Did you know that by running a screensaver on your PC, you can help research into a cure for cancer or heart disease? These and many other problems are being researched using Distributed Computing.\n\nDistributed Computing refers to the use of many computers to solve computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one computer.\n\nThe Government should raise awareness of the benefits to society of Distributed Computing.\n\nPeople and businesses in the public and private sectors should be encouraged by the Government to donate their computer's spare processing power to help very important research, for the benefit of everyone. Even the Government's computers should be put to good use in this way.\n\nPlease sign this petition to support the use of Distributed Computing.",
