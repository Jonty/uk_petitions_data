            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We note that:\n \nThe government insists on imposing the congestion charge as a condition for receiving the money to improve transport in the city.  Local authorities bidding for extra funds have no choice but to include congestion charging in their plans, regardless of need.  \n \nThe charge is estimated to be \u00a34 for Cambridge, working out at over \u00a31,000 per year per car, with no reductions for residents or for those leaving the city to work outside it.\n \nThe study on transport was only just completed before the decision was announced.\n \nNo study was undertaken on the impact on employment in the city before the decision was announced.\n \nNo study on the economic impact was carried out before the decision was announced.\n \nNo assurances can be given about the extension of residents\u2019 parking zones, their prices or the costs of public parking.\n \nThere will be no referendum on the introduction of the charges, as there was in Edinburgh.\n\nThe long term funding for transport was capped and the money that would have gone to it as part of natural growth forms the \u2018TIF\u2019 cash which local authorities have to bid for.  This system needs reviewing.",
