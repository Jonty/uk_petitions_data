            "background": "Every year we hear and read stories in the news about dogs attacking adults or children in a public place while off the lead. Public places include parks and nature walks or anywhere near residential areas, anywhere where children play, supervised or unsupervised. The existing law only calls for so called dangerous dogs to be restrained in a public area, however any dog however well trained or good natured can turn if it was spooked or felt threatned, hence should be kept on a lead. \nI just want to be able to take my children to the park without worrying about other peoples dogs!",
