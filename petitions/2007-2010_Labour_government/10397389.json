            "background": "This is about a baby whose mother took all sorts of drugs while she was pregnant. She has completely ruined the baby\u2019s life by her various drug addictions. The baby was born addicted to heroin, alcohol, nicotine & methadone.\nAs a premature newborn baby he would scream daily & continually shake from withdrawal symptoms from the drugs that were passed into his system from his mother, He now has mental and numerous physical disabilities. We used to sterilise women in this country, via Court order, who would physically and mentally abuse their children, but we no longer do this,because of human rights, well what about the baby\u2019s rights? Should the government not take this into account? If you agree that all women who take drugs whilst pregnant should be sterilised & then be subjected to a prison sentence,then please add your name to this petition&help to stop this from happening to innocent children. We imprison parents who abuse their children after they are born why should we not support those children in the womb also? Something must be done to stop this it is absolutely appalling. \nSo please,follow the link to sign & forward this email to everyone you know.",
