            "background": "Students undertaking work placements and Erasmus placements at European universities have this year received a mobility grant to help them financially when they are abroad.  This grant, however, is not available to students working as Language Assistants.  This is due to the British Council taking over giving out the grants late, meaning that this year's assistants are not eligible for the financial help that their coursemates have received.  We believe that the Government should intervene in this situation and rectify it in favour of the Language Assistants.",
