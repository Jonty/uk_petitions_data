        "background": "There are thousands of unused shop spaces across the UK due to our recent financial crisis.\nPlease force local authorities to reduce the rent on these properties for small businesses to encourage small businesses to prosper and therefore increase the value of our national economy.\nThe discount should last one year to give businesses a running start and be at least a 50% reduction.\nBusinesses that have more than 2 shops should be omitted from this scheme, because the point is to encourage new and small business.",
