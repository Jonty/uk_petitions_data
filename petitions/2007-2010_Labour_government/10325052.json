Demand independent research into this \u201cFUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS\u201d - which does have a distinguishing feature from other illnesses/conditions with similar symptoms i.e. the ES/EHS CAN AND DO recover if they are isolated from the cause(s) of the sensitivity. \n\n 2. Demand monitoring by personnel  trained or researching in this field who are aware of the effects of pulsed microwave radiation/electricity.\n\n3 Ensure that the Human Rights of the ES/EHS are observed fully and recognise electro-sensitivity as a disability in the UK, as in Canada and Sweden. \n   \n4  Provide safe zones so that the ES/EHS have places to recover/live in OR replace pulsed microwave radiation with a safer technology.",
