            "background": "The banks and government encouraged young people to invest in the property market and become home owners. With the recession causing people to lose their jobs, we think the benefits available should be reviewed to give us young people a chance of keeping our homes that we have worked so hard to buy. We ask that the age restrictions that are in place be lowered and also the restrictions that involve your partner or civil partner working 24 hours per week or more to allow us to have these benefits available.",
