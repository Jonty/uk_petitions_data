It is our opinion that these sites should be made illegal, as they are not only helping to ruin peoples lives, they are also draining money from the NHS.\nSmoking has recently, been banned in public venues as it is bad for the health, so in our opinion pro-ana, and pro-mia sites should be banned from the internet as they are life-threatening diseases.",
