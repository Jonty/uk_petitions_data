        "background": "Most universities in England and Wales issue their students with a receipt for coursework which is formally submitted.  However, there are still some universities who fail to offer this facility.  This can leave students vulnerable to scrutiny should their coursework be lost after it has been submitted.  Offering a receipt upon submission of coursework would eliminate this problem and ensure universities provide greater accountability to their students.",
