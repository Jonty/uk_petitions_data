            "background": "The British Formula One Grand Prix has spent the majority of the decade in the spotlight with regards to its facilities and fitting in with the image created by Bernie Ecclestone and his companies Formula One Management and Formula One Administration.\nWhilst the British Racing Drivers Club have continually spent considerable amounts on upgrading Silverstone to meet Mr Ecclestone\u2019s requirements, the decision was made to move the BGP to Donington from 2010.\nIt has become increasingly clear that this deal has run into continued difficulties which presently leave the BGP in a very perilous position. To think the possibility of there been no BGP on the Formula One calendar would be a travesty.\nI call upon the Prime Minister and the Government to get actively involved in safeguarding what is a national treasure and secure Britain\u2019s position in the top echelon of World Motorsport.\nThe sight of the Union Jack\u2019s at Silverstone is not equalled by any other country hosting a Grand Prix and this is an issue of National Pride born out of passion and heritage.",
