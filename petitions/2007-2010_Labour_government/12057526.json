            "background": "There is increasing evidence to demonstrate that food allergies, intolerances and problems associated with gastrointestinal dysbiosis (which may contribute to local and systemic fungal infections), can cause complicated and potentially serious symptoms in patients, affecting the quality of health and potentially significantly reduce life expectancy. \nMany GP's, gastrointestinal consultants, and non specialist allergy services are ill informed and ill equipped to diagnose and manage care of such conditions. If they do at all. Often symptoms may be put down to IBS, anxiety, or other generalised diagnoses. \nSymptoms may include, nausea, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, bloating, changes to bowel habit, wind, skin complaints, mood swings etc, and may severly impact on quality of life.\nSome patients may be treated for the wrong conditions without first ruling out dietary allergies, intolerances and/or dysbiosis.",
