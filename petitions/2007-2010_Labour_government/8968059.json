            "background": "Yesterday the Prime minister was asked in parliament if he would meet with the Dalai Lama when he next visits the UK in May. Prime minister Brown avoided answering the question directly, stating that an announcement would be made about the issues in Tibet. It has been suggested by some commentators that the Government does not want to meet with the Dalai Lama for fear of upsetting China. \nWe would ask that the Prime minister honour the governments commitment to an ethical foreign policy and allow a meeting between himself or David Miliband and the Dalai Lama.",
