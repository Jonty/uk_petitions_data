        "action": "Create a Royal Commission on Policing in the UK.  This should include a look at the following issues: The politicisation of policing, racial relations, the relationship between police and the citizen, the balance between necessary actions to prevent and detect crime and the right of citizens to be free from police intrusion, excessive use of powers of arrest and harassment, the methods used to investigate allegations of police brutality and deaths in custody, and the policing of legitimate protests.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is becoming increasingly clear that the relationships between the police and citizens is under strain.  Increased powers and the implementation of those powers has raised serious concerns that the police are being used as a political tool.  The dealing of protests has been greatly criticised.  A Royal Commission is needed to review methods of the police forces in Britain.",
