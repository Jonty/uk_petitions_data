        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Credit card companies make a fortune from charging excessive interest to cardholders who carry a balance forward from month to month. They are now trying to appear 'responsible' by closing card accounts or reducing limits to a large number of customers. Rather than helping the situation this is simply pushing people into complete financial collapse. A proper solution would be to allow customers to choose a monthly repayment that is somewhere between the 'minimum' (almost no capital repayment at todays absurdly high credit card interest rates) and 'total' (impossible if a balance has been built up). This would enable a phased and sustainable reduction in the account balance only possible currently with manual payments alongside the direct debit.",
