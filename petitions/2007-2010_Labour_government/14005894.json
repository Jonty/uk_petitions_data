Over the past four years there have been numberous domestic violence referals by the police and myself for the social services to act upon information provided. This has not been the case and it is only when transfering to a different county that the neglect was noticed that it was acted upon. \n\nCould my daughter have been another baby p? It only took 6 months of visits to see him murdered ... I think four years is way too long!\n\nPlease can you sign this petition so that the children who need help the most are acctually investigated by the social services and not left at risk.\n\nIt should save the life of one or more child by taking a few minutes to fill in.\n\nThank you!!!",
