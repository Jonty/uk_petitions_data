        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Clause 6 of the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Charging Scheme) Order 2008 which came into force on 15th November 2008 gives the Secretary of State the power to suspend the Order at any time when such suspension is considered necessary for the purpose of facilitating the movement of traffic or in the interests of the safety of the public.\n\nIn our opinion this clause should be invoked whenever the queuing time exceeds fifteen minutes. \n\nIt is inarguable that the health of residents of Kent and Essex and that of drivers caught up in this misery is being harmed.\n\nIt is equally inarguable that the Dartford Crossing is regularly & solely responsible for causing jams of over ten miles in length and delays in excess of one hour.\n\nIt is suggested that Le Crossing, the current operator, should be required to install sensors or make use of TrafficMaster information such that the toll gates should open automatically when delay is detected and remain open for as long as significant delays exist.\n\nSuch enforcement by the Minister of State could be used to incentivise the operator to provide a more efficient service.",
