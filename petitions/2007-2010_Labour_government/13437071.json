        "background": "A hybrid fission-initiated fusion nuclear reactor technology, a viable and cleaner alternative to the pure fission and pure fusion reactor technologies, has apparently been offered to the UK government. But, like many innovative ideas from unpopular sectors, this offer has been ignored. \n\nWe surely want this cleaner nuclear technology because this could give us leadership in a relatively new field of hybrid nuclear reactor technology. Moreover, there is the danger that this nuclear technology could get into irresponsible hands if not properly acted upon.\n\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister to act on the matter.",
