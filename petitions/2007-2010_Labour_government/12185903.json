            "background": "The government is keen to introduce varying types of health screening programmes. One group for whom a new programme should be created are the potential high risk non-occupational victims of mesothelioma, who have relations who have worked with asbestos and who may consequently have come into contact with it. Early detection could help with extending the life of such victims, who in many instances will already have gone through the trauma of seeing a relative die. At present diagnosis will normally occur at a time when the disease is advanced, with obvious implications for life expectancy.",
