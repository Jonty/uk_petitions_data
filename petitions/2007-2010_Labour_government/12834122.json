            "background": "Up until now, busking has been permitted on Southbank between the Oxo Tower and the London Eye. It was previously one of the few locations in which people were free to busk (as it is primarily a non-residential area), along with the strictly monitored performance spots within the London Underground. After the recent influx of Romani buskers (who play with accordions and brass instruments up and down the river), and due to their generally rude and uncompromising manner, the local coucil has decided to revoke the right for anyone to perform in the area.\n\nWe believe that Southbank, as a cultural hub of london, should be a place where people are free to express themselves through music and other artforms, not just another space used by large businesses and corporations to take our money (especially during the current economic crisis).\n\nSo give the people back their space,\nwith fair rules and regulations to keep things running smoothly.",
