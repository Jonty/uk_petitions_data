        "background": "The recent change in policy by Lloyds TSB in the offering of credit cards, has resulted in children as young as 11 years old receiving unsolicited credit applications without the knowledge of their Parents. This practice goes against so many principles of governance, moral standards and totally ignoring the wishes of their legal guardians its hard to list them all in a short petition. This immoral, repugnant and reprehensible practice must cease immediately.",
