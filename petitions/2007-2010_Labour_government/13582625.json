Some profess to be \"family friendly\" and as such I think need to make every effort to live up to such high ideals rather than merely pay lip service to it.\n\nSo, I would like to ask for your signature to create a law or government guidelines which can be enforce upon such sites to make sure ALL that appears on them is indeed \"family friendly\".",
