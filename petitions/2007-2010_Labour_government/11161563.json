In return for our custom those Companies expect us to pay them for their pitiful offerings of customer support when they get it all wrong. They give us 0870 phone in call centres staffed with badly trained call handlers, many of them thousands of miles away in other Countries. Why should these Companies profit from their lack of ability or resolve to deliver what we have already paid them for?",
