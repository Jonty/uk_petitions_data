        "background": "In the media, where children are influenced, and young women celebreties are often 'accused' of having 'cellulite' or of appearing less than perfect, the hatred and jealousy of journalists shows through these pictures. It may be amusing for some journalists to write and photograph such people, but today, as an example, I read of a young girl dying from an eating disorder. Probably from seeing a picture that branded a role model of hers as somehow 'wrong' for not being perfect at a size 10. In short, pictures taken without consent are violating privacy and civil liberties, and are influencing young people in harmful ways via the press. Please legislate and bring back our right to privacy and consent to having our pictures taken anywhere, and stop the gutter press from ruining young lives.",
