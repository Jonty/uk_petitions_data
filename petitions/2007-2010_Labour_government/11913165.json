            "background": "Leigh in Lancashire has for far too long been disconnected from the national rail network.\nThe proposed guided busway is in many peoples opinion, doomed to failure.\nLeigh NEEDS a railway link, especially now that so much development is going on to improve the town, the sports village, the rushes complex, new housing etc. The transport infrastructure needs sorting out, Leigh is far too big a town to not have a proper rail link, in fact it is probably the largest town in the UK to not have a rail connection.",
