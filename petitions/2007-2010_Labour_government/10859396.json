            "background": "It is wrong that the poorest people in Britain should pay companies such as BT \u00a34.50 every three months to be able to pay bills with cash. Many people can't afford to default on a direct debit so have no alternative.  The Prime Ministers party was created to protect the poor not allow companies to rip them off.  The Republic Of Ireland made these charges illegal and rightly so.  Why should BT charge five million people \u00a318 each every year to pay by cash and be allowed to make 90 million pounds a year from poor people.  If the Prime Minister won't help the poor then who will.  I hope everyone will remember these charges that have only appeared on our bills since this government have been in power and ask every member of parliament why they have not shouted from the rooftops at these scandalous charges being forced on the poorest in the country.",
