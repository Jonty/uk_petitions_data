Anyone else must pay! People are taking advantage of our free healthcare by organising trips to the UK to get free operations and medical check ups. Expectant mothers (including Americans!) even organise to come here on thier due date to get free maternity care! The british tax payer is paying for all of it! It must stop now! Charge them now!",
