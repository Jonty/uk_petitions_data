            "background": "Internet sites such as youtube still contain and show film footage of violence and disorder connected to street gangs and should be banned. With all of the concern around Films and computer games which depict violence how can it be right that young children and those involved in crime can have access to view gangs and those involved with these crimes have a means to show off weapons, stolen vehicles, violence and themselves freely committing many other criminal offences. These sites do nothing but promote violence and hate within the community. All of this footage should be banned and removed from these sites and then investigated by the local police authorities.With the recent and on going events around gangs and crime in this country we see this as a very small step in the right direction.",
