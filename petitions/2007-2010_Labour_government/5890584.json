        "background": "People who have no TV licence because they have no TV set are regularly harrassed with threats that they will be referred the the \"Enforcement Division for Investigation\" if they do not answer a letter within a couple of weeks.\n\nThe non TV owner must supply their own envelope and stamp or pay their own phone call cost for the priveledge of not owning a TV set.\n\nThe letter is highly intimidating.\n\nMost non TV holders are those with disabilities like the hard of hearing, the blind, those with TV set induced seizures.  They are made to feel intensely guilty that they do not have a set or license.\n\nOthers merely don't want a license - and why should they feel obliged to own a TV?\n\nThis petition is to stop innocent non TV owners being subjected to this harrassment and expense replying to these offensive letters.",
