This is what the rich monopolous music and film companies try to do. They try to block the new innovations in software to allow them to maintain there business model and therefore maintain their money stream. This isn't acceptable.\n\nBut there is more to this. It seems to be unworkable you will simply get a new wave of cross-platform viruses with disasterous consequences. They will lead to the disconnection of thousands of peoples internet connection. Since they will be able to behind the scenes download illegal files. It seems there will be no way around this.",
