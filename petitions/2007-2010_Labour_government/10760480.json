            "background": "According to new statistics the UK is the highest charging country in europe for childcare, the average nursery charging now between \u00a34.20 - \u00a35.60 per hour per child, some offering reductions for a second child placement.\n\nOn average it will cost the average household, working full time, around \u00a3750-897 per month, which averages to over \u00a310,000 per year.\n\nI am petitioning for the government and prime minister to start rewarding full time working parents by helping with the childcare fees.  At the moment they have a low income barrier earnings calculator, even if the first step was too get this raised so more people are entitled to the benefit.\n\nChildcare is crippling the majority of households and it is about time the government stepped in too help instead of wasting money on other pointless projects.",
