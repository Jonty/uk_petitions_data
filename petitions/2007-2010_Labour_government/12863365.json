As it states on their website - PHYSICAL CONFRONTATION\nFascism is a violent ideology, which throughout history has been prepared to use violence against those it opposes, and against those who challenge it politically. The 635 Group is part of the physical force anti-fascist tradition, prepared to confront fascism by force when we deem it necessary and appropriate. Physical confrontation is only one of our tactics though, we do not aim to fetishise it as one tactic above all others, nor will we allow a hierarchy to develop based on the kudos of street-fighting. If an individual member feels unable to engage on this level they are no less worthy as an anti-fascist than any other member of the group, however those with a \"moral\" problem regarding this issue should be advised that this is not the group for them.",
