This Government is hoping we forget their incompetence but the least they can do is to create new insurance numbers for those lost so that in future years when we are less vigilent we are not caught out.  It should appeal to Gordon Brown as it will mean more civil servants that might vote for him and as all labour Governments - they love their Quangos.  I just want a guarantee that my details are not in cyberspace in a few years time.  At this time this Government cannot guarantee this.",
