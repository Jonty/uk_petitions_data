Such a network would give British business users an edge over competitors in other western countries and help establish Britian as a world leader in the emerging technologies market. With so many of this countries traditional industries on teh decline isn't it time we sought new traditions. Foreing business / investors are far more likely to choose to invest in britain if we have something to offer that no one else can. An nation-wide superfast IT infastructure which their business could easily plug into could be just the edge we need. Billions upon billions of pounds of international trade could flow through that infastructure and create millions of jobs.",
