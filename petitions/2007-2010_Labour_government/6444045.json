        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Billy Connolly has just about earned every honour and accolade available to  for his services to the entertainment industry, and received recognition for his many charitable good works.. In the current climate, in entertainment, such figures have been recognised in such ways (ie Sir Sean Connery,Sir Mick jagger,Sir elton John.) It is long overdue that Dr Connolly has thus far not received the ultimate recognition that his peers already enjoy. As an icon of late 20th Century British culture, and considering the event of his 65th birthday in November 2007, what more fitting tribute could be bestowed on Britain's favourite comedian. I urge you to consider my proposal, and for my petition to be agreed..",
