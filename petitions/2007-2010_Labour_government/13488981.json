            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "When the wholesale price of gas and electricity rises the suppliers more often than not pass 100% of that rise on to their customers as quick as they can.  However, when the wholesale prices drop as they have this year there was not a proportionate drop in prices charged to consumers. eg.  if wholesale prices rise by 30% you and I pay 30% more but if wholesale prices were to drop 30% we are lucky to see a 10% drop in prices.  I propose a tariff that tracks wholesale prices in the same way a tracker mortgage tracks the base rate of interest.",
