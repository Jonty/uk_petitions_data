            "background": "It has been a number of years since Middlesbrough town had a direct rail service to London. A town of such size rquires the a direct link to the capital and not be 'cut off' the main rail network.\n\n This would be possible by diverting the HST sets from Newcastle to run down the Durham coast line serving the city of Sunderland and Hartlepool then reverse from Middlesbrough down to Northallerton. Granted that Grand Central provides services from Sunderland and Hartlepool to London, they do not cater for leisure advance travellers who require a bargain fare or for the likes of my self, students who would actually like to use the young persons railcard.",
