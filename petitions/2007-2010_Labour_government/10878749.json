            "background": "I was shocked to learn that money was having to be raised through charity donations, to provide facilities for the rehabilitation of our injured troops.  Surely the Government should be only too willing to provide the \u00a36 million required, indeed it is it's duty!!  \n   About this charity: \nH4H provides support for wounded servicemen and women injured during the course of their duty. It is a short term charity appeal with an urgent need to raise 6 million to fund the construction of a swimming pool and gymnasium complex at Headley Court, the tri-service rehabilitation centre in Leatherhead.",
