        "background": "Under the Licensing Act, a performance by one musician in a bar, restaurant, school or hospital not licensed for live music could lead to a criminal prosecution of those organising the event. Even a piano may count as a licensable 'entertainment facility'. By contrast, amplified big screen broadcast entertainment is exempt. The government says the Act is necessary to control noise nuisance, crime, disorder and public safety, even though other laws already deal with those risks. Musicians warned the Act would harm small events. About 50% of bars and 75% of restaurants have no live music permission. Obtaining permission for the mildest live music remains costly\u00a0and time-consuming. In May, the Culture, Media and Sport\u00a0Committee recommended exemptions for venues up to 200 capacity and for unamplified performance by one or two musicians. The government said no.\u00a0But those exemptions\u00a0would restore some fairness in the regulation of live music and encourage grassroots venues.",
