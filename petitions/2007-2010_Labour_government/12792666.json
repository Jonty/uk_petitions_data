            "background": "Banks operate a cartel when setting the LIBOR rate. There is no prior consultation with those borrowers directly & materially affected by their decision. Both aspects may be illegal. Credit card suppliers are increasing interest rates to make good their previous negligence & lack of due diligence when doling out credit in the past. There is a precedent for setting a limit to be taken from the introduction, by the Government, of the 1% World in the Life & Pensions sector.",
