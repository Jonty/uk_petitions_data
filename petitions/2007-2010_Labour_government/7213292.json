Look into the reasons why people are drinking. In my case I need a couple of glasses of wine when I arrive home from work because I am so stressed out from my drive home on our overcrowded British  roads. Cars are here to stay. Build more roads. I like many others are using roads that were designed for horse and carts to try and escape the traffic, it\u2019s shocking.",
