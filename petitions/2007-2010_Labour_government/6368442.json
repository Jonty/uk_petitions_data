            "background": "Currently, several European nations, including the Germans, do not fulfill the NATO obligation to spend not less than 2% of GDP on the military; the results are bad for EVERYONE because, for example, the Germans cannot provide more planes and helicopters for ISAF. Their militaries are unsuitable for fighting wars, so neither are they able to help the British military when they are needed, nor can they defend themselves (they rely on the US military). The government should choose allies wisely, and if these European allies don't help, then NATO may as well be dissolved (I'm serious). Remember, it was supposed to be a MUTUAL defence alliance.",
