            "background": "I suffer from M.E/CFS and am mortified to find despite its dibilitating effects on our health, disabling us from working, there are no benefits we can claim, we should be able to claim DLA but can't, some of us cannot claim incapacity benefit due to lack of contributions, so there isn't much left.\nI urge anyone to help me get names of both non-sufferers and sufferers alike to sign this petition.\nM.E/CFS is no joke, I feel ill all of the time, glands always swollen, sore throat, tired all of the time, like I have got perpetual flu, muscle aches ect; I don't know when I can return to work, but I am living on the edge too, and so down.\nWe need a benefit we can claim, stop using tax-payers money on things like building a mosque and use it to better fund a benefit for M.E/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, or at least change the DLA ruling so we can claim that.",
