            "background": "Many local councils provide disabled parking spaces, some provide mother and baby ones. However, the 'normal' spaces are on the small side, particularly for today's cars. This means that heavily pregnant women may park their cars only to return to find they cannot get in, due to the proximity of the car next door! Pregnant women are not ill, they do not largely require special treatment, however faced with a three hour wait while the driver returns next door can have many undesireable effects, from uncollected children from nursery, to missed hospital appointments or simply incurring a fine for not moving your car!\n\nWhile it is unreasonable administration to ask for temporary blue badge status for pregnant women, is there some identification that could be used that would allow women in, say, the last two months of pregnancy, to use either disabled spaces, or to indicate that the end rows of all car parks be designated for the use of pregnant/disabled/mother & baby, using perhaps the NHS maternity exemption cards already in existence as identification?",
