An additional incentive is to pay perhaps 80% of the market price in deferred instalments say annually over 3-5 years?. The management of these units can be done by the council or social landlords for a fixed fee?\n2)\tSimilarly, a zero rate tax rate for all privately owned lets to the homeless.\n3)\tDo also consider converting all those unsold shared ownership units held by housing associations to general needs  and please do not \u201cclaw back\u201d the VAT recovery made on the taxable status of shared ownership units. \n4)\tPlease have a zero rate tax for the not for profit community run companies.\n5)\tCommunity centres should be encouraged on all estates with more than 20 units and VAT zero rated status on all these facilities.\n\nDo increase the higher rate tax band to 50% to fund the tax cuts. \n\nPlease spare a thought for the homeless as you have the power to make a difference.",
