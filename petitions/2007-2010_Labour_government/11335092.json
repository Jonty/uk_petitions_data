            "background": "Whilst many pensioners who are relatively wealthy in many cases receive up to \u00a3400 to help with winter fuel costs, poor families with babies and young children under 5 receive no help and struggle to keep them warm. Babies of the poor need warmth as much as the elderly. The government needs to give additional help to those in receipt of means-tested benefits with children under 5 as a matter of urgency",
