            "background": "This petition recognises that there is a new hidden unemployed. Those in their 40's particularly late 40's who have difficulty gaining employment due to being over qualified or new graduates.  They will become a massive burden on the state later in life as they will not have gained enough NI contributions to obtain pensions or other benefit credits.  They are being excluded and descriminated against due to qualifications or work history.  Give them more assistance and use their vast experience to rebuild the economy and social society.",
