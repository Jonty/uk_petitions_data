            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At present toll fees exist on both bridges on the M4 and the M48.For workers that use these bridges to get to and from their place of work this is a reprehensible cost and substantially reduces the average weekly wage.For those workers that are taxed using the PAYE system there is no process to retrieve this cost.This is an unfair financial restriction on movement of labour between England and Wales,and for the thousands of PAYE workers that make this journey daily the only alternative is to add many miles to each trip by travelling up to the land-link 'toll-free' roads near Gloucester.This detour is not a viable alternative because of the enviromental implications and the extra amount of required fuel(and travel time). \nThere are three alternatives to this unfair toll:\n1-Make it a free crossing for all\n2-Make it a free crossing for those going to and from their place of work (if they are on PAYE)\n3-Enable PAYE workers to retrieve this cost as a tax credit in their weekly pay.\nThe advantages of removing this toll for local employees and employers alike are numerous.",
