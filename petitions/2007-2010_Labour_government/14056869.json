            "background": "We are concerend that L/Cpl Lawrence Soni is being investigated for an alledged War Crime committed whilst on  tour of duty in Afghanistan. L/Cpl Soni had a few days before the alledged incident suffered the traumatic loss of his lifelong friend Corporal Joe 'Etch'Etchells. L/Cpl Soni had just returned from a Patrol in the same area as Cpl Etchell had been murdered on entering the safe compound he was informed of the capture of  two suspected Taliban insurgents who were caught planting an I.E.D, these men were also suspected of plant the I.E.D that killed 'Etch', When Lawrence walked past these two cowards one laughed in his face, Lawrence the hit the insurgent. We believe that rather than be indited on a War Crime charge L/Cpl Soni should be commended on his remarkable restraint in not shooting the insurgent",
