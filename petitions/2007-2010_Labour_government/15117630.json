            "background": "My name is Hannah. I'm a married Mum of 3 who recently found out my life would change forever through disability.\n\nI suffered nerve damage to my spine & leg during a knee stabilisation procedure. The nerve damage has caused extra problems such as CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome) muscle wastage, paresthesia & osteoporosis.\n\nI was assessed by the occupational therapist. Her recommendations were an extension for ground floor accomodation, downstairs wetroom, a disabled friendly kitchen & a driveway. This was to be done via a disabled facilities grant.\n\nAn application was made. UK law states they have to respond within 6 months.20 months later & nothing.\n\nIt is happening to alot of housing authority tenants. Local authorities have a public duty as stated by law to promote disability & the welfare of the disabled. It is clear they are not fulfilling their duties.",
