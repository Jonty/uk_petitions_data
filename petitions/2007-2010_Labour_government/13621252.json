        "background": "We request that benefit payments be removed as a cash scheme, because this system is old, over subscribed and filled with major corruption.  The replacement scheme should include a booklet which contains stamps and coupons, which entitles the claimant to spend these at recommended outlets, up to the value on the coupon.\nThis new scheme would entitle the user to the same benefits, but under much more control.\nThis scheme would save millions of pounds and remove virtually all fraudulent activity within the benefit system.",
