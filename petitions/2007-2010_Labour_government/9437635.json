Many people do not eat \"five-a-day\", but pure fruit juices do count as part of it nutritionally. If all pure fruit juices were to be reclassified as a food they would become exempt from ALL VAT. The lower prices would encourage more people to drink them which would improve peoples' health, saving time off work and costs to the NHS.",
