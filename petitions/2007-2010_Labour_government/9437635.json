        "background": "I drink pure fruit juices daily as both a health benefit and because I enjoy them. I also eat more than my \"five-a-day\" portions of fruit and vegetables. Many people do not eat \"five-a-day\", but pure fruit juices do count as part of it nutritionally. If all pure fruit juices were to be reclassified as a food they would become exempt from ALL VAT. The lower prices would encourage more people to drink them which would improve peoples' health, saving time off work and costs to the NHS.",
