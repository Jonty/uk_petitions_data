        "background": "The family of murdered schoolgirl Lynda Mann has been banned from putting a petition on the this website demanding killer Colin Pitchfork stays in jail for the rest of his life. Downing Street officials told the family the subject matter is \"not appropriate\" for an online petition. Simon Eaton, 32, of Wigston, is the cousin of Lynda, who was raped and murdered by Pitchfork in 1983. He wanted to put a petition on this website demanding Pitchfork \u2013 who also raped and murdered 15-year-old Dawn Ashworth \u2013 is not allowed to leave jail early. The double child killer was jailed for life in 1988. Last week, he appeared at the Court of Appeal in a bid to reduce his minimum 30-year tariff. \"We feel very strongly that this man should spend the rest of his life behind bars,\" said Simon. \"I wanted to do my bit to help and thought a petition on the Number 10 website might be good. There are petitions for all sorts of things on the website \u2013 and yet we're not allowed to put a petition on there about this.\" \nIf you believe that the family of Lynda Mann have earned the right to place a petition on this site then please sign below.",
