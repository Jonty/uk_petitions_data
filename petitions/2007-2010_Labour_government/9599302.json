            "background": "Since the farce of \"political\" voting has dogged yet another Eurovision Song Contest. With Sir Terry Wogan arguing that the event is no longer \"a song contest\". Isn't it about time that the UK and the BBC withdraw from this highly political contest? Moreover, the BBC is one of the biggest financiers of the contest giving \u00a3173,000 of the license fee towards the cost. Wouldn't you agree that this once enjoyable contest is now becoming a waste of time and license payer's money?",
