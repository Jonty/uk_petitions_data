            "background": "Fast approaching the October 10 deadline for the public consultation in response to the DBRR* paper The Future of Nuclear Power, we urge all UK women to support this petition to prevent the disastrous,irreversible development of more nuclear power stations and the immediate, safe decommissioning of existing ones. We are outraged that this consultation paper excludes any mention of the fatal medical consequences of further radioactive material production. Antinuclear medical expert Dr Helen Caldicott can demonstrate nuclear power production leads to random compulsory genetic engineering for the rest of time. She also corrects myths that nuclear production is clean when its vast consumption of resources in fact generates huge amounts of Co2. Helen has noted that rising temperatures due to climate change already threaten the safe cooling of nuclear reactors. Reactors also enable nuclear weapons proliferation, adding to a current capacity to annihilate life on earth 12 times over.\n*DTI",
