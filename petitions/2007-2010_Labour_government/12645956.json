        "background": "The Royal mail is forced by law under the people act to deliver election material...we do not believe that this law should include partys like the BNP.\n\nTheir leaflets are anti immigration and anti immigrant and have been posted into many ethnic minority households which is offensive to them and many house holds for that matter. Every body knows what the BNP stands for and most people find this offensive it also stirs up community racial tensions and does nothing for community cohesion.\n\nPosting a peice of paper into someones letter box who is \"not british\" or may have family relatives of different ethnic origin that states to put non \"native\" british people second, and wishing all immigrants/ non \"natives\" to leave the country is a form of hate crime to any ethnic minority.\n\nAnd had it been posted by anyone else it would of been considered as such.\n\nplease change the law so royal mail do not have to deliver them again...the public find those leaflets offensive and we do not want them!",
