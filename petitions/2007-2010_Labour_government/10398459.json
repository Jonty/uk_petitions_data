        "background": "The UK has strong ties with Commonwealth countries. These teachers hold similar teaching qualifications to the UK trained teachers. Some of them even hold Bachelors\u2019 degrees and MEd from the UK universities, and have received CPD in their schools at the expense of the UK tax-payers. Those who have been teaching for more than four years with OTT status confirm this. The National Union of Teachers passed a motion to support the recognition of these teachers' qualifications by the UK government, just like teachers whose countries belong to the EU. Commonwealth teachers also benefit the UK economy.",
