            "background": "I have seen the horrendous injuries that bladed boots can cause to the wearer of the boots and the opponent of the wearer. Horrific true stories can be found just by searching bladed boots in google.The severity of the injuries could have easily been reduced if the player/s had been wearing studs.I feel (although I haven't been personally affected) that this needs to be brought to the attention of someone in power so manufacturers of these boots and the respective people in charge can do something about this so-called 'minor' problem and stop these injuries. There will always be injuries but sometimes they shouldn't be as bad as they are.Careers have been prematurely ended and in some cases because of the severity and the trauma the victim has never been able to play their sport again.The lifestyles of the affected willl never be the same again.",
