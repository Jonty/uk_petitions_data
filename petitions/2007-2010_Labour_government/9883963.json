            "background": "We would ask that every housing officer is provided with compulsory training around the problems and issues that street homeless substance miss-users face and the reasons why these people feel a need to misuse substances in their lives. The housing of Homeless substance users is failing due to the lack of knowledge and understanding around the client group by housing officers across the country resulting in needless deaths that could and should be prevented.Street Homeless clients are at the lowest point ofthe housing chain making them one of the most vulnerable groups, they should be accepted and treated as such. Many use substances including Alcohol to block out feelings left from abuse,violence and traumatic experiences which is not understood by the people who can offer them safe accomodation which in turn prevents them moving on in life with the correct support.",
