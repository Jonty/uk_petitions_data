        "background": "in the last month or two i have noticed more and more articles about animal cruelty. one incident in liverpool a 17 year old boy was given 4 months for allowing his dog to savage foxes and cats that he had captured and filmed this! 4 months is outrageous! i have been speaking to people who agree with my theory if people can hurt animals in that way they are in the same league as child abusers as they only prey on defencless victims in which i see animals are also defenceless victims. Please help as this is becoming out of control! we need lenghty prison terms to show how serious animal cruelty is and will not be looked upon lightly",
