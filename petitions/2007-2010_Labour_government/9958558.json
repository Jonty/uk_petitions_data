The victims are currently taking court cases both in Turkey & in the UK.We are becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack & speed of communications between the 2 jurisdictions.We want to know what can be done to open up the lines of communication between both jurisdictions as this is unnecessarily delaying the victims in getting their money back.Some of the victims face financial ruin unless this money is returned to us & returned quickly. We are all honest, tax paying UK citizens & we beg you to do all in your power to help our case.",
