        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With the change in modern viewing habits and the switch to Digital TV surely it is time for the TV License Fee to be pensioned off as viewers now have a choice of TV platforms from which to choose which were not around at the time the TV License was brought in, surely now is time for the BBC to find other ways of funding itself instead of the public being forced into paying ever increasing License fees to support the running of the BBC. Other Channels and platforms manage without public funding so surely after all these years of public funding the BBC can find other ways of funding itself. The TV License Fee is no longer a small contribution for having a Television set it is a stealth Tax on anyone owning devices that are able to broadcast BBC channels such as radio, TV or online media.",
