I visted everything i could, Buckingham palace, big ben, westminster abbey, the ritz, london eye, kensington palace and the 'princess diana memorial fountain'. Which i was very disappointed in. \nLady Princess Diana captured the hearts of millions across the world.\nShe was the peoples princess and the world loves her to this day, billions of people cried and prayed when she passed away that tragic night in paris.\nIn honor of Princess Diana, i propose there should be a statue of her that we can all visit to look up to and remember her. to pay our respects and lay flowers. A statue that all the other kings, queens and royal people have, why not her? if anyone in the world desearves this, its princess diana. xxx",
