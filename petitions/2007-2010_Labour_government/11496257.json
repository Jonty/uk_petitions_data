            "background": "Action needs to be taken against Mr Stringer for his outrageous claim that dyslexia doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n Mr Stringer describes dyslexia as a \"cruel fiction\" that should be consigned to the \"dustbin of history\". He believes the reason many children cannot read and write properly is that the wrong teaching methods are used.\n\nUnfortunately, if he researched dyslexia he would have found out that it  is a lot more then just \"not being able to read or write\" You can be the most intelligent person in the world, but with dyslexia you just need a supporting hand to help you organise muddled thinking, something  which is most definitely not due to \u201cbad teaching\u201d \n\nHow on earth can he state that dyslexia doesn\u2019t exist when he is used to interpreting things one way, used to seeing things one way?",
