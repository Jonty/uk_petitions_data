        "action": "introduce a ban on taxpayer-funded council publications from accepting advertising or sponsorship",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In many areas across the U.K., local councils publish news pamphlets.\n\nCouncils have a mandate to inform residents about programs within the community.  It should come as no surprise when council-published content reflects views of the council.  Alone, this is no cause for concern.\n\nAdvertising can defray costs for such pamphlets. Unfortunately, by virtue of their taxpayer subsidy, council pamphlets offer advertisers lower prices which independent papers can\u2019t match.  This allows these pamphlets to grow into \"pseudo-newspapers\" which crowd out local newspapers.\n\nA ban on council-funded pamphlets carrying ads would keep them from using taxpayer funds to compete unfairly against local newspapers which might present differing views.\n\nAs columnist Andrew Gilligan noted in his 27.07.09 Evening Standard article, \"The propaganda newspapers\", this is not a party political issue -- there are councils on each side of the political spectrum which could be considered to have overstepped the mark.",
