            "background": "This petition asks the Prime Minister to ensure that the murderers who committed such a heinous act in the name of the government be charged with murder along with the officers who authorised the shooting. It is unacceptable that an innocent man be killed by the police and then have the facts covered up and lies told to the public about the case. The fact that a foreign national can be murdered by the police on British soil with impunity is abhorrent and against all principles of the Justice our democracy was founded on. If this is not forthcoming we call upon the Prime Minister and head of the Police service to resign and call an immediate general election as he and his government will be deemed unfit to hold office or represent the people of this nation.",
