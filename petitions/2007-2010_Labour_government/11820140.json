        "background": "The new ships HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales were first promised a 'non negotiable' in service date of 2012, now that has been moved to 2014, and now expected to be delayed a further '2 or so years'.\n\nThis pointless cost cutting will put our national security at risk and impede our countries ability to project influence around the world.\n\nWe want the new carriers to be brought into service by 2014, the time that BAE systems says that the aircraft that will fly from them will be ready. There is no valid excuse for further delays.",
