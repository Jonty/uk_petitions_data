            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Please can you change the law to give more child maintenance to the children who live with their mother or father that care for them. Because at the moment the child maintenance law only makes the absent parent pay 15% of their income or benefits.Why should a child with an absent parent suffer have to go without items, new clothes, days out, holidays etc. It is very hard for parent on their own with only one wage coming in. Due to the need to pay rent, mortgage, council tax, bills etc, a lot of parents can\u2019t afford to buy their children items like games consoles and mobiles that all their friends have. These items are very important for young children and teenagers. Furthermore, many of these parents cannot afford internet access at home which is very important for a child\u2019s education, with it being the best resource for information anywhere. In addition, many children are teased and bullied because they cannot afford nice things or only have one parent. The absent parent should have to pay more because of the effect their absence has on their child\u2019s life. \nWhat is more, absent parents should pay child maintenance from the birth of their child until they finish their education.",
