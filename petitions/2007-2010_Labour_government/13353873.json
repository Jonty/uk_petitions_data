            "background": "PM, I like to request that there is a system of self evaluation and adaptation in Job Centres. One advice is: there should be Financial advisors in Job Centres who can help and inform people in dealing with their financial issues e.g. council tax, mortgages, government schemes available (one window facility). \n\nThere are number of government initiatives in response to current financial crisis but these initiatives are not widely heard of and the information is not readily available to the people who might benefit from these initiatives. For example most of middle class job seekers would assume that job seekers allowance is just about a little payment, but there are other benefits to it i.e. council tax benefits, mortgage support schemes. \n\nJC should also organise seminars and workshops where people can go and improve there job hunting skills e.g. interview techniques etc.\n\n\nMore than any thing people need personalised service where there problems at the least are professionally evaluated and possibly sorted.\nI think this is one area where government can improve the efficiency of the system without any major investment by leveraging the existing mechanisms.",
