        "background": "Bring MPs final salary pensions in line with private sector schemes. MPs currently only contribute a max \u00a36k a year towards their pensions for an annuity of \u00a340k. The Private sector would need to squirrel away over \u00a321k a year to get the same ! Hardly seems fair does it ? Join me in lobbying the removal of these scandalous schemes that is costing all of us dearly and lining the pockets of our MPs !! Equality is a word this government used to take seriously.",
