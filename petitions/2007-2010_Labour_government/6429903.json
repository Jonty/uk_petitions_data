            "background": "At the moment there is barely any tax on short haul flights in the UK so they are often cheaper than the train or public transport equivelant. But this would not apply for journeys to Northern Ireland!(2 trains and a boat fare) Also, by the time I would use the 2 trains & the boat, I would arrive in Northern Ireland in the middle of the night, so then there is no public transport and I could get stranded. If short haul (domestic) flights are to be taxed then it should only be GB mainland (it is easier for people from the mainland can use the trains instead).",
