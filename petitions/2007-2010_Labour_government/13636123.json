            "background": "5500 sufferers of neuromuscular conditions. muscular dystrophy. living in the entire east of england region have no access to a regional care advisor. unlike the rest of england and especially the south west where 5 new posts have been created. these advisors are a necessity to people with these conditions to the extent that it could in some cases increase life expectancy by up to 10 years. that is the difference between a duchene sufferer living in the north east surviving until early 30's against someone in the east of england surviving only until early 20's. This is unacceptable and requires immediate government action for the nhs to fund this  much needed position.",
