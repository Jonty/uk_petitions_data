            "background": "Robert Fidler built a castle on his farm and his family has been living in it since 2002. He hid the castle behind haybales so as to try and avoid having to get planning permission. The building has been standing for over four years, and as such is a legal building having been standing for longer than 4 years without complaints, however Reigate and Banstead Borough Council insist it must be demolished. This is a petition for his house to remain standing.",
