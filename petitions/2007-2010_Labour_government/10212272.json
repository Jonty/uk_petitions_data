            "background": "virgin media have started limiting bandwidth use during certain hours of the day for XL users paying \u00a337 that is a limit of 3gb per day that only 20 minutes of downloads or game play. Then your speed drops making it almost impossible to play xbox live games and download any content as fast as should be. \n\nThe problem is they are selling a product by speed and are not offering this speed at peak times (anywhere from 4pm to 1am)\n\nthis seems wrong that they can sell an unlimted service with a advertised 20MB (not UPTO!) and then limit your downloads for upto 12 hours after you have hit 3GB in a day!! \n\nless for other users.\n\nThe ISP's are blaming pirates but as I have clearly shown this is not the case, it is normal useage for todays bandwidth hungry services and it is unacceptable that our service is being degraded\n\nthis needs to be looked into and stopped before others follow suit.",
