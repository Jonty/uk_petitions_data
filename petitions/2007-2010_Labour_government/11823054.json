            "background": "Did you know you can be convicted in England on the word of a single person? No other form of evidence is needed. Yet a trusted Police officer cannot get you convicted of speeding if They're alone. Seems far fetched? Read the law it is stated in Archbolds and Blackstones the cornerstone of the law used by every magistrate and crown court judge. Either everyone can be convicted on the word of one person or no one can, not without substantial evidence to prove the case. In no other country in the world is this allowed to happen not even the \"developing\" nations. We stand alone in this complete injustice. \nPlease help change the law, many MP's are already fighting my cause, lets give them some weight against this injustice.",
