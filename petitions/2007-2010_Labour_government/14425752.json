        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Gordon Brown,\nI live in Canada now, that little cold country we still own over to the West and just a little bit above America where all the fat people live?\nMy good friends Scott & Marissa Orton live in a little village called St George with 2 dogs, Gordon and Brown, they recently bought an RV which inside looks like a Palace with a sink and a bucket.\nThey are really nice people and I would like you to consider making them King and Queen of St George because Marissa would look lovely with a crown as she has such beautiful hair.\nThey have volunteered to look after Buckingham Palace when the Queen is on vacation or posing for a new stamp. Scott has a working knowledge of vacuum cleaners and Marissa invented Fabreze but was too proud to market it. She also named it Kamoola-zoom-bang before it became Fabreeze. I am in the process of perfecting my latest invention for them, the Easy Broom. Basically it is a broom powered by children\u2019s tears and a fetish for cheese remnants. \nKing Scott 1st and I have no ambition to form an Air Force or Navy but we do have lots of toy soldiers in our Army, all named after famous sports shoe manufacturers. We have 3 soldiers, Sergeant Nike, Corporal Adidas and Private Puma.",
