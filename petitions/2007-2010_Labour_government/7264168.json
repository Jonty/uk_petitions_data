            "background": "Currently diesel is subject to a higher rate of tax then unleaded fuel which surely given the goverments push to go green is wrong.  Diesel is also cheaper to refine than unleaded and yet with the heavy taxation is still more expensive per litre at the pumps.\n\nLowering the tax on diesel fules will also have a positive impact on not only our transport industry, but also the price of products we buy.  Transported by train or road, they are moved using diesel.  A reduction in transport costs will result in cheaper living expenses for everything from food to clothing.",
