            "background": "This is intended to stop companies (in particular, financial companies who send out pre-approved credit card applications) sending post to customers previous addresses.\n\nCompanies often continue to send out promotional items to people who have had very little dealings with them for years on end. This can often include personal information and I feel this makes it very easy for people to become victims of identity theft to the new occupants of their old home/previous tenancy. \n\nTherefore I would like to limit the amount of time companies can hold onto their customers details to one year in order to reduce vunerability to people who have moved from their previous address, as it is these people who are most at risk from identity theft.",
