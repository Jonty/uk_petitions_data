            "background": "The local and national government continues to reduce popper police presence on the streets in favour of special constables and community support officers with no real power thus leading to increasing troubles in communities and more and more young kids vandalising, fighting, drinking, and smoking in public. I, the creator of this petition am not an old man, I am barely in my twenties but even I know the youth of today are a disgrace. As my old Granddad will say there was a time once when this country's youth had respect for their community and knew that if they misbehaved their local bobby would give them a clip round the ear, and you wouldn't dare do it again otherwise your parents would find out and you would get one from them too. I say bring back popper local community bobbies and let the give kids a clip round the ear like it used to be.",
