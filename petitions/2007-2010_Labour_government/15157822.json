The legitimacy of the PM by default is critically underminded and is embarrassing the UK on the world stage.  His position is untenabable and a general election must be called to clear out the MPs that have bought disgrace to the system.  The persons caught out by Dispatches are almost certainly not the only persons lobbying and cheating the tax payer.  An general election must be called immediately to restore credibility to our historic and recently tarnished institutions.  It is time to flush out the corruption",
