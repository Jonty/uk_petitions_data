Personally I want the PM to ban the incessant media hype and make all TV, papers and radio to stick to reporting the facts.  This has to happen before financial meltdown. Lets remember the Northern Rock fiasco could have been contained and resolved easily without the media frenzy. We should all do our bit and refuse to buy another newspaper or watch the TV news. \"NO NEWS is GOOD NEWS!!\"",
