            "background": "We demand that the privilages, which prevent the full investigations of MPs, including bugging of their conversations when necessary, be removed. Many MPs are apparently incapable of acting with honesty and integrety, and appear to the public as corrupt. An investigation of all MPs is now necessary to restore public trust. We also demand that the word 'honourable' be removed when describing or addressing MPs, as this word is now inappropriate when applied to MPs.",
