            "background": "Chiropractors help thousands of people each year who've been manhandled on the NHS, told there was nothing wrong with them and that their problems were in their heads. So many complain of neck pain and back pain to their G.P's and simply have painkillers and anti-inflammatories thrown at them which only relieve the symptoms, THEY DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM CAUSING THE PAIN. Chiropractic quickly treats the problem very effectively and, post 2000 since strict guidelines were put in place to stop unqualified persons calling themselves chiropractors, is probably the safest and most effective healthcare available.",
