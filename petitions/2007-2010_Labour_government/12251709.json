        "background": "I fail to see why MPs should be entitled to any allowances which are not also available to other employees in the country.  MPs are employees of the people, nothing more, nothing less.  They do not have any special needs which are not also held by hundreds of thousands of other employees who are denied access to the taxpayer pounds heaped upon our elected representative -  simply because our elected representatives can vote on them themselves, a situation which is no longer tenable in view of the extreme amounts of sleaze being perpetrated by increasing numbers of those same elected representatives.  If these allowances are not to be extended to the general taxpaying public then the Prime Minister needs to make a statement to explain why not.",
