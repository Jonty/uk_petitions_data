            "background": "I read a headline in the Guardian stating \"IVF Hurdle For Single Women & Lesbians to be overthrown\".  The hurdle that existed for Lesbian couples was a true barrier to becoming a family, and it is only right that they are not discriminated against because of their sexual orientation, and can only mean that more children are born into stable, loving families. However, why is it that single women are allowed IVF treatment? the 'Hurdle' that single women encounter, is the same 'Hurdle' that single men encounter- as we cannot reproduce by ourselves.  But just because women are able to bare children does not give them the right to use IVF as a way to obtain a child. I am not saying that single women do not make good parents, or that single parent families are inferior to two parent families, all I am asking is that single men and single women be placed on a equal playing field. If a single woman wants a child then surely she should go through the same procedures that a single man has to go through, and apply to adopt.",
