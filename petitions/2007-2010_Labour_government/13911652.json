            "background": "People with mortgages have to wait until they have been unemployed for 16 weeks before they can get mortgage interest help. This is unfair as those renting get housing costs paid straight away. The 16 week rule prevents those of us with mortgages taking short term work due to having to wait again another 16 weeks when you sign on. Many people in social housing choose not to work as they get their rents and council taxes paid by the state.",
