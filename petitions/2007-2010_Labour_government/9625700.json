            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Steel wire crash barriers need to be replaced with traditional crash barriers to prevent accidents that prove lethal to motorcyclists. These cheap crash barriers do prevent accidents involving vehicles, except in the case of motorcycle accidents, where they have been proved to be lethal, and end up cutting the motorcyclist in half much like a cheese wire. I therefore propose that these barriers are banned, removed and replaced with crash barriers that are safer to two wheeled road users.",
