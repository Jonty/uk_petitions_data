            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "More of us today are using MP3 players to store music tracks. Recently it became allowable under law to connect these players to low power FM radio transmitters so that a car stereo can be tuned into the FM signal and the MP3s played while in the car. This increases convenience and safety, as many \"albums worth\" of songs can be stored on an MP3 player and it negates the need for the driver to change radio stations or music CD's, which can have a detrimental effect on concentration while driving. \nHowever, with the proliferation of local FM radio stations it is often necessary to change the reception frequency of the low-power transmitter on medium and long journeys, to avoid localised parts of the spectrum that are dominated by more powerful transmitters.\nTherefore, I urge the Prime Minister to consider legislation to preserve a large enough portion of the FM radio spectrum (say, 1.0Mhz) for the effective use of these low-power transmitters.",
