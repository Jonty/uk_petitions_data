            "background": "The creation of an 'Eco-Town' on the outskirts of Leicester will not only ruin a beautiful stretch of countryside, the village of Stoughton, and the wildlife and ecosystem in the area by adding 20,000 homes, but also by the added traffic of up to 40,000 cars - not to mention construction traffic throughout the building period - through small roads causing unmanageable congestion within Leicester, particularly areas such as Stoneygate and Oadby, and completely cancelling out any environmental benefits such a construction might have. This is NOT the right place to build the Eco Town.",
