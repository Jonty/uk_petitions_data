We feel strongly that we need a sense of community broadcast on a popular media, ie. TV. They report on local issues that matter to us. It is important that we keep these people in the jobs that they do so well. It is our link with local news and issues that effect our lives. Surely a strong sense of community is vital in this day & age. Please help us save these job cuts that effect so many lives across our region. With so many job cuts in other fields. Our Local news is even more vital.",
