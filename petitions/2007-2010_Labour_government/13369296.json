            "background": "In the modern society, benefits have enabled perfectly healthy people who should be in employment to stay at home and contribute nothing to British society. Students such as myself who continue education to better themselves, so as to contribute to society in the future, receive little or nothing. Student cards one of the few things that students can receive, however, at present, students have to pay for these cards in order for them to benefit from the various discounts made available to them. I call upon the Prime Minister to act for the students of Great Britain in making these cards free as a reward for the hard work and drive of this generation (and indeed the generations that will follow) of keen, motivated, intellectual students.",
