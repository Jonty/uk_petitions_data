        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Trustees of Broom Village Hall have issued The Fawns Pre-School with 1 months notice to vacate the premises and remove all equipment - no reasons for this request have been made \nThe village of Broom has had its own playgroup/pre-school running in the village hall since 1974.  Sadly over the last 5 years it has become clear that the Village Hall Trustees no longer wish the children of the village to enjoy such a wonderful facility as is provided by the Pre-School.  Not only does it provide a central place for all families to meet but is an important feeder to the Parish School based in Southill.  \nIt is felt that this act to close a much needed service to the community is a personal decision made by the Trustees of the village hall.\nHelp us fight the decision by showing your support not only to the Fawns Pre-School but also to the community use of Broom Village Hall which has been in decline over the past 20 years and bring back the community spirit for all.",
