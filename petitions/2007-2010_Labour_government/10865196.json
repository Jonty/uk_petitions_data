            "background": "In October 2008, Peter Mandelson was made Business Secretary on the Cabinet and was granted a life peer status, earning him a position in the House of Lords, despite his murky political career.\n\nHis failure to declare his \u00a3370 000 interest-free loan resulted in his first resignation, bolstered by his ridiculous comments as the newly appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in 1998. \n\nIn recent years, serving as the UK's European Commissioner, Mandelson has insisted in a system of free-trade rather than fair-trade, damaging farmers in developing countries.\n\nThis petition asks Prime Minister Gordon Brown, to do the right thing, and sack Peter Mandelson from the Cabinet.",
