        "background": "This year, Dennis Nilsen, the mass murderer, would have served his entire 25 year sentence in prison. He was imprisoned in 1983 for the murder of 6 men, and the attempted murder of 2 more, although he admitted to murdering 15 men in total.\n\nCurrently, a Life Sentence doesn't mean LIFE. It usually means approximately 25 years.\n\nThis Law needs to be changed, so that hardened criminals such as Nilsen, who are given Life in prison, get LIFE IN PRISON, ie until the day they DIE!\n\nExisting prisoners, such as Nilsen, who are on a Life Sentence, and due on remand, should be made to stay behind bars for their remaining life.\n\nTHIS LAW NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO PROTECT US! THESE PEOPLE BROKE THE WORST LAWS IMAGINABLE, THEREFORE LETTING THEM FREE AFTER 25 YEARS IS WRONG! LIFE SHOULD MEAN LIFE!",
