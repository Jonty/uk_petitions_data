            "background": "A report on the Telegraph web site (dated 27th September 2008) states that Ofcom are planning to levy charges on the RNLI and other smaller life saving groups around the country.\n\nOfcom are asking for input (search their website (ofcom dot org dot uk) using \"Applying spectrum pricing to the Maritime and Aeronautical sectors\" as search text) stating that \"...The aeronautical and maritime sectors are complex, encompassing very large international businesses, smaller businesses, individuals, and organisations with charitable aims (such as the RNLI). We need to understand the impact throughout the sectors and this will require considerable input from stakeholders. In particular, we are seeking input from spectrum users, based on the opportunity costs indicated in this document, but we will also wish to consider carefully the views of the UK bodies responsible for air and maritime regulation and industry sponsorship: the CAA, the MCA and the Department for Transport...\"\n\nI urge the government to move to block any plans to levy further cost on to an already stretched service.",
