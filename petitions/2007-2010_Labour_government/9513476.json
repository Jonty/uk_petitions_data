        "background": "By legislating the installation of solar panels in all new build properties within the UK, either domestic or commercial, the Government will be taking a solid, constructive step in reducing the UK's carbon footprint rather than just raising more taxes.\nThe benefits will be:\n-The cost of installation at the build stage will be minimized.\n-The new owners/tenants will benefit from reduced power bills.\n-Reduction in demand from all new builds from other power sources.\n-The increase in demand for Solar panels/equipment and maintenance will not only drive costs down but also create employment.\n-Reduction in costs will make the installation cheaper for existing buildings.",
