            "background": "EBay currently disallows the use of certain major online payment agencies such as Google Checkout and Amazon's payment services with the reason that \"Google's and Amazon's products and services compete with eBay on a number of levels, so we are not going to allow them on eBay\". EBay continues to force sellers to accept it's sister company, PayPal. This country should be promoting healthy business competition and should not be allowing big companies to become monopolies. This petition asks the government to look into the trading of eBay and its partners and to in turn look at the laws surrounding the fairness of eBay's trading policies and methods and consider any suitable amendments to current law.",
