            "background": "Presently anyone in the military can have difficulties when they hit civilian street as their skills do not fit anyone specifically.  It is therefore very difficult to apply those skills to any job outside the Military.  Although the MOD is helping with certain training courses etc, it is not really giving them practical experience in those fields as there is generally no time.\n\nMostly staff are working til the last 6 months specifically in their chosen field within the Military and then find it very difficult to adjust to civilian life.  This can affect all levels within the Military from engineers through weapons specialists etc.  I think although the training programs are increasing, I think its important to spend more money and time on these individuals to assist them adjust to what we call normal life.",
