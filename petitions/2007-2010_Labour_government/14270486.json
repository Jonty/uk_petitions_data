            "background": "These full body scanners use electromagnetic waves to  scan the body which produces 'naked' pictures of airline passengers. This cannot be allowed as not all passengers should be exposed in such a way. Using the scanners on children could breach the Protection of Children Act 1978 by creating an indecent picture of a child. The effectiveness of these machines does not justify the invasion on privacy. They are not effective on the more recent bomb threats that have appeared e.g.  liquids and plastic explosives.",
