        "background": "The magistrates court system is seen as biased in favour of the police for many minor offences.A public members court system , where members of the public chair the court in judgement is proposed.This for lesser criminal and public order offences.It would fast track cases and show transparency in the judicial process and bring to light issues of police abuses of power along with incomprehesible legal jargon being reduced to plain english.The proposal is to mandatory duty via the National insurance numbers of members of the general public being called upon to serve a one day seat in judgement(in any one year).Advisors on law would be present.It would allow the police to return to \"free\" and impartial policing,without the need to issue on the spot fines(acting as judge and jury on the street is not the remit of the police officer).This Proposal is for non custodial crimes and/or public order offences.It is for clear and transparent and impartial judgement by members of the public for members of the public.",
