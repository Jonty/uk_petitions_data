            "background": "The current financial crisis in the UK has been exacerbated by the lack of concerted action by the EU and the UK has been even further damaged by the nationalistic attitudes and unilateral moves of the French, German and Spanish governments (who have the balls to do this, of course!) to protect their own.  This demonstrates YET AGAIN that self nationalistic interests will ALWAYS prevail in France,Germany and Spain, regardless of the wider effect in the EU. So why are we bothering with a EU when we just know that France, Germany and Spain are going soundly, and at the same time, to shaft the UK (because our washed up government will allow it) when it comes to the crunch?",
