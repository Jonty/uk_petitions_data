            "background": "It seems that the media only focuses on negative stories.  The headlines in newspapers are always about murders or political rows - not to suggest that those stories aren't important, I just think it's time that the media should become more responsible.  let's face it, the media has such a huge influence on the general public.  The government should try to create an alliance with Media companies.  An agreement that will vastly increase the amount of positive news stories and images so that ourselves and our children can be inspired to improve their lives - instead of perhaps wanted to become the next reality TV star and earning money for bad and unacceptable behaviour.",
