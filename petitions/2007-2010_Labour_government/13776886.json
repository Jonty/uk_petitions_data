        "background": "Stop artist Alex Hartley from spending \u00a3500,000 of lottery cash to move a piece of an Artic island recently uncovered by melting ice.  This is a gross waste of money that could be used for better causes and should not be considered as art.  It is a contradiction to reducing our impact on the environment.  It is uneccessary, environmentally damaging and a vile abuse of lottery contributions.",
