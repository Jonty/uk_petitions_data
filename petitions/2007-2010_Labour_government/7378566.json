We do not accept that nothing can be done against these websites if they are hosted outside the UK; the people who run these sites or provide information are in the UK. Their details have been passed onto the authorities on several occasions but no action has been taken. These sites are about aggressive intimidation towards individuals. These sites have direct and disturbing internet links with far-right websites such as Combat 18 which has its own deeply unacceptable association with violence. Redwatch states its purpose clearly and simply: to intimidate anti-fascist, anti-racist campaigners; as the statement on the homepage says: \u2018Remember places, traitors\u2019 faces, they\u2019ll all pay for their crimes\u2019.  \n\nThese sites contain information to harm individuals both mentally and physically, why are these sites allowed to carry on existing?",
