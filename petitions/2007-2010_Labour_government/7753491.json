            "background": "As a disabled driver myself, I am finding it hard to afford the running costs of my vehicle's.\nI am forced to take a vehicle when I leave my home due to disabilities.\nBut due to rising fuel costs I am being more & more restricted with my movements.\nLast year I had a motorhome adapted for me so I could take my children away on a holiday in some degree of comfort.\nBut due to the rise in fuel tax's I cannot afford to use it. So I am still stuck as a prisoner at home. Why can we not use red diesel for example.\nAfter all it is available at  most boat yards & plant hire places etc.\nWhy should the help that we get to become mobile, then become a serous financial restriction of our mobility.\nThis is a very serous issue that needs addressing urgently.\nIf you agree with this please sign this petition",
