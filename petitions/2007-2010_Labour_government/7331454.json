As a result accounting practices were established under law that made those responsible for such fraud to take place to be better penalised & monitored more openly. With the most recent in a wave of security lapses perpetrated by the HMRC we the people require similar laws to be instituted to remove fraudulent & faulty business practices at the highest level of government \u2013 the same people who are requiring more and more of our personal details. \nWe demand full accountability of all government departments with a more independent & empowered national audit office presiding and a constitutional duty of care in all areas of governance.",
