            "background": "Exceeding the speed limit or travelling too fast for the conditions is a contributory factor in over 790 deaths and over 34,000 injuries every year (Road Casualties Great Britain 2005). If these were deaths from terrorism, it would not be tolerated and there would be an outcry yet we allow this to happen on our roads. It also creates more noise and intimidates other road users. I would ask the prime minister to make as many roads/vehicles monitored for speeding as possible and increase the number of police randomly checking for speeding.",
