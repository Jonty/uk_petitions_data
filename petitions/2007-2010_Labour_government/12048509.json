            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recession could be easily solved by giving all UK families one million pound sterling, this would boost the economy as the money would be spent in shops & saved in banks. This would mean a total investment by the government of approximately \u00a340 million pounds with the current UK population of some 67 million people. The government has already thrown several billion pounds of tax payers money into the banking system yet banks are still failing to financially boost the economy with business's going bust & repossessions at a all time high. With this proposal people would once again be able to pay their mortgages, there would be nobody on benefits as they would be over the threshold! There would be hardly any need for any social housing! The overall cost to the government would be considerably and progressively less as time went on; thus making Britain great again!!",
