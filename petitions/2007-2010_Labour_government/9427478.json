            "background": "This is a petition to ban chicken battery farms. For those of you who don't know a battery farm is when chickens are forced to lay eggs in a space no bigger than 20 feet it may seem large but there are upto 100 chickens in each one. They create artificial light to confuse the chickens into thinking it is constantly day time which makes them sick and confused and ultimiatley they stop laying eggs. Once they stop laying eggs they are killed and sent to fast food chains and other such places that sell chicken this is a petition to stop battery farming and to be able to know that the eggs that we buy are not tainted.",
