If they think this country is so bad, why don't they go and live in a fellow muslim country where they will NOT be looked after, they will not recieve child benefit, housing benefit and god knows how many other benefits this incompetent Labour government is giving them for their vote, and maybe, just maybe, if they decide to up sticks and move back to a fellow muslim country which i very much doubt,they would shock horror, probably have to get a JOB, yes WORK, instead of freeloading for a living!! Will this government do anything about this?? Yes probably... increase their benefits most likely, after all they probably do vote Labour!!",
