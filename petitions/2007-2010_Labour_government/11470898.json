            "background": "Far from being seen as a serious issue, abuse towards red haired people is seen as something of a joke in modern society. It seems that there are laws protecting people from racism and discrimination in regards their race, religion and sexuality, but others are left to endure psychological and sometimes physical abuse because of the colour of their hair, their fair skin and pigmentation. So many children and indeed adults are bullied in this way and their lives become harder to live because of it. We do not see the difference between these abuses and racial abuses.\nWe would like to stop the trauma and misery for many many people by asking that abuses and discriminations regarding red heads be made illegal. Terms such as 'ginger', 'carrot top', 'copper nob' etc should be made illegal also, and red heads be recognised as a racial sub-group, due to its supposed Celtic/Nordic roots.",
