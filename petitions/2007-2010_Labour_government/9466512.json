        "background": "This bill, which allows for the creation of animal/human embryos to a maximum of 50% animal and 50% human, even for a regulated maximum of 14 days is in itself a violation of what it means to be human.  Will the passing of this bill not allow science to pursue the growth of organs, if not organisms that are transgenic?  What assurance can be made that animal/human tissue i.e. 'eagle eyes' are not surgically implanted into fully human hosts, and if so is there not a danger of creating a super/sub human, genetically manipulated race, in which individuals could potentially seek tissue 'up-grades' to failing or less than optimally functional parts?",
