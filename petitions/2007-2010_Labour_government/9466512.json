Will the passing of this bill not allow science to pursue the growth of organs, if not organisms that are transgenic?  What assurance can be made that animal/human tissue i.e. 'eagle eyes' are not surgically implanted into fully human hosts, and if so is there not a danger of creating a super/sub human, genetically manipulated race, in which individuals could potentially seek tissue 'up-grades' to failing or less than optimally functional parts?",
