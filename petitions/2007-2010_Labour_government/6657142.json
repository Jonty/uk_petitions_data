            "background": "UK parents place a high value on the role that children's television plays in society, and believe that it is particularly important that public service broadcasting for kids reflects their own lives and cultures, and helps them learn more about the world around them. But new programming made in the UK accounts for just 1% of the total hours of kids TV on offer to UK audiences.\nThe situation is rapidly getting worse: ITV and Channel 4 have pulled out of commissioning new UK kids' shows, and Channel Five has cut back the range of programming it offers, having axed shows for older kids.\nOutside the BBC, these have traditionally been the main channels offering UK programmes for UK kids.\nThere are more kids channels than before due to the growth of cable and satellite services, but they are unable to plug the gap left by the main channels such as ITV and Channel 4. The BBC remains, but parents do not want their children to grow up in a world where they only have one perspective - the BBC's.\nWe ask the Government to act now to ensure that parents and children are able to benefit from a rich variety of UK kids' shows with different voices and views.",
