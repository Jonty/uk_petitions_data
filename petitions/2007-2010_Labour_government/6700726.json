            "background": "A large proportion of the A180 which runs from Barnetby into Grimsby (also serving the port of Immingham) suffers from cracks, ruts and potholes, some two to three inches deep.  The road has to support thousands of lorries every day.\n\nThe bulk of these potholes and cracks are between the junctions at Ulceby (Brocklesby Interchange) and Barnetby (Barnetby Interchange) although there are severe ruts in the tarmac surface on the inside lane of the M180 between Barnetby and Scunthorpe.\n\nThese cracks and potholes not only affect a driver's ability to control their vehicle but also cause damage to tyres and wheels.\n\nThe road is also extremely noisy.\n\nAll our local MPs have expressed concern and support for the resurfacing of the remainder of the road to be resurfaced in the local Newspaper.\n\nThe road is now of a very poor standard and needs resurfacing with a material suitable for the amount of traffic it is carrying, which will also minimise the noise pollution affecting both drivers and nearby residents.",
