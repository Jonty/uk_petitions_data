            "background": "The Home Office Policy on \"Change in Visa Category\" requires a child to travel back to home country to change from being a father's dependant to being a mother's dependant.\n\nAs a result many children (of families that seek to keep within the law by not allowing their visa to expire) are forced out of school as they travel thousands of kilometres to British High Commission offices abroad.\n\nOnce abroad, the British High Commission do not feel in a hurry to reduce the time these children are stranded in the home countries and to return their passports. This could take weeks and months. \n\nThe effect is that children are prevented from attending school (since they school in the UK and not home country). They are subjected to mental and psychological stress. Many of those children begin to wonder why they are being treated in that way. Its difficult to explain to children of primary or junior secondary age that they have to pass through that because \"the immigration policy\" says so.\n\nThis policy not only destabilises families, improverish hard working families, but is also a violation of the UN Charter which the United Kingdom has signed to defend the right of every child to education.\nStop this!",
