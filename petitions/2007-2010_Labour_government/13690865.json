        "action": "Create a National Youth Movement for people aged 9 to 18 and make it compulsory",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A new national youth movement should be set up allowing children to learn discipline and self respect. By making it compulsory, it should be free of charge or perhaps just 2 pounds a week. In a style which is a cross between Scouts and Cadets, the movement will be set up by the Government for the sole purpose of education in factors that schools fail teach. E.g. leadership and awareness. This will reduce the number of Yobs and possibly lower crime rate. Failure to attend will result in a fine. Meetings should run for 2 hours a week at least. The movement should be able to have people from all religions and backgrounds attending. Sessions will be taught by Instructors, CRB checked and able to participate in activities. Obviously this can be adapted and changed but this is the basis of a new youth. Youth with Respect!!",
