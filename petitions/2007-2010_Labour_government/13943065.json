            "background": "Many cars made pre 80s are now fast dissapearing , the classic car tax excemption introduced for pre 1973 cars needs to be extended in order to help preserve many fast dissapearing British and foriegn made cars. A car same model make etc made in 1974 and not 1973 has as much right to be excempt . So please extend the cut off year to correct this for many classics that are affected by this . This is one of many petitions that has been posted over a number of years and while heels are dragging many classic cars are fast dissapearing . As classic cars are used very rarely and are on limited mileage insurance (how many do you see in a week)it makes sense to preserve our history our memories and our enjoyment .",
