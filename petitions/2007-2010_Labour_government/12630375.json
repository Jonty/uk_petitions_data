            "background": "This petition is to highlight what a growing number of people are concerned about ie:  That the Speaker in the House of Commons has not only failed in his duty to the public by not regulating MPs activity but has used taxpayers money to try and keep all the revelation secret.  This, most consider, criminal and I call on Gordon Brown to eject this man forthwith with no golden handshake as he is not fit to stay in his position nor take a seat in the House of Lords, as this would devalue the House.",
