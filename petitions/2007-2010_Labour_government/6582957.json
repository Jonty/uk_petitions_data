        "background": "when is the government going to stop persecuting working class people, if you pay tax,have a nice car that is taxed/mot/insured, pay your council tax, extend your home to accomodate your family, you can be assured that the government will persecute you because you are legal and in the system, higher taxes/car tax/council tax are what you can expect to pay for trying to better yourself, in this country working classes never stop paying for every other low life/illegal immigrant/drug addict/murderer/benefit takers. I for one am fed up with it and can see why English people are getting out of England it can only get worse.",
