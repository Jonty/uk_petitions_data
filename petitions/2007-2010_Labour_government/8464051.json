        "background": "The premierleague is in discussions relating to staging a 39th premier league match outside of the uk. The top 5 teams will be seeded (nice advantage already for the big boys, so they don't have to play each other) and then the teams will be drawn out of a hat to see who and where they play. \n\nThe premierleague already makes a lot of money out of us fans. We pay 3 times or more for tickets than fans on the continent, we can't watch premierleague matches on terrestrial tv (yet you can watch it free abroad) and premierleague clubs are already treating our game like a cash cow now.\n\nSave the last reminance of a soul that English football has and vote to partitian the government on these worrying proposals..",
