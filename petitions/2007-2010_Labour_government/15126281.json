            "background": "We petition the PM and the DECC to reconsider a transition period for products to be eligible to join the MCS/FIT schemes.\nAt the moment products already having attained International standards such as IEC 61215 for PV's are now no longer eligble.\nThese standards still show that the products have undergone the strict quality and safety checks also manufactured demonstrating consistent processes.\nA transition period of 12 or 18 months using the IEC standards would allow manufacturers to catch up on accreditation whilst still maintaining standards for installed products.\nMCS installation and commissioning would then still ensure product standards plus installation safety  and conformance are maintained.\nDelays in product accreditation will only result in slower rollout of microgeneration stations and less impact on the ultimate goal of tackling climate change.",
