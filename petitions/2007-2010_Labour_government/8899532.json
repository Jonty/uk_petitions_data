            "background": "Any future levy on plastic bags must not apply to doggie poo bags, as this will run the risk of causing even greater fouling of pavements, parks and open spaces by previously considerate owners who won't be able to afford the extra cost of clearing up their pets' mess. Like spending a penny, having a poo should be free for pets.",
