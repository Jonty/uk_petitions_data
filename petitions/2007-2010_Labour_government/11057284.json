        "background": "I am currently applying for primary school places for my 3 year old and I am disgusted at how discriminatory the school system is to non religious parents and their children. In the area in which I live over 80% of the primary schools choose parents who practice religion above anyone else, meaning as a non religious parent we are likely to end up with whatever is left purely because of what we believe! This also happens to be the less reputed schools. If this was done based on skin colour it would be racism and rightly there would be outrage!\nI'm not anti-religion as such I just feel a state education place, most of the funding for which comes from the tax we pay, should be based on merit and criteria other than religion. I do, however, want my child to be given an understanding of what the different religions encompass, without indoctrination, so that when the time comes he is able to choose for himself. I would also support a rise in taxation to replace the funding that churches would no longer provide.",
