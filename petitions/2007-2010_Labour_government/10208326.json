            "action": "reconsider his Government's proposal to ban the display of tobacco in shops, and consider instead ensuring stronger enforcement of the law to prevent underage sales and illicit trade and to make it illegal for adults to buy tobacco on behalf of anyone under 18.",

            "background": "The current proposal would not meet Government objectives to prevent underage smoking and in addition would have detrimental effects such as: - it will seriously affect the livelihoods of independent retailers and force some out of business; - it will cause retailers substantial unnecessary expense to pay for shop redesigns; - it will allow unfair competitive advantage to supermarkets who can more easily absorb refits both logistically and financially; - it could cause small shops to lose customers to supermarkets where they expect to find a full range of tobacco products at lower prices (small shops need to be able to display available products and prices to compete with supermarkets); - it will cause longer serving times which will lead to lost footfall and sales of non-tobacco items with customers (including non-smokers) buying goods at bigger retail outlets; - it could result in increased health and safety risks for shopkeepers as they bend to retrieve product from under the counter; - it will increase the possibility of theft as retailers are distracted from viewing the shopfloor; - and it could facilitate, encourage and increase the trade in illegal products.",
