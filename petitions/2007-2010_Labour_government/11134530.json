        "background": "Food should be labelled to tell the truth, as people who are Gluten intolerant can react to as little as 5ppm and low levels build up as more is eaten. Only food which is naturally Gluten-Free and without contamination should be labelled as GF.  Other foods with reduced or small contaminations should be labelled as \"<Xppm\".\n\nDespite the Media belittling this problem, this is a serious issue which costs the country millions each year in NHS bills and lost work-days. The food industry in the UK has a reputation for marketing nonsense. - Lets try and have a little honesty for once!",
