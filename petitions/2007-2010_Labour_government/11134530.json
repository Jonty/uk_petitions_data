Only food which is naturally Gluten-Free and without contamination should be labelled as GF.  Other foods with reduced or small contaminations should be labelled as \"<Xppm\".\n\nDespite the Media belittling this problem, this is a serious issue which costs the country millions each year in NHS bills and lost work-days. The food industry in the UK has a reputation for marketing nonsense. - Lets try and have a little honesty for once!",
