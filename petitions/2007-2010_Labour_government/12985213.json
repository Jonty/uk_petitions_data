            "background": "The request by the US to extradite Gary McKinnon is unjust and badly thought out. Anyone that knows anything about ASD and specifically Aspergers will know that Gary would not have understood the consequences of his actions. Gary is undoubteldy an intelligent person and very literate with IT which, surprise surprise is another solid indication of Aspergers. \n\nMr Brown, step in and represent us and Gary. Perspective and common sense is everything.",
