        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Together with fellow broadcaster Russel Brand, Jonathan Ross made a series of obscene offensive telephone calls to the elderly actor Andrew Sachs.\n\nThis is the latest episode in a sorry series of unacceptable incidents involving Mr Ross.\n\nJ. Ross is a wealthy man, earning six million a year, so any financial penalty would mean little to him. \n\nI do not feel he deserves the OBE, and being stripped of it would send a clear message regarding the values and standards that the British public hold and expect.",
