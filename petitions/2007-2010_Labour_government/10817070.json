            "background": "Currently plans are in execution to make owner-occupier homes energy efficient through insulation &c.  This leaves tenants, literally, in the cold. Landlords do not pay the energy bills for the properties so have no incentive to improve them.  They should be legally compelled to improve the energy efficiency of their properties without pricing tenants out. If they refuse to do so, claim they cannot afford to without an above inflation (RPI) rent increase or attempt to increase rent by more than the rate of inflation then all properties and any other assets held by the landlord must be seized and the ownership be transferred to the local council who will then carry out the work.",
