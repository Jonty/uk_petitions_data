            "background": "The flooding across the UK is now the worst it has been for around 150 years, 100s of 1000s of people have been left homeless, many without water or electricity, and many without any means of claiming back any funds on their insurance. This country is known for supporting the rest of the world whenever disaster strikes, so why has no central fund been set up to help those at home? The EU has \u00a3607m in a disaster fund for just this type of event, and have publicly said that they want to help, but have to wait for our government to ask first. This EUROPEAN money has even been sent to the US in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, so why aren't our own government asking for the same?",
