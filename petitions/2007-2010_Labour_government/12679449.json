            "background": "For example, people choose to have children or choose to come to this country. Where a free choice is involved it is illogical that anyone should receive a Benefit. In situations where people have no choice, ie old age, genuine unemployment or disability then they should receive a generous benefit.\nAnnouncing that Child Benefit would cease for all children born 9 months from now would be a huge step in improving parenting. It would ensure that children were born for the right reasons and not for the Benefits they attract. They would be loved and cared for. It would address most of our social ills, from bullying to Baby P, from littering to knife crime our society would be transformed.",
