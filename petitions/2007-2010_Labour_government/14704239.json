            "background": "Buses and trains need to be seen as a viable and pleasant alternative to the car. This means they should be clean, safe, punctual, reliable and not overcrowded. There should also be much better provision made for weekend and holiday travel, especially to obvious tourist destinations. People without cars just cannot get to many places unless they go on a weekday, and even then they will always wonder if their transport will let them down for the return journey.",
