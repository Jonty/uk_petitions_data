            "background": "National Service, The answer to many problems. Knife and yob culture is growing in our country more and more every year, School leavers should have to do at least 3 years in the armed forces, If they choose not to go on to further education, Take them away from the culture they are use to give them training and extra education.. Take them off the street and make them become real men.. There would be less knife crime and crime in general, less unemployment and more soldiers in our undermanned forces, Less overcrowding in our prisons.. Get them while they are young and shape them before its to late and before the crime and knife crime spirals out of control in this country.\nThis will help to sort out a lot of issues this country has.",
