            "background": "For people abroad, the British Council is a gateway to opportunities in the UK. It can be compared with the BBC, a trusted source of knowledge about the world. It is essential both organisations provide fair and impartial information to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nUnlike the BBC, the British Council depends on the Foreign Office for operational support and core finance. It can easily become a tool of government policy.\n\nThe British Council is the face that the UK presents to aspiring young people all over the world.  Our interests will only be served if it demonstrates clearly the values of objectivity and impartiality for which our nation deserves to be known.\n\nTo ensure that the British Council provides a manifest example of those values, it needs effective systems of internal governance and a guarantee of its independence from central government.",
