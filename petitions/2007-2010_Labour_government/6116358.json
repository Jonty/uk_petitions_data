            "background": "This petition is to help stop companies charging adult prices for children who are under the age of 18.  Companies include everything from air line tickets to cinema tickets.  Legally children aged 15 are in full time education and can not get a job therefore why are they being charged adult prices to watch a movie or go on holiday with their family.  The cost of living is already high enough without companies forcing families to pay extra money for no reason and no change of service.\nThe government need to standardise the legal adult age across the entire country, deciding whether the legal adult age is 16, 18 or 12 as some companies seem to think.",
