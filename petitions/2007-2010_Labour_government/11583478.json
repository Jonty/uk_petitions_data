            "background": "We would like a bridge to be built on the East Lancashire road. We are asking this because of the tragic death of Katie Gallagher who died on 14th of January 2009 after she was hit whilst crossing this road. We feel the only way to make the road completly safe, is to build a bridge. We are asking this as we do not want people to feel the same pain Katie's friends and family are feeling now.",
