        "background": "The Inductrack Magnetically Levitated system uses permanent magnets for both levitation and (main) propulsion. No electrification of the track or vehicle is needed.  Thus it represents the greenest solution to rapid public transport.  Wasteful domestic short-haul flights with attendant problems of airport expansions, CO2 and noise would be eliminated.",
