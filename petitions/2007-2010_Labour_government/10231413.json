            "background": "Over 85% of the proposed Curborough Eco-town is set to be built on greenfield land, currently used for farming and home to hundreds of species of wildlife.  Much is said about the plans' use of Fradley's former airfield, but that accounts for only 15% of the land.  Lichfield's greenfield surroundings are a fundamental part of the City's character and vital to food production and agriculture in the region.  the Curborough Eco-town will destroy this.",
