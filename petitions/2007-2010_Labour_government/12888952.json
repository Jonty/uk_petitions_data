            "background": "We would like you to act to reverse & outlaw any & all laws & loopholes that allow companies to inflate the price of goods on the pretext of regional differences.  Typically they ignore the exchange rate & charge goods at the rate of $1 = \u00a31.\nUsing terms such as 'grey imports'  to keep a stranglehold on their markets they act by blocking access for UK credit card holders, stop sales on Ebay & Amazon, prosecute  distributors.\nIt is especially abhorrent when monopoly holder  Microsoft (with 88% of the market) exploits the system.  Taking Microsoft\u2019s  Windows 7 Pro upgrade as an example, on their US web site it retails for $99.99. In the UK it is \u00a399.99 - $166.05 at current rates.\nAs well as enforcing fair price parity based on the exchange rate we would also like you to put pressure on Microsoft to create a 'family pack' of user licences for home users, in the same way Apple Mac have done with their Leopard operating system. (I cite MS Office Home & Student 2007 3\u2013 User as a precedence).",
