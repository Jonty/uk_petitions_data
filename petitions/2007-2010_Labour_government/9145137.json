            "background": "The newly-designed coinage is technically unusable and must be retro-designed to include essential elements that will aid their use in the real world.\n\nCoins are not merely design artifacts - they are an every-day item that must have utility designed into them as the core goal. The new designs fail on several counts:\n\n1. there are no numerals thus making identification for non-English speakers incredibly difficult;\n2. the typeface used on the coins is far too small to be readable by anyone with eye-sight difficulties;\n3. the use of the Royal Shield leaves out the Welsh nation in its entirety;\n4. the design project idea of splitting the Royal Shield over the facias of the coins creates an all-too-rigid framework that does not permit the addition or removal of coins;\n5. the new design totally ignores the \u00a32 coin, immediately creating an unbalanced coinage set.\n\nThe coin designs must be adjusted before final roll-out to the marketplace. The designs, as they are, are unusable and fail many of the core goals of modern coinage.",
