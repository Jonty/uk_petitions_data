        "background": "Being a snake keeper all i hear about is petitions to stop people keeping snakes. The most recent is the burmese python who killed and ate a cat,recently a cat tried to kill my girlfriends rabbit,does this mean cats should be put on a dwa? If peolpe spent more money and time trying to get to know about snakes then they will quickly learn that they are not the slimey killers that people think.Millions of people across the world keep snakes and the only time you ever hear about them is when they are getting bad press from a badly written news paper article etc. Stop these people having a say in what happens to our snakes.",
