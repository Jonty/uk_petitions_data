The \u2018half size\u2019 trains result in severe overcrowding across the country with many passengers not able to get on trains, making them late for work, and people with guide dogs left stranded because the RSPCA advise animals should not travel in such conditions.\n\nWe are frustrated with the inability of anyone to sort the problem, poor communication, and a lack of respect.",
