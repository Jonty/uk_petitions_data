        "background": "Student nurses who are carrying out a degree program are currently eligible to a maximum of \u00a33,534.00 means tested bursary per year. This is to cover travel costs, cost of living, and to fund ourselves through a full time course which lasts 52 weeks of the year. \nFifty percent of our time is spent in practice which consists of 40 hours per week. For less than \u00a34000 a year, we find it impossible to support ourselves, and although there is a loan available to us, we feel that we should not be forced into debt. Whilst we are in practice we work hard and feel we deserve a proper wage to help and prevent unecceresery stress and worry. \nAlthough we do have the alternative option to take on part-time work, this is not possible during placement as we are already working 40hours a week, with assignments on top of that. \nWe ask you to consider the implications of only receiving a maximum of \u00a33,534.00 per year and assess the situation as some students find it difficult to continue their studies due to financial difficulties.",
