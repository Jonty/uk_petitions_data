        "background": "Currently, if a car clamping firm were to:\n\n1. - issue you with a fine illegally\n\n2. - put a car clamp on your car illegally\n\n3. - take your car illegally\n\nthen it would be deemed as a civil case by the police. The individual concerned would have to pay the clamping firm to:\n\n1. - avoid escalating charges that could lead to bailiffs calling\n\n2. - release the car clamp from their car\n\n3. - get their car back\n\nand then take them to court to retrieve the money.\n\nBecause the laws are civil not criminal the police are powerless to interfere.\n\nI think, if my car is parked in a perfectly acceptable place then it should be deemed as a criminal offense if anyone was to remove it - regardless of whether they have a license to or not.",
