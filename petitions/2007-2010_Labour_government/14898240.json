        "background": "A truly wonderful radio station which has 620,000 weekly listeners and costs \u00a37 million a year to run, could be closed in a meaningless sacrifice to politicians demanding BBC savings and a limit on the corporation\u2019s digital ambitions.\nThe Trust could argue that 6\u2019s audience reach doesn\u2019t justify its expense and that its core audience be served in the margins of a tightened-up Radio 2.\nThis is a petition for listeners of this iconic radio station to air their thoughts and demand that it be left on the airwaves, championing new music and cherishing the old.\nLeave 6Music alone! (and the Asian Network whilst we are here)",
