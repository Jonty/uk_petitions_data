            "background": "There are facts the British public read in their news regularly.\n\nOf losses of the 2 computer disks containing 25 million peoples details. \n\nOf lost top-secret documents containing latest intelligence on al-Qaeda.\n\nOf further documents covering fighting global terrorist funding, drugs trafficking and money laundering.\n\nThese are the newsworthy major CURRENT stories, there are no-doubt many more cases that we do not hear about. That these lapses in our security are allowed to happen is inconceivable to us whose liberties are curtailed, who are watched regularly by cctv or who hear that the powers gained under the cloak of \"terror\" are abused by councils to spy on us and police to control us often without terrorism even being reasonably suspected.\n\nWe want tighter procedural security at the civil service, as well as other government bodies. They should be in no doubt as to the procedures.\n\nWe ask for criminal charges against those who have breached those procedures, to combat the clear and present danger to our security, wealth and liberty that these breaches cause.\n\nIf our security REALLY matters, then please Prime Minister address this issue.",
