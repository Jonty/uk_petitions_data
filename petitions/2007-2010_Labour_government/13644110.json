            "background": "We demand that the first chartered deportation flight to southern Iraq, expected to leave on Wednesday, is suspended and the detainees threatened with forcible removal are released immediately. Deporting people to a war zone like Iraq would put the lives of many deportees at risk. Violence and bloodshed continue throughout the country, which saw 1,891 civilian deaths in the first six months of this year alone. The British government, through its participation in the war on and occupation of Iraq since 2003, is responsible for these crises and the consequent displacement of millions of Iraqis. Iraqi refugees have been forcibly removed to Iraqi Kurdistan (northern Iraq) since November 2005. Mass removal flights to Kurdistan have been removing 50-60 people almost once a month since June 2008, with the Home Office arguing that, unlike the rest of the country, the Kurdistan area is 'safe'.  Despite these claims of safety, however, many have died or disappeared following their forcible return.  Many others have been forced into hiding.",
