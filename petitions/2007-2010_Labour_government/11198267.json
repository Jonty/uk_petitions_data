            "background": "Severn Bridge Crossings PLC will not be reducing the bridge price following the V.A.T. reduction. They are increasing their current toll to ensure the prices remain the same and therefore gaining income at the expense of motorists. \nThere should be an inquiry into the bridge tolls with a suspension of any further toll. The Severn Bridges act of 1992 should be reworked.  It is estimated that Severn Bridge Crossing PLC will gain 4.1 million GBP by the V.A.T. cuts: not helping banking or the public (source:\nhttp://www.freepressseries.co.uk/search/3936163.Severn_Bridge_may_not_pass_VAT_cut_to_drivers/\n\nThe lack of a price reduction and further planned rises is a blow to people and industry either side of the river.",
