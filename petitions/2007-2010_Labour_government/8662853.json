            "action": "introduce legislation which bans all retailers from producing and supplying non-biodegradable carrier bags.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I believe that carrier bags should be banned. They are unnecessarily harmful to the environment. If retailers did not make these available, people would have no choice but to purchase 'bags for life', or re-use their carrier bags. The aim is to gradually phase carrier bags out. How hard would it be for retailers to supply strong bags with handles made from recycled paper? If Britain could start this, the rest of the world will hopefully follow suit.",
