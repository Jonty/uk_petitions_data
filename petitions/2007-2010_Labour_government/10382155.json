            "background": "Midgley post office is due to close in August as part of the post office campaign.\nMidgley, Nr halifax should not close because:-\n1. it is a rural post office, with no access to other post offices within easy each. The nearest one is a 40 minute bus ride.\n2. It costs the post office NOTHING to run. The overheads are paid for by Midgley community shop and community room\n3. it is used by over 50 people a week.\n4. It is  held up as an example nationwide on how a community can work together to maintain services in  a rural village.\n5. The post master has won a major award for servicesto the community.\n6. It provides a lifeline to many disabled, elderley and young parents in a remote hillside village\nPlease support our village . We are only a small village and are reallly trying hard to keep a  post office, shop and community room going. We have the enthusiasm, support and have proved we can do it!",
