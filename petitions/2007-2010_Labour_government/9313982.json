            "action": "request the Secretary of State For Justice to ensure the practice of plea bargaining is removed from the Justice system.  Under current system a Prison Officer charged with Section 4 Harassment Putting a Person in Fear of Violence has had his plea reduced to a Section 2 offence, ommitting the word violence in order to ensure he does not lose his job as a Prison Officer.  If an offence of Domestic Violence was in place this would ensure any persons found guilty of an offence within the Domestic Setting would not be able to continue working in a Prison.  I think it is in the Public Interest to know that plea bargaining does go on behind the closed doors of the Court system despite The Criminal Justice System telling the Public that the Victim Lies At The Heart of The Criminal Justice Service.  It would be interesting to see how many people respond to this Petition in light of a recent decision where a serving Prison Officer has had his charge reduced in order to safeguard his job.",

Where a Crown Prosecutor chooses to agree a plea bargain to an offence of Harassment S2 under current Prison Service Policies and Procedures this does not result in dismissal of an Officer.",
