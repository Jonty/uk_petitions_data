            "background": "Is the government not ashamed and embarassed to be increasing tax on motorist's fuel at a time (today 01/04/09) when the economy is stagnant because the population is unwilling to spend due to the fact that it is being taxed too heavily and punished for other people's errors...\nThe PM should consider decreasing tax immediately by 5 pence a litre to give us all some monetary relief and more spending power.\nThe revenue shortfall could be recovered by cutting minister's salaries and expense allowances, by removing salaries over 50 thousand pounds per annum for city\\town councilors and eliminating 'parking attendants' salaries and positions.\nAnother method to raise revenue would be to introduce a road tax for foreign motorists visting the UK - similar to the Swiss model.\nRegards,\nMr Del Core",
