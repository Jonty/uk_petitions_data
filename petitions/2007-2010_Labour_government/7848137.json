            "background": "I have a student loan started in 1999 that I have to pay off a fair percentage of my earnings each month until its paid off or im 65. Later loans are cancelled after 25 years. If i hit 65 i will have paid 47 years of student loan payments. Its simply not fair, especially with the rate now at 4.8%. How can the government expect to get people into uni. Im nearly 5 years out and still have a \u00a317000 loan that ill be paying until i retire.",
