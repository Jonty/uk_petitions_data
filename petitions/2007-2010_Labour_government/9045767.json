The section between Junctions 6A and 10 is approximately 10 miles (17 km) long, stretching from the M25 through to Luton, and carries an average of 160,000 vehicles per day with long delays experienced at peak times.\"\nTherefore if the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane (Car-Share) was not included once the widening scheme is completed it would be a missed opportunity.",
