            "background": "Since the amalgamation of these two services into one unit there has been a serious decline in the provision and access to vulnerable patients who require emergency admission to the Accident & Emergency department by ambulance.  On the 12.05.08 I personally witnessed the medical team on duty make the 'call' that they could not accept any more admissions to the accident department for safety reasons until 'management' sorted out a solution.  Ambulance Crews were left haggling at the entrance with extremely sick and vulnerable patients, not knowing what to do with them.  This situation persisted for one hour until it was overriden and then the situation became even worse.  One patient even ended up in the toilet for a short time while shuffling was going on!  Paramedics and local papers have been reporting this deteriorating situation for some time now.  These two units must be separated as there isn't the physical space to meet the demand.  There are Health & Safety Issues and dignity of patients is never considered at all.",
