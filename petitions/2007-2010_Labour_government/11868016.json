            "background": "Please sign this petition to stop Newcastle City Council as (reported in the Newcastle Evening Chronicle)\nFrom buying up land and properties in Newcastle and surrounding area.\nIf they have surplus money it should be spent on road improvement or traffic calming measures.\nIf this money is coming out of Council tax then it is a disgrace and should not be used for gambling in the property market.\nGive it back to the tax payers who are struggling to pay their mortgages and reduce the tax in future.\nIt is just like the Banks gambling with our money on the Stock Market and look where that got us.",
