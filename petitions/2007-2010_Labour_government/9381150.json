            "background": "The proposed increase in car tax for vehicles over 7 years old. This is yet another tax on the less well of and is totally unfair The environment is a real issue to many people but the government just see it as another excuse to levy a raft of unfair taxes.If government keeps on with unfair taxes imposed under the environmental banner then they will lose the support of the very people they need to win the battle of the environment.I dont mind being taxed a bit extra on car use but revenue earned by carbon taxes should be used to buy solar panels and small wind turbines for domestic use to lower everyday peoples carbon footprint.And not up companys like Northern Rock and other banks",
