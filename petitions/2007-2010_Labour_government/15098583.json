        "background": "There seem to be a plethora of cases of fires caused by cigarettes or other smoking materials; I wonder how many injuries, or even deaths, of smokers, or especially innocent non-smokers, have resulted from these fires!  Cigarette manufacturers have known for decades how to make their product fire-safe but, for reasons of their own, have never done it.  It is surely long past time for them to do so; they should be forced, by law, to do this immediately!",
