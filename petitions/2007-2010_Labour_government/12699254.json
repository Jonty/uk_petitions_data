        "background": "Honour Heather Brooke not only for her tireless dedication in bringing the scandal and corruption rife in the Houses of Parliament to public notice (even after having been forced to take the matter to the High Court), but also for her efforts in many other diverse areas including (but not limited to):\n\n - Police Surveillance\n\n - ID Cards\n\n - Transport for London (bendy bus accidents)\n\n - The Iraq War\n\n - The All Party Parliamentary Beer Group (how I wish I was joking)\n\nMs Brooke has gone far beyond simple journalism and has proven that  transparency is an essential component of government; this information age is rendered meaningless without freedom of information.  Ms Brooke has been a worthy champion for such freedom while our elected leaders have let us down.\n\n\n\nNote: the normal, secretive, nominations process is run by many of the people Ms Brooke so frequently exposes hence the need for a public petition.",
