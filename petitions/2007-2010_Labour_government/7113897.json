For this reason, I do not call for an outright ban, in accordance, but an immediate halt on all media advertising of alcohol to the public.\n\nFor the people who are trying to heed the recent herald by the press as to the inherent dangers of home drinking, to have an alcohol advert, with all it's associated 'cool' stereotypes, stuffed in your face regularly during the most popular programming. Quite frankly, I feel that it is a complete disgrace that our government is accepting, and thereby condoning,such harmful propoganda.",
