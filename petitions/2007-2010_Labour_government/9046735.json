            "background": "I suspect like most who've parked in supermarket and council run carparks, my vehicle has suffered damage on several occasions as a result of the careless actions of others in opening their car doors and allowing them to come into contact with my own vehicle.  Unless rectified, such damage can reduce the value of your vehicle. I have also on occasions struggled to get out of my vehicle because of the paltry width of the space.  It is about time that those providing parking spaces (especially where these are paid for) realise that they owe a duty of care to the users of their facilities and that what is currently provided is, in many cases, not fit for purpose!",
