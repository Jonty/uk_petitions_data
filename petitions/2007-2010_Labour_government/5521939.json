In return, the company pays the nomad what is often a six-figure fee. In the exchange's history, just a handful of AIM companies and nomads have been publicly fined by the stock exchange for wrongdoing, and just 3 percent of the companies listed on AIM have gone bankrupt.\n \nIn the exchange's history, just a handful of AIM companies and nomads have been publicly fined by the stock exchange for wrongdoing, and just 3 percent of the companies listed on AIM have gone bankrupt.
