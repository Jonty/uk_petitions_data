In return, the company pays the nomad what is often a six-figure fee. In the exchange's history, just a handful of AIM companies and nomads have been publicly fined by the stock exchange for wrongdoing, and just 3 percent of the companies listed on AIM have gone bankrupt.\n \nIn the exchange's history, just a handful of AIM companies and nomads have been publicly fined by the stock exchange for wrongdoing, and just 3 percent of the companies listed on AIM have gone bankrupt. This petition will give make it easier for either the FSA or police to deal with rogue companies who put spin and gloss in reports and press releases to cover and manipulate facts whilst tricking innocent investors into buying stock.",
