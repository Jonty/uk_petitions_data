            "background": "The resignation of Sir Ian Blair highlights the degree to which politics is becoming an everyday aspects of UK policing. \n\nThe tripartite of local councillors, magistrates and independent members of police authorities had been successful. They have the power to remove chief officers who have found to be ill prepared or neglectful in their duties.\n\nPolitical control/infleunce of policing is a frightening aspect. History has many examples of how, in the past, watch committee's often exerted polictical control/influence of their police force(s). But that was in a local arena.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has national responsibilities as well as London issues to deal with. The manner of the resignation of Sir Ian Blair has set a dangerous precedent for the people of this country. A precedent that could have frightening consequences for this and future generations of Our people. \n\nThis issue affects everyone no matter what their political persuasion is.",
