As i write this, local fuel stations are selling it at \u00a31.02 per litre. 4 weeks ago it was \u00a30.98 per litre. a rise of 4p per litre in less than month. At this rate, it will be \u00a31.10 per litre by christmas! This much be stopped now! I propose that the price of fuel should be dropped, and frozen, at a maximum of \u00a30.90 per litre.",
