This view fails to take account of two things:\n\n \n1. SBS is a secular organisation, helping women from a wide variety of religious, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, by empowering them to access what are universal human rights.\n\n2. SBS possesses the specialist knowledge and experience to reach and help this broad range of women, who, due to their social, economic and cultural backgrounds, can be among the most marginalised and voiceless women in British society.",
