        "background": "I, the creator of this petition believe it would make adults with Special Needs and Vulnerable adults have a safer life and safer community out there for their own safety. Having a personal alarm would be a good idea because say if there is someone coming up to that person who has got Special Needs or who is Vulnerable threatening them or bullying them, all the have to do is press the button to send out the alarm and then someone nearby, people in their house or police would be at the problem in a second to help that person.",
