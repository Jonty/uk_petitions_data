            "background": "We demand that the Labour Government, immediately drop their outrageous plans to take control of all hospital charity donations, to come under the umbrella of total Treasury Budget, as of April 2010, and that these donations stay as they always have been, fully independent of Government and outside influence / control.\n\nHospital donations are given in good faith by the public for specific causes close to their heart. We want the money to go direct to the causes and used for the good of our communities and services. The Government has no right whatsoever to control these funds.\n\nIf Government control the funds and outrageously use them as part of their Treasury budget, then people won\u2019t give, and our hospitals will suffer!",
