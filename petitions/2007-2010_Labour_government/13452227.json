This includes swans and ducks.  These people do not have licences,do not use the proper fishing tackle and equipment and are destroying our wildlife in large numbers.  There needs to be tougher legislation in place to stop this activity, not just signs, deportation or arrest.  Please support and put an end to this barbaric activity taking place.",
