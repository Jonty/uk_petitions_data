            "background": "The idea is for a government scheme, or a collective scheme through the banks (thou, unlikely), to offer a 25 year fixed mortgage at 3.5%. The scheme would be only 1 mortgage per person/ couple and would run for a limited period (say 12/24 months then would be under review). You would have to be a \"prime\" applicant with a 20% deposit to be eligible. Yes, 10 years from now interest rates could be at 8% and hence a loss would be made, but in the same breath, we have seen time-and-time again just how crucial the housing market is to the fortunes of the ecomony and how it effects us all (taxpayers). Although, such a scheme is highly ulikely in this country I could see america opting for something similar.",
