            "background": "VED is an arbitrary and unfair means of taxing any and all vehicles as it does not take account of vehicle usage.  By adding a reasonable amount to the price of a litre of fuel, drivers will be charged on a more equitable basis for the vehicle they choose to drive and the mileage that they travel.  Small engine + big mileage can be much more polluting than big engine + small mileage.",
