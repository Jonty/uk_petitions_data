I don\u2019t have the answers because i am not the government but, instead i want to eradicate the bonus system, review who is getting EMA and if they require the sum they are receiving, and in general make it a system so that people who miss out on EMA currently arent missed out completley. Or, alternatively, a new system introduced which caters for ALL students by either giving the money to the college/school or allowing every student the same allowance as each other regardless of social status or family earnings! If the government want to promote equality they should lead by example!",
