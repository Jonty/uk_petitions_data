            "background": "Low income families cannot pick & choose their schools, because they are largely driven by where they can afford to live.\n\nHigher income families are often squeezed out into private education by overcrowding towns & therefore schools.\n\nA much better system would be to open up schools to becoming competitively competent by making all schools compete for their own income as fees.\n\nLow income families who cannot afford schooling can be helped with benefits.\n\nThe government continually devise more tricks, such as abolishing sibling priority, to squeeze well off families into using private education. This is unfair & underhand.",
