However, it is widely speculated that these figures could be much higher as many men do not feel they are able to get help for their eating disorder. We believe that part of the reason for this is due to the lack of awareness of eating disorders in men from doctors / other health practitioner's. Numerous male sufferers have reported getting a diagnosis for their eating disorder a struggle and their symptoms dismissed probably because eating disorders are commonly seen as female problems. By signing our petition, you will be helping many thousands of men get the right support and treatment they need in order to work towards recovery.",
