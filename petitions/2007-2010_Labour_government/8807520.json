            "background": "The village of Terrington in North Yorkshire is to lose its Post Office in favour of a tri-weekly mobile service.  There are many residents who are elderly and/or disabled who will be put at a severe disadvantage by this new system, as public transport to similar facilities in neighbouring villages is non existant.  We, the undersigned,  would like the Prime Minister and his colleagues to apply pressure to the management of the Post Office to consider some of the more drastic consequences of their closure scheme on isolated rural communities and to reconsider their plans accordingly.",
