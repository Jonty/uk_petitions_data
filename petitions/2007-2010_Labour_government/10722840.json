            "background": "Many thousands of people who have residence status in the UK, eg. Non-EU born wives of UK spouses, need a visa to visit an EU country. If you live outside the UK in an EU country and have residence status for that country, you will benefit from an agreement called the Schengen agreement. This allows visa-free visits to countries within the agreement. Most of the EEC countries are signatories. The UK is one glaring exception. Applying for a visa is not easy. Usually it means making an appointment with the appropriate embassy in London, then turning up with a swathe of paperwork, just to get a rubber stamp on a passport. The government's attitude is that our borders must be secure, but I fail to see how restricting a wife's ability to travel out of the country with her husband in any way enhances our security. \n\nIt is a basic human right to be able to travel without unnecessary restriction. The EU recognised this by introducing a very sensible agreement. It is about time the UK followed suit.",
