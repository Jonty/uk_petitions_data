            "background": "Alistair Darling stated in his first Budget in March 2008, that he will delay the increase of 2p a litre for both petrol and diesel to Oct 1st. \nSince this was mentioned, the cost of petrol has risen sharply. We do not want any more increases in our fuel. \n\nThe govt should do more to keep the cost of fuel to under \u00a31 a litre. \n\nThe govt can recover the loss from the richer people in society as they are taxed less in ratio terms than the low paid. Or raise the cost of a packet of cigarettes by an extra \u00a31 per 20.",
