            "background": "The present structure means that travellers to the Caribbean or Kenya will pay more tax than those going to any part of the United States, including Hawaii, which is nearly twice as far from London. \nWe believe this will put off travellers from visiting developing economies that rely on tourism for their livelihoods. \nWe urge the Prime Minister and Chancellor to change the system in the next finance bill so that poor countries are not unfairly penalised.\nWe also call for the removal of other anomalies that unfairly tax premium economy passengers and force passengers from the UK regions transiting through Heathrow to pay twice.",
