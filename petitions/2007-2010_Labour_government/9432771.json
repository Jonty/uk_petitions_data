            "background": "The Starband system is a helmet tailor made to the shape of the childs head,this helps the skull to assume a natural shape avoiding a traumatic and costly surgery later on in the childs life, cost of the helmet is in the region of \u00a32000 pounds which would be a lot cheaper than major surgery. For the best results from the helmet it is recommended that it is fitted from four (4) months old and before eighteen (18)months and will remove the need for the child to suffer the trauma of surgery, thank you for your support C I MCPHERSON",
