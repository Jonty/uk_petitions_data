        "background": "I have recently moved home and my new property has a water meter installed because it was used for rental before we purchaed this. Yorkshire water have said we are not allowed to have this meeter removed and because of this the cost of water to my home has now doubled in comparisson to what i paid at my previous address which is less than 100 meters away. I find it disgusting that a home of the same size less that 50 yards away with a larger family than mine is able to pay approximatly \u00a3300.00 per year for any water used and I receive a bill for \u00a3112.50 for using 35 cubic meters of water for just over 2 months. This will result in me paying more than \u00a3600 for 12 months water supply. This is more than my gas and electric combined!",
