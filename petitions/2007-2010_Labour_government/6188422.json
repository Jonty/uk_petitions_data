            "background": "we believe that the system of criminal justice in this country is more about vengeance than justice, which does nothing to help the victim(s) of crime.\n\nPrison does not reform inmates but simply furthers retrograde behaviour, including creating drug addicts. It is cruel and it is also a criminal waste of tax-payers money.\n\n\nThe focus of criminal justice should be about forcing the perpetrator to make reparations to his or her victims. The victim should be the main party in deciding a suitable sentence.",
