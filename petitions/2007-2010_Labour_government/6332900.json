            "background": "Panthers, Pinzgauers and Rover jeeps are all weakly-armoured vehicles, indeed, they are mobile coffins. As vehicles that are easy to destroy, they are useless. V-shaped vehicles, like armoured trucks are not only better armoured and better constructed (they deflect the explosives diagonally), but are also able to access locations that Panthers, Pinzgauers and Rover jeeps cannot. Never mind that v-shaped vehicles can ALSO act as Command&Liaison vehicles. Dozens of soldiers have already died because they drive pseudomilitary vehicles like Rover jeeps. Please buy 401 armoured tracks to replace 401 useless Panthers.",
