Some time ago, however, I started making comments on individual petitions, as well as/instead of signing my name; recently I have occasionally received messages to the effect that my \"name\" is too long but when I try to shorten it I experience a VERY GREAT DEAL of difficulty due to the very short space provided and, ESPECIALLY, to the fact that it is almost (if not QUITE) impossible to get to the part of the \"signature\" one wishes to change to bring it down to the requisite number of characters.  I realise this probably seems a very trivial matter but I find it extremely exasperating!  If it is not possible to approve this petition could I ask for it to be \"noted and treated as feedback\"; as a previous petition (right to reply) was?",
