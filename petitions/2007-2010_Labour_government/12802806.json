        "background": "The BBC could be made to share part of the television licence fee with commercial rivals under government plans to be announced later.\n\nThis is stupid, would you share your money with rival companies.. I don't think so.\n\nWhy should we fund other channels that don't offer quality programs and raise more than enough money through advertisements.\n\nIf they can't fund themselves then they should fold and not expect us to bail them out.",
