        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For the last four years Weston Favell School has suffered a series of disruptions:\n\n\u2022 we have changed from a 3 tier to a 2 tier system, \n\u2022 we have been on a split site because of this, the GCSE students have been on a construction and destruction site, \n\u2022 we\u2019ve had additional disruption from moving site and the teething problems, \n\u2022 we had a period without a permanent head and the new head has not been given enough time to show the result of the hard work we\u2019ve all put in. \n\nTherefore we oppose Academy Status at this time because:\n\u2022 it will bring more disruption\n\u2022 it will cause some staff to leave because of ULT\u2019s employment record\n\u2022 it is the Privatisation of education and means that the academy will not be accountable to parents, staff, students or elected bodies.\n\u2022 Some Academies have corporate partnerships which result in school departments advertising private corporations\n\nIf the proposed sponsor gets the contract they\u2019ll achieve a monopoly on Northants Secondaries, reducing parental choice.",
