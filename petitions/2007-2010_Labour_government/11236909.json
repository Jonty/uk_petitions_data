            "background": "I feel that the alcohol aisles in supermarkets should be hidden away. Non-drinkers and recovering alcoholics find these ailses are a real problem when we go shopping, in my local store there are 4 of them and in the summer the seasonal aisle also becomes full of it also. Alcohol is a awful drug and causes to many problems in our communities, costs the nhs a lot of money and ruins lives. Also if the goverment can force or pass a ruling to hide cigarrettes under the counter in shops and supermarkets why not alcohol.",
