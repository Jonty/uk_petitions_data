            "background": "I write to you, to try to appeal to your sense of Justice and your inner humanity.\nI would like to inform you of the planned execution of four Tibetans who could be executed within a matter of weeks. They and others also condemned to execution have done no wrong. Is it justice to execute someone simply for resisting the occupation of their country and the impact on their, culture, religion and language? The Chinese Government claims they set fire to buildings causing the death of people. The Tibetan protests of last year were largely peaceful and any charges against these peole are unproven and have not been heard in an open judicial process. Free Tibet and other human rights groups have pointed to the absence of legal representation for Tibetans since March last year. Please I beg you to make a statement to the Chinese government requesting they revise this decision as there is no evidence that Lobsang Gyalten, Loyak, Tenzin Phuntsog, and Gangtsu are guilty of any crime.",
