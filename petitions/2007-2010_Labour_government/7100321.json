            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Our current legal system claims to treat alleged sex offenders as innocent until proved guilty, but still convicts innocent people as it treats an accuser's word as 'proof' of the crime being committed - if a jury believe the word of the accuser, the innocent defendant is convicted.  The system then refuses to allow an appeal against that conviction unless 'new evidence or argument' becomes available.  An accuser falsely claiming to be the victim of a sex crime is often considered enough 'evidence' to convict, but someone else (or maybe even the accuser at a later date) saying it didn't happen, or proving that the accuser's account is manifestly wrong, is often not considered enough evidence to quash the conviction.  This is clearly unjust. While we should certainly have an aversion to the guilty going free, we should have an even stronger aversion to the innocent being wrongly convicted of a sex offence with little prospect of a successful appeal.",
