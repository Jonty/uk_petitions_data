        "background": "We urge the government to bring in legislation so that banks have to help and be more understanding towards the smaller businesses in this country. Loans, mortgages and overdrafts should not be called in so easily by the banks and they should demonstrate fair and more reasonable tactics when dealing with our country's smaller businesses. Remember, smaller businesses provide jobs and much-needed services to the UK.",
