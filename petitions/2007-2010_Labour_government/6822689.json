            "background": "Looking everywhere I was horrified to see that most gym equipment available for purchase only goes up to a certain weight that it can hold. Most overweight people either will not go to the gym through fear or do not have the time. I would like to see gym equipment that can hold obese people to be available for hire so they can get the help they need. Dieting is all well and good but goes no where without the exercise. If equipment was available to hire, that would actually hold the person, I am sure more would exercise. Doctors can prescribe Active lifestyle, but this involves going to the gym, they should be able to hire out equipment too.",
