        "action": "Hold an enquiry into why no psychiatrist has, of yet, been charged with professional malpractice for misdiagnosis; and to force psychiatrists to pay compensation to the misdiagnosed analogus to that paid when 'any other medical complaint' is misdiagnosed.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sometimes a doctor can misdiagnose, for example, a wart as cancer, and cause needless worry and stress to the individual and their family, or worse still, putting them on unnescicary medications that could harm or even kill them. For this reason, they usually have to cover themselves from lawsuits by patients who've had years of their lives ruined by misdiagnosis.\n\nConsidering the lifelong stigma associated with mental illness, and the adverse effects of medications if taken in the long term, misdiagnosis of mental illness is probably the worst kind. So it's a wonder they pay the least malpractice insurance, until you learn NO Psychiatrist has of yet been charged with professional malpractice for misdiagnosis. \n\nDespite the open nature of diagnosis, and the mass disagreements between colegues as to which diagnosis a particular set of symptoms equates to, both of which make misdiagnosis easy, we're led to believe NO ONE has EVER been diagnosed wrongly with mental illness. Why is this?",
