        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Legislate to stop loan brokers being able to charge for upfront fees, to arrange a loan until the client is happy with the loan that has been arranged. There are loan brokers who charge upfront fees and they are not delivering the service.  I have been stung three times, with the result of having been ripped off \u00a3160, for a loan that hasn't come through. It is very easy to see who these companies are through looking at the money supermarket forums, with the most vulnerable people, often who are driven away from the high street banks, because the banks can't make much money out the disabled, or the unemployed. If banks would allow the disabled to borrow up to a certain amount & let the disabled & the unemployed, pay over a longer period of time then it would stop the door street lenders & these other financial cowboys, ripping off the very people who have been paying for the banks Global Financial Market Mistakes. For example there are a lot of people who have lost their job through the credit crunch which has been fueled by the banks greed. So the high street banks should try to help people instead of turning their backs away the most vulnerable in our society.",
