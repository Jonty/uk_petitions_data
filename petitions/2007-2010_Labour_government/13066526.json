            "background": "The government has just permitted the rendition of a British Citizen to the notorious justice system of the USA. He faces a custodial sentence of up to 60 years in a high security penitentiary\nfor an alleged crime committed in the UK. His punishment in the UK, if found guilty, should be for a minor, non-violent misdemeanor. British \ncitizens have also been abused through\nthis government's 'outsourcing' their torture and collaborating with foreign agencies carrying out the torture of\nBritish citizens. I feel that an apology is due.\nPromises of 'lessons learned' and 'improvements will be made' are not required as these would only be met with the same disbelief as all of the\nprevious promises made by the government regarding protection of human rights.",
