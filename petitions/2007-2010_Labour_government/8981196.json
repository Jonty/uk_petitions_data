            "background": "On the face of it real time reports look like a great idea, however, if one looks at the implications of this initiative one can see that would be a disaster for students, teachers and parents.\nFirst and foremost is child safety. Placing sensitive child data on the internet will necessarily make it less secure, and therefore potentially open to abuse.\nSecondly, the information will have to be gathered and input onto a computer system, no small task. This will add work to teachers who are already overloaded with other government initiatives, it is important to note that for every minute a teacher spends on this they are not teaching.\nThirdly, this information itself will not be very useful to any parent reading it as the data will be of a technical nature (if the data is not technical then someone will have to translate the raw technical data in to a more readable form creating more work) this will only lead to misunderstandings and confusion between teacher, pupil and parent.",
