            "background": "This IS against the law in Britain but I believe it still goes on; perpetrators should therefore be subjected to the most rigorous punishments.  F.G.M. involves such things as cutting off the clitoris (the most sensitive part of female genitalia) often without anaesthetic (this is also known as female circumcision), sewing up the vulva leaving only a small hole for urination and menstruation (also often without anaesthetic; this is cut open by the husband on the wedding night and if he has to go away he sews her up again.), etc.  \n\nThe \"rationale\" for these practices is to ensure sexual fidelity which could, I suppose, be seen as a laudable aim but why use such barbaric methods?  In my opinion it's all of a piece with the ethos that condones so-called \"honour\" killings; both practices should be utterly condemned and fully punished.",
