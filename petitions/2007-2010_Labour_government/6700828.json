            "background": "The \u201cFull Justice for Kelly\u201d campaign seeks a change in the law to stop prison sentences and driving bans on drunk drivers being served consecutively.\n\nKelly Woodward was killed when a drunk driver lost control of his car and crashed it killing her and injuring her friends.  \n\nSadly, such drunk drivers can often serve their prison sentences and driving bans at the same time \u2013 often meaning that once they are released, they can walk out of prison and straight into the seat of a car and drive away.\n\nThe \u201cFull Justice for Kelly\u201d campaign aims to change the law so that when a magistrate or judge jails someone and imposes a driving ban, that ban starts on the day they walk free and not a day sooner.\n\nThe man responsible for killing Kelly Woodward was sentenced to four and a half years in prison and given a driving ban of five years.  It could effectively mean that just six months after being released, he could be back in the driving seat. \n\nOur campaign will fight to have all driving bans served in full AFTER the drunk driver is released from prison.",
