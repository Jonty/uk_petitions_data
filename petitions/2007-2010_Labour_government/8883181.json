Now reintegrated into the international community, Libya is currently one of 15 member states serving on the United Nations Security Council.\n\nAlthough UK\u2013Libya diplomatic relations are fully re-established after a 20-year break, economic relations with Libya have not yet improved to the same extent as that of our main exporting competitors (eg France). A State Visit by Muammar al-Gaddafi can be expected to redress this imbalance.\n\nHaving made protocol arrangements for inward State Visits in the 1970s, the Petition Creator (commissioned by the Queen on 5 August 1983 as an Officer of HM Diplomatic Service) would be pleased to assist the FCO in ensuring the success of a Libya State Visit.",
