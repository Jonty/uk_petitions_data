            "background": "Parents need reliable information based on evidence, not commercial pressure from baby milk companies. \n\nArtificial baby milk makes children more prone to infection, asthma, meningitis, obesity and diabetes. An increase of just 10% in breastfeeding rates in England would save the NHS more than \u00a35 million each year on the treatment of major infant diseases. The problem is that leading UK baby milk manufacturers spent \u00a37.6 million on marketing campaigns in the UK in 2006/07. That's more than ten times the ever-declining amount the UK government spent on promoting breastfeeding in the same year. It's time for change. \n\nThirty years ago this month, the international boycott of Nestle began. Yet almost 1.4 million children still die every year because they are not getting enough of their mother's milk. The aggressive marketing of baby milk is a major part of this problem.",
