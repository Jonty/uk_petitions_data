            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It has recently come to light that Sheffield City Council has wrongly fined some 25,000 motorists through an improperly arranged bus lane camera trap at the Wicker. Despite overwhelming evidence to the countrary - including rulings from the Traffic Penalty Tribunal - the council denies any fault and refuses to refund the fines which it has been taking on spurious grounds since January 2008. Authority for Local Councils to enforce bus lane restrictions comes from the Secretary of State for Transport. We therefore petition the Government to revoke this authority from Sheffield City Council until such a time as it can demonstrate an ability to exercise that authority fairly and responsibly.",
