            "background": "The UK Chapter of the International Academy of Financial Management (IAFM)finds the evidence too compelling - when government props up failed businesses it ensures a future of institutionalised incompetence, where the un-fit can count on the bail-outs from the consumer. This relationship turns the democratic nature of capitalism on its head. Businesses manage the country's resources to support consumers, not the other way around. We reject the concept of Feudal Capitalism, socialism for the un-fit and Darwinianism for the victims. Pay the stimulus to the unemployed & let them decide what businesses should survive and thrive.",
