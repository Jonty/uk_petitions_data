            "background": "Speeding - The debate into speeding on motorways is ongoing, and we the UK population would like to offer the following opinion. \n\nIf \"common sense\" doesn't prevail soon the roads are going to become less safe as people will be paranoid about looking at their speedometer, instead of observing what is going on around them. Defensive driving will be a thing of the past. \n\nUnmarked patrol cars should only be used for recording non-speeding offences on motorways - for example dangerous driving. \n\nCars have become much safer since the introduction of the 70 mph motorway speed limit, and most accidents are related to \"undue care and attention\" - not speeding. The largest single contributor to motorway deaths is the driver falling asleep at the wheel. Consideration needs to be given to the road conditions, the vehicle being driven, and the competence of the driver. \nStatistics show that motorways are the safest roads, so why does speeding on motorways attract by far the largest fines?\n\nFor reference see these BBC news pages.\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1577708.stm\n\n&\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1895753.stm",
