Dairy cows are usually milked up to twice a day, these factory cows will be milked at least 3 times a day.\n\nThe cows will survive on fodder and will stand and sleep on sand rather than outside.\n\nIf this build goes ahead we want the cows to be outside and not in sheads living and sleeping on sand.",
