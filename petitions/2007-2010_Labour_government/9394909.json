        "background": "It is a fact that, particularly at training establishments with the logistical and time constraints that exist, this is often the only source for troops to obtain cash on demand. In many cases withdrawals result in further charges being  applied when cummulative inbuilt ATM charges causes overlimit spending.\nWith so many bases moving over to the 'Pay as you Dine' facility, and fewer businesses accepting cheque payment,(a non-starter generally for those under 18's in any case)  hard cash is a necessity rather than a choice.\nIt is a disgrace that our poorly paid troops have to factor in bank charges to their monthly outgoings as a matter of course and pay a premium to get their hard-earned wages out of a machine, whilst the 'faceless fatcats' profit at their expense.\nThere ARE banks and building societies which operate charge-free terminals in other premises.We all have a moral obligation to ensure that our brave troops do not encounter further hardship and by signing this petition we will be in a stronger position to, hopefully, change the status quo. \nThank you for taking the time to read this statement and for appending your support.",
