The people coming under this heading are not given free prescriptions, \nalthough whilst they were employed they have paid NI contributions. It has to be deamned as being unfair that the people who have paid into NI are not given free prescriptions, whilst those who have not paid contributions are given the prescriptions Free of charge.\ne.g If a person is made redundant from employement and paid NI, the person is not given free prescrptions,\n\nPlease would you undersign below if you agree that the current system is unfair",
