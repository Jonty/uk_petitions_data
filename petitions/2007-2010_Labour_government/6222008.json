With the increased risk of death, through constant fighting, as well as the after effects of frontline fighting, soldiers are currently earning \u00a35.05 an hour, with a yearly wage of \u00a314,300 a year before tax compared to a policeman's wage of \u00a320,000 a year before tax.  These brave people are currently risking their lives on the frontline, on a daily basis, sometimes for only \u00a32.45 an hour if in combat for 16 hours a day! Is that how we treat our soldiers in the \"War on Terrorism?\"  This needs to be addressed now, we owe these brave servicemen and women more than \u00a35.05 or \u00a32.45 an hour!",
