            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In the last year it has come to my knowledge as a local heating engineer that \"warmfront\" and its subsiduary company, \"Iguana,\" have been demanding grossly overinflated prices for additional labour to people receiving benefits. Such people receving the benefits are being forced to find additional sums of money to subsidise the warmfront grant scheme, i.e, \u00a3600 to fit two additional radiators. I find this completely immoral and tantamount to daylight robbery of vulnerable people.",
