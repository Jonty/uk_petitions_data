            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Within the UK the younger generations are seen as the vandals and trouble starters for society by the older generations. The situation is running out of control, the government say they are trying to deal with the anti social situation within the country, yet they spend very little if anything at all on local prjects to get teenagers off the streets and into a definitive and legal hobby or pass time.\n\nThis situation needs to change, i myself am a teenager and have several times been mistrusted because of the behaviour of others. In this petition i am calling for all teenagers and younger generations to sign this petition to make the government see that the situation has to change and soon or the government may have a problem that they could not control.\n\nI am by no means saying that all are innocent, but if the government were to push more funding into the public sector, especially towards activities and clubs aimed specifically at  teenagers, i beleive that you would then see a dramatic drop in the crime rate throughout britain",
