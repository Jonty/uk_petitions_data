            "background": "The government is planning to introduce a 50p/month charge for all landlines, so they can invest in the future of broadband/high speed networks.  It ignores the fact that many households do not use, or want, broadband internet, and the elderly, or those on benefits, cannot afford a further financial burden.  Any cost to improve the network infrastructure within the uk should be borne by industry and, if necessary, paid by their users.\nIndeed, why should the already paying public (to private enterprise) subsidise the future of internet connectivity in the UK?",
