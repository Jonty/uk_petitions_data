            "background": "HGV contain speed limiters, resulting in one hgv overtaking the other causing undue delays, sometimes for MILES. Technology exists to allow a signal to be received by the 'inside' HGV to reduce its speed by say 3mph and allow the 'outside' HGV to temporarily increase by the same amount, thus expediting the manoeuvre. It would be possible to limit the number of 'overtakes' per hour or certain distance. Bluetooth could be the tx/rx medium. The +3mph would be an incentive to encourage the transport companies to invest the small amount needed.",
