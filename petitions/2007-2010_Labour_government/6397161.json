            "background": "Motorbikes do not cause congestion, and have reduced CO2 emissions, and as such should be allowed the privilege of using Bus Lanes. Allowing motorbikes to use Bus Lanes would reduce the amount of motorbikes weaving through congested traffic, thus reducing the likelihood of accidents, as well as any aggravation caused to car/lorry drivers by bikes cutting in front of them. We would all have a more pleasant, stress-free journey.",
