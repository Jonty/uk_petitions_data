Trees are dying, grass was not growing and many farmers were having difficulty getting any crops to grow on their farms.  Aluminum, barium and other elements were found to be up to thousands of times higher than normal limits. huge quantities in rain world-wide, is very harmful to flora and thus the eco-system.and the respiratory mortality rate, which has risen from eight on the list of mortality to third in the past five years, and the fact that Alzheimer\u2019s and other illnesses linked to aluminum have continued to rise around the globe at astronomical rates since the inception of the alleged spraying.elements found in the soil, water and air are from an unrelated source. and health risks associated with SAG but also the numerous world-wide allegations about current deployment.",
