        "background": "I need to take my son abroad to my sisters to dry out my son so he may have a Naltrexon implant to get him off Heroin. he has had one a few years ago, but ended up back on Heroin, he is slowly killing himself, we are desperate to get him the Implant, we feel this is the only medication that really works, we are paying from our own funds, we do not want to burden the NHS further. The problem is, my son is on license and is not alowed out of the country, I have asked the probation service for permission to take him away, but they refuse. One would have thought anyone trying to get a person off hard drugs would be helped by the system. My son is not seeking to run away, anyone can do that, he wants medical help for his drug addiction, I ask you to give me permission to take him away so he may dry out and then have the Naltrexon Implent. Thank you. G.Jameson.",
