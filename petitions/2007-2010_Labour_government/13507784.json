            "background": "Employment law currently states that a reasonable belief of guilt is good enough grounds to dismiss.  Where as Criminal law states that if there is reasonable doubt you are innocent.  These two laws should be brought into line with one another.  ie. If there is reasonable doubt then an employer should not be able to dismiss an employee.  If a Police investigation shows there is no charge to answer then the employer should not be able to dismiss the employee on the grounds used for charge. This appears to be an anomoly which should be re-examined as a matter of urgency.",
