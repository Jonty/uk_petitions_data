            "background": "The Race Relations Act is the most unfair, politically biased, and racially prejudiced peace of UK legislation in history. It openly allows workplace discrimination against English people due to sections 35 and 37, and makes it impossible to set up English community groups when all other races are allowed and encouraged to do so. We call on the government to remove the discriminatory sections of the act.",
