        "background": "My sister has recently been through a year of hassle and trauma when the father of her child had someone else represent him for his paternal dna test. All the ID that was required from his was a photograph. It was only when she contested the results that they offered to show her the photo, and obviously it was not him. She also received a call from a misinformed member of the CSA staff in the middle of this to say that he was not the father and that they were closing his case. It has now been proved that he is. Can't we have some sort of formal identification to ensure this does not happen? What if she had not contested the results? how many others has this happened to that haven't?",
