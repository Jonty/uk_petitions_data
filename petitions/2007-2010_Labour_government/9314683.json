            "background": "The abolition of the 10% tax rate causes a significant reduction in tax paid income.  For a large number of \"single\" tax payers there will be no compensation payable either by tax credits, fuel allowances etc especially for those on low earnings over the age of 25 and under 60.  It may be that you feel these people are of no importance but both with the rising cost of living and the reduction in income they are significanlty worse off.  \n\nI would like you to look further at what can be done for the tax payers in this category.",
