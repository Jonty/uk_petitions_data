They must hold these companies accountable to make sure that the big six power firms are not acting in \"tactic collusion\" as they all raise their prices (again).\n\nBritish Gas made record profits in 2007 of \u00a3750 million, meanwhile British consumers are facing another fuel and lighting hike,with a negative impact across the country, particularly for the elderly and less wealthy.\n\nIt is time to stop the rhetoric and rot, it simply isnt good enough, to be told by the energy firms, that they are passing on their rising costs and that they have little choice.\n\nThese kind of statements have been proved to be false. It is time for the Government to represent fairly the needs of the British public and put an end to the sharholder value of these power firms, being of greater importance then the British public.",
