This is more appropriately connected more ego neutral philosophies such as those of physics.\nThe abstract forms of objects of value may be evaluated in terms of the networks of attention (in terms of time and compound qualities) and energy (of formation and distribution) as fundamentally related, linked, measurable quantifications found in physics. The networks are based in the mathematics of graph theory.\nThis would allow a rational market to emerge free from the positive feedback herd psychology aspects found under current regimes.",
