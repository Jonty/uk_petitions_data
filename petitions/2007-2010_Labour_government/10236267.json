            "background": "As a reluctant patron of the Benefits system, myself and countless others have had to turn to them for assistance due to illness or genuine misfortune. We only wish to recieve some financial security allowing us to move forward in a positive manner regardless of our situation. \nThis however has been far from the case; for example I myself have been waiting 7 months to recieve payment on an Income Support claim due to a shocking list of administative blunders. \nOn investigation I find I am not alone. I have heard of numerous examples of poorly trained staff unable to cope with the most simple enquiry, a lack of supervisors/managers availiable at any time, lead times frequently exceeding a month on simple tasks such as sending forms, frequent loss of sensitive information supplied to them in contravention of the Data Privacy Act and lack of response to complaints. \nThis breaks the terms of thier charter and so must be corrected. Please sign this petition if you are unhappy with the service you have recieved from any BDC. Thank you",
