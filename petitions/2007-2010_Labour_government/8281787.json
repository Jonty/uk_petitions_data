            "background": "I wish to campaign on behalf of fellow Civil and Humanist Celebrants.  We would like the law to be changed so that we can legally marry couples.  We know that this has been allowed in Scotland in 2005 and would like it to be possible here in England.  We feel the present Law is discriminating against people with non-religious beliefs (under the European Human Rights Act) and feel that every member of the public should have more freedom and choice to opt for a Ceremony of this nature.",
