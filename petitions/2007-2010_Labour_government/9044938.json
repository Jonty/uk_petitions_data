In many cases, the grandparent/s are involved in the care of their grandchildren because of the high cost of nursery care and fuel costs. The cost, to the grandparents, of this care can be high and it it seems time that the government regognise the value of this care and allow some financial recompence to these 'grey' carers. For my part, this service, given with love, is costing me \u00a375.00 per month. Time to re-assess the value of the family I think! We have brought up one generation [well]. Do we have to, now, do it all over again because of the state of the economy?? What happens when I can no longer afford the cost of fuel to care for my Grandchildren?",
