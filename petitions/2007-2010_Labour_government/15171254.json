        "background": "why are many drivers from other countries effectively living in the uk and driving foreign registered cars on uk roads without paying any road tax and without being punished for traffic offences? a work colleague of mine fro slovakia has been getting away with it for over 3 years now. the police and dvla are powerless in enforcing almost any kind of uk laws on people like this. what if someone is killed by a foreign driver? how do we know they are insured? are terrorists running around the uk in untraceable cars? we must have every foreign car registered on a dvla database as soon as they arrive in the uk.",
