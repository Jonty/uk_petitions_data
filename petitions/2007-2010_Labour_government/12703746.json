        "background": "Immigrants should not be allowed to fill in the skills shortage for our country, rather our country should train our people to fulfill these jobs.\n\nIn my local community, in the local college, only a certain number of places are allowed to run on training people to become nurses, each year the course is full, there should be more places allocated for training as the demand is there. This would reduce the impact on DSS, housing, schools, NHS, as many of the immigrants go for these services, because they are free in this country. Like a gift horse to immigrants. The government says that skilled immigrants contribute to our country but they fail to say that we have 3 million unemployed who can be trained to meet the skills shortage.",
