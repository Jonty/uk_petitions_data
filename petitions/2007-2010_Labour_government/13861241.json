            "background": "The government has taken a positive step in banning smoking from pubs and clubs, however this is not far enough.\n\nSmoking is an anti-social hobby that discriminates against non-smokers. We have a right not to be forced in to breathing smoke wherever we go. With this in mind, why are people still allowed to smoke on the street or whilst driving? Why must we, the non-smoking majority, suffer because of their inconsideration? It is time that the government banned all smoking, except in private residences.",
