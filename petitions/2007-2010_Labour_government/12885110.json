            "background": "The current Scrappage scheme is ideal if your vehicle is already over 10 years old and falls within the parameters of the scheme.  I propose that the \"registered before\" date on the current scheme should be extended on a periodic rolling basis of less than a year (possibly every 6 months to coincide with the main and mini budgets) rather than a once only offer.  This would continue to offer a much needed boost to the Car industry and would continue to help on removing older more polluting vehicles from the roads",
