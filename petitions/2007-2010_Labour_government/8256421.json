If now was the time for change, then the people of England must be given the choice to choose who they want to represent them and run the country.If you don't, you can say goodbye to a once great institution and hello to a real third world country, full of crime, murder, rape, fraud, theft, and millions of immigrants living off your taxes. If you don't want this, then vote for an election, urgent, to save this country and bring it back to what it was once.",
