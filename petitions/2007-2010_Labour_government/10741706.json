This is due to the fact that Health care professionals do not have a definitive method of diagnosis and at present this occurs through a process of elimination whereby other similar diseases are tested first and if the sufferer does not have these is then deemed that they have CFS or ME.\n\nWe the undersigned are therefore petitioning the Prime Minister to raise awareness and funding for research into a clear method of diagnosis.",
