            "background": "The environment impact of closing the expected 66 driving test centre's is going to be monumental... Over one year 7,280,000,000 grammes\nor 7,280 tonnes of extra co2 will be pumped into the environment, An extra \u00a34.6 million of fuel will be consumed, and covering almost 35 million extra miles. This doesn't even included the daily travel of the examiners extra miles. The increased costs of learning to drive with the excessive test increases will cause people to drive illegally. Fatal accidents on Britains roads cost us all, over \u00a35 billion per year, this is set to see a large increase as people opt out of professional tuition. \nWe are seeing 2.5% of our drivers already driving illegally thats average of 500,000 across the country; how many more don't we know about? The government are ultimately responsible for allowing it to happen.",
