            "background": "Patients who pay for some of their treatment privately, are prohibited from then going back to the NHS for other elements of care, until they cease to use the private system. eg. paying for a course of chemo privately - because you either don't live in the right postcode, or it would be a long wait on the NHS if at all,  prevents you from  receiving blood tests, scans etc on the NHS. People trying to help themselves because the NHS is failing them, are then punished financially. A course of chemo can be many thousands on its own, but add blood tests at \u00a3400, a CT Scan between \u00a3300 and \u00a3700, plus consultations, nursing care and additional anti sickness drugs etc, and you could face financial ruin.\nPaying National Insurance Contributions does not count for anything. I want people to still receive care from the NHS, even if they are paying for treatment through the private system, which they would not otherwise be able to receive.",
