            "background": "The Labour government is not required to call a General Election until June 2010, however there is signigicant public support behind calling an election sooner. The UK is currently under a Government led by an unelected PM, Gordon Brown, who has successfully managed to impoverish a generation and create a second \"Wasted Youth\". His recently announced spending cuts on NHS, education, Transport etc in order to provide funding for housing seems, at best, fool hardy and short sighted. \nPublic borrowing is at 54.7% of the GDP of the country, which is irresponsibly high. It is time for the Government to allow the tax payers to choose who they allow to spend their money.",
