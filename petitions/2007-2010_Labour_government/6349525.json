The onus should be on parents to prove that they are not responsible (by action or inaction) for the behaviour of their children.\nIf parents cannot demonstrate that they have acted reasonably responsibly, then they should at the least face some form of compulsory parental training. If it can be shown that they are directly responsible, or may even have encouraged the criminal actions of their children, then they should receive the full sentence that an adult would receive, for the offence their child has committed.",
