            "background": "Trucks are vital to the UK economy but can cause major hold ups when one travelling at 56mph tries to pass one travelling at 55mph with the result that they are effectively a moving roadblock sometimes for miles and miles on 2 lane roads such as the A12, M11, A1 etc. An alternative would be for the law to be changed to oblige the vehicle being passed to slow down to allow the overtaking vehicle to pass much more quickly thus helping to make better use of the limited capacity of our roads, cause less stress to drivers and reduce the likelihood of accidents.",
