            "background": "This is a genetic abnormality and is passed on to any gender through birth.It affects the blood and causes it to clot too much putting people at risk of blood clots.If this was routinely screened then pregnant women would have better in depth care regarding their pregnancies. I suffered from a placental abruption (with clots in my placenta) at 35 wks and gave birth to a beautiful perfect baby boy, but had I been screened for Factor V Leiden then none of this would have happened. I would have taken medicine to ensure that my blood was thinner. They only test for this when tragedy strikes and people have to suffer.They screen for other illnesses when they take your blood so why not Factor V Leiden??",
