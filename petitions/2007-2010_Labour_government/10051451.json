            "background": "The British Medical Journal recently published a report showing that over one in ten people had a piercing in an area other than their ear lobe. It also claimed that over a quarter had complications. The survey also claims that should this trend continue it could create a substantial burden for the NHS.\n\nI call for the Prime Minister to introduce licensing for Body Piercing practitioners to ensure that a high standard of uniform quality is upheld across the industry. This should include a clear code of conduct, improved health and safety measures and consistent after-care advice.\n\nCurrently anybody can claim to be a professional body piercer with little regulation.\n\nIt concludes \"If piercing remains fashionable, almost half the female population might eventually have had a body piercing at a site other than the earlobe. Even if serious complications are rare, the popularity of the practice and the fact that complications can occur long after the actual piercing, might place a considerable burden on health services for many years.\"",
