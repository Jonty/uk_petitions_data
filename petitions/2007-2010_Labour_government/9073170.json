        "background": "Schools should not be designed to pump children full of information that they may or may not need. They should be a place where unique skills are practiced and developed, open mindedness is encouraged above everything else and teachers should  be an aid to this, not always leading. \n\nI'd like parents, children and teachers to decide together what, if anything they should all be learning.\nTo aid this parents should attend classes with their children from time to time and be involved in what their child learns.\n\nI believe that if education were optional and the system changed a little, inquisitive natures would be nurtured and the less interested ones would receive as much tuition as they felt they needed.",
