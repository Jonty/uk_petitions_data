        "background": "It must cost quite a lot to make and show these advertisements; especially the ones we see on T.V.  I live in London and I understand that this is the most expensive area for T.V. adverts; yet we see \"benefit cheat\" adverts on T.V. regularly.  I just wonder whether all this overkill is worth it: how many so-called \"cheats\" do these adverts expose and, above all, how much of taxpayers' money is retrieved as a result compared with the cost of the adverts?  If this assessment shows that the overkill is NOT worth it will you stop commissioning them?",
