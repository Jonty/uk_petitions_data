            "background": "Many employers let employees work half-days on Christmas eve and New Years eve.  Yet if employees want to take the day off then they must use up a full days of their holiday allowance.  To stop this unfair practice we are asking for Christmas Eve and New Years Eve to become public holidays from 12.30pm.  Of course some employers do need their employees to work these afternoons, but they will still be able to offer overtime pay or alternative time off instead.",
