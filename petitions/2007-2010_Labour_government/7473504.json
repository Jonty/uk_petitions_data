            "background": "The Bristol Old Vic is in great danger of being re-opened as a receiving house only, not as a fully producing repertory theatre, as it was before.  It is crucial that this not be allowed to happen, as many famous names and artistic and technical talents have begun and forged their career there.  The Arts Council South West are offering a plan to only supply funding for the essential refurbishment of the theatre if it re-opens as a receiving house, with the Bristol Old Vic Theatre Company having to find a base outside of the theatre, and losing all the resources of the building (rehearsal rooms, carpenters, painters, lighting and sound technicians, wardrobe facilities, to name a few).  Also, all the fantastic educational work the theatre company do would be lost.  It must re-open as a fully producing repertory house with an Artistic Director.  Please do not allow the Arts Council to do this to one of the most historic and important repertory companies in the UK.",
