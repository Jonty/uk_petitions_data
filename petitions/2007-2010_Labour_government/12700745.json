        "background": "I would love to see youth clubs back again!I had a youth club when I was a child and play groups, I looked forward to the school holidays and Tuesdays and Thursdays when youth club was open,2 elderly men run the youth club and charged just 15 pence for us to get in.It kept us of the streets and wanting to be creative and active. The play group was operative in the summer holidays and took us kids on day trips to the the sea side. There is nothing like that happening these days. I think heath and safety has got way out of hand.It does no harm to a child to have the odd fall. It teaches them more.Kids have no respect these days and I do not want my children having no respect for anything or no-one! I want the youth clubs back, the cafe's that had pinball machines and arcade games (modified to this day and age) The drugs and drink is all kids have to give them a rush. Why not bring back community spirit? GIVE THE KIDS SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
