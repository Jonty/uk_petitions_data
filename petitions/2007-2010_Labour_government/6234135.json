A government changes, but the civil service do not change. They have secretaries, under-secretaries...ad infinitum.  An MP should only need one secretary, no spin doctors (as they are part of the civil service), and if that secretary goes on holiday, the MP should type up their own notes.  After all we elected them to represent us, so they should do some graft as well as having a very PC argument in the house of commons.",
