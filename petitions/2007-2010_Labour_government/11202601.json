This would allow those of us disillusioned by our choices of representatives to vote clearly and explicitly.\n\nWhen we do not want to vote for one party we do not need to vote for \u201cthe other party\u201d to express the negative, instead we can vote for \u201cnone of the above\u201d meaning that we don\u2019t like any of the options better than none.\n\nWhile proportional representation has some democratic merits it tends to favour stagnation over change. If we feel there is no need for change we can vote for \u201cnone of the above\u201d.\n\nThe proposal is that those who vote but choose \u201cnone of the above\u201d can be counted as well as those who choose not to vote and these figures can be shown along side the highest votes thereby showing just how popular or unpopular the elected person is.\n\nThis should mean that any would-be-politicians need to come up with suggestions, words and/or promises that are more believable than \u201cnone of the above\u201d. This changes the emphasis from the voter being to blame for not voting to the politician needing more popular policies.",
