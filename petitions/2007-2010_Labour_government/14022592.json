The idea of the petitions site was, I assumed, for people to sign their name towards something they agreed with. The current system seems to allow comments on the main petition page rather than just a signature, which reduces it to nothing more than an un-moderated free-for-all. If the idea is to have comments on individual petitions then perhaps a forum would be a better place. If this is allowed to continue then this petition site will be even more useless than it is at present \u2013 or is that what the master plan is?",
