If you don\u2019t and then change your mind, the Government will NOT let you remove your record. They will just \u2018mask\u2019 it to stop clinicians reading it. Your data would still be kept centrally\u2013with the Health Secretary as its \u2018Data Controller\u2019. They won\u2019t even delete your record if it\u2019s accidentally uploaded by a GP practice against your wishes! \n\nThe DoH said in an FOI reply: \u2018Ministers have determined patients need not have an SCR if they do not want one\u2019. [If an SCR is made, they added]: \u2018The issue of audit and the medico-legal evidential significance of the SCR will be extremely important and it would be inappropriate to provide tools that could completely remove a record, even if this were feasible' [&] \u2018the cost of completely removing them would be prohibitive'. \n\nWe reject this: a low-cost way should be found to let patients delete their SCR\u2019s.",
