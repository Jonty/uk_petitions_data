        "background": "In this day and age, surely it's inappropriate for employers to require men to wear ties at work in jobs where women don't have to wear ties. This is connected with the attitude \"men are completely different from women and here's the proof!\" (i.e. a tie). I think this should have been included in the original version of the Sex Discrimination Act. Apart from this, employees are often selected on their ability to wear a tie rather than their ability to do the job, which results in poor service to the public. At the moment enforced tie wearing for men is decided on the basis of legal precedent set by Judges. Surely this is wrong.",
