The government needs to cap APR rates to sensible levels that are enforced by law. I would\nsuggest an maximum APR of 20%.\n\nPlease sign this petition to lobby the government to bring a halt to this extortion by unprincipled companies and to put a cap on permitted APR rates - if this practice continues more      unsuspecting people will wind up broke.\n\nAt an interest rate of 2356 APR, if for instance you borrowed \u00a31000 and were unable to pay off the load during the course of a year, then by the end of the year you'd owe \u00a323,560. That's\nscandalous!",
