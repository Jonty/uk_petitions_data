        "background": "This government seems bent on creating more and more laws, mostly knee-jerk reactions to immediate problems when existing laws already exist to protect the public. There can only be two reasons: either they think that they have to make headline news with pointless legislation or they are leading us blindly into the EU system of Napoleonic law which states that you can only act within the law. Anything not legislated as being permissable is illegal and the individual has to prove their innocence by showing that they acted within the law. This is neither democracy nor freedom.",
