Having seen a lot of other local primary schools, this seems to be a vast problem and measures need to be taken to ensure the safety of our children and support parents dropping their children off.  If local land can not be allocated for a car park or drop off area, then school buses should be made available, therefore ensuring the children's safety around the school and also ensuring the parents are not held up with car congestion",
