            "background": "We are a self-supporting Cadet unit that is not affiliated to the Ministry of Defence. The youth club has been established in a deprived part of Folkestone since it was \"set up\" by a retired Naval Officer in 1972. His intensions were to have a youth club on a military orientated run programme for children aged 10 to 18. Our problem is that NO ONE will affiliate us to their umbrella body ie Kent Youth. Because we are not a recognised youth club the MOD cadet establishments will not affiliate us either. We are able to use MOD land if we pay a licence and pay there fees to use the land for camps etc. We pay on average \u00a3800 a year. Incidently self supporting means we fund our selves which is around \u00a36000 a year. We would like to petition as we do a lot in the community without getting the Recognition that our youth that attend deserve.We would like to become our own recognised unit",
