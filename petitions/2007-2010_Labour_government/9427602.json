            "background": "Introduce a Driver and Vehicle smart-chip photo-ID card to replace the current Driver Licence.  This would help reduce the time and cost burden placed on Police and other authorities in policing vehicles being driven without Licence, VED, insurance, MOT etc.  All relevant driver and vehicle data would be recorded onto the card \u2013 driver licence, vehicle(s) registration, insurance, MOT, current penalty points, relevant medical data etc.  Police and other authorised agencies would have card-readers in offices and vehicles.  Fuel pumps would also have card-readers and would NOT dispense fuel if any of the essential authorities was absent or out of currency.  Thus, it would be very difficult to drive without an ID card holding these valid authorities.  A one-off charge would be made to generate the initial ID card, with a small admin charge for each subsequent update made through DVLA Offices, Post Offices and other authorised agencies.  This proposal also assumes that the VED system would be dropped in favour of an appropriate component \"VED\" charge within the fuel-tax.",
