            "background": "Drumbrae Primary School and its nursery have been targeted for closure by the City of Edinburgh Council. Drumbrae School was opened in 1957 and has served the community very well as a school and also as the central hub of the community providing young and old with a wide range of activities. It has received several awards for excellence in recent years and teaches traditional values to our children. Sports day at Drumbrae illustrates well the team work and camaraderie which exists across all school years. This is something to be proud of and something which we as a community feel we must encourage and fight to maintain.",
