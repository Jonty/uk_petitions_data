        "background": "Being old and disable doesn\u2019t mean we should be forgotten.  At present it seems once you have reached the \u201cGolden Years\u201d and you become disable you are far less important and should not be even thinking of trying to carry on and live as normal a life as possible.  At present those on Attendance Allowance are excluded from the mobility scheme, road tax exemption, extra heating allowance etc.  To receive the same benefits as those on Disability Living Allowance would enhance thousands of disabled pensioners lives.",
