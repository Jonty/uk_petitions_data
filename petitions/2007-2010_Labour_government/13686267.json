        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If the government made large bonus's a disallowable expense for corporation tax purposes it should deter companies from paying large bonus's, and if they do it would mean they will still have to pay corporation tax on that amount. This would make the procedure of paying bonus's expensive to the company and the benefits of the bonus being shared with the tax payer.\nThis may also, in some cases, deter directors of businesses paying themselves huge bonus's instead of dividends in order to exclude shareholders from their share of profits made.",
