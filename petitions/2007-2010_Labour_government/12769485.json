Use this money on all sorts of national and local projects and for gradually buying in the National Debt for a start. Inflationary? The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chairman of the Bank of England must have powers between them to prevent this. This measure will help overcome the recession. You and your advisers have brains enough to make this work.",
