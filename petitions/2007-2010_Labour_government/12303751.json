            "background": "An adult in the UK is legally defined as under the age of 18. currently, many companies are charging 'adult' fares to many children under the age of 18. for example, Trains - a child ticket is 15 and under, Wilts and Dorset buses are 14 and under, many theme parks etc. consider a child to be 12 and under. I believe this is wrong and the government should force companies to charge 'adult' fares to adults (over 18) and 'child' fares to children (under 18)",
