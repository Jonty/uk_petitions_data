            "background": "In the academic year 2009/2010 the process of applying for student finance in England changed. Where formally it was the position of the LEA to assess most claims the Student loans company assumed this responsibility and failed.\nThe student loans company has consistently failed to carry out the following:\n\n1. Process information in a reasonable timeframe.\n\n2. Ensure the security of information and evidence provided i.e. evidence is frequently lost.\n\n3. Provide adequate customer care. \n\n4. To provide a suitable contact service. \n\n5. To provide funding to those \"at risk\" as a priority.\n\nI therefore feel as though this company, employed by government, has acted in a grossly incompitent manner and therefore it is in the public interest to have the Student Loans Company explain its behaviour at a public inquest.",
