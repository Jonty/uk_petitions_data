        "action": "re-consider the reclassificiation of marijuana",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many people, at some point in their lives, will try weed. Many of our leading politicians have admitted to it in the past, and yet they are the ones reclassifying it. By making marijuana class B, it will simply mean more prison overcrowding for petty offences, and more money thrown away on the policing of marijuana possession (Policing which would have a far greater benefit in areas such as under-age drinking or knife crime). I find it hard to believe more of the general public are not as adverse to this reclassification as myself. Sign this petition if you want more police on REAL criminal activity, less drug dealers on the streets, or maybe if you just fancy a joint; whatever the reason, maintaining, or even de-classifying marijuana will benefit not only the individual, but the country as a whole.",
