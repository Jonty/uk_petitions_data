        "background": "On 22 April 2009 Alistair Darling announced his latest Budget. \n\nThis Budget did not contain anything to assist and encourage small or start up businesses in the UK.\n\nIn these unprecedented economic times, the small business plays a vital part in helping to reduce the unemployment figures. \n\nOwners of small businesses and those wishing to take the step to start their own business should be actively supported and encouraged.\n\nThis petition has been set up to lobby the Government to introduce a package of tax breaks and incentives that will have a positive and immediate impact on small businesses and start ups.\n\nThe measures should be introduced immediately without waiting for the next PBR.\n\nWe ask Shriti Vadera, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Competitiveness and Small Business, to meet with Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown to arrive at a suitable package of practical and effective measures.",
