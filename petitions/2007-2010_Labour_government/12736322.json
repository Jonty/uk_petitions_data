            "background": "to allow type 1 diabetics to drive small trucks and buses for profit, at the moment as i am sure youre aware type 1 diabetics cannot drive HGV's and PSVs.\n \nWith my campaign i aim to show that like America were type 1 diabetics can obtain such licences the UK could also addapt to this culture and use exactly the same guide lines but enforce a few other just to make the plan even safer for example reducing distances travelled , reducing weight allowences (e.g max vehicle  weight of 15 tonne), increasing rests, strict quaterly medical examinations, reducing passangers (eg 48 max or 36 max) and so on.\n \nI want all diabetics to be able to do something they love wether it be bus driving or truck driving but also operate within strict guidelines and be safe which is more than achivable,\nThank you for your time and i would be most greatfull if you would sign my campaign .\nKindest Regards.(www.diabetes.org/uedocuments/ChartofSafetyMedicalScreenings07.pdf ) This link will provide you with the cretiera that America expects inorder to drive a coach of any size and distance.\n \nRobert Walmsley",
