This in the long term makes the user think that they constantly have a blocked nose. When you become addicted to the nasal sprays you start to use more and more because the effect doesn't last as long making the user in danger of causing permanant damage to their nose. I there fore think that it should only be sold to people over 18 ( like ciggerates and alcohol this is to addictive)",
