            "background": "There exists so much corruption amongst MPs and those in high public positions that it would seem that the penalties for being caught aren't really much of a deterrent. \n\nI would like to petition the PM to wipe out the person's pension rights they have accumulated while in their public position. An independent authority would determine guilt and even if they're only guilty of  a minor offence of corruption the penalty is always the same; take away their pension. As the saying goes 'steal a penny, steal a pound'.\n\nSomeone who takes on a position of trust and then abuses that trust is really guilty of treason against those that elected him in to that position. \n\nI believe this would make MP's who would be inclined to abuse their position a lot more responsible and would make them think a lot more before defrauding the tax payer.",
