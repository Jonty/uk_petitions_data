            "background": "The prime minister should introduce legislation to make it mandatory for petrol stations to show how much of the price of a litre of fuel is actually tax,\n this would remind people every time they fill up just why the cost of fuel is so high,\nthe tax proportion of the cost of a litre of fuel should be shown clearly on the forecourt price signs, \nThis would stop consumers complaing about oil companies profits and make them realise who really is responsible for the extortinate price of fuel in the UK.\nI would imagine that the fuel companies would also support this idea.",
