        "background": "Events of recent weeks (May 2009) have destroyed public confidence in MPs parliament. Given that in order for democracy to be effective it requires the consent of the people who have elected it, there can be no doubt that the current parliament must be described as no-only ineffective but paralysed. So that MP\u2019s can get on with their task of running the country according to the wishes of the people who elected them, there must be an immediate election to re-establish the moral authority of parliament. Without MPs who are trusted by the population it is impossible for the government to make useful progress towards any objective, and this trust can only be re-established by an immediate election, and the resignation of the Speaker.",
