            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "By making the purchasing of an annuity compulsory the providers have the general public over a barrel. With most annuities paying an annual rate at more or less that which you could get from a good \"non taxed\" savings account - the providers are basically guarding the capital amount until you die. Then they get to keep it. We would encourage the govt to design a savings account and tax scheme that at least allowed pensioners to pass on the capital when they die. That way widows, orphans etc. could reinvest the full remaining capital into a similar \"pension\" and not be subjected to a 50% reduction in the pension rate as happens today. We know the standard argument is that one person's loss helps pay another person's pension  - but at such low payout rates that are way below average investment returns we just do not believe that to be true.",
