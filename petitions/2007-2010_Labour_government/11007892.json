The BBC are not listening to those that pay their way and are keeping their inferior commentators and much reduced coverage even though they now have the monopoly of the sport. This is an outrage - The BBC are out of touch with public opinion yet again. We demand adequate coverage of all races (125's, 250's and the premier class), not on the interactive service but live and in full on a television channel we can all access. The BBC are meant to be a body for the people, we pay for their service, we demand at least a way to share our opinions without being rebuffed by rhetoric.",
