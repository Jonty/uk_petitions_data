        "background": "Vertical Tutoring is due to start at the Arthur Terry School in Sutton Coldfield soon, as a testbed for other schools. However, the students believe it is wrong. Students are split from people they have known for X number of years and put with students, both older and younger than themselves. The supposed advantage is that older students can help younger ones, but this is unlikely to happen. Vertical Tutoring loses the family feel of the Tutor Group, and the feel that everyone knows everyone else. In Vertical Tutoring, the older students may possibly bully the younger ones. We are desperate for vertical tutoring to be stopped, and we have tried asking school council and senior staff, to no avail.",
