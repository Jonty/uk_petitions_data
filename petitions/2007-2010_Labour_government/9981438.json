The agencies should not be able to respond to a credit reference enquiry without first checking separately (i.e. not rely on a signature on an application form) with the individual whether the request can be responded to.  This would reduce the opportunity for fraudsters to take over an individual's identity and obtain credit.\nMaking the data held the property of the individual should also lead to an obligation on the agencies to provide free access, by the individual, to their reference data, rather than the chargeable access that currently exists.",
