Urban policy should provide towns and cities with incentives to grow, prevent ghost towns from appearing, and give towns and cities much more freedom to decide how to use regeneration money.\"\n\nOne idea might be to legislate to make independent companies pay for web site \"feedback\" to encourage people to be more innovative and avoid the exploitation of getting ideas for free. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to ensure that this voluntary practice, like much of the work in the health and social services, and for medical journals, is paid. It's hardly a rocket science solution to falling standards, is it ?",
