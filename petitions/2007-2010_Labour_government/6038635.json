Unprotected bodies, travelling at legal speeds up to 70mph, on a 2-wheeled vehicle which can be upset by a wet manhole - any official would reject this idea out of hand.  The only reason we allow motorcycles is that they have been around for more than a century and we have all got used to them.\n\nMotorbikes are dangerous to all road users, are frequently driven recklessly, and cause a disproportionate number of deaths and serious injuries.  Their removal would benefit averyone.",
