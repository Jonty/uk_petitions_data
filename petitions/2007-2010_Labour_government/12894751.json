            "background": "We wish to request that a maximum temperature law is set for all office based and other suitable jobs where a maximum temperature would be beneficial to the workforce.\nDue to current climate conditions, productivity when extremely hot decreases \nUnusually hot weather conditions affect the body by pushing it beyond its limits. When temperatures and humidity are high, the body must work extra hard to maintain a normal temperature. Temperatures above 30 degrees affect concentration levels anyway so we believe that this is a reasonable temperature to set so when it rises above that we are allowed to leave work premises in order to become more comfortable",
