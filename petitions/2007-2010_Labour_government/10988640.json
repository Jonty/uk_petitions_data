            "background": "Heating Oil is the only source of heating and hot water available to a vast number of homes in rural areas that do not have access to mains gas or reliable electricity supplies. Due to recent massive increases in Oil prices, many elderly and vulnerable families are living without heat because they cannot afford the thousands of pounds to fill even a small fuel tank. Farmers have subsidies or can offset against business expenditure. The Elderly and vulnerable cannot. There is sufficient leeway in recent Government 'oil price' windfalls to fund this and be seen to be justly helping the most vulnerable in society.",
