            "background": "During the past several years the people of Wootton Bassett have turned out in droves to welcome home the fallen heros from Iraq and Afghanistan. Their selfless committment of ensuring that the fallen Service men and women are given the respect they deserve needs to be recognised. They are there to offer support to the families and friends when they are in their greatest need of comfort. It would be wrong to pick out individuals so why not provide the whole of Wootton Bassett with recognition and make it \"Royal Wootton Bassett\". The troops will then be welcomed home not only by family, friends and members of the public; they would be welcomed home by the Crown. The very thing they are fighting for.",
