            "background": "Everyone knows this county is now in a recession. However, reporting this 24 hours a day in the press, on TV and on the internet is making the situation worse. People are in a state of panic. Because of this, people have stopped spending and this is a vicious circle as by stopping spending and thinking you are saving money, businesses aren't making a profit, therefore people are made redundant and then have no money in the end because they don't have a job. We need to focus on how to make the economy better and not focus on the negative.",
