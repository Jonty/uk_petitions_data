            "background": "For way too long, the town of Leigh in Lancashire has been the largest town in the UK to not have a railway link. Lowton is regularly becoming congested with traffic trying to avoid the A580 East Lancs Road.\nWe feel that with the current development in the area, especially the Leigh Sports Village, a railway link is long overdue as opposed to the guided busway proposal.\nAll large towns in the UK should have good access to the rail network to provide good public transport and promote the local economy by providing improved transport links for local businesses. The extra benefit would also be to reduce road congestion in the area and provide local employment.",
