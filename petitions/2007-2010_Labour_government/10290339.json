            "background": "Autism is a serious lifelong neurological condition for which there is no cure. It affects one in one hundred children in the UK and 60,000,000 worldwide. It is seen as acceptable to use the word as a term of abuse and this causes great distress to people with autism and those of us who love them. This disabiltiy is as real as downs syndrome or cerebral palsy and yet you would not have Politicians on the floor of the house of commons hurling these disabilitites at one another as an abusive term. So why is it ok to do this with autism. Comedy shows on tv regularly use the term as a way of negatively describing people and I want this to stop, so that people with autism can find their place in the world just like anyone else.",
