MPs should lead by example, then the public is expected to follow.\nPolitians seem to be a law unto themselves able to claim unlimited taxpayer funding. Anyone else making claims off the public purse, are deemed to have acted fraudulently, and investigated.Should these MPs appeal against the ruling will they have their claims suspended until a verdict is reached? Will they reimburse the public purse? When people find themselves unable to work,due to incapacity and  claim benefits, they are put through the mill. Why shouldn\u2019t the same apply to MPs. \n\nPoliticians should set the precendant. Until then all ongoing investigation of incapacity benefit claims should be SUSPENDED.",
