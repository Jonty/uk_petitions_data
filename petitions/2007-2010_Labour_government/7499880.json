            "background": "Our honours system has become focussed on those who have sporting, entertaining or political prowess.  The fact that they have been extremely well paid and received public attention should be reward enough.  Why should I be expected to call some rock singer or unlearned footballer \"Sir\" and his even less deserving wife \"Lady\"? The same applies, but more so, to the clutch of politicians and their publically paid  civil service \"advisers\" who look after themselves so well and so consistently sell us down the river.  Just abolish this out-dated honours system.",
