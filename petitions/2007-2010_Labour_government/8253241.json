        "background": "This is a largely unexplored area, compared to science etc and at the moment, to my knowledge, no university or private venture receives funding from the government for paranormal exploration.\n\nThe department should aim to either prove or disprove the existance of spirits/entities.  If proven to exist then the department should seek to establish contact with them, and then seek to control them.  If our nation was able to control spirits then we'd have a massive advantage in the world-market.\n\nIf proven not to exist then every medium who claims to contact the dead should not be allowed to practise/con the living.",
