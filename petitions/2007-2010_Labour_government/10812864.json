            "background": "Due to the high competition at the Olympic Games this year by both sets of competitors, I feel, in response of a letter in the Media that the Paralympics Games should be played before the main Olympic Games. My reasoning is because due to the high Media Attention of this years games and how after the main games the Media attention died down, I feel that on paper the Paralympians did better but didn\u2019t have the same thanks from the public. In summary, it would provide more attention to the Paralympics, and not differ from the Olympics.",
