        "background": "I purpose that the government changes the legislation for benefits for under 25\u2019s. \nAt the moment under 25\u2019s are restricted to the amount of benefits they get, for the reason of their age only.\nIf you are under 25 years old you can only claim a Shared Room Rate for Housing Benefit, regardless of your housing situation.\nYou are also only allowed a certain amount from the Job Centre Plus, and you have to be over 25 years old to claim Income Support.\n\nBut if you are under 25 years old you are expected to work, pay taxes, be a good citizen and fight for your country.   \n Also you are allowed to drink, smoke, have a bank account, credit cards, and buy property, rent property and drive.\nWhich is exactly the same for over 25\u2019s but you are not entitled to the same benefits as over 25\u2019s.",
