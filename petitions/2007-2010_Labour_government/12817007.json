            "background": "where would we be without our brave men and women serving our country? it is because of them that we sleep at night. what i want to be stopped is our service men and women being taxed on a bonus. why should they be taxed on a bonus? its a bonus. they get taxed way too much on a wage so why take more off them, they do a fantastic job doing what they do yet they get no credit for this job. a bonus should be a bonus and they should get the full amount that they have been told they are getting which is what they deserve. my husband, a submariner (who are always forgotten when it comes to protecting this country) will be paying over \u00a33000 in tax this month most of this is being taken from a bonus which is disgusting!\nplease scrap taxing on their bonus!!",
