            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The UK Government and the banks are now using millions of savers to subsidise other peoples debts and mortgages. Savings accounts are giving only a pathetically low rate of interest ,yet banks are offering very competitive loan and mortgage rates,often to people who have bought property they cannot afford .Some people on Tracker mortgages are paying virtually nothing.Why should savers bail them out?Most savers have worked hard,been careful,paid tax on their earnings,pay tax on their savings and need savings interest to help pay the bills.The finance industry has been ripping us off for years and been reckless and greedy to boost profits and bonus payments.The Government has already given banks billions of pounds of public money and continue to punish millions of savers.This is unjust and Gordan Brown will pay a high price come the next general election.Please sign the petition now and help get justice for UK savers!",
