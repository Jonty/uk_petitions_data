        "background": "People on the Isle of Wight who suffer from psoriasis are having to travel off the Isle of Wight to Southampton or Portsmouth several times a week just to recieve treatment for a condition that is no fault of their own. The cost of traveling to and from the \"mainland\" is astronomical. Many treatments available locally everywhere in the uk are not available to Islanders and some are needed as much as 3times a week and whole days are needed off work.\nAll i ask is for a little funding to the 1 and a half Psoriasis specialists on the Island so they can actually treat us        rather than make us travel oversea.",
