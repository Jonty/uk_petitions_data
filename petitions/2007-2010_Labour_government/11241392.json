Thousands of pounds could be saved and used for more important services like the National Health for example just by turning street lighting off a couple of hours earlier. We are now in an economic crisis thanks to this Government, who should do more, a simple way to save money nationally appears beyond this Government, it's time for a change in how we use resources and Government should lead the way.",
