            "background": "In the current economic climate it is obscene and unacceptable that any organisation shored up with public funding should award itself/employess bonuses.\n\nWhy should any banker earn more than a surgeon, doctor, nurse etc.\n\nIt has been said that the UK needs to keep these banking professionals otherwise they will go elsewhere, my view is that there is enough talent, skill and ability within the UK to cope without those individuals that want to leave - our current economic climate and for years to come is a clear indication of such 'talent' .\n\nInstead of paying out the money as bonuses the money should be used to support those people at risk of losing their mortgaged homes to stay in those homes.",
