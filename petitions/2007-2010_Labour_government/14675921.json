            "background": "The average cost of childcare now runs at \u00a3800 a month. Even with Childcare vouchers, this is a struggle. Why can the state not provide free Childcare, the same as it provides for Primary and Secondary schools? My family brings in \u00a340,000 joint income, but this still does not cover the money needed for Daycare, yet means we earn too much for Childcare Tax Relief. Nationalised Daycare would offer these families much needed help, and also improve the tragic wage of under \u00a310,000 p.a for Daycare Workers, who are teachers in all but name, yet earn \u00a320,000+ less than their counterparts.",
