            "background": "The Forestry Commission is the body responsible for some of Great Britains most treasured landcapes and one of the countries largest landowners at over 1 million hectares, 7,720 square kilometres. This is the peoples organisation, funded by generations of British tax payers. It has been both a strategic reserve, a place of family recreation and a timber resource paid for by a caring public. This petition seeks to stop the sell-off or any other form of agentisation, next steps organisational change or whatever else is dreamed up. This petition demands that the FC is allowed to remain as part of the peoples asset base in its current guise for this and future generations.",
