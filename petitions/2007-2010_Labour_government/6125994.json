            "background": "The vice-president of FIFA, Jack Warner, has stated his intention to do his upmost to try and block England's bid for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nHe has called England \"an irritant\", said that \"nobody in Europe likes England\" and stated that \"England has had no impact on world football\" despite winning the\nthe world cup in 1966 and the huge success of English football clubs both at home and abroad.  \n\nThese slanderous comments will have an inevitable impact on whether or not England is granted the opportunity to host the World Cup in 2018. \n\nWarner's words are a slur against England and an insult to the English people.\n\nIt is paramount that a person such as Jack Warner remain impartial and unbiased. \n\nHis admission to trying to block England's bid for the world cup amounts to openly blatant corruption against England.\n\nBerating England in this way has also rendered his position untenable.\n\nThe Prime Minister should demand an apology and the resignation of Jack Warner to make it clear to FIFA the serious nature with which we regard these disgraceful remarks.\n\nFootball has a major impact on England and it is pivotal that comments such as this are addressed direct by the Prime Minister.",
