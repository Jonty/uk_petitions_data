            "background": "The term 'hump-day' is offensive to children, being a reference to sexual intercourse. This is why there are so many underage pregnancies. Due to the fact children will clearly think it is perfectly fine to 'hump' on this given day of the week for all eternity. Why don't we just call friday, saturday and sunday binge days and let our children run riot with vodka and heroin.",
