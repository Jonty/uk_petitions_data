The current electoral system and political climate relies too heavily on a mass body of opinion primarily driven by selfish, short term desires, and peers who do are not forced to acquiesce to such petty threats to reasoned judgement can act in the long term strategic interest of the nation, be it in opposing ID cards despite the hyped threat of terroristic activity or in supporting the renewal of Trident instead of childishly punishing a sitting Government for its foreign policy.",
