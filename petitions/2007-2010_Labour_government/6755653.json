            "action": "provide the same legal rights and duties for unmarried couples as is available under current Divorce laws, by enabling unmarried partners to register their relationship after a qualifying period of one year or at anytime following the birth of a child of the relationship",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "With more and more couples living together outside marriage, it is vitally important that the government changes the law to provide people with the same rights and duties which they would have if they were married.   At present it is often the case that when such relationships break down a fair and equitable division of assets is impossible because of the inadequacies of the present law.   I propose that after a qualifying period of 1 year (or at anytime after a child of the relationship is born), one or both partners should be able to register their partnership and thus be placed in an identical position to married couples and those who have entered into civil partnerships.   Not only would this provide unmarried couples with the many necessary and just legal rights which they are deprived of at present, but it would hopefully promote a measured and responsible approach towards entering into the significant commitments of cohabitation and (often) parenthood.",
