            "background": "Consumerism is one of the biggest threats to the planet.\nThousands of products come out every month, with barely any change, reissues, specifications slightly improved, and then hard sold to the consumer with aggressive advertising.\nThese items typically have a short lifespan, and the waste, and packing is phenomenal.\nThis is not the consumers fault, the fault lies with the companies making and marketing these items, so, \nLet the govenment bring in legislation so that companies make items which last a lifetime, or very long indeed, not just months, and this will cut electrical waste, packing waste, plastics waste.\nComanies know exactly how to make products, and this is easy to implement, but choose only to build them poorly so that they don't last long, in order for the next new sensationalist item.\nThe way to really save the planet is to compel goods sold in this country to be made to top quality, lasting goods and items, obviously excluding things like foodstuffs.\nSurely this is commonsense, and the government must stop this growth in short lifespan products if it really cares to do anything about the environment, tackle the problem at source.",
