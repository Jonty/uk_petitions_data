        "background": "Transport links between the West Midlands and the East of England are nearly non-existant. The only road link consists of the A14 which is in dire need of upgrading. The only rail link is the Birmingham New Street to Stansted Airport route, on which it takes over 3 hours to get from Birmingham to Cambridge. Regular commuting between these economically important regions is impossible. A new rail route must be considered in order to improve journey times between the two regions.",
