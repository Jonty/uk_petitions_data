            "background": "Please create a single system that would allow all UK residents to be allocated a smart card that can perform all of the functions of a birth certificate, marriage certificate, passport and driving license, NHS Card, National Insurance Card and identity card. The relevant attributes can be added when required. By integrating all these old systems, surely there will be some cost benefits with reduced costs of systems that are replaced to offset the cost of introduction. It should create a simpler and more accessible system for all of us. The data on the card is simply updated as we get married, pass our driving test etc. They should be issued to everyone without a requirement to apply. Data should reflect documents that people currently have. Updates to the card data should be possible by visiting existing local council offices.",
