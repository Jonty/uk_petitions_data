            "background": "It is understandable that an amount of money has to be paid into the system to accomodate degree courses and the facilities that go along with them, such as libraries containing the latest reference materials and computing equipment. However it is unnacceptable that over a 3 year degree course the tuition fees can increase between each year. For example, in your first year a course can cost \u00a33070 however in your second year it can be increased to \u00a33145. Students are at university to improve their future prospects but are not given the best start to their future with at least \u00a39000 worth of debt on their shoulders.\nThis is only on a 3 year course, there are many courses that last a few years more and therefore carry more debt, this should be changed.",
