Although tolerant and Accomodating almost in the extreme we have never wished for the Mass Immigration which dilutes and ethnically cleanses Britain of our individual English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh Identities with 'Imported Europeans'.We call upon the Government to reduce and or reverse immigration to a level which does not threaten the inaliable human right of the British people and culture to exist.\nWe further call upon the Government to use it's Influence to ensure the Survival of our Similarly threatened European Neighbours.",
