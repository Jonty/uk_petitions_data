            "background": "This is in response to a petition which asks for such information to be published re benefits claimed by lone mothers; such benefits are, almost certainly, a TINY FRACTION of the amount lost through TAX EVASION.  The only difference is that tax evasion (or avoidance) is legal (I know one is and one isn't but I don't know which is which).  I really don't know why there are so many petitions expressing animosity to benefit claimants and few if any, (apart from a couple I've created), towards tax evasion/avoidance.  Even false benefit claims don't cost the country that much, unlike tax evasion (etc), and surely it's just as galling to be forced to pay tax, without any option at all (taken from your wages before you even get them), as it is to work hard and see others getting benefits for not working (something they may have very good reasons for).",
