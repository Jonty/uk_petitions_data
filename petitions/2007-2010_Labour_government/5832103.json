            "background": "The United Kingdom is one of few countries where motor sport is not financially aided by the government. Spain, for example, has a grant put aside for promising youngsters to aid them through the ranks, and this aided current Formula 1 World Champion Fernando Alonso to reach the top tiers of Motor Racing. The United Kingdom would benefit hugely from something like this, as there are a lot of unsigned, extrenely talented drivers who will never reach the top through lack of funding.",
