            "background": "I am a current student who receives the top level of EMA (\u00a330) per week, but personally do not feel that this is a sufficient amount. Each week, my bus fare alone costs me \u00a315, despite only having to make a short (15min) bus journey each way. This leaves me with just \u00a315 per week for meals, trips, equipment, stationary and anything else I might need for my studies.I feel that many other students will be in a similar predicament. Other students who have to travel further will pay more in bus fares, and those who do subjects such as photography have to pay more for equipment. The Government should re-think the assessment process to allow students in such circumstances to have access to further funds, and limit those who do not require such amounts. This way the scheme is altogether more fair and effective.",
