Employing police officers with a criminal record doesn't inspire the public's confidence and trust in the police force and its standards in the police force.\n\nThere is a risk that the position of trust will be abused by those who have a criminal record. Anyone with a criminal record for serious offences should not become a police officer.\n\nThe police force should have high standards where their police officers' criminal records are concerned so that the public can trust them not to abuse their positions of trust and responsibility towards the public, justice and law.",
