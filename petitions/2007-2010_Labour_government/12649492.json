We the public are grateful to the Daily Telegraph for this and ask that their expenses so incurred should be reimbursed as a sign of the UK Parliament's desire for honesty and transparency of the political system.\n\nWe ask further that announcement of this payment should  made by the Prime Minister immediately upon the election of a new Speaker of the House of Commons.",
