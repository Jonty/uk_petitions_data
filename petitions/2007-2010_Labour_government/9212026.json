        "background": "The way that Canada treats its fallen soldiers is exemplary. They line the highways and roads with saluting fire and police officers and have a police escort proudly escorting their fallen dead while other police officers clear the roads and stop traffic. The way Britain treats its soldiers is the complete opposite they are given no escort in oxfordshire and are left to navigate the roads in traffic and with hardly any honour or recognition on their final journey. No people lining the roads, no salutes, not even a single police car which can't be spared due to \"Community services\" ITS NO EXCUSE. This is disgusting, appalling treatment for people who deserve so much better and this petition is a way for people of this country to right this terrible treatment of true heroes.",
