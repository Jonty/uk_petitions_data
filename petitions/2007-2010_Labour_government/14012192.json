We call on the PM to advise the US Administration that British troops will be pulled out of Afghanistan within 1 month unless they make a commitment to meet agreed objectives and outline a strategy for meeting those objectives. The time for Obama rhetoric is over, its time for him to act like a leader instead of talking about being a leader.",
