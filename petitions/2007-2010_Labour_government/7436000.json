            "background": "Since October 2006 Mr Amstell has hosted a panel show on BBC 2 entitled Never Mind the Buzzcocks.  This program was considered amusing by some before the services of the gentleman named were employed; however the quality of the presenting is now so poor that it can no longer be found a source of amusement for anyone.  The employ of Mr Amstell must now be considered a waste of license payers\u2019 money and the Prime Minister is obliged to ensure that BBC funds are no longer squandered on retaining the services of below par broadcasters.",
