        "background": "HM Government is abusing the law preventing the police from striking over pay, by offering police officers an insulting below inflation pay rise which actualy amounts to a pay cut in real terms. The government is well aware of officers legal obligation not to strike, so is able to ride rough shod over any pay deal. This No Strike Law was based upon an historic agreement, where officers agreed not to strike in return for fair pay deals. The present government has now broken that agreement, so police officers should be permitted to do the same.",
