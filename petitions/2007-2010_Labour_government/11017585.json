        "background": "We the undersigned, petition the Government to suspend the introduction of new rail timetables on 14th December 2008, until the full implications and regional effects have been properly debated.  The new timetables impose many reductions in services and significant changes which will impact many tens of thousands of people, and have not been sufficiently consulted upon or publicised by the TOCS, who have tried to introduce cuts to services with primary regard to profitability and little regard to levels of public service, particularly in the regions.",
