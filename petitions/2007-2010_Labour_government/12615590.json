            "background": "Currently the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) are advising against all but essential travel to Mexico in an unscientific blanket ban akin to Egypt's globally mocked cull of pigs.\n\nThe FCO employ 16,000 civil servants worldwide.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) employ more than 8000 people and is attended by all 193 UN Member States. WHO staff include medical doctors, scientists, epidemiologists, experts in the fields of health statistics, economics and emergency relief.\n\nSo, why is the FCO advising against all but essential travel to Mexico when the WHO state;\n\n\"WHO is not recommending travel restrictions related to the outbreak of the influenza A(H1N1) virus. Imposing travel restrictions would have very little effect on stopping the virus from spreading, but would be highly disruptive to the global community. Scientific research shows that restricting travel would not stop the spread of disease.\"\n\nThe FCO advice makes the UK government and it's citizens appear uneducated, unscientific and prone to overreacting.  In short, the FCO make the UK look 'stupid'. I call for the FCO advice to be amended immediately in order to reflect international scientific opinion.",
