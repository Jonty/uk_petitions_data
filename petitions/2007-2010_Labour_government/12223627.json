        "background": "Under recent ACPO guidance (\u201cGuidance on charging for police services\u201d ACPO 2005) police forces around the country have been charging community events such as community arts and music events for the cost of policing. Under the ACPO guidance any event with a few stalls, stewards and a stage / entertainment license can be charged for the cost of policing.\nWe believe that community events fulfill a vital service in our society promoting community cohesion, encouraging community engagement and generally being a force for good in society, all of these are key national indicators of the department for culture media and sport (DCMS). Community events are often organised by volunteers and the events run on a shoestring budget, they cannot afford the additional cost of policing. This is why we urge you to safeguard the future of community events by stopping the police charging them.",
