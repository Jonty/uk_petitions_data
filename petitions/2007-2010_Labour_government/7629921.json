        "background": "If someone wants to move into the UK and they do not have a full time job offer that can support their family they should automatically be drafted into the army for a minimum of 3 years and earn the right to live in the country. If they become unemployed and remain so for 2 months, they should automatically be drafted again.\nThey should be paid less than minimum wage to work in the army as they will have little ourgoings. This would help filter out the people just looking to cash-in on our health and benefit schemes.",
