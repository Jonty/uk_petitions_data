        "background": "As true fans of football, we appreciate that Leeds United acted against the interests of the Football league rules, and were punished by agreement of all other clubs.\nIt is therefore inconceivable that they should be even considering action to overturn this 15 point deduction.\nAs true believers in fair play, we support the 15 point deduction and encourage its implementation.\nThe only reason for overturning it would be financial gain, not sporting achievement and as football is sport first and foremost, there is absolutely no reason to overturn it.",
