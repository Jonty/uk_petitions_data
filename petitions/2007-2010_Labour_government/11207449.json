            "background": "The major problem all companies encounter, is  their Cash Flow, This means, most companies rely on their debtors to pay outstanding Invoice, on agreed time schedules. However,  this can only be achieved providing every company receives payment for outstanding invoices from their customers.\n\nFactoring services do exist nationally but only cover up to 85% of outstanding Invoice values but interest fees prevent  many companies considering having their invoices Factored.\n\nGovernment would gain from introducing a 100% Factoring service, with a low rate of interest  i.e. 3.00%. This mean, all companies nationally would be invited to join a government controlled factoring service, which would encourage companies to pay employees income tax and national Insurance contribution on the due date for payment and also pay their VAT  obligation when due for payment.\n\nFactoring needs to be encouraged nationally because providing all companies pay their creditors on time, they pay lower overdraft fees and we all benefit from lower retail prices.",
