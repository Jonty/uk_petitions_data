        "action": "Stop treating student loans as \"Income\" and provide state benefits to support living costs including Housing Benefit",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Quite unfairly, a student is forced to take out a student Loan which is then treated as income. Students are then disbarred from receiving any benefit what so ever. Student loans fail to take proper account of the living costs of the student, but instead presumes that a student loan addequately covers the student living costs.\nGovernment policy on Students is that they are able to work to subsidise their living costs, which is not always possible, especially in areas heavily hit by job losses due to the Credit Crunch. \nIt is widely known that many students sell their bodies to fund college / University or turn to shop lifting. This is disgraceful, but it is the government who should be ashamed for failure to provide addequate resorces and safety net for students.\nAllow Student access to Housing benefit which is the biggest single cost to all students often using upto 2/3 of the Loans.",
