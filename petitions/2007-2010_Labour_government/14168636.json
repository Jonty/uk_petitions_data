            "background": "The recent extensions to the proceeds of crime act through a statutory instrument is a gross abuse of power and process, and an affront to freedom and democracy in this country.  It gives sweeping powers to councils, bailiffs, debt collectors and companies to seize assets under a presumption of guilt for \"crimes\" as trivial as non-payment of a parking ticket or non-payment of council tax.  It incentivises these agencies with a portion of the seized assets, encouraging the abuse of those unable to defend themselves.",
