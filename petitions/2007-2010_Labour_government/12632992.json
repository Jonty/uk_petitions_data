            "background": "It is obvious now that Michael Martin was, like David MacLean, doing everything (at no cost to himself) to ensure that MPs expense claims should be withheld from the people who were funding the debacle.  That he used the government lawyers, at taxpayers expense, to do that was a disgusting attempt to keep his own abuses of the system under wraps.  Since he has now been found out he should be required to repay the costs of that action to the taxpayer.",
