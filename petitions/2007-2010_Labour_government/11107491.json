            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The proposed change to the law to prosecute clients of prostitutes is an attack on the human rights of men, and of the women who choose freely to sell sexual services. The existing laws that penalise trafficking and coercion should be enforced. The proposed law will make the lives of prostitutes more difficult and dangerous as prostitution will be driven further underground. Also the time of the police and courts will be wasted in unnecessary prosecutions, and tax payers money will be wasted. The police and courts should be focussing on the serious crimes of violence and theft that concern most voters. They should not be concerned with prosecuting those who perform sexual acts in private to the mutual benefit of those involved.",
