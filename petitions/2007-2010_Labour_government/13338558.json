            "background": "We would like our government to raise awareness of International parental abduction (only victims are aware),help us to secure legal aid/help for families torn apart by this crime and to offer abducted children impartial mediation and support away from the influence of the abducting parent.We would also like help to reach an agreement with other Hague countries to do the same.Currently some countries do not offer legal aid and can be seen as obstructive towards the left behind parent(as is our experience.We feel free legal help should be mandatory in these cases and that each central authority should interview the children away from the abducting parent and offer them support.Many children are led to believe terrible things about the absent parent and there is currently no system in place to care for the children or offer them advice.We believe this crime IS child abuse and should be treat as such.In our experience the abducting parent has not faced justice,but instead has been assisted by the central authority.We feel laws should put in place to promote contact with the left behind parent and to protect children from the hurt,confusion and dishonesty of parental abduction.",
