            "background": "Having recently retired from Government Service and noted commercials urging reduction of an individual's carbon footprint by reducing car travel by 5 miles per day. I have reduced my carbon footprint by at least 45 miles per day and the Prime Minister (Government) should recognise such contributions and make credits/payments available for use in respect of fuel costs to assist the elderly.\nAny failure to offer credits/payments will undoubtedly result in a suitable response from the electorate. We have given you and this country our lives, be grateful.\nWe are not comparing our service to that of the armed forces who more than deserve everything this country can give.\nJust enough to survive with a home, heat, light, food and a little bit over with which to LIVE.\nCivil servants have accepted lower pay increases, lesser conditions on the basis of our duty to the Crown and that compensation will be received with retirement.\nLet it be so. I have personally given this country, the Government and my Sovereign 42 years of my life.\nTime for payback.",
