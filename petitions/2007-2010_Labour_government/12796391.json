        "background": "In January 2009, Channel 4 announced that it was to axe the 24-hour live feed, which was available on E4, for the sixth Celebrity Big Brother series. E4 continued to broadcast live streaming for a couple of hours during the day, and overnight.\n\nFive months later, they confirmed that it would not return for the tenth regular series of Big Brother, which is currently ongoing. However, in a slap in the face to fans, they also axed the afternoon streaming on E4, meaning that the only live feed would be broadcast overnight \u2013 a time when housemates and viewers are sleeping.\n\nIt is a fundamental factor of the Big Brother format that viewers are able to watch 24/7. At the moment, the UK edition of the show is the only one in the world not to offer some form of 24-hour live feed.\n\nWe strongly believe that Channel 4 should restore the 24-hour feed as soon as possible.",
