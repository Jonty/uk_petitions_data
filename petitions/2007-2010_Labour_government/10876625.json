They have risked our money and our livelihoods for their greater gain.  Now they should be made accountable.\nThe Labour Government should INSIST that the financial institutes of this country take some of the responsibility for, and stand by, their actions and not allow them to repossess peoples homes and investments until such time in the future that we are out the other side of this crisis.\nIf you think the Labour Government should stand up to the financial institutes in this way then please sign this petition.",
