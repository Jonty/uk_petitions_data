            "background": "The alcohol content of wine has increased steadily over the years, to the point now where a typical bottle has an alcohol content of around 14%. This trend must be stopped.\n\nSetting such a limit will help to reduce binge drinking, its associated unsociable behaviour, and its health risks.\n\nLowering the alcohol content of wine to, say, 10% or 11% would be widely beneficial. The amount should be limited by law, and be implemented across the EU.",
