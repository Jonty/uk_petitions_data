        "background": "Here in the UK, we permanently seem to get a raw deal from europe.  We pay more into the pot than we take out.  We take on more immigrants than most other countries.  The british economy is totally unsustainable with its social expenses, and the uk population are being taxed to the hilt to pay for this.  I beleive that we could become an independant state and still benefit from free trade( pulling out of europe wll not stop other countries from trading with us).  Lets have a referendum once and let the nation decide because it has been 30 years since the last one.",
