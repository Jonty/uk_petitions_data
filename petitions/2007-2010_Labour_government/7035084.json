        "background": "David Irving was exposed by Judge Gray to be a deliberately fraudulent academic who \u201cqualifies as a Holocaust Denier\u201d. Nick Griffin leads the British National Party which foments race hatred. Oxford University is a place of careful scholarship and giving a platform to fraudulent historians or racists is entirely inappropriate and insulting to the ethos of the University and to those who strive to uphold it. There is no doubt that both Irving and Griffin will try to use their invitations to the Union to give respectability to their causes. Irvng and Griffin are entirely inappropriate speakers for a Free Speech Forum. The Union should invite the \u2018referees\u2019, not the \u2018players\u2019.",
