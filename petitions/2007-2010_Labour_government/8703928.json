The unprecedented levels of immigration are undermining our culture & heritage and creating division and tension between ethnic/religious groups and causing distress to the indigenous population against the wishes of the vast majority of the indigenous population of the U.K. \nTHERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH PUBLIC OR A REFERENDUM OVER THESE CHANGES AND ARE IN DANGER OF DESTROYING OUR CULTURE!!!",
