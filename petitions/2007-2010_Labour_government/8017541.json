For some people it may only be the time of year when they could spend their hard-earned money to buy something either for themselves or their loved ones.  Once Christmas is over, most if not all of us could hardly wait for the next payday in January. If companies would provide us a 13th month pay on top of our December salary, we could have something extra for our Christmas shopping and gift-giving as well as some savings until the next payday in January.  We could then focus our December salary for the usual expenses we incur like electic/gas, council tax, transport, etc.",
