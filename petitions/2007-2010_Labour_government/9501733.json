The Adversarial system benefits those who can present their case in whatever way benefits them best. The truth is irrelevant in such a system. the prosecution's case is what matters. \nThe adversarial system is the favourite of career criminals as the Jury can be coerced and intimidated by the system. Adversarial Law is a true \"Theatre of Criminals\"",
