        "background": "Over the last 12 months energy companies have increased their prices overnight supposedly in line with rising oil prices.  The price of oil has dropped considerably yet they are continuing to raise our bills.  If they are increasing costs due to oil prices rising, when the price of oil drops they should be forced to pass that reduction back to the consumer.",
