            "background": "As we have a government (supposedly) so committed to reducing carbon emissions why not subsidise rail travel and actually make a small effort to make it affordable to the masses. At the moment it will cost me \u00a3150 to travel to Edinburgh, almost twice the amount it will cost me to fly. We have a great network in this country and the labour government is allowing it to fall to pieces (just like a lot of other things). We could make rail travel a lot more affordable just like other European countries have done but instead we are wasting time and money trying to run it like a cheap (expensive) bus service. If only Gordon Brown would open his eyes for once (chance would be a fine thing). \nThey are obviously so dependent on  road taxes that this sort of option is impossible to them.\nAfter all they do have a war (unwanted) to win (lose).",
