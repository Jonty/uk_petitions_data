How are people supposed to travel to these surgeries when they have no car.How are the elderly and the infirm and people with kids supposed to get on a bus when they are unwell and in my case travel on 2 seperate buses for 8 miles to see a doctor when you feel ill.\nThis is another case of someone coming up with an idea without thinking it through from the users point of view",
