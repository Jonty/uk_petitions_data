Apart from benign uses of this service it also presents burglars the ability to specifically target vulnerable households in an area.\n\n192.com do not view this as a problem that is worth addressing as the service (which was introduced about 2 months ago) is proving to be very popular.  I believe it is likely to make an existing problem more widespread.",
