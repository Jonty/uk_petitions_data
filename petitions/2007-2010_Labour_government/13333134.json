            "background": "Due to the Government\u2019s vetting and barring scheme, which is due to be introduced October 2009, it is estimated that 1 in 4 adults will be required to register with the Home Office's Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA). This will range from parents who regularly drive children for sports or social clubs to those whose children are in a foreign exchange scheme.\n\nComplaints or concerns from colleagues or members of the public that fall short of prosecutions may be held on an individual\u2019s file by the ISA and will be available for viewing by any employer or voluntary group with which the person might work\n\nThis scheme is a disproportionate response that risks deterring volunteers.",
