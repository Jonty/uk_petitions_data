The Government response to our first ePetition ended with: \"It is notable that the present petition has attracted fewer than 300 signatories.\"  Until the Government PERMITS those most adversely affected by the issues in question to sign the petitions, it is unjust to comment that they have NOT signed it! In the Hirst ruling (right to vote) in the European Court of Human Rights, the Court said:  \"[The] removal of the vote... runs counter to the rehabilitation of the offender \u2026 and undermines the authority of the law as derived from a legislature which the community as a whole votes into power\" and there was no evidence that disenfranchisement helped prevent crime. The same concepts apply to the right to petition the Government. It would be simple to allow prisoners to make a written application for the Prison to add their name to the ePetition.",
