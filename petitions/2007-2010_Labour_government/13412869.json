        "background": "We ask the government to use some of its television advertising budget to educate road users about lane discipline, especially on motorways.\n\nIf the majority of road users were properly educated about the importance of returning to the left after performing an overtake manoeuvre, many traffic problems on our roads and motorways would be alleviated.\n\nAll to often do people believe in the  \"slow lane\", \"middle lane\" and \"fast lane\" fallacy, and it slows things down - a detriment to every other road user, not just those who understand lane discipline. \n\nThis is particularly important with regard to motorways, where motorway driving is not compulsory education for new drivers.",
