The government makes these easy responses rather than the more difficult task of responding to controversial or complex issues which people really care about. Show your country that you care and do us the decency of responding to petitions that we put effort into. Today this would only be approximately 30 petitions, so 'should' not take a lot of resource to do. Also show us the result and action taken on said petitions, please.",
