            "background": "The beliefs that people hold are something that should not in anyway be part of government concern Government should be completely secular in carrying out its responsibilities. So many people use religion purely to obtain what they see as an opportunity to gain access to a better education for their children. If all education was, as it should be, of a similar standard this would not be necessary. The main objection is that of the indoctrination of children at a young age into a simplistic fairy tale belief of how the World was created. Why are supposedly educated people in positions of power allowed to carry out this patently childish deception? We know that the Universe was not created as the book of Genesis would have us believe: without that basic concept there can be no Christian or Islamic religion. So why continue with the deception and implant it into our children who then, in so many cases as they become adult, have a struggle between the logical and that which is implanted in their minds so early in their lives? \u2026.It is quite disgraceful, and is only continued because it appears too difficult to disentangle it from all that man has constructed around religion.",
