        "background": "An important facet of any democracy is the split between the courts and government.\nRecent criticism of the SFO's decision to drop the investigation into the Saudi/ BAE bribery scandal by the High Court is not enforceable in any way. The government can ignore it, or introduce legislation to give themselves the right to block this and any future investigations whenever they see fit - without reference to anyone.\nWhenever the government - central/ local/ any branch (eg MOD) is criticised in the High Court, they should be forced to go back to court within 30 days to respond and state what led to the criticism and what they will do to ensure future actions do not repeat the action.",
