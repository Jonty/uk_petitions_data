        "background": "It is time that the UK recognises the status of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The UK has the biggest diaspora of Turkish Cypriots, and it is only fair we recognise it.\n\nDue to that the UK is a guarantor of independence, of the island, I do think that the hint of independence is increasingly diminishing. All these UN resolutions are going nowhere. I propose that the UK becomes the second state to recognise Turkish Cyprus, despite the EU's opinion also.",
