How long have we... the British public have our leaders in Parliament take advantage of our system and economy in what they are doing for this country? Are you indeed any different to the bankers who helped take this country into rescission? Now it seems you the MPs indeed are taking the British public into a depression!!!!\na full investigation should take place!",
