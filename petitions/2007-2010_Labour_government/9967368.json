            "background": "I think it is about time we the British public started to stand up for our rights as human being's and not taxed out of our vehicles that we rely on. I personaly own two cars one of which is a Mini but even the road tax has increased on this vehicle even thought is a low emission vehicle the other vehicle is a 4x4, which because of where i live i require such a vehicle and due to the nature of my work it is an essential part of owning a 4x4.( a roads inspector & snow plough/gritter driver ) I think as a nation of vehicle owners we might not mind so much paying high fuel cost's if the road pricing and road tax were abolished. coming from being a bus driver in the past i know that public service transport is very poor in the rural areas some buses running only once every two hours and sometimes only one bus a day in each direction which is of no use to man nor beast. so i think we would like this question answered why are we being taxed out of our vehicles and herded on to a very poor fourth rate public transport service. CHEAPER ROAD TAX OR ABOLISH IT COMPLETLEY",
