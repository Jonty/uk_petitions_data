            "background": "Education, education, education. Thats how 'New Labour' began, and certainly if they were identifying an area they were going to change dramatically, they found it rather quickly. The problem is that the reform was so radical that it totally overturned the tried and tested education system that had existed beforehand. This petition is to urge the government to see sense and curb this reform becasue at the moment the government are teaching the children and the teachers are just 'administering' Labour's classroom ideas. I say, put the reigns back in the teachers hands and stop pushing for results that will not come from the crumblig education system that we have today.",
