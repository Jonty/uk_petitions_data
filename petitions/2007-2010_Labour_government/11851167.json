            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Users of mains gas and electricity have the benefit of Ofgen regulating the industry. Users of bulk LPG will soon have the right to switch suppliers. But users of cylinder LPG and heating oil are often restricted to local suppliers, who fix prices between them, eliminating real competition. All sources of home heating fuel should be regulated and any profiteering by suppliers should result in fines on their profits. Rural fuel users off the mains network are being penalised, and prevented from connection to the mains by huge costs imposed by the big suppliers.",
