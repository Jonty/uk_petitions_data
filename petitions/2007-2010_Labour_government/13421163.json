            "action": "introduce legislation to ensure that public employees who are paid out of the taxpayer pounds taken from the working population of the UK are required to take out insurance to cover the fines and compensation that are ordered by the various authorities when a taxpayer funded employee is negligent or commits a criminal act, so that the taxpayer is not also liable for paying that compensation nor fines.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There continues to be a rampant air of disdain among taxpayer funded employees because they know that the law currently favours them so that when they commit a criminal act in carrying out their job any fine or compensation ordered will be paid by the taxpayer.  This situation encourages employees to act without conviction or honesty and MUST be curtailed.  Requiring them to take out AND PAY FOR their own indemnity insurance will ensure that they remain focussed and aware that come the time they are negligent or commit a criminal offence, they will be required to answer for it.  If not to the public employer (which is not happening at the moment) then it will be to their insurance company.  Better that than no accountability or reponsibility at all.",
