            "background": "The Prime Minister has recently backed a decision to replace Britannia with various other decorations, in the teeth of his Britishness credentials.\n\nBritannia is a symbol of Britain.  She is a Goddess who may well have associations with the Romans, but She goes back farther than the Roman invasion to the Keltic Goddess Brigantia of the Brigantes tribe of what is now Yorkshire, who Herself has parallels with many other Keltic Goddesses.\n\nIf the PM removes Her, he strikes, therefore, at the very heart of Britain; we therefore urge him desist.",
