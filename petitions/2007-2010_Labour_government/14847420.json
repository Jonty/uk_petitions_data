If passed, the amendment\nwill mean that religious prejudice against homosexuality will be able to find its way, quite lawfully, into sex and relationships teaching in such schools. The amendment has certain\nechoes of section 28 and it does a serious disservice to vulnerable young gay people. Furthermore, it detracts from the good provisions in the Bill regarding sex and relationships\neducation.",
