        "background": "The prime minister should, in my opinion, ignore the various other petitions which suggest alternatives to the current UK National Anthem. These suggestions appear to offer nothing in terms of relieving British citizens of the current arguably dreary, atavistic jingoistic, chauvinistic diatribe which has little or no musical merit.\nAlternatively the replacement of the current dubious Anthem with the adoption of the popular hit, of proven popularity: \"Itsy bitsy teeny-weeny yellow polka dot bikini\" would aleviate the boredom of the duty of our civic leaders attending tedious and/or pompous occasions. In addition it would send a message to the global community that we are a happy, modern polity, mature enough to dispense with ritual props of the State of an infantile \"Ruritanian\" character.",
