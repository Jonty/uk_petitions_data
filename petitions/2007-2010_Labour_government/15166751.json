        "action": "Support Animal Charities from National Lottery (Public) Money",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "When the national lottery was set up its legislation dictated that Animal Charities and Rescue centres - such as NWESSR - are not deemed good causes. \n\nHowever making films (by the UK Film Council) is designated as a valid use of money which is generated from the PUBLIC - by money placed onto the Lottery and in addition has been taxed on and is spent by people who would support animal charities. This requires the Government to see fit to support REAL good causes and not just such things as film making! (sorry \"the arts\" )\n\nIt is time the \"constitution\" of the national lottery grants system allowed Animal rescue centres to apply for grants, this may annoy a few \"luvvies\" and result in make-up shortages, but real lives will benefit from supporting animal charities rather than keeping someone occupied behind a Camera.\n\nHopefully HMG can see sense and sort this anomaly out, animal charities should be equally supported.",
