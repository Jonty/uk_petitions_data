It's the system that's wrong and whilst it's there for the taking people can take. Please petition this government to change the benefits system so that they can see the views of the working tax payer, before we become the minority in a broken Britain that has spent it's money on those with it's hands out and not on those who are getting their's dirty. Our days are numbered unless we respond.",
