            "background": "As a work based trainer/assessor I am concerned at the number of learners who have poor basic skills in numeracy and literacy. Surely this is a sign that schools are failing to ensure that children leave with even the bare minimum. \n\nIt should not be the responsibility of adult training providers or even employers to address this problem.\n\nThis topic has been the subject of much research and has yet to actually address the problem itself. \n\nChildren are being disadvantaged on a large scale due to these failings. \n\nIf you agree that basic skills should be addressed during compulsory schooling please sign this petition - lets give our children and the future of this country a chance.",
