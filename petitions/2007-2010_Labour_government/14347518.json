        "background": "Cold Weather Payments should be made available to all Registered Disabled and Pensioners (over 60's) and should not be means tested. The fact that people are working beyond retirement age does not necessarily mean that they can afford huge heating bills.I know of many people who just cannot afford to retire. Many over 60's still have a mortgage in our present financial climate. I know of several people who will miss out on these payments because their incomes are just a few pounds over the means test limit. Others with an income of just a few pounds less will receive Cold weather Payments. This does not seem to be a fair system.",
