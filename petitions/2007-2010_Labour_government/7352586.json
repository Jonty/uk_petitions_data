It will probably go underground but the bonus is that footballers wont be picked on pay but on ability once again which will turn it back into a real sport and you wont have football on tv all the time or all over the newspapers showing overpaid footballers behaving badly and setting a bad example. You also wont have to live in fear of Huga hoodie football fans beating you up.\nPeople will also maybe start paying attention to a real sport such as rugby?",
