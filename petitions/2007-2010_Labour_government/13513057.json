        "action": "accept the Competition Commission's advice to change planning rules so that individual supermarket companies cannot monopolise towns and cities, but to set the threshold market share well below 60%",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Situations in England similar to Inverness having three Tescos and no other supermarkets should never have been allowed to develop. A 60% market share is far too high a figure for planning restrictions to start however, as the company concerned would already have a market controlling position. Until a town or city has four large supermarkets owned by different companies, none of the existing owners should from now on be allowed to open another large store. These restrictions need not be applied to retail parks well outside town or city boundaries, as monopoly pricing there would encourage people not to pollute the environment by driving out of town to shop.",
