            "background": "The Conwy and Denbighshire NHS trust have reduced the staffing levels in postnatal care and no longer employ enough Midwives at Glan Clwyd Hospital to provide a basic level of service.The community midwives have been told that they are no longer to offer ANY post natal care to women.After giving birth you are your own.New mothers are being left vulnerable and alone by an NHS trust that covers some of the UK's most economically and deprived areas.You can go to the hospital but many new mums are so exhausted and on a steep learning curve that they may not realise there is a problem until its too late.Or they live in such a rural area that they cannot get to a hospital that is miles away.Community midwives are just that...the healthcare professionals who work within the community providing WOMEN LED post natal and ante natal care.They are now being made to staff the maternity wards at Glan Clwyd Hospital because the service is so poorly funded and NHS mangers feel that this is not a priority service.This decision puts lives at risk.",
