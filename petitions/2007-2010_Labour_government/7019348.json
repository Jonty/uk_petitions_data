IN AREAS ALL OVER THE UK PARENTS ARE GETTING TO THE STAGE WHERE THEY ARE FRIGHTENED OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND SCHOOL TEACHERS AFRAID OF PUPILS ASK THE POLICE SERVICE WHO GO OUT AND SEE CHILDREN BEHAVING BADLY THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE LAW OR PARENTS OR TUTORS.ITS A JOKE THE STATE OF OUR COUNTRY THAT THROUGH GENERATION AFTER GENERATION PARENTS AND SCHOOLS HAVE PUNISHED CHILDREN TO TEACH THEM RIGHT FROM WRONG ONLY IN EXTREEM CIRCUMSTANCES. IF MONITORED PROPERLY WE COULD STILL RAISE CHILDREN INTO WELL BEHAVED LAW ABIDING ADULTS JUST AS WE HAVE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. SO WE WOULD LIKE THE SMACKING BAN TO BE LIFTED BEFORE OUR COUNTRY GETS INTO A STATE OF DISPAIR.\nREGARDS MRS K LAMB.",
