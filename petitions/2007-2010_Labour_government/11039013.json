        "background": "It has been reported that a large number of people in the UK are sending money (amounting to thousands per week) to the Shabaab.  This group is responsible for very violent enforcement of Sharia law in Somalia, including the recent stoning to death of a 13 year old girl because she complained to the police of being gang-raped.\n\nThe Shabaab should be classed as a terrorist organisation and therefore people caught sending money to it should be arrested/deported.\n\nWhilst the UK is engaged in the global war on terror it cannot harbour people who fund such groups.",
