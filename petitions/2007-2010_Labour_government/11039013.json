This group is responsible for very violent enforcement of Sharia law in Somalia, including the recent stoning to death of a 13 year old girl because she complained to the police of being gang-raped.\n\nThe Shabaab should be classed as a terrorist organisation and therefore people caught sending money to it should be arrested/deported.\n\nWhilst the UK is engaged in the global war on terror it cannot harbour people who fund such groups.",
