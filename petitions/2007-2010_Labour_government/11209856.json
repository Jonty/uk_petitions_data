            "background": "It should be a human right for any adult to take any drug without fear of punishment. Drugs could be regulated as alcohol and tobacco currently are. This would have several advantages. The amount of organised crime would be reduced. Money that is currently spent on law enforcement would be saved. If the drugs were reasonably priced, the amount of crime currently committed to fund drug habits would reduce. The government could if it wished tax the consumption of drugs. The purity and quality of the drugs could be controlled.",
