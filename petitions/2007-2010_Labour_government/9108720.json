            "background": "Properly regulated red light districts where prostitues offered safe and affordable sex would reduce sex crimes. Workers would have regular health checks, and work in purposely constructed \"windows\" that are 100% hygenic and with a dircet line (panic button) to the police.\n\nSuch areas, if created with bars, adult theatre shows, sex shops, as well as the girls, and promoted properly would prove a great tourist attraction, as the Amsterdam model has proved.\n\nAll working girls would be doing so out of choice.\n\nIt works in Europe. We're part of Europe. It can work here.",
