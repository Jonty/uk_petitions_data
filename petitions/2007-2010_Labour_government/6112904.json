        "background": "with large corporates, in banking and retail, reporting ever more massive profits, it seems futile to encourage potential students from less wealthy families, to take on huge debts to obtain a university degree, without which they will never get past the HR departments of said companies and into jobs that pay more than the basic minimum wage. Wouldn't it make more sense for the government to force these companies to sponsor further education?",
