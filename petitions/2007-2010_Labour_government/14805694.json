They are what they purport to be: students who come from another country to study here because we have something to offer them. They and their associated visas should be re-designated as: Visiting Students, thus VSV (precedent set in Visiting Scholar) or Overseas Student, OSV. This simple action would project a true representation of the business of international students as opposed to the warped perceptions currently being broadcast.",
