            "background": "Over recent months the Police have taken an unfair if not openly hostile attitude towards Social Motorcycling Events. Most recently the Welsh National Motorcycle show, a wonderful family event was cancelled following pressure that the Police applied.\nThey did not even consult with the organisers so that any concerns could have been addressed.\nThe police should be there to ensure that peace loving people can enjoy events such as these, would this have happened at any other public event? A Football match perhaps? Of course not. \nI call on the Government to ensure that the Police respect our Civil Liberties and that they take the same proactive and supportive role as they would at any other social gathering.",
