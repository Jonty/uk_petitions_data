            "background": "Our education system is out-dated. How many revolutionary changes has there been in education the last two decades, in comparison to the social, technological and economical advancements during the same period. What use are humantities subjects if someone can barely read or write? what use is physical education without the educational aspect? We need to teach  children those skills needed in modern living, not a fountain of general knowledge - most of which they will fail to remember just a year after their GCSE's. Teach them how to lead a healthy lifestyle, teach them financial management, teach them social cohesion. Do not teach them the minute details of a past war, teach them the consequences and causes of current of social problems.",
