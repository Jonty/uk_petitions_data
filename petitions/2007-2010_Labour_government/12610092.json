            "background": "It's a binding principle that there should be no \u2018real cost\u2019 to student loans.   As such, the rate has always been set every September at or below March\u2019s RPI rate of inflation. The reason for this is to ensure that borrowing the money doesn\u2019t decrease students\u2019 purchasing power. \n\nYet, this year, we have deflation. March\u2019s RPI was -0.4%, but the government has said the student loan rate for the majority of outstanding loans will not drop to that.  Instead, those who started university after 1998 will only see their loans drop to 0% interest.   \n\nBreaking this principle is wrong.  Is effectively means student loan holders will be overcharged, as, while prices in general are dropping, their loan rate doesn\u2019t, so their purchasing power  diminishes.   While the difference is currently small, once a principle is broken, it is rarely fixed, and could cause huge damage in the future.",
