            "background": "At present, fathers who are married to the birth mother or who are named on a birth certificate are granted automatic parental responsibility. This means that the father has automatic rights to contact with the child. \n\nSome sufferers of Domestic Abuse are forced by the other partner to have their names added to Birth Certificates. They evenutally escape the abuse, only to have to suffer further when, because the other parent has Parental Responsibility, they are forced to keep the abuser in their life. They are forced to live a nightmare by being forced by court orders to send their children to spend time with someone with a history of violence. If the other parent stops contact for fear of the childrens or their own safety they risk custody being given to the other parent.\n\nLets stop the system forcing sufferers of Domestic Abuse to live in fear!!!",
