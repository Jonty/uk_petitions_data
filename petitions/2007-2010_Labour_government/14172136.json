            "background": "Currently there is absolutely no entry criteria to becoming a buy to let landlord or a freehold landlord, allowing not just the professional but the criminal, and the plain useless/lazy to also set themselves up in business. This lack of entry criteria across  both sectors has been compounded by the fact that belonging to any professional landlord membership organisation is voluntary. Acquiring any form of accreditation is also voluntary. Dr Julie Rugg's proposals for even the most basic of entry criteria, that of a simple licencing scheme seems to have been forgotten by the resistance to the government's proposals that built upon (and extended) her recommendations. To not have even one statutory basic entry criteria to meet in such a fragmented and 'voluntary' market is absolutely incredible. The private sector also doesn't have the equivalent national lobbying body that landlords do. The other thing to remember is that landlords usually choose to go into business - those of us that have to pick up the pieces when subjected to the actions (or non-actions) of a fraudulent or neglectful landlord, do not.",
