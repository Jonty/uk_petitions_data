We would like to see the government informing all parents of that right.  We would also like to see the government ensuring that the LEA inspectors of Home Educators are pro Home education and have a knowledge of the different ways in which Home education can be delivered by parents.  We also want it recognised that children vary in their abilities and that there is no way to gauge when a child will be proficient in any one area of learning.",
