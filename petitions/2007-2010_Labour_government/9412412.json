            "background": "*The Act of Settlement 1701 specifically discriminates against Catholics or persons married to Catholics from succeeding to the Throne. In fact, it also prevents people of Jewish or Muslim faiths - and others - from standing in the line\nof succession. This is clearly discriminatory, bigoted and an anachronism in the 21st Century and we call for its Repeal.(kindly reproduced from Mr P McGoldrick's original petition)\n\nIn light of the fact of Mr Peter Phillips and Miss Autum Kelly's nuptuals this May - it would be of benefit to the country as a whole that the Act of Settlement be repealed to stop people feeling like criminals in their own country. \n\nSectarianism is unfortunately an issue which is alive and well in this country in this century.",
