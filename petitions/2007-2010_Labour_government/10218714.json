            "background": "Red diesel is currently a lot cheaper than normal diesel.  There is no difference in product except for the Red dye.  It is illegal to use Red diesel at the moment on the public road.  Obviously fuel duty on normal diesel is not going to be reduced as there is to much tax being brought in from it, so why not bring in a licensing fee for carriers / hauliers / fleet users which they could pay a fee for which would then enable them to use legally Red diesel.  This would bring down costs for carriers etc... which whould then help bring some prices down again that have risen due to the higher transportation costs.  This to me is a common sense solution to helping the economy get on the move again.",
