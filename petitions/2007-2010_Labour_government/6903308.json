            "background": "The idea of the motorist being used as a cash cow is once again upon us and the excuse of safety is a myth. The introduction of 20 mph speed limit enforcement cameras is just another way of milking the motorist and will not do anything to curb wreckless or dangerous driving. The rate of road casualties will not be decreased by the introduction of 20mph speed enforcement cameras. Other methods should be used rather than resorting to the use of money making speed cameras.",
