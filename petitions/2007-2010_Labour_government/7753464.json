        "background": "The energy form nPower has this week increased electricity prices by 12.7% and gas prices by 17.2%. This is despite current wholesale prices being lower than 2 years ago, while prices charged to consumers are already more than 60% higher than they were in the same time frame.\n\nEnergy companies have failed to cut prices when their costs have dropped but never failed to pass on increases. It is apparent the free market does not work with respect to domestic energy prices and we contend that the government needs to regulate prices. Price competition in the domestic energy market is limited since all providers follow the leader on each price move.",
