            "background": "A condition of the National Education Grant (NEG) is that a school/nursery is not allowed to charge a top up fee if it accepts children using the NEG. As the fee is currently so low (\u00a33.10 per child) this does not provide sufficient funds for all private institutions to run an effective service. By allowing a top up fee, parents have a choice (the point of the NEG) and nurseries can provide the best possible service they can.",
