There would also hopefully be some government initiated studies and experiments.\n\nIt would cover a number of key issues surrounding cannabis legalisation such as percieved economic benefits, potential for a reduction in crime rates and or the potential for the increase of crime rates.\n\n-This study and the sources cited must not have corporate sponsorship.\n\n-The results of the study should be published openly.",
