This leaves no question as to why 20% of GPs break the law to ensure that their patients can have their prescriptions and 6% of GPs have paid for their patients prescriptions themselves!\nThe NHS was funded on the principle that healthcare is free at the point of use- not free if you have your \u00a37.20per item.\nIt has been evidenced that it will cost \u00a346m to scrap the scheme but this would be offset by savings in emergency care and admissions!\nI am sure that it Wales and Scotland can do this successfully there is no reason why England cannot follow suit!",
