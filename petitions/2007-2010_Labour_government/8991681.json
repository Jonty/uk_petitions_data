Thirteen have been awarded the Victoria Cross \n\n\u2014 About 43,000 Gurkhas died fighting in the two world wars \n\n\u2014 The first Gurkhas were recruited into the British Army in 1815 after the Victorians identified them as a \u201cmartial race\u201d, naturally warlike and aggressive. Gurkhas still carry into battle a traditional 18in curved knife, or kukri \n\n\u2014 The name Gurkha comes from the hill town of Gorkha, from where the nation of Nepal expanded \n\n\u2014 The motto of the Gurkha is: \u201cBetter to die than be a coward\u201d \n\n\u2014 About 28,000 Nepalese youths enter the notoriously tough Gurkha selection process every year to compete for just over 200 places \n\nSource: BBC \n\nAnd the Government continues to treat these brave and faithful people with discourtesy and contempt.",
