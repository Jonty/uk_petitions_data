            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "EMA is provided for those who continue with their education following the end of their compulsary stay at school until 16. At the current time, students whose parents earnings are under a certain amount are awarded either \u00a310, \u00a320 or \u00a330 per week, simply for attending college every day.\nHOWEVER, with current ecomomy issues and the problems every family is suffering at the current time, EMA should be extended to all students who meet acceptable attendance standards. Many parents may earn over the allowance band, but due to rising prices and fixed wages, they do not provide their children who have continued their studies with any money. Many of these students attend college every day and never miss their lessons, but yet are not awarded any money, simply the grades at the end of the year. It has been agreed by many that this is unfair conduct, as many students who DO receive EMA payments abuse the system, stamping their sheets on days which they have not attended college, while the students who do not receive the payments DO attend.\n\nTherefore, we ask that the payments are extended to all students, as we all need a helping hand during the (probable) hard times which are to come.",
