            "background": "Media companies often run highly lucrative competitions where viewers and listeners are enticed to try and win a prize.\n\nMany of these are rigged, unfair contests.\n\nEven those that are legal are a license to print money, because the price of entry to these competitions is usually a Premium rate phone or mobile tariff.\n\nWe argue that staking \u00a31 a time to enter a competition makes this a lottery, and a form of gambling which should require a gambling license.\n\nWe think any company that has run such a competition should pay a gambling tax on its earning. (ten pence in the pound is the standard rate) \n \nThis would address the unfairness of the Premium rate phone scams, and allow companies to make a fair tax contribution. The tax should be retrospectively applied.",
