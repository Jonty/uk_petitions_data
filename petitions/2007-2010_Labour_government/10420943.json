        "background": "A simple sticker containing tick boxes\ncycles 1 - 3 - list drugs given and time commenced would be a brilliant way of imrpoving resuscitation guidelines. Where I trained - this was an important element of resus training, but in practice, I have seen very few medics concentrate on recording their actions until AFTER resus. Like my idea for another sticker to record dressings - I could design this for a small fee and would like to suggest that this fits with saving junior docs time - at a time (resus) when time is of the essence.",
