            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We demand that weekly bin collections are returned to their weekly collection as it is totally unacceptable the amount of refuse being left on our doorsteps contravines not only Environmental Health Issue's but that of Health and Safety. We also require that a proper recycling initiative is also put in place and stop using the excuse \"that all plastics cannot be recycled\" as this usually means they won't pick up any plastics. We also feel that more education concerning recycling should be made widely available as the current situation is unacceptable.",
