            "background": "I believe that Politicians should be restricted to a maximum of Two elected terms.\n\nThis will help prevent the current failure of trust, it will make Politicians do more for their constituents due to the time period set.\n\nIt will also continually renew new blood and enthusiasm for the job, and remove the familiarity factor which makes the House too cosy, and a place for 'The old boys to fix things'\n\nIt will end the 'Meal ticket for life scenario' which creates a situation where the long standing MP's often do not bother attending Parliament or use it as a place to sleep.\n\nIt will generate interest in the re selection process allowing youth AND older persons a chance to stand for the position, it will remove the current cosy process  of allowing a small group of party members re selecting the same person because they believe the 'Good old boy MP' is their mate. \n\nFinally it might JUST might generate enthusiasm of the majority of young people that have never voted because they have no confidence in the mumbling bumbling current Houses of Parliament.",
