            "background": "Help bus operators that are suffering the effects of the global financial crisis. Many operators have seen a sharp decline in passengers due to people not shopping and less people commuting to work after loosing their jobs. The only increase in passengers is OAP (Free) pass holders which dont provide much income to the bus companies. Make it easier and pay the companies the full fare for each OAP that travels F.O.C on Britains buses. Many drivers are facing redundancy because the companies they work for cant afford to run the services that many OAPs rely on.",
