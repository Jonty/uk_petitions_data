            "background": "George Bush is a highly decisive character and his presence in Iraq is only tolerated by virtue of the Anglo-American occupation of that country.  Mr  al-Zaidi\u2019s actions were wrong in law, however George W Bush is seen by Countries other than our own as international felon and his presence was always likely to cause offence.  To parade the outgoing president at such a time was incitement. Muntazer al-Zaidi actions were calculated to insult rather than harm.  Therefore a custodial sentence is highly inappropriate.",
