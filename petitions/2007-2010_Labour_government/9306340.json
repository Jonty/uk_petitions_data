        "background": "\"A shake-up of the way major UK airports are run and economically regulated has been signalled following a damning interim report from competition chiefs\", AOL today reports.\n\n\"First, the Competition Commission (CC) laid into airport operator BAA saying its ownership of seven UK airports, including Heathrow, was probably anti-competitive and \"may not be serving well\" passengers' and airlines' interests.\"\n\nChanges in economic regulation, however should not be at the price of security -given the high airport centred critical incident rate, the petitioner is urging the P.M. to ensure that no corners are cut jeopardising air passengers when implementing any new changes. \"Reflecting today's realities\" in the words of the report, must include terrorist threats. Please don't forget this.\n\nThank you.",
