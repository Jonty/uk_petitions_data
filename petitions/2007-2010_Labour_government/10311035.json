It sends out a negative message to residents who are normally law abiding and contributes to preventing reporting of ASB in there neighbourhoods. It prevents a bond between local people and the Police and contributes to further resentment. It's not rocket science. Stop alienating road tax cheats and concentrate on the major companies such as Tesco who evade REAL taxes. Gordon,Get a grip.",
