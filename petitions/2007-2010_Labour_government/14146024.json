        "action": "Make it possible for people to canoe down any major river in England, using rivers as a right of way similar to Scotland.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In England, if you wish to canoe down a river, you must ask the permission of the landowner. Landowners often decline this, even if there is no possible harm that can come of it. We ask that the goovernment opens up England's rivers as rights of way or at least allow experienced canoeists or kayakers to paddle down all major rivers in the country, not just those designated in national parks and other exceptions.\n\nI think that it is an injustice to say that a river is closed to the public without good reason. Why not open rivers in a similar way to footpaths, bridleways and other rights of way?\n\nIf this was governed by an organisation such as the British Canoe Union it could be both safe and environmentally friendly.",
