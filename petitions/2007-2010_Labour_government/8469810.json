            "background": "The Premier League have announced that they are exploring the idea of playing a round of matches abroad. Such a move would demonstrate complete contempt towards club's loyal fans and the local communities which have, over the years, helped football clubs to flourish. The competitive integrity of the League would be reduced into the realms of farce as the title race and relegation issues could be decided on the luck of the draw. Sign this petition and urge the Prime Minister to lobby the Premier League and stop them from selling the soul of our national game.",
