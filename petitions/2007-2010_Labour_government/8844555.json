        "background": "Currently we are seeing advertising for Christmas starting as early as September or October.Which in my opinion is an utter disgrace and is nothing but commercial greed and the exploitation and abuse of a greatly loved and respected religious occasion.\n \nTherefore, why can't the Goverment at least consider bringing in a code of practice or legislation whereby,advertising for Christmas does not begin until the beginning of December. (Just like they do in many countries on the continent) Surely that's got to be a better solution, than the commercial greed fest we're forced to witness ever earlier, every year.",
