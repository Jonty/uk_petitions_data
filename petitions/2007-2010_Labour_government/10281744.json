            "background": "The RICS proposal for Stamp duty land tax\n\u2022 Slab tax system reformed to a two tier marginal tax system that reduces barriers to vast majority of homebuyers moving onto or through the market\n\u2022 No-one pays SDLT on first \u00a3150,000 of home purchase\n\u2022 2.5 percent marginal rate on the value of homes between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3250,000\n\u2022 5 percent marginal rate on the value of homes over \u00a3250,000\n\u2022 The thresholds for stamp duty rates should then be annually indexed, reflecting house price growth and inflation\n\u2022 Everyone purchasing a home up to \u00a31million would pay less stamp duty\n\u2022 Purchasers of the most expensive homes would pay more stamp duty. However, the increases are relatively minimal \u2013 the SDLT bill on a \u00a31.5m home would only be 8% higher in total (\u00a35,000 extra).\n\nInitially the RICS proposal will reduce Government revenue by up to 24 percent, but given the 40 percent rise in stamp duty revenue in recent years (up from \u00a34.6 billion in 2005/06 to \u00a36.45 billion in 2006/07) there is room for the Government to manoeuvre.",
