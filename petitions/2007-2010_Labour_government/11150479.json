            "background": "We are experiencing unprecedented times, however the cause is obvious to most of us, that is our over spending.  Our governments attempts to turn this around by reducing VAT to 15% is not going to work, in fact the belief that you can resolve the issue of debt by encouraging people to consume more is not right and will go no where in helping this great country turn round and realise what it needs most is to consolidate, take some time to pay off debts. Please please do not roll over and accept this governments sham attempt to right its wrongs, instead stand up and be counted and say NO to this short term nonsense measure, say yes to giving an income tax reduction that will motivate employees to work and choose to pay off their debts or spend elsewhere. Sign here please to ask the government to reconsider this policy and to hold a free vote in the House of Commons.",
