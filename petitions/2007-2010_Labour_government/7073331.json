            "background": "Many people are intimidated by this practice, which has become more serious due to it being hijacked by trouble makers. In some cases, the \"trick or treat\" is secondary to the Halloween celebrations, being used as a vehicle to support anti-social behaviour.   The fact that police forces have produced leaflets to display in windows, to say \"not here please\" is an indication that the practice is ill-used.  Then, of course, the leaflet itself may draw unwelcome attention. People go to such lenghts as sealing letter boxes and showing no lights; pretending to not be at home. This fear has no place in British society, and \"trick or treat\" is an imported activity. It should be made a statuary offence.",
