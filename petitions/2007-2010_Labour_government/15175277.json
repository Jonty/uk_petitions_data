        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is intended to end the constant loss-leading tactics used by supermarket chains on the sale of alcohol. In an age where \" binge drinking \" is regarded as a major cause of anti-social behaviour and several serious health issues, It is almost beyond belief that the loss-leading tactic has been allowed to continue for this long, the British public house is the only place where the consumption of alcohol is undertaken under supervision, yet they are being legislated and priced out of existence, an act that can only lead to worse problems in the future. The constant bombardment of advertising relating to alcohol sales by supermarkets, and the celebrities used in said advertising, i.e sports stars, hardly helps the situation either, we need to create a level field of play, with proportionate rewards for those seeking to assist in the tackling of the problems surrounding alcohol abuse, instead of ignoring one of the potential  instigators.",
