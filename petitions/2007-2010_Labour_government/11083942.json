            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Prior to the recent high cost of crude oil, the difference between petrol and diesel fuels on garage forecourts was negligible. The cost of crude has now slumped, but the difference between the two fuels at the pumps has been maintained with diesel costing around 12-14p per litre more than petrol. This has a big impact on inflation as transport and haulage companies are heavy users of diesel fuel. I think the oil companies are maintaining an artificially high price for diesel to subsidise the cost of petrol and to boost their profits.",
