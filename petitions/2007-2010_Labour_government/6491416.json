            "background": "Does the average person realise that when you put your child in a day nursery, or daycare facility most of the employees, the people responsible for your child's welfare and care, are in fact paid less than someone who works in a supermarket?\nYes, in the private sector a loaf of bread is considered more important than your child's welfare. That's because childcare is considered a vocation and not just a job. So if you want to work with children you really aren't worth much more than the minimum wage!\n\nMr Brown you have children, would you put your child in a day nursery knowing that the people looking after your child are paid less than someone who works for a major supermarket stacking shelves.\nPLEASE PLEASE SHOW US THAT YOU AS PARENTS AND CONCERNED CITIZENS VALUE A CHILD'S LIFE MORE THAN A LOAF OF BREAD. YES THIS IS BRITAIN AND NOT A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY I'M TALKING ABOUT.",
