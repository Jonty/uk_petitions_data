            "background": "It has now become more cost effective to drive to your local big shopping centre or supermarket like Tescos, than to walk around the corner to your local shop. This is causing more vehicle trips and is encouraged by free parking at large shopping venues. A tax on these parking places would reduce vehicle usage and greenhouse gases and also ensure that parking at somewhere like Tescos is as costly as those charges forced on the motorist in town centres.",
