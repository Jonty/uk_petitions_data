            "background": "The recent increase in fuel duty by 2p per litre has led to most fuel prices being quoted above \u00a31 per litre.\nFor hauliers this is a particular problem as they already operate on such tight profit margins.\nFor the average family, the cost of filling up a family car has increased by more than \u00a310 per tank.\nTherefore, in order to save many hauliers from going out of business and to protect our transport infrastructure, we the undersigned would like to see fuel duty cut to ease the pressure on the public as a whole and to protect our economy.",
