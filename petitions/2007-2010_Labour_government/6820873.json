        "background": "\"over the years thousands of women have been imprisoned in the United Kingdom because they were not able to pay fines imposed upon them for not having a TV Licence. Almost all of these women were on benefits and around half of them had dependent children\" CAB 2003\n\nCustodial sentences are not given for television licence evasion, but for non-payment of fines imposed by the courts for licence evasion. (Current 2007 maximum \u00a31,000). If a fine remains unpaid, the courts may resort to imprisonment. \n\nIt is especially important for low income groups, that non payment of a TV licence fee IS reclassified as a civil offence recoverable through the small claims process only as a last resort where other payment mechanisms or schedules have failed.\n\nFor all those on low incomes, the tv licence fee is an unmanageable expense and arrangements for paying the TV licence fee in instalments (6 months in advance) is unreasonable.",
