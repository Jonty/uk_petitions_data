Fans wuuurldwide have been quoting The Dood ever since, and this beloved character has gained a cult following everywhere.\n\nIt is time The Dood (as Bridges' character prefers to refer to himself) was given the neccesary means for neccesary means for a return in all his Doodness. While no-one can coerce the Coen Brothers to return to ground they feel is fully covered, there is no reason why His Doodness could not be given 4-5 more cases to unravel on the American HBO channel, possibly the only place that he could fully express himself outside of movies.\n\nSo vote Dood in 2008. Let's let HBO and Bridges know that the demand is there. Another 10 years without Lebowski would be very un-dood.",
