Many of these people are ex Armed Forces/survivors of two world wars and other conflicts. Is this any way to treat these people? when other nationalities who couldnt care less about Britain and its people, can enjoy there native country's full pension out of our treasury's coffers while they live among us! Canada respects her Majesty the Queen, her head being on their coins as ours. Time to give our ex pat pensioners the pension they deserve instead of insulting them with a pittance that does not pay the rent for a simple single apartment! \nLETS DO THE RIGHT THING AND GIVE THESE PEOPLE THE ASSURANCE OF A LIVEABLE PENSION INCOME IN THEIR TWILIGHT YEARS,THEY DESERVE IT!",
