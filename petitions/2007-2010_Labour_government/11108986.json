Engines made within the last 5 years also come with diesel partical systems, which remove the soot particles created with the combustion of diesel resulting in these cars being far more environmentally friendly and less harmful to health.  Also, all frieght distribution and supermarket delivery vehicles use diesel fuel, so this tax affects our everyday costs for food, etc.",
