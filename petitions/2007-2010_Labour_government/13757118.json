            "background": "The Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has recently suggested that the \"Heads I win, tails I'm bailed out.\" status afforded to large banks removes what would be the most powerful check on their excesses \u2013 the fear of failure.\n\nThe need to use Public Funds to rescue such Banking organisations recently has severely dented the UK's financial standing.\n\nHe proposes that banks should be split into \"Utility\" (domestic banking) and \"Casino\" (investment banking) arms, with the latter implicitly having no guarantee of future state support.\n\nAlthough a very sound proposal, this is legitimately limited in scope, as it comes from the Bank of England, to the Finance Sector.   \n\nA more generic approach that could be taken only by the government of the day would be to put limits on dependence on all Private Sector Organisations, such that none is \"too big to fail\"",
