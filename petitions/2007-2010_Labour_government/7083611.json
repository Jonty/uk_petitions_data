            "background": "CCHR is a Scientology front group, its main aim is to deny the Public access to Psychiatric Care and denegrate Psychiatric Professionals, the aforementioned exhibition is currently touring the world and contains images and text making outrageous claims about the acts and practices of psychiatrists. a perfect example of the effects of these images is John Sweeneys famous shouting match with a representative of the Los Angeles Scientology Celebrity Center chief Thomas Davies. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjlo4u_8g60\nif this is the effect this exhibition has on a journalist with experience in war reporting what chance has a member of the public with no knowledge of Scientology or CCHR? i believe this organisation and its exhibition is exploitative and actively seeks to deny ill people medical attention and possibly putting the general public at risk.",
