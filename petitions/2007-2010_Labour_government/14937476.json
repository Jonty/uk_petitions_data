            "background": "Since UK Sport formed the governing body UK Athletics in 1998, standards in Track & Field Athletics have declined dramatically.\n\nTo mask this decline, UK Athletics (UKA) prevent many of the best British athletes from competing at major international championships. \n\nGreat Britain will not be sending a team to the world cross country championships in 2010 to spare UK Sport's, and the Government's blushes.\n\nIt is a policy which breaks the hearts of British athletes who have dreamt of representing their country at an Olympic Games, and in other international competitions from a young age. British athletes who have done everything asked of them to gain selection for these hugely important championships are dismissed, and our country is not represented.\n\nThe young athletes watching enthusiastically from below, are seeing the glass ceiling being lowered year on year, and drop out. Standards continue to decline.\n\nThe sport of Athletics must be returned to the people who care about it. The volunteers who work within the clubs, and their governing Association, The Amateur Athletics Association (AAA's), with the Queen as its Patron.",
