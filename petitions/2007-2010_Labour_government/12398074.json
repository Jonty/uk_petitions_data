        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The removal of Empty Property Relief (EPR) is doing great harm to all sectors of the commercial property industry in this country. Buildings are being demolished and property companies are being placed in financial difficulties. Many property organisations are having difficulty staying within their banking covenants, which in turn is putting pressure on the banking sector, as loans become toxic. The government should help all types of property owners across the sector especially, in view of the deepening recession, by extending the length of the Empty Rates Void Period to twelve months, before empty rates need to be paid. The extension of the void period to twelve months would be of particular benefit to retail and office premises which currently are only granted a three month exemption.  These sectors are being hit particularly hard at the moment made evident by the \u2018Bombsite Britain\u2019 landscape.",
