            "background": "Westbury swimming pool should be saved for the nation and local familes and schools to use. It was gifted to the people of Westbury by the Lavertons, a local mill-owning family. It is beautiful and historic being one of the first public pools in constant use since 1897.It has a ghost called George, a past janitor at the pool. It is a warm 20 metre pool ideal for arthritic conditions and so loved by the elderly and great for the family and local schools. It has great patronage making a small profit each year. It must be saved for the nation and local use.\nThe newly-created unitary Wiltshire Council has identified an 'overprovision' if swimming pools in west Wiltshire. They are also doing an audit with the aim of reducing their leisure budget by 25%. Westbury pool may well be in their sights for closure whatever they claim.\nSave this pool for future generations as it is UNIQUE.",
