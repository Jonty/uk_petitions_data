            "background": "The banking sector, which the UK economy is dependant upon, has suffered a recent down-turn, resulting in the nationalisation of several financial institutions.  Britain is already hugely respected for its contribution to media, thanks largely to the work of the BBC.  The public acquisition of Yahoo! Inc. would further strengthen Britain's position in an information age.\nWe believe that the UK's economic strength in the next 50 years will be defined by a bold move like this.  Yahoo! Inc.'s current share price of less than $20 presents an opportunity the Prime Minister should not ignore.",
