            "background": "Since 1950 the percentage of registered voters who have cast a ballot in a general election has fallen from almost 85% to just over 60%. Although there was a small increase in 2005, this is still far short of producing a truly democratic result. By making polling day a bank holiday it would raise the profile of the election and encourage otherwise disenfranchised voters to participate, increasing turnout and providing a stronger mandate to the new government.",
