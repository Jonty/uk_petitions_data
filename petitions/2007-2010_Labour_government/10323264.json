        "action": "scrap the present road tax system and its proposed amendments, and replace it with VEDOF: \u2018Vehicle Excise Duty On Fuel\u2019.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Under VEDOF a small percentage charge will be levied on the amount of fuel motorists buy at the pump. VEDOF means that the more miles you drive, the more fuel you buy, the more road tax you will pay, and the less miles you drive, the less you will pay. If your vehicle has a large inefficient engine you will pay more in road tax for every mile you drive and if your engine is small and efficient you will pay less - that\u2019s fair.\nVEDOF will give every driver and business the financial incentive to change their driving behaviour - the incentive to drive more fuel-efficient vehicles, the incentive to use alternative transport, the incentive to be greener.\nThere will never be a good time to introduce an extra tax on petrol, but VEDOF is fair - it hands control of road tax back to the driver and offers them financial reward for good environmental behaviour.\nVEDOF is fair. VEDOF makes sense for the environment. Please support this petition.",
