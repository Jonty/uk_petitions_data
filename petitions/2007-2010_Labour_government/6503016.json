        "background": "The pay gap is a rip-off equivalent of men getting paid all year and women working for free from October 30th. \n\nWith women working full-time paid 17% less an hour than men on average, women\u2019s work is being discounted scandalously.\n\nProgress on the pay gap has stalled and we need new, stronger action from Government. We need:\n\nTransparency: Mandatory pay checks for all organisations or require organisations to publish pay information in annual reports.\n\nProtection: Each work place has a statutory representative to make sure health and safety standards are met. We need the same to ensure equality too. \n\nLevel playing fields: Tackling long hours and increasing flexibility at work, including at senior positions would enable women and men to compete on a level playing field. \n\nLet women stand together: Allow group actions supported by unions so that the burden is not on individual women to speak out.\n\nFunding: The Government should clear up its own backyard and fund equal pay deals for women in the public sector.\n\nSimplify the law: Equal pay cases are harder to take than other discrimination cases, meaning women can\u2019t get justice. The Government must end these unfair anomalies.",
