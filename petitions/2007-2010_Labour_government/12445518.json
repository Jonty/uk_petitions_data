        "background": "My son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes three years ago now.  Until then he was making a very good living driving his lorry, the only thing he ever wanted to work at since a child.  He passed his HGV 1 test when he was still only 21, he is now 36.\nOnce diagnosed his HGV license was revoked immediately and he has been in financial difficulties ever since.\nHe has never once had a 'hyper' in the last three years of his condition, so is still very capable of pursuing his lifetime dream. \nMy petition hopes that the government will reconsider this stance on HGV licenses and instead, allow controlled Type 1 suffers to continue to earn their living, doing what they do best.  After all, how many sufferers of other conditions are still allowed to drive?",
