            "background": "This petition is to aid our overstretched NHS in the wake of a severe increase of immigration. All immigrants must pay an NHS contribution for one year before having access to free health care. During the year they are making their contribution they must take out private health insurance if they are to receive medial care. This will stop immigrants entering the country to simply take advantage of free health care and thus free up more resources for contribution paying citizens.",
