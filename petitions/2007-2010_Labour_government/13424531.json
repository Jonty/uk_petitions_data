            "background": "Many citizens in this country make significant contributions to the wellbeing and security of this Country; yet in return they are often treated with great injustice by the Government. Many citizens can cite examples when the Government has either acted or concealed criminal activity, together with the resulting harm caused both to individuals and to the greater wellbeing of this Country. The Alan Turing petition has established a precedence for such cases; it is therefore fundamentally unjust and undemocratic for the Prime Minister\u2019s ePetition team to reject similar petitions. Alan Turing and many others were prosecuted according to the law, as much as we now regard that as flawed and wrong. Yet the ePetition team will reject similar personal cases notwithstanding that the law as it stands may have been breached and disregarded by Government. Alan Turing is well known for his contributions but his celebrity status is not just grounds for the Prime Minister\u2019s ePetition team to reject other petitions of similar injustices.",
