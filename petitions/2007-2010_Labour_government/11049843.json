            "background": "Following the recent story in the news about \"Baby P\" and the injuries, abuse and trauma he experienced, social services and the medical services failed to do their jobs to the best of their ability. What is even worse is that all of the social services team involved failed to get sacked from their jobs. They played an important part in this little boys abuse as much as his tormentors. The Government needs to prevent this and help children at the early stages, not when it is too late.",
