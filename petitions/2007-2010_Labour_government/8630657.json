        "action": "Backing to build a correctional facility for youths (16-21)",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Our facility will be like no other, taking in youth offenders that are overcrowding our already congested prisons and we will half the costs that the government are currently paying out for youth prison sentences. The facility will promote methods of rehabilitation used in National Services and the armed forces today, when offenders are in the facility they will be encouraged to give up smoking, and counselling sessions will be a must. They will be an physically ardouous and mentally challenging daily routine. As proven in the armed forces these methods can be dramatically life changing. \nWhen offenders leave they will get the opportunity to seek employment, their attitudes, punctuality and most of all, the respect for others will be vastly improved and re-offending should be at a minimum, We do need donations and support for this project from everybody in the UK that feels the young offenders in our community are ruining your quality of life. Please vote and be prepared to help.",
