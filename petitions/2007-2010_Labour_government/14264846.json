            "background": "Faith in politics and our system of democracy is badly shaken in this country following the expenses scandal, the Iraq war 45 minute claim, the failure to regulate the banks and the failure to protect our troops to name but four.\n\nIt is proposed to empower the electorate of this nation to positively register an objection to the current choice of leadership by including an option to express a lack of faith in all the candidates presented.\n\nIt is hoped that obtaining such information would spurn us to take a long, hard, honest look at ourselves and our existing systems of government and in so doing add to the democratic process.\n\nDemocracy only works if there is a viable choice available for the majority of the people to vote for.\n\nDemocracy does not work when the electorate feels forced to choose between the lesser of broadly unsatisfactory options. \n\nAs a democratic nation we should be actively exploring if this is the situation that has arisen so that we can consider doing something about it.\n\nIt will incur no significant additional cost to add an 'abstention' option onto the ballot paper.",
