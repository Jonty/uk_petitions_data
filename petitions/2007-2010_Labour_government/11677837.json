        "background": "It seems to me that this is blatant discrimination against these workers; surely there can be NO QUESTION AT ALL that EVERYONE doing a specific job is entitled to the same pay and conditions as everyone else.  The cost of living is the same for everyone living in this country; why, therefore, should anyone be expected to accept a lower standard of living just because he/she is not a British citizen?  This situation is also a very potent factor in the current (Jan/Feb 2009) furore over jobs in power stations, etc., not being offered to British workers.",
