We've all witnessed the stripping down of identity and watched the cancer gradually set in.  There has been nobody representing the ordinary decent citizen for many years now. We are all so frightened to speak our minds for fear of being labelled some sort of 'ist'!! After Noel's recent comments about 'broken Britain' I think he would be the ideal candidate to run this country......I'm not sure how he would feel about this, but who knows, we might even learn how to smile again.",
