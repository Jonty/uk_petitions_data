        "background": "The situation currently in the uk in as much as the amount of illegal immigrants are concerned is clearly out of control.\nTo stop all immigration for a period of ten years would; enable the system to recover from what appears to be overload.\nThe current influx of immigrants is clearly unsustainable. Housing employment and social structures such as the NHS are clearly stretched to breaking point.\nThe UK is a relatively small island.It will soon be over populated. What quality of life will future generations enjoy if the current situation is allowed to contiue without controls and proper policing.\nIf you agree with the points raised and consider them valid and reasonable sign the Petition.",
