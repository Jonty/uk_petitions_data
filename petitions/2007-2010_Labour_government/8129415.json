            "background": "We are all paying far too much for oil, gas, and electricity. Because Power Stations use Oil and Gas as fuels,\nwe are held to ransom by the oil producing countries.\nAllright - go ahead with Nuclear power, but let's get our coal mines re-opened and start using our own coal reserves instead of paying other countries who sell it to us at greatly inflated prices. We have the technology to use Carbon Capture to isolate the C02 which is the only arguement the environmentalists can use. \nThe price of coal is rising, so let's make use of that, and at the same time, produce our own energy for less, whilst boosting the number of jobs.",
