            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Motorists pay to use the roads, and so should cyclists. The Highway Code specifies that drivers should give cyclists a the same amount of room on the road as they would give a car, thus cyclists take up the same amount of road-space as cars, ans so should pay as much tax. \n\nMoreover, cyclists should be bound to displaying registration plates similarly to motorists. I have seen accidents caused and nearly caused by cyclists in my short time driving, usually as a result of cyclists pulling out without signalling, and ignoring red lights. Not only does this endanger pedestrians, but if a motorist were to hit the cyclist, the motorist would need serious therapy.\n\nGreen people might argue that cyclists deserve a tax break because they aren't polluting the environment, but cyclists burn energy similarly to cars: their increased demand for food isn't great for the environment.",
