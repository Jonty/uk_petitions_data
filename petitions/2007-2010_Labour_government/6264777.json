        "background": "It can come as no news that the use of umbrellas in crowded city streets is an anti-social act. It increases the area covered by an individual considerably, and more often than not does nothing to increase pro-social behaviour (i.e. respect for other pedestrians). Thus the undersigned wish to request the act of using an umbrella in metropolitan areas be made illegal. The use of shooting sticks or umbrellas at the Open need not be covered as this behaviour nearly always occurs in open spaces.",
