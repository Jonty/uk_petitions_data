            "background": "Too much wate is being sent to landfill sites and eventually there isn't going to be any space left. Would you like to be living next to a landfill site?\n\nBy having a limit of 4kg per person (the average being 5kg)more people will recycle as no one would want to pay the fine.\nThis is not a huge or difficult proposal to ask from people. Hopefully by doing this we will be able to stop climate change and save our natural resources. Not only that, but by having a per person limit, it will be much fairer than a per household limit as some families may contain up to 8 people compare to a couple of 2.",
