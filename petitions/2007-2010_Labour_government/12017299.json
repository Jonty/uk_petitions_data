            "background": "This petition aims to change the U.s.p.c.a animal welfare laws in N.Ireland to match the welfare laws of the R.s.p.c.a in England. U.s.p.c.a officers in N.Ireland want to be able to rescue more abused and neglected animals. They cannot do this at present due to the animal welfare laws in N.Ireland. This results in them having to walk away from thousands of abused and neglected animals every year because their basic needs of food, water and shelter are being fulfilled regardless of the conditions of the shelter, the quality of diet and general health and mental state of the animal.",
