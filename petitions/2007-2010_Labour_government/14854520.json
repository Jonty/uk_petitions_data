        "background": "FSCS Levy\n\nIt has come to our attention that due to the failure of Pacific Continental securities, Square Mile Securities and Keydata the debt is some \u00a370 million and it has been stated that the cost sf this debt will be falling to investment intermediaries.\n\nWe are astounded that due to the failure of these companies because of   general incompetance, over trading and poor management that the investment intermediares have to \" bail these companies out\". Not only this but you expect the levy to be paid within 30 days\n\nMost intermediaries will have no dealings with these companies in any format.\n\nThis will force many small business to close with valuable employees joining the unemployment queue and professional\nfinancial planners unable to provide advice. My understanding is that you are looking to support the small business community?\n\nYou can't expect to steal our hard money to pay for the failings of others, can you?\n\nWe require a full formal review of your process and policy in relation to this matter.\n\nThis is an urgent matter",
