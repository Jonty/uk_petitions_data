        "background": "I would like to ask Gordon Brown to make a law to stop firms trading in Britain ripping off the British public with unfair prices and charges, Especially the likes of travel companies and airlines, Why should the price of a holiday or a flight double or treble in price because of school holidays, This is a total rip off and discriminates against families who would like a holiday but can not afford these high prices, Obviously we are getting ripped off across the board by firms because the government let them do it, America stamp down hard on rogue trading because they care for their citizens, Life is hard enough in Britain without all of these rip offs.",
