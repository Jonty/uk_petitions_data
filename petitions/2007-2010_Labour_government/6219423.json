        "background": "Since devolution, Scottish MPs have been able to vote on matters in Westminster which do not affect their constituents-the so called Midlothian question-and this is unfair. English tax payers have largely funded a \u00a330 billion block grant to scotland for their schools, roads, care homes and for cancer drugs not available in england. Scotland also receives \u00a31500 more per head than england in funding. The \u00a32 billion required by the SNP to fund free university education in scotland will be largely paid for by english tax payers. This all has to stop. The SNP wants independance so lets have a referendum in england to end the Union with Scotland, give it its independance and spend english tax payers' money to help them.",
