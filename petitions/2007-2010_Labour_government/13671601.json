            "background": "A better way would be for the government to give every British citizen a good c are service would be a card to use as a pay and go system to pay for there hospital treatment that way people would receive a good standard of service and therefore would be seen and dealt with by consultants and doctors nurses e.t.c... quicker!\n\nFor those whom have problems they get extra put onto there cards and if not used the government cant take back that credit of say for example \u00a35,000 person per year.\nAnd an extra \u00a31,000 to help for every problem you may have like Diabetics, Cancer, Asthma e.t.c! \n\nYet if you need more money its down to yourself and family to find the remaining and that's the way the government should go forward with medical care for the country.\n\nSo for example somebody of the age of 18 may not need to use there card for 10 years that means by then they would have accrued \u00a350,000 on there card and may need to use it later on in life.\n\nBut all under 18's are free of charge like the NHS is at the moment this would then be fare to all.",
