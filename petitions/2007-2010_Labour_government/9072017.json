            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Well i for one am tired of whitehall and our local councils draining our financies under the guise of doing this country a service. I would rather we removed anyone who financially abused our system and are paid higher than the prime minister. \n\nIf Tony and Gordon can live on \u00a360,000 then so can everyone else. I have heard some MP's comment on the number of hours they have to do but i would always be able to find someone on less than them financially who do more hours and travel more, so in short i ask to remove these drains on the tax payers money and cap public sector pay for any \"fat cats\" in government and council employment.",
