            "background": "As we all know, at the start of the next financial year, the government will impose a 50% rate of income tax on high earners. This has already played a part in driving big businesses away from our shores and will stifle aspiration and future economic growth and will inevitably lead to an overall loss in tax revenue for the government. It is time the government stopped its lurch to the left and followed the principles that reinvigorated the party in 1997.",
