        "background": "The latest Communication Bill to be unveiled threatens to create a \"Super Database\" which contains records of all phone and email communication sent in the UK. Not only is this an atrocity to the privacy of individuals, but it's a threat to individual security. \n\nBased on the Government's recent carelessness with sensitive information, allowing more information to be stored about us is most undesirable. The new measures, put through on the guise of \"National security\", is another attempt to infringe on our right to privacy. \n\nIt can be said that those who do no wrong need not fear. But those who idly sit by and have their civil liberties stolen from them are doing wrong by their inaction. I would urge you to sign.",
