Gordon Brown your useless and are dictating britain get out nobody want's you in power.\n\nLabour are useless look what they are doing to this country. Allowing Muslims to have sharia courts in this country. We don't want it get them all out make them pack their bags and never set foot on british land ever again.\n\nThe goverment is trying to force islam on everybody. This religion is trying to become the one world religion.\n\nGod will destroy man for his wicked acts believe me. Man won't get away with it. No matter what they say, what they do they can't take away the christian faith or jewish faith our God is the true living God. And that is the end of the matter.\n\nHe ends the story he is in control. Not man and his evil schemes. \n\nIraq and Afganistan are not our responsibility. Get the troops out now!!!!!!!!!!",
