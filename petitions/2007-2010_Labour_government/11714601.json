This religion is trying to become the one world religion.\n\nGod will destroy man for his wicked acts believe me. Man won't get away with it. No matter what they say, what they do they can't take away the christian faith or jewish faith our God is the true living God. And that is the end of the matter.\n\nHe ends the story he is in control. Not man and his evil schemes. \n\nIraq and Afganistan are not our responsibility. Get the troops out now!!!!!!!!!!",
