            "background": "The proposed Severn Barrage would have the capacity to generate 8GW of electricity during peak flow. 2GW on average. This could replace two or three nuclear plants. It would have a long service life, in its lifetime it would prevent tonnes of Carbon Dioxide from being produced. This plan should not be delayed it should be executed without delay. Tidal power (especially of this scale) is inherently predictable, which is one of the drawbacks to most renewable sources.\n\nWind turbines could also be built along it's length to further increase output.\n\nAdditionally it could carry a railway line, saving a long detour and creating a new strategic and economic link.",
