        "background": "A restricted moped is more dangerous than having a derestricted one. I ride a restricted moped, I have no choice being 16. I get dangerously over taken beeped at sworn at and in some cases nearly run off the road. If a moped is restricted to a more reasonable speed, 50 would be ideal, it could keep up with the flow of traffic therefore making it safer. Other drivers wouldn't get wound up, angry, frustrated and ultimately more dangerous. Looking at the implications if this law was changed, a more stringent CBT would have to be made. This could make 16 year olds better drivers. Overall, the roads become safer, the drivers become better and everyone benefits. I propose mopeds should be restricted to 50mph, currently, they are allowed on roads with a 50 mph speed limit so it makes perfect sense to enable them to stick to the speed limits. If you were a police officer, would you stop someone doing 20mph under the speed limit? Of course you would. This is what happens due to the 30mph restrictions but the permission to use 50mph roads. This law is a contradiction to another law, something has to be done.",
