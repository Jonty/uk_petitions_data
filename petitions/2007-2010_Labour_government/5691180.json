American Pit Bull Terrier, English Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Bull Mastiff, Doberman Pinscher,German Shepherd, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Rottweiler & Japanese Akita\n\nThe law came into force on July 1st and will lead to the unnecessary destruction of over 20000 dogs.\n\nMore emphasis needs to be placed on education of owners and preventing dangerous people owning the animals, not banning responsible owners from having them\n\nOutright bans have not worked in other countries and have led to criminal activity involving certain breeds, being driven underground. Taken from ANVIL WEBSITE\n\nWe also urge the British Government not to introduce similar laws in the UK",
