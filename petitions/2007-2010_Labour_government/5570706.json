        "action": "Compel Investigation (Under Civil Contingencies Act 2004) into Unreliability of Emergency Backup Generators",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Reports of Unreliability (including allegations of sabotage consistent with Stage 3 of the IRA \"Garland Plan\") have variously been made since 1981.  \n\nIn August 1997 Kent Police Authority called for report but their Chief constable failed to comply and Jack Straw refused to compel inquiry.\n\nSince then we have had serious backup failure incidents in the nuclear industry (The four billion pound nuclear clean up at Dounreay for example)and many failures at NHS Hospitals (Including one leading to death of a child in ICU at Guys and three at new PFI Hospitals).\n\nJohn Reid, in spite of the matter being transferred to him by Tony Blair, failed to sign a decision whether or not to compel inquiry.  \n\nReid was sent a detailed report which also argued the methods of alleged sabotage used.\n\nHow close and on how many occasions has the UK come to a Chernobyl (due to failure of backup power during emergency shut down) ?\n\nNever mind ID schemes to combat terrorism.  First ensure that we don't have to evacuate the country for three centuries due to just ONE saboteur (who Kent Police have refused to record crime complaints against for two decades).",
