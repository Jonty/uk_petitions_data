            "background": "Aspartame is the name for an artificial, non-saccharide sweetener, aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester; that is, a methyl ester of the dipeptide of the amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine.\n\nAdding the label \"With Sweetners\" is still not enough to ensure the safety of the public from aspartame.\nThe trend of patients with brain tumors and various problems has risen greatly over the same time period that aspartame was introduced. Not enough is being done to improve the quality of our food, diet drinks are now more commonly found in Tesco rather that drinks with real sugar, it is alarming that the price to produce these diet drinks are so cheap yet very un-natural, customers are mis-lead.\n\nThe following is quoted from an interview with Rebecca Kang from Singapore:\n\n\"What is the limit for safe aspartame consumption?\"\n\"None. No human, nor any animal, should intake methanol at any dose at any time - ever.\"",
