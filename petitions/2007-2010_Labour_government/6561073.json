Whilst some needed changes were introduced, considerably more harm was done.\nThe new era of spin, misleading information, draconican civil liberties policies, mass uncontrolled immigration.\nWe the people of the UK call for the new PM to look in depth at the harm done to the very fabric and essence of our country, and call for him to abolish many of these changes that have been allowed to happen.\nThe government exists by the people and for the benefit of the people, and no-one else.",
