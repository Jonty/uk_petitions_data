        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This experiment hasn't worked.  The 24 hour licensing laws are simply bringing Britain's public services to near breaking point.  NHS A&E departments, Ambulance Services, the police.. all have better things to be doing, more worthwhile things to be doing, than dealing with binge drinkers who can't handle their drink.  The only result of relaxing the law around licensing is that the problems are constant now throughout the night.  They haven't stopped people binge drinking and they have only served to increase instances of assault and disorder.  This is one of the worst decisions taken by the government and it needs to be repealed.",
