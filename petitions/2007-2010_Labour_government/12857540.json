        "background": "There is plenty of careers advice for people in certain categories, e.g. teenagers, the unemployed, people with few qualifications. This is great, but what about the 'Average Joe', who maybe doesn't have access to a University careers advisor, may work full time, or who do not fit into the above categories and thus don't have careers guidance available? \nThere are local services, but these are very much a postcode lottery affair. More face-to-face careers guidance so the same support is offered to yours. \nThis issue seems to be a growing area of concern recently, young people who have worked hard and may be working in a job that is inappropriate for their skills are feeling increasingly disheartened with the lack of support when trying to progress through their working lives. \nHaving the existing walk-in services available at weekends and evenings would be a great help to those in full-time work or who can't attend careers help in the hours these services are open for.",
