            "background": "The government claims it wants a greener Britain. Apparently so long as it can make money out of it, yes.\n\nIf you produce less that 2500 litres of biofuel for personal use, per annum, you do not need to register with HMRC. Well done - a step forwards, at least. \n\nThe problem is few commercial outlets produce biofuel. Home biofuel processors are now available to purchase - fantastic! They are, however, somewhat expensive: \u00a32500. I would consider purchasing a processor for this price. But! \u00a32500 + VAT = nearly \u00a33000! This is not acceptable and does not encourage greener living.\n\nIf the government wants its green credentials to remain, then such biofuel processors need to be VAT exempt.\n\nTo the public: please do the right thing by signing this petition.\n\nTo the government: please do the right thing by making the above mentioned VAT exempt.\n\nGreener Britain, Greener World.",
