            "background": "As it atands women can abort a child at 24 weeks, statistics show that many children have survived and lived a long and healthy life when born at 24 week.I was one of those babies that was born prematurely and survived this was some 20 years ago.In 1999 survival rate for a baby born at 24 weeks was 50%, now it is 80%, The percentage keeps rising because of the specailist intensive care units hospitals have.I am creating this petition because i feel very strongly on this issue and feel every child should have the chance to live. Thankyou",
