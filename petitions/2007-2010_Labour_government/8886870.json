        "action": "to abandon his proposed legislation to create inter-species embryos for research.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Members of the British public, of all Faiths and none agree that to create a new living entity, by mixing human genetic material with that of an animal is a step too far, as it crosses the natural order.  To create, experiment on, and destroy a \u2018being\u2019 which is 99% human, cannot be anything other than evil.  Despite stringent regulations, without doubt  sooner or later some maverick will succeed in bringing such a creature to birth.  \n \nWhy does the government not encourage research into adult stem cell research, and that of material obtained from umbilical cord cells, as experiments have been successful in treating such diseases as Parkinson\u2019s?  Treatment with cells obtained from inter-species embryonic material, will need constant drug therapy to prevent rejection, whereas one\u2019s own genetically modified cellular material would be unlikely to cause rejection.\n\nWe, the undersigned, respectfully ask Mr Brown to heed the advice given by ministers of religion and others who have strongly protested against this obnoxious proposal.",
