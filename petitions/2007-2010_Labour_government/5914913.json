        "background": "If you listen to Michael Jacksons', \"The Earth Song\"... what about all of the things that is said in this song? A lot of the population has seemed to have forgotten about the true beauty and nature of this Earth! Technology has taken over and it is no joke, can we please take technology back - and live in a less virtual world? We would help the world's environment (and maybe prevent this crazy recent weather) and the world would be a safer place - millions of problems in this world today are caused by technology. We all lived without virtual technology once, why can't we again? Please sign this, as I feel very strongly that our world isn't going to last much longer, or get any better if we continue to treat it this way.",
