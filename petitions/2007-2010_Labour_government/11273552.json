            "background": "I believe that students who have graduated with a 2:2 or lower second class degree have nearly no chance or hardly any chance of being employed by large firms. I believe that this is unfair as it seems that firms do not even look at your academic or work history if you have gained a 2:2 and your application is deemed unsuccessful. There are a few cases where students with a 2:2 have got o.k jobs, but this is minimal. I would like the PM or Education minister to have a look into this and ratify if necessary. It seems that more than 90% of companies want a minimum 2:1 or 1st in order for applicants to apply for available vacancies.",
