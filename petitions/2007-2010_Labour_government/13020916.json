            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Road / pavement provisions for cyclists and pedestrians are inadequate in many areas, particularly in rural areas. Increasing these provisions will provide benefits for the environment, safety, tourism, employment and personal health. \nThe proposal in this petition is to pass legislation requiring appropriate local and national authorities to include clauses in their invitations to tender and contracts for new roads and the maintenance of existing roads, obliging the successful bidder to create and/or maintain cycle and pedestrian paths as a part of every bid. Bidders should demonstrate innovative ways of increasing cycle and pedestrian use of the existing highways / paths e.g better use of verges, interconnection of existing cycle ways, bridleways, footpaths etc. The costs of these provisions should be carried jointly by the contractors and national lottery funding. \nUnder the direction of the appropriate authority, the amount of new / developed paths provided should be geared to the primary road development / maintenance contract e.g. one mile of road should generate \"x\" miles of cycle and pedestrian friendly path.",
