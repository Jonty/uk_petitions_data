            "background": "Gregori Sokolov, one of the great pianists of our time, has performed in the UK for over 18 yrs. He has to visit a UK Embassy personally in order to provide biometric details and renew his Visa. He is unable to do this and has cancelled his performances in London, again, in April. His tour was cancelled last year for the same reasons. Whilst recognising that this visa requirement is to protect us from terrorists, there is no sense in applying the requirement to performers of this stature who enrich the arts and music culture of our nation so much. His concerts sold out in days and we are unlikely to see him return to the UK whilst this law is imposed inflexibly with no regard to common sense. There should be a 'sponsored visa' available for performers of this magnitude that gives Visas to the Artistes for the duration of their visit and is granted in conjunction with an application from the organisation or agency who booked their performance(s).",
