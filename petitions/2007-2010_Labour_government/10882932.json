        "background": "Disabled children age 3 and under/ Or carers CANNOT claim any help from Disability living allowance for mobility.\n\nOften ( more than not) thesec hildren need transportation as an utmost importance in order to carry bulky essential equipment, fittings, casts, braces, adapted chairs and seating etc.  It can be impossible to access public transport or often inappropriate to so so.  Others (like ourselves) need to take children to hospitals up and down the country to special care centres when public transport is not an option.  As many carers do not have employed work to meet care needs, the costs for independant transport can be staggering.  We urge that the government look at amending this rule and view all child cases under 3 on need.",
