            "background": "For many years now the world of confectionary, stationary and news retail has been under threat, from (until recently) an unseen threat, that threat has revealed itself to be the NEMISIS Corperation and more specifically MR X. \n\nX has appeared to live a normal life however it has been revealed that he has recently recruited hundreds of men from the far east and supplied them with orange boiler suits and has recently purchased an island in the south pacific with a dormant volcano, which he intends to hollow out and use it for launching satellites that will in some way bring the world of stationary, news and confectionary retail to its knees. \n\nThis man must be stopped. We therefore urge that the prime minister launch an enquiry into the dealings of NEMISIS corp and take appropriate action. maybe involving Sir Rodger Moore single handedly tackling this evil genius, however if he is unable due to his charity or post office voice over commitments it is our opinion that Nigel Havers is sent in his stead",
