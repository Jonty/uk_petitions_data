            "background": "Whatever happened to \"Rule Britannia ! Britons will never be slaves ?!\". The petitioner is calling on the British govt. to address  the safety and security of persons travelling abroad, in aid projects and on UN missions. That the former Archbishop of Canterbury and the church needs to intervene is a shocking inditement on the role of govt. in caring for it's citizens, but thank God that they do.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the PM. to legislate to provide guidelines and an international safety net as preventative measures to ensure that British subjects are not subjected to harsh, degrading or inhuman treatment at the hands of foreign nationals. \nKidnap worldwide is a sinister criminal act, yet, sadly, in an unstable world, an everyday occurence  -  can we, as mankind, not somehow address how to do unto others as we would have done unto ourselves ?\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to deal with disappearances - it seems that part of terrorism is sensationalism, and attention - seeking, sadly at whatever cost and regardless of the human suffering inflicted on the lives of other people.",
