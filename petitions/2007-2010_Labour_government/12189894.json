Now pass holders will once again have to pay on coaches, park-and-ride buses, open-top bus tours and any services intended \u201cprimarily for tourism\u201d. \nIf the OAP's are not allowed to use these buses then they will have to pay.\n\nAs the banks have reduced the interest on savings and the pension is so low this action will isolate many pensioners.  Do you really want to see more OAP's driving cars?",
