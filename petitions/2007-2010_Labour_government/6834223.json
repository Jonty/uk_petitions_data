            "background": "In a recent visit to the Netherlands I noticed that most of the souvenirs sold there such as the famous wooden clogs were certified as genuinely Dutch-made products through a recognised symbol.\n\nI have spoken to friends who have come here as tourists and being dismayed to find that souvenirs they brought, including from official government-sponsored Tourist Information sites, sported the Union or other British Isles flags, or were traditional symbols of Britain such as the red telephone box etc were all made abroad.\n\nI want a law which stats any product containing the Union or any British national flag or is a traditional British symbol, is made in the UK. It is unacceptable that foreign-made goods use our national symbols when they are made elsewhere.\n\nIf it is not possible to make this an enforcable law, the government should set up a voluntary scheme with an approved, recognisable Government logo certifying that the product has been made in the UK - this could also guarantee quality, eg. that the product met British Standards Institution standards etc. It could also ensure they only sold such products its own official Tourist sites.",
