            "background": "We are 12 years old and we believe that zoo animals and sea world animals should not be forced to do tricks, we believe that such animals as killer whales at sea world and bears at zoos should not be made to perform infront of the general public. Killer whales should not have been removed from the wild in the first place as they don't have a chance to survive for themselves. I hope such people agree so we can raise this matter to Gordon Brown.",
