            "background": "As England is now the only country in the UK to still have mandatory charges for prescriptions, it is now time to end this unfairness to English people and make prescriptions free to ALL, regardless of their conditions, at the point of need.  Those of us who still have to pay for them here are becoming increasingly more frustrated and anxious that we still have to pay for our own medicines, sometimes having to leave the prescription unfilled because we just cannot afford \u00a37.10 per item! It is grossly unfair that the English people are, in effect, subsidising the rest of the UK so that people living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can have theirs free - it is NOT fair. \n\nIf England remains the only country in the UK to keep charging it's people for their medicines then we can no longer be called UNITED Kingdom because we are not!  \n\nPlease sign the petition and end this postcode lottery prescription shame.",
