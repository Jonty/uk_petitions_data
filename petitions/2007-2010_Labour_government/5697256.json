            "background": "By putting extra tax on fatty foods, will not stop fat people buying them unless you're talking \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3's extra! Think about thin people who just want to treat themselves with a cake, they shouldn't have to pay extra tax, they're not wasting time & money on hospital costs for obesity, it isn't justifiable! By putting a law on the allowance of fat allowed to be baked into food & sold by businesses, people would have no choice but to eat healthily then! The 'Fat Tax' is made to sound like it's been put into place to help people & save lives, when all-in-all it's just about making more money!! I find it sickening!! We pay enough tax already & a reduction should be considered by the Government not an additional payment!!",
