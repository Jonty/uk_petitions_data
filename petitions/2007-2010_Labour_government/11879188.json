            "background": "No citizen or party has a monopoly on good ideas.  The aims and concerns of all political parties should be taken into consideration.  There should be regular cross-party strategy meetings to ensure all aims and concerns are taken into consideration.  Party politics should be less adversarial.  These days there is much convergence between the political parties anyway because everyone is learning lessons from history.  So collaboration and cooperation should be a lot easier.  Regular cross-party meetings could focus initially on how best to work together and then further consructive action could be taken.",
