        "background": "We would like to campaign for a worthy cause: an Equality and Diversity Bank Holiday. The idea is that the bank holiday will be respectful and inclusive of all sexual orientations, genders, races and religions \u2013 ideal in a such a multi-cultural country as the UK. And also a chance to celebrate how far this country has come in preserving equality, plus also to unify the many different pockets of society.\n\nUK residents enjoy only eight bank holidays each year. There are several European countries such as Germany, Italy and Poland that boast much higher numbers ranging anywhere from 10 to 15 days! There have been calls for more Bank Holidays in the UK, and it is believed that an Equality and Diversity Day will send out a good message and be a great way to recognise what our country stands for in the 21st Century.",
