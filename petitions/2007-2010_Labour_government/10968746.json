            "background": "Dear PM,\nConsidering the liquidity issues which are affecting majority of the Banks I would like to put forward my views regarding early repayment charges which the banks r charging for people who want to return their principal amount in case of fixed term mortgage home loans. I would request u to please ask all the banks to waive the early repayment charges for the next 2 years on all fixed term home loan customers as there are many people who have cash with them but r not able to invest in any where safe due the current volatile markets.\nI think this would be a very good step in helping out the liquidity issues with the banks and make more money avaliable to them.",
