        "background": "The government has moved in recent years to protect events such as the FA Cup final for the general public ensuring that it will always be shown on terrestrial TV. I challenge the government to protect the live event in the same way ensuring that the true fans are protected by ensuring that the ticket allocation is fair. \n\nCurrent allocation of only 55% of capacity split between the two clubs in favour of giving tickets to FA members & corporate sponsors who have no interest in the outcome is at the expense of the true fans who are the lifeblood of the game is abhorrent and requires change, enforced if need be.\n\nI addition, a large proportion of corporate tickets end up on the black market being sold to fans at a huge market. The current allocation structure only feeds this market & further takes advantage of those to whom the game has meaning.",
