        "background": "Pony & Traps should not be allowed to race around Roads, they are a danger both to horses & the public. The majority of the horses are cruely treated and in a poor conditon. Causing damage to vehicles & property. They should be banned from racing around roads Or atleast have to apply for a licence to show the horse is in a fit state & the driver is a legal & responsible adult, even then the speed should be stopped. Some of these Pony & Traps drivers are young kids with no respect for property other people and certainly no care for the horses.",
