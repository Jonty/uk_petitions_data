            "background": "Cern assures us that this experiment is safe, yet states that the chances of a black hole being created are 'miniscule', not 'impossible'. That is not a good enough assurance of safety, there are too many unknowns, and we feel, as members of the general public, that we deserve more in-depth information before this goes ahead.  Many of us are well-informed, educated and well-read people, yet news of this 'experiment' has come out of left-field, a total surprise to us, and with little time to object or fully understand the implications.  Perhaps the scientists fully understand the implications, but do they care?\n\nAs parents, one to another, we beg of you to please help ensure the safety of this planet for our children, and by delaying this experiment, request that the Cern Scientists involved hold a worldwide media conference stating their beliefs as to why this experiment is 'safe', what safety measures they have in place should it go wrong, and how the knowledge they are seeking will benefit mankind.",
