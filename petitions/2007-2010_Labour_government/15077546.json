            "background": "Despite making up as much as 10 per cent of GDP, the construction industry is not treated significantly enough by MPs and by ministers. The quick succession of construction and housing ministers means there has been no senior and lasting point of contact, and there are fears that even the new chief construction adviser will not have the weight required to fulfil this role.\nConstruction News calls upon the Prime Minister to commit to improving the relationship between the industry and government and to set up new channels of communication, whether through select committees, ministerial appointments or other means, to ensure the issues that hold back sensible development are fully understood by all throughout government.\nConstruction can make a significant difference in many areas of importance: in boosting employment; in retrofitting homes and delivering energy efficiency; in delivering a functional transport infrastructure; in addressing the housing shortage; and in helping meet the energy challenges the UK faces.\nCN has taken the first step through its Vote for Construction campaign, aimed at raising the profile of the industry to both MPs and prospective MPs.",
