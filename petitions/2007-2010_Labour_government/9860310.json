            "action": "Abolish or change the VAT rule that makes it more viable for developers to demolish and build new rather than refurbish good homes that need relatively small investment to bring them up to standard.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The fact that existing VAT rules make it more profitable for developers to demolish rather than rebuild is a key factor in the problems faced by local communities. Along with the use of CPO's and the lack of real consultation with local people where regeneration is concerned, the VAT rule helps create more misery and distrust of politicians and the political process than is acceptable in the C21st.\n\nWe urge those elected to serve the people of Britain to change this cruel rule and allow the more environmentally sound prospect of maintaining and upgrading existing buildings, bringing currently uninhabitable housing stock back into use and building on existing community networks rather than continuing to fragment the fabric of British society.",
