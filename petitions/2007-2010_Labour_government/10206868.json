        "background": "Depending on where you are you will always get a varying age for children. This means that teenagers, who have very little money, are being charged rediculous fees for riding buses, going to theme parks and the cinema all because they are considered an adult when it comes to paying,yet suffer a lack of adult rights.\n\nYet the age limit to do what would be considered 'adult' things such as voting and buying alcohol are 18-21. This means that teenagers pay to be an adult from sometimes as young age as 12 which is laughable.",
