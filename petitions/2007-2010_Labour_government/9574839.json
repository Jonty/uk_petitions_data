            "background": "CCTV is clearly being used to fine motorists on many occasions when in the past a word of warning would have done. Society is increasingly policed by digital means and citizens are increasingly found guilty before their side of the case is heard.  The often anonymous authorities are clearly using this as a means of extra taxation. This brings a real sense of unreasonableness - which was not the UK way. Whatever happened to the man on the Clapham Omnibus which always used to be the UK test of acceptability.",
