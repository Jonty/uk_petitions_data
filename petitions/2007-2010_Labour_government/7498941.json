            "background": "We believe this Bill to be an illegal tax grab on commercial property landlords, brought in under the pretence to encourage landlords to rent empty shops and offices and to force them into releasing unused brownfield sites for housing development.  Unfortunately this Bill doesn't take into consideration relief for landlords who CANNOT find tenants for vacant offices or shops.  Small landlords were originally encouraged by the government into farm diversification schemes, now they face the prospect of paying tax on properties that derive no income.",
