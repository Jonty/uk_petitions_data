            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The agency workers bill will destroy the temporary and flexible workforce in Britain.  The Government have not listened to the indepth feedback from the recruitment industry who mostly manage their temp workforce in a professional manner.  Many temps specifically choose this method of working by choice - the companies who hire them often dont have the capacity to hire so many people permanently. The latter results in jobs being offshored to India and similar places. This will further increase and our temps work force of 1.2million could find that the majority our out of work altogether.  The temps nowadays receive many benefits due to the WTD but the further changes proposed will make it impossible to maintain the flexible workforce that both employee and employer enjoy.",
