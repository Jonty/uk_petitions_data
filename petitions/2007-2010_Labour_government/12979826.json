        "action": "Limit the interest rate charged on credit to a maximum of 5% over the Bank of England base rate.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This would stop banks profiteering and  inject real cash into the economy. rather help banks recover their losses incurred through their mismanagement at our expense. Banks will still make a profit and people will be able to save and spend the difference in interest between the rates.\n\nEven though the Bank of England has cut interest rates to 0.5% credit card companies and banks have not reduced their interest rates. In fact many have increased interest rates. Some banks have increased the rates by over 10% - RBS interest rates are now between 22% to 30%. This amounts to a tax on taxpayers who paid to bail out RBS in the first place.\n\nFurthermore it will enable everyone to benefit from the low interests rates and pay of debt which would in turn  benefit the economy.",
