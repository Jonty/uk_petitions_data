            "background": "A mother whose son's grave was cut in half under 'health and safety' rules is outraged at being billed \u00a3250 bill for the work.\nAnna Greenwood spent months battling the local authority's demand to halve her 14-year-old son Daniel's plot from 6ft to 3ft.\nBut the council went ahead with the work turfing over half the grave, while Mrs Greenwood, 53, was in Cyprus nursing her sick mother.  \nSingle mother Anna Greenwood was reduced to tears when she returned to the UK to find a wooden cross, plants and ornaments had been removed and turf laid down.\nBasildon Council demanded relatives of those buried at Pitsea Cemetery decrease the size of their loved ones graves to 3ft.\nNow the council has sent her a letter demanding money for the work, warning her she would face a debt agency if she failed to pay up.\n\nPlease help us over run the council. It makes me sick that they can even think about doing this to people\u2019s graves.\n\nThank you for your support",
