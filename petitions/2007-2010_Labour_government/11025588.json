If you want a bank account you have to jump through several hoops such as having a passport(?) or driving licence as proof of who you are.  But what if you can't afford either of these? Then you end up with a bank account that you can't get either direct debits or a debit card with.  And then if you go less than \u00a35 overdrawn even for a few hours you are hit with a charge of around \u00a330.  It is time that this was changed and poorer people got a fair deal.",
