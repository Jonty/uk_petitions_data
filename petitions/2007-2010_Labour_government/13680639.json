            "background": "This is in response to a petition setting out, very graphically, all the difficulties people experience when trying to claim these benefits.  These include \"being humiliated by being disbelieved; and having to appeal and appeal again\" (because of what I believe is the culture of disbelief in the D.W.P.) in spite of supporting letters from one's G.P. or specialist.  Instead of therefore asking for this process to be made easier, however, the original petition simply says potential claimants should be warned that claiming \"can seriously damage their health\"; an obvious effect of this is that people who need these benefits will be so deterred that they will decide not to claim money they need so badly.",
