Its blatantly obvious that the government have no intention of paying the lads what their worth, EVER.... If they were to make them tax exempt whilst in theatre it would make a huge, deserved difference to them. Think about it... For some of them out there they are in immediate danger 24/7....breaking that down, the government is asking 18/19yr old lads to put their lives on the line for less than \u00a34 an hour (probably less - I'm no mathematician)....They are acting in defence of the realm (allegedly) fighting for this country, fighting for the queen, getting killed and maimed daily all for less money then the Traffic Wardens haunting our High Streets. My hope would be that if we get enough members, someone with a bit of oomph would get on board, or maybe the tabloids could start picking up on it....\n\nOne thing is certain, if the public were made aware of this idea they would be behind it 100%",
