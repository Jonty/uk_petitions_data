Also, even though I do have one that is 'portable' I have had to have a new CRB check carried out as the 'portable' one is 13 months old.\n\nThese checks cost me \u00a337.50 each time, multiply that by the number of employees who have to have these checks carried out.... Just where is this fortune going????",
