        "background": "The speaker should not be allowed to stand down, he should be sacked and definitely not rewarded with a peerage.\nAll politicians and the speaker that are guilty of making dishonest claims must be put before the courts and prosecuted for fraud. If any member of the general public is found defrauding the state or refusing to pay council tax, any financial crime against the state(government) they end up with a custodial sentence. If it is good enough for them, it's good enough for MPs, all politicians alike. As above, non shold be given a peerage or reward of any sort. This requires legal action through the courts, even the prime minister if he is guilty.",
