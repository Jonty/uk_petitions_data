            "background": "As a British citizen of 34 years of age I am so angry at the way in which we are being treated. It seems that we no longer have a voice and at every opportunity are being made to feel like our REAL concerns and feelings are not as important as those who either come into the country or reside in a country that they feel they can knock at every opportunity. WE need to be heard and consulted on what we want and not what is right for a minority group. Many British citizens are embarrased by what their fellow countrymen demand when they arrive in this country and for them this must end up causing them to feel isolated as the rest of us do.\nGRADUALLY THE MULTI CULTURAL SOCIETY OF BRITAIN WILL BE NO MORE AS THE BRITISH WILL LEAVE TO PASTURES NEW. HOWEVER, WE WILL MAKE SURE WE HAVE PRIVATE HEALTHCARE, CAN SPEAK THE LANGUAGE AND RESPECT THE CULTURE (i was an expat so have experience). THEN AGAIN NO ONE DOES IT LIKE BRITAIN SO THE CHANCES OF REACHING THEIR SHORE IS PRETTY SLIM EVEN IF THEY DO WELCOME US IN THE FIRST PLACE.",
