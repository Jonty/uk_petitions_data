            "background": "Since the 1980's several large wage increases were given to the civil service, as a result of benchmarking exercises against the private sector.  Recently the value of a final salary pension has increased by a factor of 3 or 4, when compared to the capital pot required to buy the equivalent annuity.  We request that this hidden public sector wage and cost inflation is controlled by reducing the benefit to maintain parity with the private sector.   This may require freezing or reducing public sector salaries or pension benefits when they are up for review.",
