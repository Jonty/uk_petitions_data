How is that fare and how does it encourge the use of public transport? They say the answer to that is to buy an oyster card, but not everyone needs to use public transport everyday or even every six months. Everyone between this age group should pay a flat rate. All these high prices do is encourage the use of a car which is probably why in non peek times you see about five people to a double decker bus, How is that good for the enviorment or anyone else!",
