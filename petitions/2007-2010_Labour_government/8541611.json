This is an issue for the music industry, who have for years artificially rigged the price of CDs to generate inflated profits \u2013 not for any Government to solve in this way.\n\nThis is not an issue that should be resolved in this way.  It smacks of a big brother state \u2013 the type of thing one might expect if you lived behind the old iron curtain.  It is completely outrageous to suggest that a whole household will be denied access to the net because potentially ONE person in the house may have been downloading.\n\nThis will prove to be one of the MOST UNPOPULAR things this government has ever done if it goes ahead.  IT MUST BE STOPPED.",
