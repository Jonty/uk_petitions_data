            "background": "Train services from Kings Cross Thameslink have been terminated and replaced by trains from St Pancras International.  The new station has been badly planned and creates the following problems:\n\n1) the walk from the new station to the Underground is excessive. (estimated 10 minutes)\n\n2) access to London Underground from Kings Cross Thameslink allowed passengers to board Piccadilly and Victoria line trains at the opposite end of the platforms from people who accessed the underground via other entrances thus relieving conjestion, the new access from St Pancras International creates additonal conjestion further delaying passengers.\n\n3)Access via Kings Cross Thameslink allowed users a relatively seamless interchange with no need to input tickets - the new access requires passengers, many with luggage to use their ticket twice.\n\nUnless the old station is reopened passengers will be seriously discouraged from using public transport.",
