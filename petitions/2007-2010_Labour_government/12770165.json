Throughout the country there are many varied organisations each with there compliment of paid up members who should be represented in the House provided they meet certain criteria. The British Legion, RSPA, Some Political Parties, Trade Unions, The Federation of Women's Institutes, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds with over a million members, These are but a few which come to mind. A decision as to the number of representatives to be allowed would have to be made and from this the minimum number of  members of each organisation could be calculated.Multiples of this number would allow extra repesentatives. The House would have the power to co-opt people who have specialised skills to offer to become representatives. Each organisation would have to democratically elect their representative(s). Organisations whose membership numbers fall below the required number would lose their representative. Organisations reaching the required membership level would be able to apply for membership. There would have to be a number of rules to allow the House to operate properly.",
