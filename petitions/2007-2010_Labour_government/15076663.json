            "background": "If armed forces personnel left service after April 1975, they receive a pension (in accordance with the number of years of service and contributions paid). If, however, they left before April 1975, they receive no service pension (unless they had completed at least a full 22 years of service, 16 years in the case of officers).\n\nOver 1/2 a million men and women who left the Armed Forces between 1949 and 1975 are affected.\n\nThese brave men and women put their lives at risk for their country in places like Korea, Aden, Cyprus and Northern Ireland (for example, there were 1,100 British deaths in Korea).\n\nThere is an Early Day Motion (2009-2010 #185) put forward by Colin Challen which says \"That this House believes that all ex-servicemen and women should be treated equally in the payment of pensions, regardless of when they served in Her Majesty's armed forces.\"\n\nWe believe that this should be brought to the House for discussion, and the heroic members of the Forces should receive the pension they so richly deserve.",
