        "background": "The law states that a pedigree pet counts as an assett and can therefore be seized by bailiffs to pay overdue fines (as seen on the BBCs \"Cars Cops and Bailiffs\" Weds 9th Jan 2008). Pets should not be regarded as goods and chattels in this way, they are sentient beings and it is upsetting for the pet as well as the owner to take it from a loving and stable home and more than likely place it in a cage in a rescue centre until a new home can be found (but who knows WHAT happens to seized animals - they could be flogged to anyone by the bailiffs..). Would you seize a child to pay the mothers debts? Animals have feelings and are not the same as TV sets and stereos!",
