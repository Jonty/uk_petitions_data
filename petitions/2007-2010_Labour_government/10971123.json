        "background": "The lack of action by event organisers of the Mountain Marathon over the weekend of 25th October 2008 large amount of public money and personal safety of service men and women was risked on an avoidable incident. \n\nThe Police and Mountain Rescue Services issued a warning recommending that the event be cancelled and re-scheduled due to extreme weather warnings issued by the Met Office. \n\nI propose that in future if official recommendations are made by the Met Office and Police service, organisations would be liable for the costs of using a service if the worst should happen. If no warning is issued by the Met Office and the police then use of such services would be free as it is now.\n\nIt is only by good fortune and pure luck that no-one was serious injured or killed during the event which was totally avoidable.",
