            "background": "The President of South Africa\u2019s policy of \u2018quiet diplomacy\u2019 has allowed Robert Mugabe\u2019s regime to brutalise his country with impunity. Whether or not this was the intention, it was the all too predictable outcome of this policy. The continuation of this policy in the face of the recent upsurge of violence and the continued silence from President Mbeki suggest that he still sees no crisis in Zimbabwe. His position as an impartial mediator is now laughable. Should Britain continue normal relations with the Mbeki regime, his misguided policy gains legitimacy it does not deserve. The suffering of the people of Zimbabwe will be prolonged as Mugabe strings along those who believe in this \u2018quiet diplomacy\u2019. This policy has failed and will continue to fail. To support it would be to be complicit in the crimes of the Mugabe Regime. It is time to call the president of South Africa to account. While the current South African policy is in place, Britain should have nothing to do with South Africa.",
