            "background": "There is nothing more horrific than the deliberate use of weapons such as WHITE PHOSPHORUS on trapped civilians. This weapon burns through into bone and cannot be extinguished. It falls into the same category as weapons used by Saddam Hussein. This weapon was used by a modern/mechanised fully equipped army against civilians trapped-denied any exit. Not once in error but repeatedly. Investigation should be carried out into targeting of UN buildings and supplies & every effort afforded to ensure the prosecution of those commanders in breach of the Geneva convention.",
