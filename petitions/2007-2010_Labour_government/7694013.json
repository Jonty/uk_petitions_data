Such charities, aside from their quasi-public functions are often supported to a large degree by public funding.\n\nIt is unconscionable that service-users or members of charities, who may be subject to discrimination and/or stigma by virtue of conditions, disabilities or circumstances that those charities supposedly champion, are denied recourse to the HRA when those charities act unreasonably against them.\n\nWell-run charities should have nothing to lose from falling under the HRA.  It is the users of those organisations that engage in bad practice often to individuals\u2019 detriment who will gain from access to the HRA - along with an implicit requirement for charities\u2019 good governance.",
