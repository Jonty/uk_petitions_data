            "background": "High risk neuroblastoma is a deadly form of paediatric cancer despite intensive therapy.  Government funding for this particular cancer is zero.  Survival rates are as low as 20%.  To increase survival rates and stop these children from losing their lives in such a cruel way, the way forward is Government Funding.  Funding for research, funding for better treatments (first line and relapse protocols). Nine children have died from this deadly disease in the last 2 weeks and many more are terminal now.  Please do not let these children die in vain. Please sign this petition and lets put a stop to these innocent children dying.",
