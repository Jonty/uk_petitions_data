        "action": "end discrimination against the mentally ill and other disabled people, by making it unlawful to ask potentially discriminatory questions in the job application and interview process",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Discriminatory practices against the mentally ill are still widespread, due to ill-informed and prejudiced views by employers. Many otherwise capable people who have suffered from mental illness, have been denied the opportunity to work in their chosen profession, due to these mistaken beliefs. \nThe Disability Discrimination Act 2005 does not go far enough to prevent discrimination, since interviewees still \nhave to disclose their mental health history during the interview process, allowing potential employers to make decisions based on disability rather than on a candidate's qualifications and experience. I propose a system similar to the US where it is illegal to ask potentially discriminatory questions about disability, religion, ethnicity, sexuality, age etc during the job application and interview process.",
