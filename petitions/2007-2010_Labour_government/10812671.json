            "background": "London Crossrail is a vastly overpriced scheme, costing \u00a316bn (at the latest estimate) for a couple of tunnels that effectively duplicate the Central Line. At the same time as this scheme being approved, several proposed Tram and light rail schemes elsewhere in England were scrapped by the DfT for being too expensive, despite the fact that they were vastly less expensive than this scheme. \n\nCrossrail should be scrapped and the money spent on improving transport in areas that currently lack decent public transport, since London's transport system is already very well developed. People don't like buses!",
