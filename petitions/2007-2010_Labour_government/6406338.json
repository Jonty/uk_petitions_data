            "background": "We wish to express our concern for the use of palm oil in The UK and the current policy on the labelling of palm oil in products. The use of palm oil is associated with serious environmental consequences in Indonesia and Malaysia. Primary rainforest is being cleared to make way for palm oil plantations, destroying the habitat of highly endangered species like the orangutan. Palm oil is often labelled on ingredient lists as a generic 'vegetable oil', limiting the ability of consumers to make informed purchases. We feel that this breaches the Regulatory Objectives of the Food Standards. The UK must provide for the protection of public health and safety by providing adequate information relating to food, thereby enabling consumers to make informed choices. \nWe request that the government:\n \n\u2022 Implement policies to ensure the labelling of products containing palm oil. \n\u2022 Work for a certification system for sustainable palm oil, and regulate to prevent the import of \nnon-certified palm oil.\n\u2022 Support the Indonesian Government in stopping the clearance of primary forest. \n\nSupplied by: Borneo Orangutan Survival Fund (BOS)",
