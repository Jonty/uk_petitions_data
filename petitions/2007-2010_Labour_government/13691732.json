        "background": "This petition has been created to ban 'thinspo'/ thin inspiration. It can come in many forms: images, videos, diet tips, forums, support friends (buddy ups) etc. The depictions of beauty in the 'pro-ana/mia' are distorted. Many images are photo shopped to make the model look thinner and more attractive. In some images the image has been changed so much it would be impossible to achieve what is in the picture. These images are being used by sufferers of eating disorders. For those pro-ani/mia they look for images of celebrities or people they feel are thin and attractive to idolise. Many of them having eating disorders themselves or their job role has forced them to be at a size 0 or similar.",
