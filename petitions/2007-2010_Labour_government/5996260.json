On average men and women think, act/react & communicate differently: nearly half the world\u2019s opinions are neither heard nor acted upon. \nLife has moved on from the ethos of one man one vote for one man. Gender democracy is a subtle variant of the double democracy system. Political parties could not, as now and perhaps inadvertently, influence the gender outcome of an election: only voters could do that.\nThere would be a list of female candidates & a list of male candidates; both lists with party affiliations, or not, as now. Voters would have one vote to choose from either list. Obviously the candidate with most votes is elected. Because of space constraints the English used here should be read with care to appreciate that all implications have been taken into account. Gender democracy is an electoral reform that could be implemented across the world.",
