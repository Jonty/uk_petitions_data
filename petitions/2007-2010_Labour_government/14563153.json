            "background": "Petition the PM to amend the way the home office deal with immigration cases and to create an efficient process for immigrants waiting for decisions on their status, so as to reduce the timescale in which immigrants are constantly struggling to get a decision for their case. Also their situation and the consideration of the rights they already hold (such as UNCRC, FOI Act) should be taken into account. Lots of people spend most of their lives waiting and not getting any response and not having a status destroys alot of their lives as they are unable to work or vote and they live with their lives held in the hands of the government. Well i say it's time to stand up and get just decisions made!",
