        "background": "We all applaud the emergency Services when they have saved a life. The Police, Fire Brigade, Ambulance, Air Ambulance,Coast Guard, all at times put themselves at risk to save lives. That is their job and they receive Public Funding and a pay packet.\nThe members of the Mountain rescue Teams receive nothing. They are made up entirely of volunteers who often put themselves at risk to save others. But without these Rescue teams (who raise their own funds) the emergency services could not manage. They simply are not trained or equipt to rescue and evacuate casualties from many incidents. Such a service deserves public funding as it surely is enough that they volunteer. They should not have to worry about funding as well.",
