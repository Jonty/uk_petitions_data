            "background": "The goverment currently gives alternate fuel drivers a 10% discount.\n\nIf the new VED proposal gets passed then 10% will disapear.\n\nHow can you justify this move. How is it a true green tax.\n\nIf the discount is phased out then the green thing to do, would be to tax the vehicles based on actual engine emissions after conversion. I hope this is not due to the increase in interest around LPG and other alternate fuels by the haulage industry.\n\nSo keep the discount or re-consider the tax bands for alternate fueled cars.",
