            "background": "The CPI basket of goods is not indicative of the most common goods and services purchased by consumers.  The basket of goods should be expanded to 10,000 lines and include the most commonly purchased items and services, including;\n\nAll fuels\nAll taxes, including vehicle and council\nCost of public transport\n\nTo name but a few.\n\nBritish citizens are suffering because of this governments unwillingness to accept that inflationary pressures exist, and the government has amended the calculations to suit this argument.\n\nThe CPI basket of goods should be determined by an independant body, and based on quantative analysis - not government whim.",
