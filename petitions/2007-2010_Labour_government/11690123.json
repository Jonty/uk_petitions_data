            "background": "In the UK at the moment there are an unprecedented number of dogs being abandoned, partly due to the credit crunch and partly due to irresponsible owners. At the same time Local authorities are handing out breeding licences to puppy farmers and individuals who breed litter after litter of puppies. Unfortunatley though these puppies are often brought up in appalling conditions with no concern for their welfare what so ever, the breeders only concern being financial gain. Most will end up in kennels eventually, adding to the already huge number of unwanted and unloved dogs. \n1.Please STOP local authorities handing out licences with one hand and euthanising unwanted dogs with the other. 2.Please encourage the public to rescue a dog and not buy a puppy. 3.Please regulate the RSPCA who were set up to deal with cruelty cases with the new 'Animal Welfare Act' yet do little or nothing to stop this. Section 24; point 37 states 'an animals 4 basic needs', yet still when these are not met the RSPCA fails to take action!",
