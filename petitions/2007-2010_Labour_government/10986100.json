        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Due to the understandable levels of security at airport terminals, passengers must no longer carry fluids beyond the security control for embarkation, or on arrival before leaving the airport.\nIt can be seen that any passenger is therefore required to buy a drink. \nA small proportion of the passengers, would be simply satisfied with a drinking fountain. It seems that the licensed premises at the airports are not required under the terms of their license to dispense free water. Therefore prominent water fountains should be provided, or signage to their location prominently displayed as an alternative near to the retail outlets. It is the case in The United States that free water is commonly available. This could otherwise be seen as a means of raising income from an unfortunate security restriction, beyond the control of domestic and foreign travellers.",
