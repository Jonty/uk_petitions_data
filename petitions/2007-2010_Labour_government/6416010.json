        "action": "support the 'Less Snakes, More Ladders' campaign, organised by the Howard League for Penal Reform student groups, and change the government's policy on the 18-20 age group in the penal system",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "1. That the government must recognise that the needs of the 18-20 year old age group are being ignored, and their treatment within the penal system must change.\n\n2. That reoffending rates show prison isn't working for this age group, while community sentences make a person take responsibility for their actions and live a law-abiding life in the community.\n\n3. That a system of practical support must be developed for young adults in trouble with the law, encompassing the Howard League for Penal Reform's recommendations on housing, employment and education, advocacy and substance misuse.\n\nFor more information please visit the Howard League for Penal Reform website or join the Howard League Students Facebook group.",
