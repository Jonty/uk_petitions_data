            "background": "The current legislation is entirely reasonable and works well in practice. Removing the ability of parents to use minor forms of physical intervention is unrealistic and unnecessary.  It would also be unreasonable as a majority of parents would not be able to fully comply.   In effect a normal everyday action would become criminalised. It is noted that others countries have removed similar safeguards to minor physical intervention.  New Zealand is a recent example where this occurred despite widespread opposition by the general population. Supporters of such change try to make a link between smacking and extreme acts of child abuse and cruelty despite an absence of compelling scientific evidence. The causes of child abuse and violence are generally understood to be driven by issues including poverty, unemployment, domestic violence and lone parenthood.  In NZ the issue is far from over as a petition calling for a referendum on the matter has been successful.  Avoid this situation in the UK and retain the reasonable parental safeguards.",
