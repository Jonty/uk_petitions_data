        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The proliferation of wind farms is now becoming a threat to the quality of our landscapes and as such should be stopped. If wind farms are required then they should be installed in offshore locations and not onshore. We can meet our wind renewable targets in this manner. I also believe that we are not meeting our commitment to the European landscape convention instrument by continuing to apply what may be non conforming instruments of current planning policy.",
