        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We would like to propose a nationwide petition to reduce the age of the smear tests.  We have recently lost our sister / a mother / a wife / a daughter / a friend to Cervical Cancer and she has been battling against it for 10 months.  Kirsty has left her 4 year old son, she will not be able to see him grow up, see him play football, get his first girlfriend etc.  He will miss out on everything a mom does for her son, and with her son.  It is a great loss to us all and we want to reduce the age so no one else has to suffer the loss we have had to.  We have many people supporting this petition already and it was Kirsty's last wish for us to use her as an example and to be able to lower the age of these tests.",
