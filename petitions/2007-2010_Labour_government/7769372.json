Surely we can find it within us to show some compassion to those around us who have lost a close family member and give them the peace of mind that they are actually entitled to time off to grieve and make arrangements without having to use their annual leave or even to make up their lost hours.\n\nThe South African government provides 'Family Responsibility' Leave of 5 days in a 3 year period.\n\nSurely, it is not unreasonable as human beings to follow the South African model and show love and compassion for our fellow people.",
