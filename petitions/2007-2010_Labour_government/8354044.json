            "action": "let common sense prevail and consider moving Army Units returning from Germany under Project Barona to move to St Athans in South Wales and thus allow RAF Cosford in the West Midlands to remain as a centre of excellence for the delivery of Training to members of the Armed Forces. This common sense approach would surely be a better Value for Money option as opposed to the present proposals. It would also mean a boost to the South Wales economy.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Hundreds of highly skilled and technical jobs will be lost should RAF Cosford be transformed into an Army Base. St Athans already has Army personnel based there and with some magnificent empty hangar space available and with some additional infrastructure would be well postioned to support the return from Germany of large numbers of Army units. Moving training from Cosford does not make economic sense.",
