        "background": "\"Goldman Sachs' 6,000 UK employers are in line for $2.6 billion, which makes up around a quarter of the group's total compensation and benefits bill, despite taking around $10 billion from the US Government's bail-out.\"\n\nAnd a question for you...\n\"If I work in a shop and I get paid on commission and sell loads of goods on tick to people who blatantly cant afford it and when the shop goes bankrupt do I deserve a Christmas whip around from anyone who may or may not shop there?\"\n\nThis kind of behaviour must be stopped immediately to stop further financial problems. The bankers have drained the world finances through a bonus system which allows payments to leave the country without being taxed like normal hard working peoples money is. This can only lead to anarchy and a breakdown in the entire economy.\n\nIt must be stopped now and NO bonuses should be paid to any bankers who work for ANY bailed out banks. If you believe this round of payouts must be stopped please put your name on this list and hope that the Government have the guts to do something about it.",
