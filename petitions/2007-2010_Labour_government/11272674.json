The bankers have drained the world finances through a bonus system which allows payments to leave the country without being taxed like normal hard working peoples money is. This can only lead to anarchy and a breakdown in the entire economy.\n\nIt must be stopped now and NO bonuses should be paid to any bankers who work for ANY bailed out banks. If you believe this round of payouts must be stopped please put your name on this list and hope that the Government have the guts to do something about it.",
