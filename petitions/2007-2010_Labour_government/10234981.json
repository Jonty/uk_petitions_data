The country is out of control and needs a tough new leader that can change things around quickly and address public concerns.\n\nThe is no law and order, no respect, petrol and fuel prices are increasing daily and not a peep from Mr Brown or his goverment. \n\nWhat happened to a goverment of all the talents? More like a goverment of the talentless!\n\nYou were never an elected leader and have already bottled an election. \nSo, let the people decide on this petition if you should be leading this country going forward. Maybe then its time to listen?",
