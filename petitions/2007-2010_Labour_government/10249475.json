The British government has a moral obligation towards the Palestinian people whom they had given away their land and freedom to Zionist gangs. Today, many British Jews are joining the Israeli armed services and committing atrocities against Palestinian civilians. The British government either bans this practice, or provides the British Palestinians with equal rights to support their people's bid for freedom and justice.",
