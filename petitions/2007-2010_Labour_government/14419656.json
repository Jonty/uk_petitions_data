            "background": "According to a recent press article it is understood that the Prime Minester wishes to make it illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under the age of 21 years without proof of their age. \nThis would only serve to criminalise citizens who are not actually doing anything wrong in selling alcohol to people who are legally old enough to buy and consume it.\nUnder current guidelines responible alcohol retailers already ask under 21s for ID before selling them alcohol. Further legeslation on this is unnessesary and places more accountability on the retailer whilst placing none on the purchaser.",
