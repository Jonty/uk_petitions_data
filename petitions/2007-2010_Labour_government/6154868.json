        "background": "The UK has a projected housing deficit of 4.4 million dwellings.\n\nThis problem could be easily solved by forcing local authorities to approve planning permission for self-build properties.\n\nRough calculation:\nHousing Deficit=4.4M,\nUK Population = 60M,\nDewllings needed per 1000 pop=7.3,\nProperties per hectare = 100,\nHectares needed per 1000 pop = 0.73,\nHectares to be released in Esses = 100,\nArea of Essex=350000 hectares,\n% of Essex needed = 0.3%\n\nSelf-build houses are significantly cheaper and 'greener' than developed properties, thus this proposal would also negate the need for affordable housing policies. \n\nThough this would involve developing the countyside, a blot on the landscape it is preferable to having a generation of homeless pensioners who are unable to afford their rent.",
