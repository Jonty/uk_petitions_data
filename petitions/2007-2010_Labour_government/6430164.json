        "background": "The SEWG recommends that we send astronauts (instead of robots) to the Outer Space - at the cost of taxpayers. I call the Government to:\n1) ignore that recommendation\n2) end the existence of the space budget and return that cash to taxpayers\n\nThe American, Russian and French space programs are nothing but prestige projects on which the governments of those states waste much cash. We British taxpayers DO NOT WISH our cash to be wasted on the space. This is our hard-earned cash - taking it from us and giving it to someone who didn't earn it, such as astronauts, is immoral.",
