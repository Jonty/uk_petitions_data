            "background": "Tax on fuel has to be cut as the effects are having a crippling effect on working class people. Famalies are suffering real hardship as it is not always an option to stop useing the car as often, especially if you dont live in the big cities. People who have to commute to work, as they can't afford to live in the cities, are getting hammered for tax. Public transport isn't an option as this often costs more than driving. The government are making millions and millions in extra taxes from fuel from the british public and something has to be done to return it to a sensible level.",
