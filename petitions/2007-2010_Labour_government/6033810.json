        "background": "I want to see an end to all Islamic religious buildings being erected in this country as it undermines the indigenous populations faith in its historical connections with Christianity. To say these two faiths can co exist together is blasphemous in the extreme. Islam cannot and will not recognize and respect other faiths and neither should Christianity allow this cohesion with inferior sub human followers of Radical Islam.",
