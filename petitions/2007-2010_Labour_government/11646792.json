            "background": "Despite the Disability Discrimination legislation, there still seems to be resistance to providing disabled access to the platforms at Bromley South station (described by SouthEastern Trains as \"one of the busiest stations on the network\"). The 29 steps to be negotiated between the booking hall and the platforms are a burden on the disabled and elderly, and also make access difficult for those with baby-buggies and suitcases. Excuses have been offered - lifts would be \"too difficult to install\". However something needs to be done as soon as possible; a sense of some urgency would be welcome! The Prime Minister is urged to intervene with the Department for Transport to accelerate such action.",
