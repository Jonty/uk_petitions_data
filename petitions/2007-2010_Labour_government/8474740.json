To have religious leaders in positions of political leadership in a secular democracy is unacceptable, and something that has come to the forefront of the nations consciousness in light of the actions of Dr Rowan Williams in regard to the use of aspects of Sharia law within the British system. We demand that religious leaders are removed from our government with immediate effect.",
