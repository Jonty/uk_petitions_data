        "background": "Woodhouse Mill playing field and play grounds are in threat of being destroyed by the building of a road which is not realy required. Sheffield & Rotherham Councils have avoided to use alternative routes and would rather see our fields and residents homes demolished for it's construction.This road will bring extra pollution and traffic to our village giving the residents an unhealthy air pollution level and obvious loss of land for the children to play on.\nThe alternative route was originally accepted and agreed upon by Rotherham and sheffield councils but they have now chosen to go against ALL the resident wishes and do as they please without further consultation.\nThe traffic we have does not warrant another road to bring in more traffic.\nWE PETITION THE GOVERNMENT TO STAND BY THEIR 1997 MANIFESTO PROMISES & SAVE OUR PLAYING FIELD.",
