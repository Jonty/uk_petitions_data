            "background": "Christmas celebrations could be banned under Harriet Harman's controversial Equality Bill.\nPart of the evidence being considered by the Parliamentary committee examining the Bill, said: 'Under existing legislation, we have seen the development of a risk-averse culture with outcomes as ridiculous as reports of a local authority instructing tenants to take down Christmas lights in case they might offend Muslim neighbours, or of authorities removing the word Christmas out of cultural sensitivity to everyone except Christians.\nUK is a Christian society with freedom of speech and expression - this should not be allowed to happen!!!",
