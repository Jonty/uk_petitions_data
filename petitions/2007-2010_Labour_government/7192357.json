            "background": "To introduce a limit of fireworks allowed to enter the uk/the number of fireworks sold in the uk. With this in force i believe that it will push the price of the fireworks up and also limit the number sold. It may encourage the \"fire work season\" to return to 1 day of the year instead of the 2 weeks either side of 5th of november. The limitation of number would also reduce injurys and encourage general members to go to \"organised displays\" \nI hope that you can give the problem of the \"firewoks \" the attention it deserves",
