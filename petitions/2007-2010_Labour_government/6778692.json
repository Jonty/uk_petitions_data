            "background": "Brooklands is a disused motor racing circuit and airfield built near Weybridge in Surrey, England. It was opened on June 17, 1907. The central area including the hard runway and remaining racetrack was sold to DaimlerChrysler UK Retail in early 2004. Mercedes-Benz World opened to the public on 29 October 2006 and incorporates a test track. The facilities also include a conference centre and a Mercedes-Benz showroom. Other stores which reside on the small retail park include a Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Mothercare, Currys and Argos.\nThe central area of Brooklands including the hard runway and remaining racetrack was sold to DaimlerChrysler UK Retail in early 2004. A Mercedes-Benz museum and performancedemonstration centre is now completed in front of the remaining banking. The facilities also include a conference centre and a Mercedes-Benz showroom. Other stores also reside on the small retail park.\n\nI would like to see these new developments located elsewhere and for the site to be turned back into an active airfield for civil flying. This would be popular with aviation enthusiasts and wouls also bring tourists into the area.",
