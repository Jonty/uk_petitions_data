            "background": "The road markings on the gyratory system, especially by Rugby School and at the Bilton Road/Russelheim Way junction are very unclear and lead to frustration, confusion, near misses, and far from improving traffic flow, actually cause the opposite to happen.  It is clear from letters to the local papers that many drivers are unclear about rights of way within the system, which could be improved if the Highways department repainted the road and put some signs up.",
