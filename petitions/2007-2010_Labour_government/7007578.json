        "action": "Introduce beach safety public information films for broadcast on mainstream TV channels",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We frequently hear of tragic deaths that could have been avoided if those involved understood the dangers that they are exposed to when visiting the beach, either at home or abroad. Many surfers will be able to tell of the times they have gone to the rescue of swimmers caught out by powerful currents. Even after rescue the victims often haven't a clue how much danger they were in. \n\nBeach goers can also frequently be seen swimming near rocks, paddling an inflatable in a 20mph offshore wind, glowing red from lack of sun protection, limping from the water after stepping on a weaver fish etc. etc.\n\n5 minute public information films similar to those broadcast years ago on road safety, HIV awareness and other issues could go a long way towards increasing people's awareness of beach and sea dangers, and potentially save many lives.\n\nSpend a couple of hours watching at the beach and see how many unnecessary risks are taken through ignorance and complacency.",
