        "background": "The aim of this petition is to make motorcycles more acceptable within the Uk. I love motorcycles and it angers me to see many people within the UK frown upon people that ride them as though they are criminals. Another thing that annoys me about it is that the government greatly exaggerate any figures to do with motorcycling and this does not help our image. All many motorcyclists want to do is to sink into the background and not cause anybody any problems and because of the governments stance on motorcycles and the crazy figures being churned out we cannot do this.",
