The site is the old South Leicester Coal Disposal Point, off Beveredge Lane, Ellistown, Leicestershire.",

            "background": "Residents working with the Friends of Ellistown Wildlife Garden (www.ellistownwildlifegarden.org) are greatly angered by North West Leicestershire District Councils plans to develop this site for industrial purposes. The Planning application is now being managed by the Government Office for the East Midlands on behalf of the Secretary of State, due to its immense controversial nature. Previously a coal disposal point till the late 1980's, the site has been recolonised with a huge variety of wildlife from Otters in the River Sence along its border, to Grass Snakes, Great Crested Newts and Orchids. The site has the entire infrastructure for a country park with miles of disused railway line that will make a fantastic cycle path network into the Town of Coalville and the larger village of Ibstock. We can all see the potential here for a fantastic green space for recreational purposes whilst safeguarding a much important green wedge. Gordon Brown and Hazel Blears please help us!",
