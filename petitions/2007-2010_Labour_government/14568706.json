            "background": "There is no incentive for ISP providers to upgrade the local exchanges because end users have to pay for what they can get if they want an internet connection.  \nFor example, if an end user is paying for a 2MB line and only gets 500KB then they should only pay a quarter of the charge the ISP charges for a 2MB line.  This should encourage them to upgrade rubbish services quickly to maintain their revenue stream which they otherwise probably won't do.",
