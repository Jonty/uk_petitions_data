            "action": "Refrain from holding a General Election until at least 3 months AFTER the new register is issued in December 2007, to avoid disenfranchisement of a million electors, to ensure that postal voting software is working properly, to ensure that threatened postal strikes cannot undermine the democratic process and to ensure that the results of the election are therefore above reproach.",

            "background": "Electoral Registrars and the Electoral Commission have both indicated that if a General Election is held now, this will cause enormous difficulties for the Electroal process - the register will be out of date and up to a million of those wishing to vote may not be able to register in time in an appropriate way - or may be confused by the need to register separately from the standard canvas forms.  In adition, failures in earlier elections of software supporting postal voting have not been put right, or where corrected have not been adequately tested.  on top of which, threatened postal strikes could cause chaos to the electoral process.  This is a wholly inappropriate time to hold a completely unnecessary election, and should it happen the process would be thoroughly anti-democratic.",
