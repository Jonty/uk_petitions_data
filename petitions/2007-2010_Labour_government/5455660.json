Let us provide equality of care for the mentally ill, as any of our healthy young people and adults have access too. It is their basic human right in an age of equality.\nMainstream colleges are not funded,ready or equipped for the next generation of young people who cannot cope in the mainstream. They require time and a stepping stone of care in a non-medical environment\n\nThis health area needs more enlightened funding, both for now and future generations to come. With the figures 1 in 4 surely this is a very serious area of the NHS to be addressed,urgently.\nIt could be you next. \nLife is very fragile.\nSincerely \nHelen Drury",
