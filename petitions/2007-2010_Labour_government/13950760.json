            "background": "Landfill methane gas currently escapes to the atmosphere in the majority of landfill sites in the UK, methane gas is 20 times more harmful than Co2 as a green house gas. Each landfill site can produce 15000 litres of methane gas per day, there are over 2000 landfill sites in England. Using methane gas as a fuel for transport and for homes will benefit both the environment and the economy. The two by products of burning methane gas are Co2 and water. By burning methane for use in transport and in the home you reduce the harmful greenhouse gases by 19 times and boost the economy by providing a supply of cheap fuel.",
