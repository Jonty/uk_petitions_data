            "background": "We oppose all Tony Blair\u2019s attempts to become President of Europe because his appointment would mean further erosion of the valuable separation between American and European policy on defence and trade affairs. \n\nTony Blair's history of judgements in international matters means such an appointment would create complex internal conflict. His record of submission to American interests in international economic policy and global conflicts -notably Iraq, Israel and Palestine - has proven him ill-equipped to ably represent the interests of Europe.",
