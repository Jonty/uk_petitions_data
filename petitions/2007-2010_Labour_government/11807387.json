            "background": "The Royal Deer Parks in South West London, Richmond and Bushy,are widely used for sports and leisure activities. Users come from London and beyond. The Parks are poorly served by public transport and many users, of necessity, arrive by car. The available parking space has been reduced and now parking charges, applicable at all times, are proposed. This will penalise those who follow the Department of Health advice to visit their local parks and \"move more\". Those hardest hit will be the daily users, the pram pushers and dog walkers.",
