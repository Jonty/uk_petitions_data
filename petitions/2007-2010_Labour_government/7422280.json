        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As Britain's roads become more and more congested, accidents are becoming more and more likely to occur. Congestion also contributes to CO2 emissions which are a likely cause of climate change. People are unlikely to voluntarily relinquish their own means of transport.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the amount of traffic on britain's roads, we petition the PM to impose a recurring driving test at 5 year intervals. With the MoT test occuring every year to inspect whether a vehicle is roadworthy or not, it would seem sensible to check if the driver of said vehicle is fit to drive. This would cut the congestion, ensure that the drivers remaining are safe.\n\nFurthermore, it would ensure that more senior drivers who never had to take a test to get their driver's lisence would be forced to take a test and thus prove that they are roadworthy.",
