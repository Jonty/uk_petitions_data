The deal, negotiated by the government, will see hundreds of thousands of letters sent to net users suspected of illegally sharing music. Hard core file-sharers could see their broadband connections slowed. Broadband in UK is already a joke (your lucky if you get one half of the promised speed), now with this agreement, nothing is going stop ISPs from cutting the speed to everyone and thousands of people being treated like criminals and spyed on by their ISPs.",
