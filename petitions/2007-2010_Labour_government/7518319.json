            "background": "On 6th December the DCSF announced the suspension of adoptions from Guatemala due to \"long standing concerns about the adoption process\".\n\nDespite this information they have continued to issue Certificates of Eligibility to families all the while knowing that they were going to suspend adoptions.\n\nFamilies have been instructed by the DCSF to proceed with notarizing and legalizing their documents and acted in good faith and at great expense both emotionally and financially - only to be told that they now cannot proceed because their papers have not left the UK.  \n\nMost families who have reached this stage have been committed to the process for at least a year, sometimes considerably longer, and all the paperwork is based on Guatemala.  To change to another country at this stage will take many months and thousands of pounds and families will have to be re-approved for a new country by an adoption panel.  Some families may not be eligible for another country.\n\nWe feel that it is absolutely reasonable to expect that if the Certificate of Eligibility has been issued then this should be honoured and families allowed to proceed with their adoptions from Guatemala.",
