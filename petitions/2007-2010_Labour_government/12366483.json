The project is currently under investigation by the European Commission for failures to carry out a proper public safety assessment and a further failure to inform local residents of the real risks posed by the site. We respectfully feel that Her Majesty should be protected from becoming involved in so toxic an issue until doubts over both the public\u2019s, and indeed the Queen\u2019s, safety in Milford Haven are resolved.",
