Muslim demonstrators inciting violence and hatred in full view of the police and the press. They were protected by Police, who protected our troops? Nothing was done or was seen to be done, 2 people who took offence to the Muslim hatred were arrested, why not arrest those who were inciting the violence? Our troops were subject to terrible abuse.How was this allowed to happen? Is not inciting hatred and violence against the law; Or are the Muslims who live here above our laws now? This country is going to the dogs in a hand cart.",
