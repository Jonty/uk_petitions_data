            "background": "It is truly sick-making to see the atrocities and blatant Human Rights horrors inflicted by that melagomaniac despot Mugabe on the people of Zimbabwe and the world sits back and does absolutely nothing. Blair sent troops into Iraq, which is NOT our problem, and as events have turned out, was a false alarm perpetrated by America. But then Zim doesn't have oil does it? It is \"only\" another independent black nation.  Truly has the british bulldog lost its teeth. Not a trace of the old Empire. Too much concern over world opinion. Send a task forcce to Zim, and lets hold our heads up. Whats wrong with No: 10? Would ANYONE here like to walk aven 1 day in one of their starving brutalised shoes? Makes one ashamed to be British.",
