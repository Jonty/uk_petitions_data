            "background": "instead of the second chamber forever being locked in a political football  game, why not connect the general public direct to government law making.\nWhy does monies have to go to the same old people in circles of power who always get it, there are people who have life experience who could spend a term of eg 5 years  and it would reconnect ordinary people to law making and means we take some responsability. With the jury selection system which already sucessfully exists, could be set for an age group and would mean all communities and gender equally represented.Plus if a law can't be understood by its people surely its a bad law.But with training and expert support i'm sure we could cope with technicalities, after all the old duffers did for years. cheers",
