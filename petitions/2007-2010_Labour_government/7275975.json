        "background": "There were two reports in my paper on 17/11/07.  The first concerned someone who had sent bomb hoax threats to a major supermarket chain; he was told he faced a long gaol sentence.  \n\nThe second concerned a man who KILLED someone by running into him while riding a bike on the pavement (which I thought was illegal anyway; if it isn't it should be) at 25 M.P.H.  Witnesses were quoted as saying he was going \"like a bat out of hell\" downhill and he was warned that he was going to kill someone; for this he was given a derisory SUSPENDED sentence of 12 months plus 300 hours' community work.  \n\nHow can anyone make sense of such contrasting sentences?  The bomb hoax threats might have caused alarm (though the report doesn't say that; only that the supermarket lost \u00a315 million) but no one lost their LIFE!",
