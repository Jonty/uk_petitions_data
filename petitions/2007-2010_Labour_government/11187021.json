            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Since the Government is asking all businesses to pass on the VAT reduction announced in the pre-budget report, it would only seem fair if the Government itself passed on the reduction by lowering the tolls. If the tolls are not reduced, since the company is only paying the Government 15% VAT, the tolls have effectively been increased by stealth. Vague promises of future benefits will not help the economy NOW which was the whole point of the VAT reduction.",
