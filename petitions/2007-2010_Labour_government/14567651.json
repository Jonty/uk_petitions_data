        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The purpose of this petition is to persuade the government to abolish VAT on petrol/diesel for disabled people.\nThis could either be upon purchase of the petrol/diesel, or by reclaiming the VAT at the end of the financial year.\nThe cost of remaining mobile can be very high and anything that can help would be beneficial.\nThe amount that is paid through VAT on an average full tank of fuel costing \u00a360 is \u00a310.50. That \u00a310.50 over a year could mean that at least one more full tank of fuel could be purchased. Therefore giving the disabled person a bit more freedom and independence.",
