            "background": "A month ago my 13year old Grandchild was the victim of a random assault by a group of youths. A broken jaw, cracked cheekbone, broken nose and endless nightmares later the group responsible still haven't been punished. And what devastates me is that there are hundreds of young children out there who are attacking people, robbing and vandalizing homes, cars and public property and are either getting away with it or only serving half their time. There needs to be harsher punishments in place so that children are scared of committing such awful crimes and thus making our neighborhoods safer places to live.\n\nIf you are fed up of reading similar, horrific stories in the paper every day and would like our streets to be safer, then PLEASE PLEASE get involved and add your signature and we can work together to make our homes safer to live in.",
