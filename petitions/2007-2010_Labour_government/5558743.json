Full-time students from families with incomes of up to \u00a325,000 will be entitled to the maximum grant, compared to the 2006/07 threshold of \u00a317,500. In addition, students from families with incomes of up to \u00a360,000 will also now be entitled to a partial grant - meaning a third of students from 2008/09 onwards will now receive a full grant (worth \u00a32,825 a year) and a further third of students will receive a partial grant. \n\nFor example, for a student from a household on \u00a325,000 a year earnings, this will mean an extra \u00a31,100 a year in maintenance grant.
