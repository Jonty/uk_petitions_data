            "background": "As we are trying to stabilise the economy I feel that by giving the large sums of money to first time home buyers only, it would mean that the housing industry could begin building homes for these beleaguered buyers. My suggestion is \u00a380000.00 paid back over thirty years at \u00a3250.00 pounds a month netting the treasury \u00a310000.00 per loan. As most people living in Britain should be able to afford this monthly payment plus their council tax payment, I would suggest it less likely for them to have their property taken into possession.",
