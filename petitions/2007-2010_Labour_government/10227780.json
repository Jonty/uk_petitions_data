            "background": "The right for a disabled person to parent a child without prejudice is not mentioned in the disability discrimination act.  We have rights to education, jobs, flat access buildings and transport but there is no protection against discrimination in our parenting role and there are statistically more parents who are disabled that have their children removed or are put under pressure from social services purely on the basis of disability. A parenthood amendment would give us the same freedom to raise our children as able parents currently have.",
