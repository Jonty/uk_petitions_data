            "background": "Since some holy texts are misinterpreted by extremists the government should phase in legislation requiring all texts involving deities and/or prophets within a place of worship to be written in English within 3 years. Other languages such as the original language may also be included provided that they are placed side by side for ease of reference and comparison. In the case of there being multiple possible translations then all possible forms of translation should be shown. This will allow followers of a religion to be able to see what the text really says rather than believe whatever the religious leader claims is in the text, as some religious texts are only written in a language that the majority of followers do not understand.",
