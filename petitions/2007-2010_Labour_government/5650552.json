            "background": "The minimum speed limit in urban & village areas has for circa 70 years been 30 M.P.H., originally effectively higher as vehicle braking systems post circa mid-1980s enable much shorter stopping distances.\nFor 10 years there has been a growth in unnecessary 20 M.P.H. limits in both urban and rural areas, even some main roads in the London area where 30 M.P.H. would still have been adequate.\nOne ridiculous example of a rural 20 M.P.H. limit is outside a school at Burton, Christchurch, Dorset, where until circa 1994 the wide and clear main road with a pavement, had a safe 40 M.P.H. reduced to 30 M.P.H., then about two years ago the limit was reduced to 20 M.P.H. with a speed table and speed humps installed. I suspect this was really to discourage through traffic!\nI request that all fixed 20 M.P.H. speed limits are scrapped. 20 M.P.H. should only be used as the lowest option for enforced, (by uniformed police), variable speed limits outside some schools with genuine road safety issues.",
