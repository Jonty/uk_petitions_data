            "background": "its a total disgrace how the government has let the military down over the last twenty years with cut backs after cut backs. We are no longer capable of supporting or fighting the war against terror in afgantstan. no more than the 120,000 russains were in the last two decades. Stop lying and for once in your lives start to put money into the forces and develop a credibe fighting force. and no i dont want excuses about two carriers being built for the future. the battle is now and from what the public can see daily in the press, were loosing. and loosing young men because of government failure.",
