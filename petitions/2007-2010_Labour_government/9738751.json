The people in them hold down manual jobs,not a lot wrong with them,  or are income support scroungers, just plain lazy.\nAs always there are genuine people, and that should be assessed, but if you think how many of these cars are about it must be costing US, yes US a fortune in taxes. It also seems every person when they reach 65 think they are entitled to one, as a FREE gift, they get free tax, insurance, tyres exhausts, all they have to put in is petrol.",
