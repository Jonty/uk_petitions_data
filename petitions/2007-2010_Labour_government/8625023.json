            "background": "All of the A1 from London to Scotland is dual carriageway, except for this particular stretch. It is extremely congested during working hours with large lorries going at 40 miles per hour, and creating extremely long queues for all vehicles. Although it is signposted warning against too much speed, there are still numbers of accidents on this piece of roadway.\nWe also believe that it casts the Northumberland authorities and the Government in an extremely poor light in terms of the lack of importance they give to one of the two routes from England to Scotland",
