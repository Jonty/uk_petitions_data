Under this plan,one adult in a property would only pay 50% of the tax instead of 75%, a couple would pay 100%, three adults would pay 125%, four or more 150%.It combines the best of the council tax where the property value usually has at least some resemblance to a person's ability to pay, with the poll tax idea that the more people there are, the more is to be paid. Pensioners could be excluded or charged at a lower rate that reflects their lower earnings.",
