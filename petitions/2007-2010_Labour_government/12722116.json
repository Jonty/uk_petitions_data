            "background": "The Welsh Assembly gives a grant to Welsh students who choose to study at a Welsh university equalling half the tuition fees for that university. Students from elsewhere in the UK are not entitled to this grant and pay the full tuition fees. However, European students are treated the same as Welsh students, and so they receive this grant, thereby creating a system which discriminates against some British students for studying in their own country. We petition the government to correct this issue by ensuring European students do not receive any such grant.",
