            "background": "The current petition don't cover the important fact that digital broadcasts require vasty amounts more energy than FM, both broadcasting and receiving. This was highlighted by my wind-up digital/FM radio, 30 seconds wind gets 30 minutes FM play, you must wind continuosly for Digital. I thought the government wanted to save energy, not waste it? The sound quality improvements are not close to the sound and video improvements of TV, and I see no real reason to turn off FM.",
