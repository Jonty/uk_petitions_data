        "background": "I am sick of seeing on the news criminals being taken into court with their faces covered by pixelation. Or when there is a story in the paper about a crime where the person/s accused are protected by the useless Human Rights Act, but the person it has happened to is shown through the papers with personal and past matters brought up which sometimes causes more crime to be made. For example vigilantes.\n\nWe need to know who these people are so everytime they walk down the street they know and feel like they are the scum of the earth.\n\nMaybe that will cause some people to think twice about even committing the crime in the first place. Because at this time they know they are protec ted by the goverment",
