            "background": "The Football Association (FA) enforce a rule that sees football players all over the country frequently recieve punishment in the form of bookings for celebrating a goal and there are general guidelines in place which suggests when a celebration brings the game into disrepute. \n\nLong gone are the days when players who score a last gasp injury time winner can celebrate a goal by running into into the crowd or even removing their shirt. Most fans find this rule unnecessary and feel that it removes passion from an otherwise passionate game.  \n\nThis petition is asking that the FA change this rule back to how it was and maybe in place ask that a new rule is instated in which it is the referees call as to whether the celebration is seen as bringing the game into disrepute.",
