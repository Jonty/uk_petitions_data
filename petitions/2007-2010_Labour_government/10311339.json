            "background": "The 2003 act allowing homosexuals to take part in civil partnerships was a significant milestone in the fight for freedom of sexuality in the UK. However, recent events have seen people being allowed to refuse to take part in administering these marriages. This is a potentially dangerous move and one wonders at what point we need to draw a line - gay people being deprived of medical help because of the personal beliefs of the practitioner? It is clear that something must be done to ensure that the recent advances in gay rights continue to liberate thousands of homosexuals and that bigotry does not get in the way of this.",
