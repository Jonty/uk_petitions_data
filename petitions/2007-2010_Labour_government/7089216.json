            "background": "In some countries, such as France, motorway lighting is kept at a minimum. This not only saves Energy, (thereby reducing the UK \"carbon footprint\") but also means that a) People drive more safely. Because more attention is required whilst driving people drive slower to increase their reaction time and b) Less light pollution means more enjoyment of the night sky ( astronomers etc )\n\nEvery motorway and hundreds of \"A\" Roads/Dual Carriageways would hardly be affected at all - if just \"EVERY OTHER\" light was extinguished, but this would still save a Massive amount of Energy - saving money which would be put to better use on more essential services such as Policing, Health, State Pensions etc.",
