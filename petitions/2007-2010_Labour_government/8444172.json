            "background": "I propose that the government implements a leaflet tax for printers of professional leaflets. I like many others receive hundreds of leaflets through the letterbox, by post or within newspapers that are immediately disposed of without a moments thought. By implementing a tax, this will make retailers carefully consider their audience rather than just entire street plus support local authority recycling schemes.",
