            "background": "Every year hopeful students apply to universities through out the United Kingdom with the hope of gaining entry into their desired institution, and every year many are given a life changing opportunity whilst others are left heartbroken.  \n\nMany unsuccessful candidates wonder why they were rejected as universities often fail to provide adequate reasons to why and how they reached a conclusion on a certain application. This is why we the people of Britain want it to be compulsory for all universities which receive any type of government assistance or funding to provide free individual reports and written reasons indicating why an applicant was given a certain decision.  \n\nAlso, all universities should release detailed admissions statistics indicating the number of students from: different backgrounds; income brackets; state or independent school; grades etc, they accepted in the last year for example 20% of applicants with 3 A\u2019s were given an offer etc. \n\nOnly when candidates know why they were unsuccessful can they progress onwards and improve so that they can achieve their full potential. After all, today\u2019s applicant is tomorrow\u2019s worker and tax payer.",
