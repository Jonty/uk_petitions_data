            "background": "As a non-smoker who is made physically sick by the smell of tobacco smoke, I have to say that the ban has made things worse, not better. I used to be able to walk into a pub via the door to the non-smoking area. The smoke from the smoking area did not reach me, and everybody got what they wanted. Now, whenever I enter a pub, I have to walk through a group of smokers. They have been forced outside by ill-thought-out legislation and I have to breathe in fumes that make me feel sick. The same applies at my place of work: when smokers had their own room, they could smoke without it affecting me. Now they smoke outside and the entrance area to the building where I work smells disgusting. The old system worked - bring it back.",
