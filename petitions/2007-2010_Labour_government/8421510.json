            "background": "The law/legislation giving power to Local Education Authorities to threaten or actually prosecute parents for their child's truancy is not an 'effective' way of supporting parents who are already under duress in dealing with their child's behaviour.  The ultimate penalty of fines/imprisonment and the resulting criminal record undermines a parent's ability to deal with the situation when their own careers and livelihoods are in jeopardy.  Make the child culpable.\nThe LEAs' Welfare Officers should put forward to the Minister of Education and the Home Office the total number of parents that have had this procedure commenced against them. The initial intention of this legislation was not to be a blanket policy against caring parents.",
