            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Digital Britain proposal to switch off national analogue radio broadcasts in 2015 will render all current non-digital radios obsolete.   \n\nMany people rely on these for news, information, entertainment and companionship at home and in their cars.\n\nPensioners and people on low incomes will be particularly badly affected.\n\nPeople will be forced to buy new digital radios, which are expensive to buy.  These are often more bulky and heavy than many analogue radios; if used on batteries they are often more expensive to run as they use batteries faster.  Many people will not be able to afford this and will lose the use of their current radios, so increasing their isolation.\n\nThere is no need to turn off this signal.  It is a vital public service, every bit as important as broadband connections.   The government should change its mind on this.",
