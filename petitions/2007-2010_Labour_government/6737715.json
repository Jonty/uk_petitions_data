His had a number of failings including using our British troops as spin. Now that Gordon Brown has slid down in the polls he has ruled out an election this year and next. \n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be his decision to make and the British voters should have a right to an election no mater what party you vote for. \n\nIn one way denying us a vote makes Gordon Brown just as bad as the Military rule in Burma.",
