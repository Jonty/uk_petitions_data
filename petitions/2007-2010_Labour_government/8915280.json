            "background": "We feel it is grossly unfair that VAT at the full rate is payable by elderly people living in their own homes for essential services such as cleaning and grocery shopping. The Organisations excluded from VAT at present are services that are provided either by charities, government run or controlled businesses. We feel that the VAT should be EXEMPT no matter who is providing this essential service. Anything else is unfair, uncompetitive and wrong.",
