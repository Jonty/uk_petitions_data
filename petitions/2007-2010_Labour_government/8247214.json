A national apology should be issued to all of the witches which were either burnt, drowned or otherwise harmed by the inhabitants of this country.  Also they should, in the cases where there is insufficient evidence to prove otherwise, be issued a full state-pardon for their supposed crimes.\n\nThis should be extended to warlocks too, who were also unjustly hounded.",
