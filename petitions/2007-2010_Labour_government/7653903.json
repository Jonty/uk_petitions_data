This is a large administrative burden on small companies.\n\nThe government should compensate businesses who have to wait more than one month for their VAT number at a decent rate per day (i.e. \u00a350 - \u00a3100 per day) over the 30 day mark. This will give HMRC an incentive to fast track applications.",
