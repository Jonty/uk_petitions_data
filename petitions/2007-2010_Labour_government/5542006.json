Please read the caption below and sign this petition this could happen to you, please help me to stop this happing to more and more innocent people like me and you..\n\nWell so I have and I want to get the law changed.  Someone at my o9ld address has done over 30 credit searches in mine and my girlfriends name and even opened 18 mail order accounts in my girlfriends name.  After taken what I though should be a police matter to the police they dismissed me saying that their has been no crime committed against me only against the companies so they couldn\u2019t even go round and speak to the people doing it unless the companies report it.  i spoke to the companies and they said that it would cost too mush money to report it so they wont.\n\nSo this is why I have set this petition up to get as many signatures in, in an attempt to change the law sop that the police land government look after the people in the correct way they should and not look after the criminals",
