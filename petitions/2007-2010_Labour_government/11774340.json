At this stage it is too early to understand what the full consequences will be but it is clear that they are likely to be very severe.  \n\nThe appearance of the ex Chairmen and CEOs of the RBS and HBOS before the Treasury Select Committee on the 10 Feb 2009 failed to properly uncover the factors which led or contributed to the huge losses suffered by RBS and HBOS . It is essential that the causes of the problems in the UK banking Sector, particularly those at RBS and HBOS, are properly understood so that appropriate lessons can be learned and measures put in place to prevent the possibility of a recurrence\n\nOnly a full Public Enquiry can be relied on to get to properly get to the bottom of this issue.",
