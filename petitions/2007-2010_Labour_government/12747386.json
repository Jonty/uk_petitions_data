Cabinet reshuffles just move bad ministers around so the can wreck other departments. They don't understand the role of the department, they are just pen pushers who can't fill in their own tax returns. The Monarchy will care for their subjects, and listen to the advisors. The money saved from paying MPs and their expenses will pay for the Monarchy extra duties.",
