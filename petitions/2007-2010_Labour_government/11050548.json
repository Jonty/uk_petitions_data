            "background": "Dear Mr Brown, \n\nWords cannot express how I personnal feel about Baby P the 17 month poor soul who was so badly abused by those who should have cared for him. Sorry but no excuse are valid, by either the mother!!if she can be called that!or the two bullies that abused this poor child. As for ths Social Department well here we have another cold woman Ms Sharon Shoesmith, how she is still in employment goes beyond belief. The whole department knew what was going on, surely 50 to 60 visits would be enough to take some steps to take the child away from danger. As for the doctor who \"examined\" him he should be struck off the Medical Register, the least, because as far as I am concerned I personnally think they should all be brought to court to answer for their lack of care. How can an 17 month baby be treated this way, is beyond belief.Please, do something about this case, if not for just to stop any more of this kind horror happening. I am sure you must feel as angry as I being a parent yourself, so please for the love of Almighty God do something. \n\nyours sincerely  \nRosina Di Meo",
