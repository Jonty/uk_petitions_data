            "background": "In June 2005 an Early Day Motion, supported by 100 cross party MPs, was put before the House of Commons. This motion stated it recognised 'the grave injustice' that he was not awarded a VC. However nothing came of it. \nBlair 'Paddy' Mayne was one of the founder members of the SAS, alongside David Stirling and led the regiment throughout World War 2. In 1945 Mayne was recommended for a VC after single handedly rescuing a squadron of his troops under gunfire, lifting the wounded into his jeep and then destroying the enemy gunners. However he was refused a VC and was only granted a fourth Distinguished Service Order. Mayne was tragically killed in a car accident on 13th December 1955. We who sign this petition believe that his heroic actions throughout his military career and its subsequent legacy warrant the granting of the Victoria Cross he so rightfully deserved when he was alive.",
