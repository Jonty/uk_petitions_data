            "background": "If the government wants to turn this country into a greener nation we need to ensure that companies, schools, restaurants and all other commercial organisations are supported when going green. Currently, Commercial Recycling comes at a high price: at approximately \u00a350 per 50 recycling bags it is no wonder many of society's biggest polluters don't recycle. Private households recycle for free (paid for by tax money) although being the smaller polluter.",
