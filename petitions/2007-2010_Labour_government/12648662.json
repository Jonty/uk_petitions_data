            "background": "Around Glasgow, pubs and clubs are no longer allowed to give customers special offers, such as discount vouchers/cards, to try and help stop binge drinking. This is effecting sensible people, the majority of citizens, from going out to socialise with friends. Due to the recession and the price of alcohol rising once again not many people can afford to do it that often. This will also effect the businesses around Glasgow, that are already making some loses, that supply people with these needs. The British Government rightfully decided not to bring in the price per unit law, because it would effect the sensible citizens. We believe that the Glasgow City Council have not thought about all of the citizens and businesses that this is effecting.",
