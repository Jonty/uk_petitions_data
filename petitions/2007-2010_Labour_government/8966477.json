            "background": "It would seem that in this country the governments solution to alot of things is just to make it illegal. Laws on alcohol being one of them.\n\nWhen I turn 18 in a few weeks, alcohol is going to become amazingly easy to get hold of and get ridiculously drunk from. I'm most excited about it because I haven't been \"allowed\" to for 18 years so I feel a good binge is in order!\n\nIn many other European coutries none of this is an issue because by the time the citizens are 18 it isnt a novelty and the excitement isnt there, and alcohol is respected.\n\nThe more relaxed the laws are, the less young people will simply want the fun of rebelling.\n\nA group of my friends who are 16 and 17 are going out for a meal next week and liked the idea of having a glass of red with it. I explained that was no longer legal without a parent/guardian present so they are off to buy bottles of vodka instead.\n\nI would love to see how many people agree on this issue as it is certainly one I'm very passionate about!",
