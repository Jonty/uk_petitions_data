            "background": "Millions of adults appear to lack even the most basic cooking skills and we need a radical solution to break this cycle.\n\nThe Proposal:\n\n1. Get a group of the most popular and trusted chefs (including Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith,for example) to come up with a small number of VERY easy to cook,healthy yet tasty recipes. Simple classics,nothing fancy. Trial them to make sure they are genuinely popular among all social groups. Choose, say, ten, then call them \"The Ten\" or something,and get witty adverts everywhere promoting the project.\n\n2. Blitz the country with lessons on cooking \"The Ten\". Teach ALL secondary school kids, maybe in restaurant kitchens if schools can't do it. Give them for school dinners and invite the parents in. Get parents in to learn with their kids in the evening. All free.\n\n3. Get all supermarkets to have \"The Ten\" ingredients all in one prominent place- they could of course brag about having \"The Best Value Ten\" or \"The Organic Ten\" or whatever . People might buy them just out of convenience.\n\n4. Every 2 or 3 years there could be a vote of some kind on which recipes to drop/ add.",
