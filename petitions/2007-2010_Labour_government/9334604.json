This stretch of water is one of the most expensive to travel in the world.\nAs the Island is part of mainland UK the cost of services should be regulated by government policy.\nIsland residents very rarely receive reductions in fares making travel off the island extremely difficult especially for the low income bracket.\nHoliday-makers will not come to the island thereby ensuring we suffer from financial recession. Soon PARKHURST will not need a wall!!",
