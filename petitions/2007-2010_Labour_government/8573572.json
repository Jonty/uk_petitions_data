            "background": "Faith schools exist for the purpose of offering parents a choice of a school with a supernaturally-based ethos. This petition seeks the creation of a similar option for those who have no belief in the supernatural, but do have a strong belief in the good of atheism. Schools with an avowedly atheist ethos will provide a choice to parents who have been sidelined by the government's push for schools with a supernatural-based ethos in the name of choice, and with the unsupported assertion of increased morality being attributable to supernatural-based belief systems. We reject this, but only ask for schools that offer an ethos we can be confortable with. The lack of avowedly atheistic schools is a glaring hole in the governments choice-faith-diversity agenda. Open atheistic schools.",
