            "background": "The waste incinerator proposed by East Sussex County Council will dominate the town of Newhaven with two chimneys towering over everything around it at 230 feet high. The main building of the incinerator will be over 100 feet high and more than 500 feet long, again far larger than anything around it. \n\nThe site is on the edge of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and in a valley which is between the two halves of Newhaven and is often fog-bound in the winter months. \n\nThere is overwhelming opposition to the incinerator in the town and in neighbouring towns. The Town & District Councils are also against it and refused planning permission but the County Council is ignoring local opinion and five members of the planning committee approved permission despite more than 16,000 objections from the public.  \n\n\"Regeneration not incineration\"",
