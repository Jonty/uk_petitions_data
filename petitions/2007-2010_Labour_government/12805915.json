            "background": "The digital format is an inferior medium that gives erratic performance, unintelligible sound in poor reception, hilly & remote areas or at the extremities. It runs out of sync, on multiple devices depending upon the carrier of the digital signal, (The Greenwich time signal will become a multiple-guess option!). The vast cost of replacing FM radios in homes, cars and businesses will incur huge cost for listeners with no appreciable gain. The only moral option would be to compensate for each receiver owned. That would increase the cost of implementing the system hugely at a minimum of \u00a3100 (2 radios) per household. Items in a household that would be scrapped if this scheme went ahead: Radios, personal FM radios, bedroom alarm radios, HiFi alarm radios, conventional car radios, historic radios, stereo HiFi tuners, stereo HiFi receivers, older transistor radios, radiograms. etc. Older people would be greatly affected. The FM sound is of a warm and perfectly functional nature. It can be heard even with a great deal of background interference. Digital sound scrambles. This proposal is naive and will be far more expensive than initial costing has revealed. It is unnecessary.",
