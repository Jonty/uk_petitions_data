Given the lack of confidence in his leadership and his party he should resign.\n\nWith the current economic climate this country needs efficient, professional leadership and recognition from the leaders that the voters are having to tighten their belts considerably due to the recession and that we do not have time for MPs who manage to claim expenses for luxury items and in some cases, allegedly fraudulent claims.",
