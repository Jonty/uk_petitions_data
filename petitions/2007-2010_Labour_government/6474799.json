            "background": "Only \"British\" merchant seamen should be on ships that fly the \"Red Ensign\". \n\nIt is the \"British\" merchant navy, not the foreign merchant navy!  As a merchant seaman of 28 years who was replaced by foreigners, I feel let down by our government.  Gordon Brown, and Tony Blair, are always talking about being British, and how proud we all should be.  Rubbish!!  They talk about patriotism, and behind our backs they bring in foreigners to take over our jobs.  Now Brown is talking about \"British jobs for British nationals only\".  Hyprocrits, both of them!  They should never have allowed foreigners to work in Britain in the first place! \n\nAs far as the British merchant navy is concerned, I know it's too late for me now, as I just turned 61 on 15th Sepember 2007.  But, I would like to see British young men get the same chance to go to sea and have a great life as I did for 28 years, before they replaced me.",
