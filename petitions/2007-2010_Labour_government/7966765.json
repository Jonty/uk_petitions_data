            "background": "The price of Fuel is disgusting at the moment at over a \u00a31 a litre. The price rises have nothing to do with the lowering of green house gases but more to do with making more money. Local transport prices have risen and service has got no better.     People need to get to work and about and you know people will still drive. Money is tight  and our lorry drivers are finding it more difficult to compete with european countries. This is not on. stop the rises.",
