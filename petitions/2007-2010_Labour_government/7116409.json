This should be done by thorough investigations by historians, especially Turkish and Armenian historians into the time frame of the allegations, so we can find out the truth about what really happened, before another so called genocide monument is erected witout the backing of truth and facts, but the political influence of the rich and powerful Armenian lobby.",
