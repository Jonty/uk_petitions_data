Robbing a child of their identity should also apply as identity theft. Any attempts by an individual to falsify a childs legal surname on legal records such as school, doctor, dentist etc should be a criminal act.\nI have had the experience where my 7 year old son was masquerading by another surname at his primary school for two months before he \ntold me. Although exciting to him, I was disgusted that this should be allowed. \nA child's identity is a basic right that should be protected & enforced.",
