            "background": "Hundreds of thousands of sea turtles, whales and other marine mammals die every year from eating discarded plastic bags mistaken for food. Turtles think the bags are jellyfish, their primary food source. Once swallowed, plastic bags choke animals or block their intestines, leading to an agonizing death. \n\n\nOn land, many cows, goats and other animals suffer a similar fate to marine life when they accidentally ingest plastic bags while foraging for food. \n\n\nIn a landfill, plastic bags take up to 1,000 years to degrade. As litter, they breakdown into tiny bits, contaminating our soil and water. \n\nUsing paper bags in super markets etc will reduce the unnecessary death and the problems our environment is facing today.",
