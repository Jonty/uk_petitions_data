In reality, this group offers nothing but despair. \n\nThe case against HuT is clear. Britain offers unparalleled freedom and opportunity for all who live here. Yet HuT operates to undermine and ultimately overturn the democratic rights that every citizen enjoys in this country, irrespective of race or religion. \n\nWe do not put up with calls for violence. \n\nHuT went on to say that \u201cthe track record of Hizb ut-Tahrir over 50 years of its existence has been one of consistent nonviolent political activism\u201d. \n\nThat is a truly extraordinary example of double-talk.",
