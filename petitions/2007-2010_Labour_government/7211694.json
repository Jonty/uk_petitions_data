        "background": "It has been proven that cigarette smoke and excessive alcohol drinking is detrimental to health. \n\nPoor health increases the risk of certain illnesses developing, increasing the need for such people to visit the doctor more, therefore costing the NHS.\n\nWith almost all private medical insurance policies, premiums are much higher for those who smoke, or drink excessively.\n\nThe regular tax payer should not have to foot the bill for these people. \n\nThey should instead pay (a subsidised amount) for their NHS treatment for illness or emergencies directly caused by the either of the above factors.",
