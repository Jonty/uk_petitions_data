            "background": "Northumberland County Council has put forward a plan to close the Wentworth Leisure Indoor Bowling Green in Hexham. The Government plans to cut down on obesity and help young people to take more excercise and get off the streets and mix with older people in society. This plan will will be jeopardy. Not all young people play contact sports such football and or rugby. In addition the disabled,the blind,those with learning difficulties and those in wheel chairs will be deprived of the opportunity to play bowls. The closure will not help any of these peole who also play an active part in society. People in Hexham and the surrounding towns and villages use the facility and the closure would mean that there would be no where for the young people or    the disabled to develope their skills.",
