Yet we are the racist ones, why is it that if we are to tell the police a foreign citizen has racist towards us we are told its not racist as they are a minority, you may be right these foreign citizens may be a minority until you consider the number of illegal foreign citizens then it is surely us english citizens that are the minority. When will labour realise what it is doing to england and stop england from being invaded this is not racism this is just a simple fact that england should give english citizens priority are ancestors fought so hard to stop our country from being invaded in WW1 and WW2 yet now we just seem to be letting our country be invaded and slowly taken other.",
