            "background": "The MP for Neath (Peter Hain) has broken the law by not declaring funds received for his deputy leadership campaign. Indeed, a large tranche has gone to a group called 'Progressive Policies Forum' - which appears to have no relevance in fighting a deputy leadership campaign. Given that the law has been broken - and that monies have gone unaccounted -  we believe that the police should investigate to ensure neither fraud nor corruption have been perpetrated. It should be made clear that this petition is an entirely apolitical request; we the undersigned petition for this action, in order to safeguard the democratic processes of this nation.",
