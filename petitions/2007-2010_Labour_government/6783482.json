        "background": "Most lorries and buses now have speed limiters to prevent speeding on motorways and other major roads. I think these should be fitted to cars of serious convicted speeders. By serious I mean dangerous boy racers and middle-aged bully boys in powerful cars on the motorways who think they can 'flash' their way through traffic at 100mph. This would punish them and stop them driving like idiots",
