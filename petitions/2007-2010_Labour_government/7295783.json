            "background": "Fairport Convention is an institution that has seen many of the UK's finest folk musicians pass through its ranks - Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson, Dave Swarbrick, Ashley Hutchins to name a few, and it continues to tour today with an equally talented bunch of new whippersnappers alongside veterans Simon Nicol and Dave Pegg. The band was responsible for the annual Cropredy festival that grows yearly and, along with other festivals, helps keep the traditional music of these islands' alive and inspires younger musicians to carry them on.",
