            "background": "Many children find main stream high schools hard. I was one of them. I found school harder than most what with bullies and peer pressure. This probably cost me some results.\n\nI had an idea today of how to combat this issue. Those pupils in schools who do find mainstream significantly more difficult than the majority should have the opportunity to do their last year of school in college to study their GCSE's in a mature, more relaxed atmosphere away from the school bullies and had case teachers. A relaxed atmosphere will help these pupils who find school more stressful than the others.\n\nI really do think that this would not only help bring stress relief from the few pupils but would also increase pass rates.\n\nIt has been proven that some people mature earlier than others and so I do not see why they should have a few bullies cost them results.",
