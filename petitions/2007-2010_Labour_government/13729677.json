        "background": "I have gone into further educaion but do not recieve EMA as my parents earn above the limit to recieve it. Many students that go to the 6th form that i am studying at, also do not recieve EMA, we all think that people who choose to study in further education believe that we should recieve some money as EMA (\u00a315 - \u00a320) This would help most of the students as it is very hard to find jobs with the current recession that is taking place.",
