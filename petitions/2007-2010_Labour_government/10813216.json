            "background": "Due to a court case held within the past year to do with hair regulations in schools, the question has been brought to mind to many British citizens minds about the issue of human rights failing to be reflected in school regulations.\n\nSome time ago the issue of a girl wearing trousers into school also raised questions about human rights as it was clearly stated in regulations that skirts were to be worn. The girls case was done under sexism claims that boys were able to wear trousers and girls were not.\n\nThis is a similar case as in many schools girls are permitted long hair whereas boys are not, this is clearly an unfair rule for any school to be allowed to enforce as it seemingly permits sexism in schools.\n\nI believe this is a matter which should be considered very carefully as matters like these may become a problem in schools within the next few years as further questions are raised.\n\nIf you agree that this is a matter that should be resolved and that people should have the freedom of choice as to how they look please sign the petition below.",
