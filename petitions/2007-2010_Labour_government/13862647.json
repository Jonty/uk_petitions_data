            "background": "Since 1999 with the attempted assassination of the tribal leader Sardar Nisar Ali Khan and the death of his driver, incidents of violence have escalated with little control by the authorities.\n\nThe invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, prompted a resurgence in Hazara killings, suspected to be performed by Wahabi extremists. \n\nA group of campaigners called the Hazara International Forum took part in a protest at Downing Street on the 27th of October to publicise the cause, and were joined by MEP Jean Lambert. They met with Gordon Brown and asked him to use his influence with Pakistani Prime Minister Yusaf Raza Gilani to address the killings in Quetta as soon as possible.",
