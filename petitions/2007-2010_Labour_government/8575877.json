The sheer arrogance of the current government, who are by definition servants of the public, is reprehensible. If people feel strongly enough to create a petition, sign it and present it to the Government it should be taken seriously. At the moment this government seems only to pay lipservice to the concept of democracy, while the democratic process is being completely eroded in this nation, along with the civil liberties that our fathers and grandfathers fought and died to protect. Honour your promises to serve the nation by taking direction from the nation itself. I have little hope that this petition will even be published, but here is hoping.",
