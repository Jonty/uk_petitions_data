            "background": "Prime minister, we the people would like punishment to include some form of hard labour.  For instance if someone gets two years jail, three months would be of hard labour in a chain gang with 21 months of education and training, depending on the severity of the crime.  Re-offenders would serve their full sentence doing hard labour, thus achieving both punishment and rehabilitation.",
