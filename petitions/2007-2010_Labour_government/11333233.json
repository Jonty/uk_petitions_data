            "background": "Many tabloid newspapers report crime, even crime of a sexual nature. For example, where a criminal has been convicted of a sexual offense on the same page or opposite pictures of models, actresses and singers designed to appeal to the sexual nature of some of their readers. Meaning the readers are increasingly likely to look on the victims of the crime in a sexualised manner. Which in turn could be seen as degrading to the victims and their families and friends.",
