        "background": "I think it is wrong to have sex with your cousin and be able to marry and have children with them. This should be made ilegal as they are still a member of your family. if a person is related to you no matter how long distant then it is wrong. If you have a child with a member of your family there are high risks of that child having savere dissabilities,and all those people out there that are haiving sexual relations with a family member should take this into consideration. why should an inoccent child live a life of pain through dissabilites because there parents were selfish and couldn't find some one outside there family. Through the actions of people like this is why sociaty is dragged down, it's people like this that give our country a bad name. Please think of all those inoccent children who are disabled because of this, and make this ilegal.",
