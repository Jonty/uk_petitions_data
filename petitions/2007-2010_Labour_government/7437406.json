            "background": "the price of petrol is going up regularly and is now at a stage where a full tank of petrol for a 1.8 litre car is at least \u00a350 and it is too expensive. It is understandable that the higher price of petrol is discouraging people to drive and therefore reducing the effects on the environment but there are other more effective ways to do this. For example it should be illegal for idiots to remove the catalystic converters on their cars so they make a louder noise. The petrol prices are too high and some of us need to have some free flowing income by the end of the year!",
