        "background": "Prisons are designed by men, and therefore are most likely to cater for the needs of men much better than they do for women. Women, however, are not like men.\n\nRecent statistical studies show that more women commit suicide while they're in prison than men do. This is probably a result of emotional complications they undergo following imprisonment and other related events, such as seperation from their children.\n\nThe Corston Review provides suggestions on how women in prison should receive better health care and better legal aid in order to help and address such problems.\n\nWe, therefore, would like you to sign our petition for the implementation of the Corston Review so that there are no more Lost Daughters.\n\nThe Howard League Committee - Bristol.",
