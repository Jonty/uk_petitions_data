            "background": "The Jedi Council, needs your help to make Jediism a recognised religion. \n\nMany people ask, how can Jediism be a religion? The definition of religion states that religion is a group of people who share a common belief. The Force is our religion and in that, it is not a question of belief in a God or not, for us it simply doesn't come into play as we believe the guidance of the Force will bring us to a course of right action. As a result, some have been guided to a belief in a God and others have not, but all believe that the Force will set them on their best path possible. On this website you will find a description of what a Jedi is and what it means to be a member of Jediism. Throughout this site you will find the foundation of the house, from there it is up to the individual to build the house on top of the foundation",
