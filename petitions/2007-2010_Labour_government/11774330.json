            "background": "I have been told the government wants patients suffering from alzheimers to be mixed with those elderly people who do not have alzheimers.  \nIt is disturbing for 'normal' patients to see and hear others with this brain disease, when they have gone to spend their last days in rest and peace.\nIt is degrading for those with alzheimers to be observed by people in their right mind.  It they knew what they were doing they would be embarrised by the things they said or did.\nI recently visited a rest home, and a lady was shouting out horrible things, and another was crawling on the floor, and other 'normal' residents had to sit around and watch and hear this. If it disturbed me, I'm sure it did them, and they had to live with it.",
