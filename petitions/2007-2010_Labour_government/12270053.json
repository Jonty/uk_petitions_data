        "background": "I feel it is a travesy that the only Football managers to be honoured with Knighthoods for winning the European Cup have been the 2 Manchester United Managers, Alex Ferguson and Matt Busby.\nWhy, regardless of their status of being dead or alive, have these honours not been bestowed upon Jock Stein, Bob Paisley, Brian Clough, and Tony Barton, along with an honourary knighthood for Rafael Benitez?\nThe Knighthood was bestowed right away upon Alex Ferguson, why was this same honour not done at all with any of the others.\nAs an Everton Fan, I have no affiliation to any club, but feel this is something that can be rectified.\nPlease take this into consideration and provide all football managers who have brought European Football's greatest club honour home to Britain, the same honour that seems to be reserved for Manchester United\n\nWith kind regards",
