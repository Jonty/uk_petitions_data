            "background": "Overseas, tetanus is routinely given to ante - natal women, in case they need surgical interventions to prevent tetanus infection - the sequelae of which is worse for the neonate, but also dangerous for the pregnant woman.\n\nHaving worked overseas and in the UK, I note some differences in practice. What is the best dose, timing and indication for tetanus injection ? Please confim prescription, give guidelines to Trusts and reassurances that this is happening. Also, I think a protocol for tetanus prophylaxis in diabetes would be a good idea - since foot checks already form part of diabetes care - if glass splinters break the integrity of the skin, then tetanus and bacterial infectionsa re even more problematic for diabetic patients.",
