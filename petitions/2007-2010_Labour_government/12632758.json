We should not look on being an MP in terms of a job or profession such that it can be compared with other jobs and professions.  Being an MP is a chance to serve one's community.  Paying the average wage will not lead to a situation where only the rich can afford to become MPs.  Salary apart, sufficient money to allow any MP to perform their duties will always be allowed.",
