            "background": "The government must stop shutting maternity wards to save money!! This is dangerous. I live in North Yorkshire and there are 2 maternity wards. The one in Malton has been shut and I know of 2 people who didn't make it to the hospital one being a friend of mine who gave birth in a lay-by!! due to the unit in Malton being closed. This is a disgrace as they now want to close Scarborough's maternity ward meaning people would have to travel around 40 miles to Middlesbrough or Hull. But this is just a problem in North Yorkshire it is countrywide and we must do something about it now! Thank You",
