        "background": "The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 came into effect on the first of October 2006.\n\nIt was immediately documented by the BBC that many companies staged preventive lay-offs to discard older employees before the law took effect (link available upon request).\n\nIt is my concern that, in my experience, the law fails to be enforced to this day, with violations ranging from indirect age specifications (widely increased number of job offers requesting 'recent graduate') to rare offers still directly violating the law.\n\nThe Job Centre's answer is that there is no enforcement agency at this time, and this is out of their hands.\n\n\nIn view of the above, I respectfully request the creation of a watchdog charged with investigating the application of the law, and its enforcement when found necessary.",
