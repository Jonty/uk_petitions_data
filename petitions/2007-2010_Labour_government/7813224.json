        "background": "The government has refused to give equal rights to the 90% majority population residing in England by not countenancing an English Parliament, nor allowing English-only matters to be left to MPs from English constituencies.  Therefore in the interests of fairness and equality the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments must be immediatley scrapped with no referendum for the 10% minority.  If this doesn't happen it will mean the end of the United Kingdom and then the citizens of Kirkaldy will have to look elsewhere for financial support. The Government must then resign immediately to salvage what's left of its honour.",
