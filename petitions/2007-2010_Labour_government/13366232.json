            "background": "We wish for the government to extend the provisions of the the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 which prevents shops from opening on Christmas Day. Many people feel that shops opening at 7am on Boxing Day is simply wrong.\n\nBy extending the trading laws of Christmas Day to the following day it would allow friends and family to spend time together without the knowledge that they have to be awake early the next morning to be at work.\n\nWith all the 365 days in a year, removing trading for one aditional day is a small move but one that would make considerable differences to the Christmas period for many people.",
