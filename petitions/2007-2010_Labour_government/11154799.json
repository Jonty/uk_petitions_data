The 2.5% vat cut is pointless this will just be added onto further taxes in the future, beer, cigarettes, car tax etc. People won\u2019t even notice the difference on the vat cut. \nHe is making the people who work hard to earn there cash suffer in more misery. \nThe company\u2019s who have not fallen suit in the bank of England cut is a disgrace and the government should be forcing the issue onto these companies. \nThe endless funds that are used to back the war in Iraq should be put back into our country instead of worrying about a country that has got nothing to do with us.",
