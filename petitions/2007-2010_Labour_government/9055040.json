            "background": "WWB Minerals are seeking planning permission for a quarry on land to the West of East Winch, Kings Lynn, Norfolk.\nThis will result in quarrying being carried out within 150m of the village centre.\nPublic rights of way will go, noise and dust will be produced and in general there will be a detriment to the overall character and scenery of this historic and pleasant village community.\nThere will be a loss of habitat for  birds, small mammals, the birds of prey which feed on them and brown hares.\nFinancially, there will be devaluation to local homes at a time when recession is a real danger, creating for some, hardship within an already dismal economic climate. Local wages are low and well below the National Average. This will impoverish people when this Government insists that it is fighting poverty.\nThe A47 Trunk road passes this site.\nThe quarry will be on view to all visiting traffic. This will harm the local tourism economy.\nWe, the residents of East Winch call upon you, The Prime Minister to view these proposals and put a stop to them in order that our rural way of life is maintained.",
