            "background": "We are English. Saint George is part of our distinctly English Heritage. Please make Saint Georges Day a Public Holiday, allowing a landmark day for generations to come to recognise what it truly is to be English, hang out their flags and be proud. We need to change the current establishment's view on what should, or should not, be considered a public holiday, and let them consider that without an English poplace, they would not have a country to govern at all. Other cultures living in Britain take days from work and school to celebrate their religious and cultural holidays, demand the English receive the same respect.",
