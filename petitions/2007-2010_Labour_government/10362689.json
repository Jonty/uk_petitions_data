        "background": "We are becoming more aware about the importance of protecting ourselves and our children from the sun. \n\nYet primary schools do not apply suncream to children who are playing outside in hot weather.  \n\nMany primary school children are unable to apply their own suncream, and cream applied in the morning, before school, is no longer effective by lunchtime. \n\nThus many children (particularly in the southwest) are being put at risk from the sun during the school day. \n\nPrimary schools should have a duty to ensure that young children in their care are properly protected from the sun. \n\nObviously parents should have the right to request cream is not applied to their child(ren). Perhaps an opt-out system for those that do not want cream applied.",
