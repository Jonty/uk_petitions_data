        "background": "While earning, every month we are having to pay a large percentage of our wage towards national insurance, which goes towards paying for the usage of the NHS when we like, even if we NEVER use it. And it allows people who rarely have a job (so pay very little or nothing towards this the privalege) to use the NHS also when ever they like. I believe the health service should become privatised and if people choose to be insured they should have to pay for what they require. With the exeption of people with longterm illnesses peventing them from working, which we should pay a small percentage of our wage to help.",
