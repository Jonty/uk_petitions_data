Their consensus: The project is not scientifically valid--or even sensible.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction is this is wildly premature, even ignoring the moral and ethical aspects,\u201d says Alec Jeffreys of the University of Leicester, who pioneered human DNA fingerprinting.\n\nQuote from Professor Sir Alec J. Jeffreys used with permission.",
