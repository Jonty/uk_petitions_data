When they cannot get their wide-screen TV's, cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, mobile phones, bingo tickets etc. we will find the unemployment figures mysteriously falling...rapidly.\nUse the money saved to build at least another hundred prisons to house these creatures.\nThere is a strange sub-species of human evolving in the great council ghettos of the UK. I have named them Homo benefitus and they will be the dominant lifeform in this country within 50 years unless drastic action is taken now.",
