            "background": "Currently the RN has only 25 such ships, 10 less than it had 10 years ago, before Blair was elected PM. This means that there are not enough ships to escort the current and future aircraft carriers. I ask the Government to order these additional ships.\nOne Type 45 vessel can monitor a city of the size of London (population 7 mn), but the population of Britain is 62 mn, and 6 ships is not enough to protect the British nation. The cost would be merely  4 bn GBP for additional Type 45 ships and a few billion pounds for the additional 8 Type 23 frigates. I hardly need to mention that not only would the British people feel secure, but also some people would get jobs as a result.",
