            "background": "The current drug laws are flawed in that certain drugs such as alcohol and tobacco are perfectly legal, where as other drugs that are less harmful than these two are illegal. This undermines the message that drugs are harmful, as the users are fully aware that the scientific community consider drugs such as ecstacy and cannabis to be of equal or less danger than alcohol or tobacco. This makes illegal drugs seem harmless, and the drugs laws seem ridiculous.\nWe propose that the government stregthen its chosen message by either:\n\na) Illegalising alcohol, tobacco and any other considerably harmful intoxicating substances and introducing them to the current ABC classification system.\n\nOR\n\nb)Legalising those drugs that are less harmful than alcohol or tobacco, based on an evaluation by professionals in the appropriate field (not the clouded opinion of MPs, which is has been the faliure on other similar attempts).",
