            "background": "Service leavers in receipt of a military pension are NOT entitled to claim Job Seekers Allowance.   My pension is \u00a3500 a month.  Taken the allowance from my pension I am left with \u00a3244 a month to live on - my mortgage is \u00a3900, council tax, water, gas, electric, food, clothing, cleaning and washing, telephone, TV, transport and upkeep of 2 college students etc. I have paid full national insurance since 16 and have never failed to contribute.  There are only a few groups of people in the UK that will be in receipt of an immediate monthly pension.  Those that have been injured and cannot work. those that choose to retire early and Ex-service men and women.  Ex-service men and women are the only ones that will be actively seeking employment.  I ask you, why am I paying full national Insurance contribution and being excluded from this allowance?   Stop discriminating against ex-service men and women in receipt of an immediate pension.  Reduce the national insurance contribution for all serving and ex-service men and women, to compensate compulsory exclusion.  Consider financial out-goings.  Stop classing college students as non-dependant.",
