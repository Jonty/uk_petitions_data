        "background": "A planned strike leading to fuel shortages from next Friday could cripple supplies for a month, AOL today reports.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to liaise with crucial industries and stop this kind of self interest. At a time when armed forces are putting their lives at risk to maintain world oil supply, this kind of industrial action is ludicrous ! Surely employment law should dictate that the 1,200 workers at the Grangemouth site in Scotland who intend to walk out on April 27 and 28 in a row over pensions have a duty of care and professional contractual agreement against this sort of ad hoc behaviour, which destabilises the economy at the best of times, let alone in a jihad.\n\nThe site's owner, Ineos, said that the industrial action could mean no fuel supplies in Scotland and the North of England for at least a month, although the Unite union has warned that the whole of the UK would be hit - the petitioner is urging the govt to a) deal immeadiately with this situation and b) devise long - term preventative measures to stop this selfish irresponsibility happening again c) legislate to make it prosecutable.",
