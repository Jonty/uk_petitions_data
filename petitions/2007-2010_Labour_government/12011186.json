            "background": "Reducing the speed limit is like patching it with a sticking plaster. The roads haven't changed nor have the speed limits over the years.What has changed is the way people are taught to drive and indeed tested on them. Most accidents are as a result of young people driving at high speeds on roads that have had bends forever. Years ago you were taught to drive at the required speed for the road. Today you are failed on your test if you don't travel at the speed limit. The standard phrase from instructors is make progress. They are also taught to get into the wrong lane and force their way in later. That is why there is so much road rage. \n\nIt is time the Government employed some of the techniques used in industry to get to the root cause of problems, and get it right first time. Then they wouldn't make such a fool of themselves by announcing changes and having to go back on them.",
