        "background": "A proposal to scrap National Insurance alltogether by increasing income tax thus making personal taxation much more transparent and simpler for people to understand.\n\nMany employees do not understand the complicated National Insurance system, especially employers conytibutions and scrapping NI and raising income tax by the same level would make the tax system simpler to administer and also much more clear to the average worker with regards to how much they were being taxed.\n\nThis proposal does not suggest any overall increase or decrease in taxation, income tax rates and bands would be altered to reflect the need to transfer the revenue collection from NI to income tax.",
