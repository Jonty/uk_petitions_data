            "background": "The West Tey Consortium want to build up to 10,000 homes next to the village of Marks Tey, Essex. This would effectively make a town and destroy the current village, leading to 10,000 more homes using the local roads beyond their proposed link road to the A12. Villagers have, to date, had no say in this proposal. We wish to remain as a rural community and new developments of this size should, if needed, be built away from current villages.",
