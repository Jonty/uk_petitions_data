        "background": "This petition has been posted by Hands Up for Fairer School Funding, a campaign launched by schools in Devon to persuade Government to tackle the inequalities in funding for schools and end the post-code lottery that affects young people in many parts of England.\n\nAccording to Government funding, the education of every child in Devon is worth \u00a3375 less than the national average and that cannot be fair. Schools face similar costs wherever they are. Staff pay is set nationally, not locally. \n\nThe education and future life chances of of 96,000 children and young people in Devon is affected by the relative low level of funding schools receive from the Government.\n\nDevon supports F40, a national campaign group representing the lowest funded education authorities in England.\n\nSearch \"Fair funding for schools in Devon\" for more information.",
