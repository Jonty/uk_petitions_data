Schools face similar costs wherever they are. Staff pay is set nationally, not locally. \n\nThe education and future life chances of of 96,000 children and young people in Devon is affected by the relative low level of funding schools receive from the Government.\n\nDevon supports F40, a national campaign group representing the lowest funded education authorities in England.\n\nSearch \"Fair funding for schools in Devon\" for more information.",
