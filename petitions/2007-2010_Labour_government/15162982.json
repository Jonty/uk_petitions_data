            "background": "The Housing Executive is vesting my area (knocking down older houses to make way for new houses). The current law allows them to 'compulsory purchase' my home for market value plus 10% compensation. As a result of the recession my house is in negative equity and I will be left without a home and with \u00a350,000 debt.  I would not be selling my house in the current climate unless I was being forced to.  If the Housing Executive wants to take my home they should also take my mortgage and not leave me in serious financial debt.",
