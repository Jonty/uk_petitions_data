Salary payments are sent to that account. Mortgage, utilities and telephone are paid by direct debit only from this account. Surplus cash may be paid little or no interest- most individuals will have limited funds in this account any way. \nSavers will transfer funds to banks to earn higher returns and will bear the risks associated with that. Banks will provide loans including mortgage and it will borrow from the central pool. Data protection is key and will be kept in UK and the service provider will not have access to the data. Set up taskforce now.",
