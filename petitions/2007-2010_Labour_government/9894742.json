            "background": "Every year prior to end of the financial year. government departments all over the country have to spend there yearly budget otherwise the surplus amounts will be taken away from the following years budget. This system encourages waste and i have experienced various areas of the council buying un-needed equipment and machinery which has been stored and hidden in buildings so that they do not loose un-needed funds.This money should be going back to the tax payer or to other areas such as hospitals.This system should be changed so that local councils feel they can be honest about how much they need and not be scared of loosing funding.",
