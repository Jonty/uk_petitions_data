            "background": "The UK is horrible mess, where moral values and the confidence within our Government and within our MP's is at an all time low with the never ending corruption that is going on. This needs to stop now, before it is too late.\n\nI feel this is the only way in which to bring back the confidence of the people of this country. \n\nMake a Law for the Queen To Take Control of Her Country temporary while this mess is sorted.\n\nSet an independent panel who are picked from the electrol role. There cannot be any influence from the parliment. eg. the same principal as the Bank of England. They would be incharge of MP's pay, and expenses.\n\nGuilty MP's are prosecuted, for their fraud to the full extent of the law to serve as a warning to others, not to Steal from the people of Britain.\n\nCall a General Election, and Let Us Have a Brand New Start, Going Back To Old Fashioned Moral Values.\n\nIt is about time we got rid of the political correctness Police. Anyone involved in crime should do their time without mercy. Back Our Police So that they can do their job without one arm tied behind their back.\n\nLets get Britain back to being the proud nation she once was.",
