            "background": "I believe that it is a fundemental human right that a person can do what they like with their own body as long as they are not hurting themselves or infringing upon another persons right to do what they like with their own body.\n\nThe way I see it, if Alcohol and Cigarettes remain legal, then all drugs less harmful should be legal as well.\n\nResearch has shown that Cannabis, LSD, Crystal Meth and Ecstasy (among others) all as less harmful than Alcohol or Cigarettes.\n\nObviously more research is needed but the drugs laws in their current state are a violation of our human rights and therefore need to be scrapped and completely new ones are neccessary.",
