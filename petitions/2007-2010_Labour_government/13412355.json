            "background": "Baroness Scotland has been found guilty of breaching immigration law. She has been ordered to pay \u00a35,000 for employing an illegal immigrant. As Attorney General and this Government's highest legal Counsel, it is outrageous that she can retain her position. This is all the more pertinent as she steered the laws governing employment of foreign workers in Britain through Parliament. \n\nHer guilt is at odds with her position. There cannot be one set of laws and principles for the great citizens of this country, and one set for those that govern us. \n\nThis Government cannot continue to treat those who elect it with such blatant contempt. \n\nI call on the Prime Minister to sack her with immediate effect.",
