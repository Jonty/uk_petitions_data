            "background": "Apparently some such MPs want to reduce the legal limit for obtaining an abortion to as little as 13 weeks; and, in tandem with this, to impose a \"cooling-off period\" and/or require all women seeking an abortion to attend counselling sessions (which, no doubt!, would be aimed at making them change their minds!).  I am asking the Prime Minister to over-rule these amendments; for the following reasons.  The result of all these proposals would be to effectively outlaw abortion altogether since it is most unlikely that most women would discover an unwanted pregnancy, decide they wanted an abortion, AND get through the \"cooling-off period\" and the counselling; all within 13 weeks.  Anti-choice/pro-(foetal only!)-lifers might say that was no bad thing but the fact that abortion used to be illegal did NOT mean no abortions took place; women simply went to back-street abortionists and \"unborn children\" (who were only POTENTIALLY so since they could have been miscarried or stillborn) still died.",
