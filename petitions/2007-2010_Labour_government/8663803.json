Give them better kit,better pay,better housing. With this money that you are going to wasted on WMD's& submarins your going to put them in. At this point in time you are cutting money to the troops. Why because the war you put them in, is costing the tresury to much. So take \u00a328Billion over the next10/15yrs. Be far to these young men and woman that are putting there lives on the line.",
