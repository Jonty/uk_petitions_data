        "background": "In the UK a fair trial must be composed of a prosecution and a defense team. However, in a trial by jury, the jury may be swayed by scientific evidence from professionals, who present a theory which is not unanimously accepted within their field eg. shaken baby syndrome.\n\nI propose that whenever evidence is given to a jury based on a syndrome or professional theory with less than unanimous acceptance, a professional opposing the theory MUST be presented to the jury in order for the testimony of either professional to be accepted.\n\nThis is to balance the evidence being presented and to ensure the theory is not presented to, or interpreted by the jury as unanimously accepted fact.",
