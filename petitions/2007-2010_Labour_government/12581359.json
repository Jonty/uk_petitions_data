            "background": "EMT are closing Sheffield Rail Station access to people who live \"accross\" the tracks in Park Hill. The tram stop will be isolated and only rail passengers allowed through the barriers. People with prams will have to use an old, dilapidated bridge with many staps. 70% of the funding for the bridge was by Council Tax payments. The bridge must remain open and the private rail company should sort out its ticket concerns on board its own trains.",
