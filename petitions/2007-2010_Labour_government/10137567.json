        "background": "I'm sure we can appreciate that tanker drivers deserve their wages, but certainly not in such huge amounts when other people are being shot at and severely wounded in defending our country.  We call on the pm to either match all soldiers, police officers, fire service staff and medical staff's wages to that of the overly paid shell tanker drivers or revoke the recently given pay rise immediately and review our real priorites.  Fighters deserve more than sitters.",
