If a teenager was on this game for 6 solid hours, what action would be there be next for that individual? Will he go re-inact the game he has just played, in a time when the world is trying to bring peace, a stupid game has been released to cause more tension for when its not really due, it appauls me that God (Allah) is a target in the game. This cannot be tolerated and the muslims will do anything they can to stop this from ever being played. Absolutley pathetic.",
