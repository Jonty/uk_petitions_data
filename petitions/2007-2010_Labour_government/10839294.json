            "background": "There are around 10,000 community, parish and town councils in England made up of nearly 100,000 councillors. These first-tier councils can respond to the needs of the community \u2013 delivering the services or representation it most needs. At present.  \nSt Helens Council has failed to work in our best interests on many issues and for this reason I think we should have our own council where we can make important decisions about the area at a local community level. Parish and town councils have a large range of powers, and the activities parish and town councils are involved in are immense. Many parish and town councils are involved in planning, promoting tourism, licensing, community halls, representation, management of town and village centres and providing community halls.\n The following areas in St. Helens already have their own Parish Councils;\nBillinge, Bold, Ecclestone, Rainford, Rainhill, Seneley Green & Windle. \nSo why not Newton-le-Willows?",
