            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Today i saw an incident that could have ended in tragedy, i saw a wheel trim fly off a car on a duel carrage way, the trim passed within 1ft of the head of a child in a push chair, i estimate it was going a little faster than the car, maybe 50 miles an hour, if it had hit we would be grieving the death of a child now of severe head injuries, which i think is the least damage this would have caused, it would cost us no more than \u00a31.00 a time to by strip ties and fasten them on, but we are not thoughtful like that much nowadays, there should be a law making this part of the MOT and allow police to stop someone not doing it and give them a warning then up stage the  penalty for being non comlient, after what i saw today i would be surprised if this has not already happened somewhere, kids need protecting at the cost of \u00a31.00? also some one can then open a factory and make colour coded ones. a new market opens. and kids get saved , who loses?",
