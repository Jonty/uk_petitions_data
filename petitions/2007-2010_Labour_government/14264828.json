            "background": "Northern Ireland has a bank holiday on St Patricks Day - 17th March. Scotland can have a bank holiday on St Andrews Day - 30th November. Poor old England (St George 23rd April) and Wales (St David 1st March) get nothing. We believe that bank holidays on all such days would enhance the unity of the United Kingdom and, in association with a thorough review on the subject of bank holidays, go some way to redressing the regional/ national imbalances that currently exist in the application of bank holidays in the UK and Europe.",
