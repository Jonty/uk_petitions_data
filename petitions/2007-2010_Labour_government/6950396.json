            "background": "We believe that mobile phone use should be banned on planes. Irrespective of the issue of whether the safe technology is developed to allow this, the use of mobile phones will be of great inconvenience to other travellers.\n\nUse of mobile phones will expose aeroplane passengers to excessive noise disturbance from, as is always the case, a few people who choose to disregard the comfort of others. \n\nWe believe that our democratically elected government must work for the benefit of the \u201csilent majority\u201d in ensuring that both The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency are aware of the concerns of the people. \n\nPlease do not allow planes to become flying phone-boxes.",
