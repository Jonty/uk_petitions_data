            "background": "On the surface, it looks as if Eastbourne is an affluent town but the fact is that the rich here are so rich that they cause aberrations to the average wage in the area. In fact, most people here live on minimum wages doing McJobs but we still get charged London prices. We, the poor and unemployed are fed-up with being insulted with stupid minimum-wage jobs with the added conditions that they are 'pro-rata', 'temporary', and 'part-time' or 'seasonal' and skilled workers are fed-up with the way local firms seem to think that they can pay professionals for specialist jobs but use agencys. For example, me being employed as a 'data-input' worker for Marlowe Ropes at (before) minimum wage at agency pay when they wanted a 'spreadsheet designer' - a difference in pay of about 500%. We want respect in job terms now! By the way, a nightmare boss like David Brent would be a dream boss in this nightmarish 1930s throwback.",
