People with other phobias you might be in the same position and if your suffering from anxiety do you get judgement? or lack of understanding? \n\nGirls who lack confidence are given \u00a34,000 boob jobs on the NHS with no given medical condition as reason. Yet we aren't given treatment that could change our lives and save us from missing out on everything. \n\nI'm wanting to see therapy such as Cognitive Behavourial Therapy, Neuro-linguistic programming and Virtual Therapy available on the NHS instead of being referred to someone who doesn't understand. \n\nI'm wanting information to be passed onto Schools, Work places and Doctor's surgeries about us so that for once they accept it as a medical condition and support us. \n\nI'm wanting leaflets made available and support groups within the above places for our sakes. Stop us having to be housebound. Help us.",
