        "background": "Currently HMRC have set the 'approved millage allowance payment' (AMAP) for motorcycles at 24p per mile, this is 16p per mile less than the allowance for a car, and only 4p per mile more than a bicycle.\n\nMotorcycles suitable for business travel over reasonable distances, such as those used by the police, have similar fuel economy and running costs to cars.  In addition, motorcyclists wishing to travel in relative safety and comfort have the significant cost of maintaining personal safety equipment and apparel.  These costs are not reflected in the current AMAP, preventing motorcyclists and businesses from benefiting from the significant time saving offered by motorcycles, particularly on congested roads.",
