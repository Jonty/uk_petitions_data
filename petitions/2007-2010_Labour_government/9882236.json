            "background": "I hereby petition the government to in future consider the implications of tax hikes on hardworking families, is this really too much to ask? Please take note that wage rises very rarely meet the extra expense millions of families are forced to pay due to high taxation, we are NOT cash sponges for the \"New Labour\" government.\n\nYou claim to \"listen\" to the voting public on many issues but I have yet to see any proof of this. I feel that if the government doesn't begin to listen, and soon, the Labour government will discover what it's like to be ousted at the next General election. Remember it is the general public that put you where you are to run things on our behalf, not give us mass immigration that is costing us billions and tax us to death in the name of the environment!\n\nI for one will NEVER vote Labour again.",
