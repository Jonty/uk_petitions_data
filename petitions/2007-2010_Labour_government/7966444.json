        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We as a nation are sick of paying over the odds for our gas and electricity!! It just can\u2019t continue, this has to stop and now!! The ridiculous profit these companies are making through our misery and hardship are diabolical. The supplier should be made to foot the bill as we do not receive a better service for these increased charges!! These companies can not justify these increases and continue to provide the same level of service to their customers, the price of importing fuel may have increased but it is unfair to pass these on to the consumer as the cost of living is rising dramatically and the money we earn/capable of earning is not increasing to meet these levels!! So much anguish and hardship is being felt by millions and it will be felt dramatically in the poorer sections of our society \u2013 the elderly will suffer greatly, single parent families, single people living alone, everyone!! Everyone will/is suffering and for the greater good of what!?!",
