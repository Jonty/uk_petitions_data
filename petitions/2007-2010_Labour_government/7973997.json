            "background": "Will the government please consider the removal of the road fund license now that the taxation on fuel has been inflation linked? This will of course remove a great deal of revenue from the governments bank account but realising that there is no road fund license to enforce will surely reap financial benefits.\n\nIt will free up a great deal of wasted police time allowing the police to spend more time focusing on anti social problems.\n\nIt will also negate the government\u2019s expenditure on advertising and enforcement.",
