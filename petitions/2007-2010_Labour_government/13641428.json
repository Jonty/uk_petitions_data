            "background": "The 'Oldham Loop' rail line between Manchester Victoria & Rochdale via Oldham was closed on 3.10.09 to be replaced by Metrolink in 2011. There is already transport chaos as buses on the route cannot cope with the extra passenger volumes. These will not be alleviated with the opening of the Metrolink extension, as the trams will be smaller, slower & more expensive than the trains they are replacing.",
