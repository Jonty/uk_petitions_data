It seems both dangerous & unbelievably remiss in these days of health & safety standards that someone who drives for a living is not governed by the same rules & regulations that apply to H.G.V. &P.S.V. drivers. How can someone who has been driving for anything up to 24 hours in a single shift not be a danger to other road users, pedestrians & passengers alike?",
