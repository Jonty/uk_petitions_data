            "background": "The immigration rules concerning spouse entry to the UK for a UK citizen bring particular hardship due to the forced and very lengthy separation caused by the visa application process. The whole process is designed to hinder entry and make the visa application as difficult as possible. Any subsequent appeal process is an extended and unnecessarily  long drawn out process causing much emotional and financial hardship to the couple.  I propose a change in regulations whereby a UK citizen by birth can apply here in the UK on behalf of his legal wife to join him here.  It places great problems for the couples being forced to apply in the country of the wife's birth.",
