            "background": "In a parliamentary statement to the house on the 29th October the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband MP shamefully legitimised the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s occupation of Tibet by stating \u201cwe regard Tibet as part of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d. This statement in our opinion flies utterly in the face of British public opinion which has for many year consistently been in support of the Tibetan people in their struggle against the oppression and occupation by an aggressive foreign power.\n\nWe demand that the Prime Minister makes a statement to the house reversing the decision of his Secretary of State to legitimise China\u2019s occupation of Tibet and states his full support of a free and independent Tibet.",
