        "action": "remove the requirement for a Certificate of Approval for marriage, which in most cases contravenes Human Rights legislation, and instead require a certificate of genuineness to be issued by the person designated to perform the marriage, issued after an interview with the couple concerned.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present the Home Office are in charge of the CoA system and require a whopping \u00a3295 fee to process the application - with no right of appeal.  This is discriminatory and unfair.  Also, a remote administrative process based on a paper application form (no meeting with the couple) is unlikely to deliver just results.  If the marriage official met the couple, asked them questions, looked at evidence then, if satisfied that their relationship was genuine, issued a \"certificate of genuineness\" which allowed those with expired visas etc to marry if they evidenced a real relationship, a much fairer assessment would result.  A small (say \u00a350) fee could be paid direct to the person doing the assessment.  Right of appeal would be to go to a different person appointed to perform marriages if you could not convince the first one.",
