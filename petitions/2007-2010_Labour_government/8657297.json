            "background": "The law states that motorcycle helmets have to allow 50% of light through, while front side windows for cars have to allow 70%. I believe the law should be changed to the same as motorcyles to 50%. The benefit of this is privacy from theft and it also makes your car look good. Some states in America have laws to allow as little as 5% through front sides. I believe it should be much lower than 70% here.",
