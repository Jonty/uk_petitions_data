        "background": "This government has increasingly encroached on the way we live our daily lives and have done their best to stop the traditional British way of life.\nIt started with the smoking ban in pubs of all places, then the attack on beer drinkers with the price hike, now we cant afford to take the family out in the car for a drive because of a refusal to drop the duty on fuel.\nAdd to that the increase in crime and the immigration issues and you can see a complete erosion of the way of life of British people.",
