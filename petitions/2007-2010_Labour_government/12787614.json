We want longer sentences.\nBen Kinsellas killers should have got 40 years minimum for this premeditated murder not the pitiful sentence they received, Remove the luxuries in prison such as tvs, play stations and all the other crap what belongs in hospitals and other establishments to help society, these low lives have no rights. Stop working on the theory that they can be rehabilitated and start thinking about justice for the victims and possible future victims!",
