            "background": "The A41 between M54 and Whitchurch carries 1000s of HGVs. It suffers with speeding cars and racing noisy motorcycles. Over the last couple of years there have been many fatalities especially between Tern Hill and Newport. The competing interests of residents and villagers along the route against the high speed through traffic is a recipe for more accidents and deaths. Certain sections have been improved with bypasses but the remaining parts now suffer even more problems. The whole route needs to be properly improved and the sections passed houses and villages should have reduced speed limits.",
