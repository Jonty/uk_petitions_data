            "background": "Whilst the undersigned are aware that cigarette packages must now contain picture health warning images from the 1st October 2008, we fail to see the need for sensationalist images such as a syringe containing a cigarette.\nThe condition needlephobia affects 10% of the population, and in some cases can be severe and crippling.\nWe ask that the needle images, and others not directly linked to smoking, its effects and related diseases be removed or redesigned.\nRisks include car accidents, and collapse in possibly dangerous situations, and sometimes vasovagal reflex reaction which can be fatal.",
