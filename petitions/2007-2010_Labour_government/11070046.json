            "background": "The Government has confirmed that only 6 type 45 destroyers will be purchased, meaning as few as 3 could be on station to provide defence for task forces. This is too few to effectively carry out the operational demands placed on the Navy. It is also an affront to the proud maritime tradition of this nation which is slowly losing its essential naval capabilities.\n\nThis needs to be rectified by purchasing more Type 45 destroyers. Alternatively, a new class of ship could be introduced with additional Anti-Ballistic missile capability to give Britain and it's navy at least some protection from future threats such as that posed by Iran's weapons program.",
