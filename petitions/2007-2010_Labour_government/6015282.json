            "background": "Ruth Kelly, Minister of Transport, is floating the idea that all drivers, regardless of ability, should automatically be stopped from driving when they reach 70. This will cause immesurable harm, and could easily be replaced by a compulsory test for the over 70s to ensure they are fit to drive. Many youngsters are worse drivers than the elderly.",
