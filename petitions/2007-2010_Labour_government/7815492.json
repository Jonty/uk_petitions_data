        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is counter to the ridiculous requests of anti-car pressure groups and individuals that the standard urban speed limit be reduced from 30 m.p.h. to 20 m.p.h., obviously narrow residential roads and town centres where current 30 m.p.h. and 20 m.p.h. speed limits apply should be restored to 30 m.p.h. from 20 m.p.h. or remain at 30 m.p.h..\nMoving, unobstructed traffic causes less CO2 emmissions than traffic slowed to unreasonably low speeds due to ridiculously low speed limits and unnecessary 'traffic calming' measures. Higher rev's in low gear to drive at 20 m.p.h. also creates extra CO2 emmissions!\nBad driving at ANY speed causes accidents, speed itself does not cause accidents!\nPlease see and also sign my other petition, (open until 11 July 2008), requesting the \"SPAP[PING of] fixed 20 M.P.H. speed limits\". To find it amongst my other petitions please put my name into the search box on this website.",
