I believe that the government should make companies state clearly on their packaging if they do test on animals. This will make it much easier for us as consumers to make our choice about whether we want to support these practices.\n\nSome of the terms used on current packaging are misleading, such as on a hand cream tube, 'dermatologically tested' - what does this mean?\n\nIt's time the government took a stand on this, and made companies give us consumers clear, factual information. Such as, 'this product has been tested on animals', or 'this product contains ingredients which have been tested on animals'.",
