        "action": "Make sanitary protection avaiable on prescription for women with gynaecological conditions of heavy bleeding",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For most women the purchase of sanitary protection is a once a month expense and they will need one to two packs each month. For women with certain conditions of heavy bleeding such as endometriosis the bleeding can require one or more pad each hour every single day of the year. This brings expenditure on such (STILL TAXABLE) items to over \u00a3800 each year. To place this into context, incontinence products are available on prescription from the age of 3 years, so comparable provision should be made for women who require similar items for the purposes of a medical condition which is over and above the normal provision that healthy women need to make. Please support women to ease the financial burden of severe menstrual bleeding.",
