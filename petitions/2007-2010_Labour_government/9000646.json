I am a mother of three children and find this absolutely discusting, as this country is trying to stop bullying of any kind and will not tolerate it but this type of game is allowed to go on sale. My son has a Nintendo WII and i would never let him play a game like this. Is there any way you can stop this game from being sold please?",
