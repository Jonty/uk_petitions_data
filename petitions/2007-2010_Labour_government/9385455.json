        "background": "Herceptin is a drug found to benefit Breast Cancer sufferers as it stops tumors reforming. However, currently there is not only a postcode lottery on who can and cannot receive this medication but those who can and are receiving the treatment are taken off it as soon as Cancer returns. Once withdrawn from Herceptin, the patient cannot have it again. This is purely down to government funding issues and it is not acceptable that the government should be able to decided who has the right to beneficial treatment and when they can or cannot have it. If it is there for the benefit of Cancer sufferers, it should be readily available and not surrounded by red tape, especially as there is no evidence to say that Herceptin has not worked if the Cancer comes back.",
