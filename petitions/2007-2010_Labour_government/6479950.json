            "background": "This includes (a) a full choice in Housing from 'Valuing People's' specified options which are \"small scale ordinary housing, supported living and village and intentional communities as well as residential care.  None of these should be ruled out\".(b) and the provision of a comprehensive appropriate and sustainable choice of Day Centres, Respite Care and Support Services within the community for those with learning disabilities and their families.This Petition expresses deep concern that many local authorities are denying such choice by refusing referals, funding or entry into all types of residential care; the closure of Day Centres, modifying eligibility criteria, and placing other obstacles contrary to 'Valuing People's' statement \"The role of public services is to facilitate choice, not frustrate it\". The Petitioners therefore call upon the Government to reaffirm the principle of Choice, to impose a moratorium on Day Centre closures and further radical change, and to take effective steps to have its White Paper 'Valuing People' implemented in full.",
