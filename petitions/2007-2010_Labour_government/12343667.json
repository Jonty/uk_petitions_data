            "background": "Nurse Margaret Haywood was recently struck off by the NMC for 'whistleblowing' on the neglect of patients in the hospital in which she worked.   She had tried to complain about the neglect she witnessed, (and filmed), through proper channels, but these channels were ineffective. She was left with no other alternative effective way to bring these cruelties to the public's attention. For your own (future)sake and that of your loved ones, support this petition, please.",
