            "background": "I belive that the public has made it quite clear on where they stand on the eu with 23% of britions believing that the eu is a \"good thing\". But I also belive that the UK needs to stay in the EU to remain a global power. Please adopt an Irish style system of referenum before legislation as Ireland seems to be the only true democracy left in the european union. You do not have to sign away are right to choose, are liberties, are freedoms. Even things like the force to the metric system have deeply upsetted people as we as a country just dont use it and is a waste of space. I belive their is still time to do the right thing and past mistakes can be undone. The british people have spoken and it is against the word of the government. That is not a democracy.",
