Of all the petitions I've signed, some with over 50,000 signatories, the response has always been the same - \"the government will remain firm...\" i.e.  NO CHANCE!  Have any of these petitions actually been successful?  Does anyone feel well served?  It seems that the sole purpose of this site is to temporarily placate disgruntled citizens who would - if not for the ban on public protest outside parliament or no. 10 - be making their voices heard elsewhere.  \n\nSign here to forgo the tedious intermediary stage of waiting for your request to be denied, and BAN THE PETITIONS WEBSITE ALTOGETHER!\n\nT.
