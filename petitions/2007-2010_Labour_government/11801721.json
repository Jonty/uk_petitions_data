            "background": "As a member of HM Forces, I find that any expenses claims I make are audited and questioned. I am sure many of my colleagues feel the same. It is right that claims need to be investigated to ensure that all expenses claimed for are correct and above board. However, our claims are often far below that made by members of Government, whose audit process is far less stringent and also appears much more closed. Unless we are sure that our leaders are transparent and accountable in their actions, how can we trust them to claim they are a) making the correct decisions regarding the economy and b) able to pass judgement on the moral accountability of financial claims by other institutions.",
