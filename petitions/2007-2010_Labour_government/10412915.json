            "background": "We are looking for the government to  act on the fact that the current UK driving test is nothing short of a joke. Motorcyclists are restricted at every turn, having to undertake 2 practical tests(CBT then Cat A) on varying sized and powered  machines as well as the standard theory and hazard perception test. We demand the government restructure the current driving test to restrict new drivers to vehicles of a predetermined power output as motorcyclists are. Studies have proved that newly qualified drivers cause the highest number of accidents and a huge factor in this is a new driver losing control of a car/vehicle too powerful for them to operate safely. Additional observation training should also be provided to new or perspective drivers as there is a hugely disproportionate number of accidents caused by car drivers paying little to no attention to vulnerable road users.",
