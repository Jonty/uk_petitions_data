        "background": "The country is fed up with ministers and spokespeople insisting that expense claims were within the rules. Morally, many of these claims are \"bankrupt\" and simply not justifiable. They should be ashamed of the way in which they have openly manipulated the rules in order to maximise their personal benefit. Gordon Brown has stated that he plans to change the rules but he, and the cabinet, need to make a public apology for the way in which they have morally abused the expense process.",
