        "action": "stop the extradition of Gary McKinnon, and pursue instead a diplomatic resolution to the matter.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The only crime to which Mr McKinnon has admitted is a Summary Offence carrying a max. sentence of only 6 months, and cannot be prosecuted more than 6 months after the event. Computer Misuse, to which Mr McKinnon admitted in 2002 without an Appropriate Adult present, is not an extraditable offence.\n\nExtradition is sought for causing $5000 of damage per computer. This allegation was not made until 2005 and has always been denied. According to computer expert Prof. Peter Sommers, the amounts claimed merely represent the passwords & firewalls that should have already been installed at the time. The CPS dismissed evidence provided by US prosecutors as 'hearsay' and 'no evidence', and Lord Justice Stanley Burnton stated that to prosecute on these grounds would be an embarrassment. \nEven under the terms of the extradition treaty, it is not the case that a reasonable person, acting without prejudice, would have grounds for suspicion that the damage alleged ever took place. The only just way to proceed is by refusing the extradition and instead seeking a diplomatic resolution with the USA, our closest allies.",
