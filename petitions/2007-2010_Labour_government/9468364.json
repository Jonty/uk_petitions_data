            "background": "In many towns and cities, there are paving stones which are either chipped, broken, wobbly, cracked or missing. What most councils do is to remove the offending paving stones and patch up the gap with tarmac. What happens over a few months, the tarmac gets compacted and sits lower than the paving slabs. This makes the pavements uneven. I had a broken ankle because of awful pavements. Uneven pavements are dangerous. It would be easier and cheaper for councils in the long run to replace the offending broken slabs than tarmacing them.",
