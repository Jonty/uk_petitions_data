            "background": "The government's lack of committment to buying additional helicopters is woeful. Some of the aircraft currently in service are TWICE as old as our junior soldiers - to continue to use these aircraft is a disgrace. There is not time for R&D of a new type - the government must bite the bullet and buy an 'off the shelf' solution which will be deployable in the next two years. Chinook seems the obvious choice. Inter-service rivalry needs to be quashed through vigorous political leadership and the funding for this project should be diverted from the proposed Tranche 3 of Eurofighter, which is superflous for our defensive requirements.",
