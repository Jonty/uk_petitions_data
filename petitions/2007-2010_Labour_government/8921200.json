            "background": "Recent reports confirmed the A12 is the UK\u2019s worst road for congestion. The A12 is closed on average around 64 hours a year. Every week there is disruption on this vital link road between London and East Anglia which is losing thousands of pounds for  businesses and delaying many motorists on a regular basis. \n The Essex stretch of the A12 is used by an estimated 65,000 motorists everyday, and has claimed 15 lives in the last 3 years. With more and more housing in Essex the A12 is struggling with the demand of vehicles using it. The Highways Agency needs to urgently survey and improve the Essex stretch of the A12 to ease congestion and improve safety.",
