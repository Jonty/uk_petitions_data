            "background": "Funding to state schools is basically another postcode lottery. Children are being let down because of where they live. Education authorities and schools are given different amounts with which to provide a quality education for our pupils. This is unfair. Some schools receive more per pupil per year than others, and our children can suffer as a result. Let's have a fair system where each school is given a set amount per pupil.",
