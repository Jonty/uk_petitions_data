            "background": "It is clear in an age where we hold regular forces in the number of 195,960 (Heyman, 2006) we are considering our countries protection to be of low priority. With a population of an estimated 60m that is a meer 3% of the population! Our country could use the incease of forces clearly needed and reduce problems of youth involved in crime. This could be done by reintroducing national service with the money saved from keeping people in prison, overcrowded and astronomically priced. This would also encourage a fit and healthy population meaning less stress on the NHS from overweight and unhealthy individuals and aid in a feeling of national pride and identity.",
