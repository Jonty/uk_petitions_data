            "background": "Over the last 12 months the Bank of England has cut the base rate by 2%, (0.25% Feb 08, 0.25% Apr 08, and 0.5% Oct 08).\n\nBanks have reduced the amount paid out to savings customers after the Bank of England's base rate cuts, but have not cut monthly payments for borrowers.\n\nBanks are profiteering at the expense of customers just as they always have done. They are building up their own profit margins at the expense of savers and home owners.\n\nThe consumer deserves a break, the failure to pass on rate cuts to lenders will hamper the government's attempts to stabilise the economy, as well as cause home owners to lose their homes, at a time when belts are tightening, jobs are under threat and our taxes are shoring up the banks due to there failed strategies.\n\nIt it time for the Banks to play fair!",
