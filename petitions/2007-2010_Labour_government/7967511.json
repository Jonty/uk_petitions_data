            "background": "Genealogical research is a growing pastime for many people in this country.  The current 100 year rule for the release of information is out of date and should be reduced to 70 years.  Most of the information contained in these early censuses such as names and ages are easily obtained from other sources but other information such as addresses and occupations would be of great interest to genealogists. By the time the 1911 census is released in 2011 (or later)many of the older people may not be around to leave a more complete family history legacy for their descendents.\n\nAn early release of the census data would certainly benefit those doing family history research, not only here but also abroad.  Furthermore,if managed correctly as was the 1901 census data it could be financially beneficial and generate large amounts of money to, perhaps, further enhance the archiving of important historical records and documents etc for the benefit of the public.",
