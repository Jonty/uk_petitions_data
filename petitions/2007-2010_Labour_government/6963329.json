            "action": "amend taxation of motor vehicles such that it it becomes more reflective of actual pollution than of vehicle ownership",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current, complex system of taxation penalises OWNERS of vehicles on the basis of how much CO2 is emitted per KM. This tax is levied irrespective of how many miles the vehicle is actually driven.  By returning to a simplified (lower) flat rate system and increasing the revenue raised through fuel duty, those who use the most fuel and therefore emit the most CO2 will carry the greater tax burden, irrespective of what sort of vehicle they own.  Similarly owners of so called 'gas guzzlers' who drive relatively few miles and therefore emit little CO2 in comparisson will pay tax proportionate to their actual pollution. An added bonus is that those who currently avoid paying car tax will still contribute as they will pay for useage through fuel tax rather ownership through road tax.",
