            "background": "i think that the goverment should stop people claiming benifits unless they have worked for a minimum of ten years as people are taking schools and colleges for granted because they need no qualifications or real drive in life as they can get paid to do nothing all day and every day. if the goverment made it a minimum of ten years to claim benefits then people would behave and overall try to get the best out of schools and colleges and there would be no easy way out for the youths that intended on claiming benifits and ignore schools.",
