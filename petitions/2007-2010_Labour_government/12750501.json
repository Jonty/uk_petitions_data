In many cases the will receive a very generous pension entitlement after only a few years service and this should not be supplemented by large gratuities which are not available to ordinary hard working taxpayers. Abolishing these allowances forthwith would be a declaration of intent to clean up the allowances system, and restore a bit of faith in Parliament.",
