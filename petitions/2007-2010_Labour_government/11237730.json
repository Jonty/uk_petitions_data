            "background": "Sir\n\nWe the undersigned are unhappy with the extortionate prices for rail fares , tickets and tariffs to travel the national rail grid. \n\nWe are most unhappy about the price inflation's expected to come into effect in 2009 and we feel seriously let down , especially as we face recession as a country.\n\nLower rail fares encourages less people to use their cars , \nencourages more people onto trains and other forms of public transport, will do wonders for the environment with less pollution and c02 emissions , especially in inner city and congested areas.\n\nWe hope you will take this petition into consideration.Because soon less and less people will use trains causing backlogs in traffic on major roads and heightened pollution to our atmosphere.",
