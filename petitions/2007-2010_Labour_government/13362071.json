All M.P.s of all parties in recent years spend at least 3 years of their 4/5 year term trying to save thier jobs and slagging off the other party.  We need a united Government. This should be the fiist cut in spending - cut the number of MP's by at least 400 -",

        "background": "All we hear from MPs is what is wrong with the other parties.  Be they Tory, Labour or Lib Debs - or others, rather than tell us what they want to do, they spend all the time telling us what the other parties are doing wrong.  We are in a right state in this Country of ours and regardless of blame shifting from one to another - the Total and Absolute blame is with Westminster.  We are the only civilized country in the World whose government officials spend so much time battling with each other, that they lose sight of the actual problem - and tackling it.  We are a small country  and with Gordon Brown as Chancellor for so many years, and now seeing how he has handled being P.M. is there any wonder we are in the state we are in.  We as a Country cannot afford over 500 MPs and quite honestly do not need them.  All we need is a dedicated team to get us back on track",
