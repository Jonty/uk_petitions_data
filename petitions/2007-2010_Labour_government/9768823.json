            "background": "The already over-burdened children that have little time to themselves and their freinds are being worsened by homework.\n\nIn my opinion, the purpose of school holidays is to give children a break from school and let them relax. So why are they having to do homework at this time?\n\nA by-product of the lack of free time for children is obisity. They are not going out and playing as much as they should be. \n\nThe government's response to this problem is to encourage PE lessons, but during these lessons, they really don't get much exersise. Instead, they spend most of their time getting changed and talked to by teachers.\n\nSomthing really must be done about this, homework is REALLY spoiling childrens' relaxation and time to play in. In my veiw, schools should be there to educate children between 8-45AM and 3-30PM, whatever they do at home should be nothing to do with the school. \n\nAlthough it would be better to abolish homework altogether, it just won't happen. So I think this is a good compromise.",
