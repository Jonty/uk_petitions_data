            "background": "Now that as a nation we have bailed out the banks with a massive \u00a3400bn perhaps it is time that they now did something for the thousands of hard pressed account holders, by removing the oppressive charges that cripple many people. The banks have over the last 20 years had a virtual monopoly on the flow and use of money. No longer can you survive without a bank account, from payday, shopping or paying utility bills you now have to use the banking system whether you want to or not. As the British public are now stake-holders in the financial banking system its time we had a change. If not, then there will be many who will question just why we are bailing out the banking system when so many other industries have been allowed to fail.",
