            "background": "Currently if you find a stray dog out of hours - your local council (after 5pm until 8am weekends and bank holidays!) there are no provisions to collect any stray dogs reported. People are expected and been told to keep the dog till \"office hours\" or indeed \"chuck the dog back out on the streets!\" its highly inconvient for a stray to need removing and putting in the appropraite kennels out of hours! We ask that dog wardens should provide an out of service taking these stray dogs and preventing accidents to occur to either the general public or motorists and prevent the dog becoming injured or killed. This is doing nothing to help the stray situtuation and since the wardens took over the situation is becoming much worse!",
