            "background": "There is a current stampede of people trying to ban or restrict mobile phone cashback schemes. Whilst there are many people who go blindly and carelessly into such deals and who subsequently come unstuck, many of us have successfully had these contracts for a long period of time and do not want to see them abolished or restricted in any way. The law is quite adequate for people to get redress if companies dont pay the cashback; customers can research and ask questions to establish the risk of any particular dealer going out of business. People must be able to have freedom of choice and protecting the foolish will simply bar the non-foolish from getting a mobile contract they would otherwise not have. Chosen sensibly the cost of losing out on the cashback is not much more than the cost without such an offer in the first place.",
