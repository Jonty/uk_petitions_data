            "background": "The Student Loans Company has recently issued notices in several national newspapers to the effect that the daily (and hence yearly) interest rate on ALL STUDENT LOAN DEBT is going to DOUBLE as of 1st September 2007.\n\nStudents already struggle to pay of mounting debt and this is going to be amplified by the new interest rate of 4.8% - YES that's double the 2.4% you have been charged for the past year.\n\nI think this is extreamly unfair, especially given the limited notice we have had to this massive change. The aim of this petition is an attempt to get this change reversed.",
