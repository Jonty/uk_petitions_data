        "background": "beat, the UK\u2019s leading eating disorder charity, carried out a survey with young people affected by eating disorders. The results demonstrated that 86% of sufferers developed their eating disorder between the ages of 11 and 16 years old, secondary school age.\n \nOverwhelmingly these respondents felt that their schools did not offer the correct awareness, support or understanding of this mental illness to them, their peers, or their families. \n\nIncreasing awareness of eating disorders within secondary schools will ultimately lead to improved understanding, empathy and prevention of eating disorders. Additionally, providing access to support will mean young people can seek help early which greatly increases the chances of recovery from an eating disorder.",
