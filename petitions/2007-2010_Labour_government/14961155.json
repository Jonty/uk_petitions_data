            "background": "This proposal isn't very well thought out, for a great many disabled people an electronic scooter is the only method of mobility, it gives them freedom to go out, shop and do things that otherwise they wouldn't be able to do.  At the moment Mobility Scooters are free for shopping purposes in Most Towns and Cities, if the proposed legislation is put in place I think that this freedom will be taken away.",
