            "background": "With Liverpool being the European Capital of Culture 2008 it is only right that Virgin Trains be compelled to restore the cross country service from Bournemouth to Liverpool Lime Street this year. They should do this or lose their franchise, and let network rail take it over. When I first started travelling to Liverpool for the annual Beatle Week & Convention I used to be able to travel from Basingstoke to Liverpool without changing trains. It is so annoying to see several trains a day to Manchester and Edinburgh and yet none to Liverpool.",
