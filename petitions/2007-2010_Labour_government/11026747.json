        "background": "The end of the britsh car industry is in sight. Land rover, Jaguar, Ford, vauxhall may not be british owned any more but their days are numbered. When in april 2009 the new VED road tax charges come in family cars like the vectra, mondeo will be priced of the road. The government is wrong in these changes especialy in the back dating to 2001.What the government is doing is wrong! under the changes someone can drive a small car with a co2 of 119g 100,000 miles and pay \u00a335 tax while someone in a rural area who has a 4x4 with a co2 of 255g and only covers 3000 will pay \u00a3500 in 2009 and \u00a31000 in 2010.\nThe green issue does not facter in as the small car produces more pollution.\nThe second hand value of cars is falling faster than houses. new car sales are already at their lowest in years. The fairest way is to abolish road tax altogether and put it on fuel. that way the more you pollute the more you pay.",
