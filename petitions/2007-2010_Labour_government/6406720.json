Or at least they claim on the site.\n\nBut those who actually attempt to view the videos will often be greeted with a message that it is not available to their geographical location and to check the terms and conditions (which do not exist anywhere on the site).\n\nIf you attempt to follow any of the links to \"contact us\" there is no feasible way to actually contact them to ask what is going on. If you try calling one of the phone numbers they provide they ask you to call a premium rate number instead.\n\nMy feeling is that this is a mis-representation on their website and should not be allowed",
