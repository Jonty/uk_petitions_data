If a pharmacy is allowed to open in the village, doctor dispensing will have to cease. This will take essential finance away from the surgery which will then probably close. Patients will have to travel to the surgery in Kidlington where they will collect their prescriptions and the village chemist will close due to lack of business. \nThe end result will be that the village will have no surgery and no chemist.",
