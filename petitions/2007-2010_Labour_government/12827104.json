            "background": "February 29th is an extra day that occurs every 4 years.\nIf a person is paid weekly, they are paid for the number of days or hours they work. A monthly paid person is paid for the month and as such is not paid any extra for this extra day.  \nA person would receive the same basic monetary reward for working during the 29 days of Feb 2008 as the 28 days of Feb 2009.\nChanging the last Monday of February in a leap year to a bank holiday would stop the exploitation of these groups of people, by allowing them to work the same number of days annually, whilst not financially discriminating against anyone.",
