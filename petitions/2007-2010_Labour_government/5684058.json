            "background": "Prison is not always the best sentance as it can ruin a persons life. If a young person commits a crime they need to be helped to change their ways, whereas going to prison will close all routes to them except crime, as they will have a criminal record. Society needs to care for these people rather than lock them up and cause them to resent the law. Prison can create more crime rather than reduce it.",
