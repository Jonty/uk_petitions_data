            "background": "follows another petition with almost 500 signatures but with no apparent reply from the government.For a long time now it has been possible to purchase LEGAL cb radio transceivers that are capable of transmitting on A.M and now also SSB. Most of the legal transceivers on sale have at least the possibility of transmitting on A.M at the flick of a switch so that 'they might be used by the operator in other countries in the european economic area where these modes are permitted..' surely it is foolish to carry on with this situation it is now a fact that many thousands of cb operators can now use these modes anyway without causing any undue interference to anyone... modern television and electrical appliance designs have improved greatly since 1981\nother countries in the european union allow ssb/am as well as fm with virtually no interference problems/concerns at all! Being as though most legal cb radios on sale have at least A.M built in and are type approved for use in ALL european countries it really is now just a paper exercise for the uk to adopt am and ssb the problem will not go away just by ignoring it",
