            "background": "We are all familiar with being overtaken by other road users in dangerous or inappropriate places;  such manoeuvres are fraught with danger for all road users and pedestrians nearby. Countless accidents are caused each year by vehicles overtaking others and either losing control, crashing head on with other vehicles, or in hitting the car that they are overtaking - if for instance the car ahead was turning right into a side road.\nThis could be reduced by tightening up the law and allowing overtaking on dual carriageways and motorways only - as a right.\nThis would save many lives each year; prevent countless injuries and would also make insurance claims more straightforward - If someone crashes when overtaking moving traffic - they are at fault. Sign up - it makes sense!",
