        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The British government must participate in the Dublin Conference on Cluster Munitions and support a comprehensive treaty to categorically prohibit cluster munitions and provide assistance to affected communities. We urge you to fully support a treaty with no exceptions, no loopholes and no delays.  \nWe believe that the treaty should prohibit all cluster munitions as they are defined. Governments seeking any further exclusion from the definition of a cluster munition must demonstrate that any such exclusion will not constitute a damaging exception from the ban, either now or in the future, for weapons that have the same intolerable effects as cluster munitions. We also believe that there must be no transition period during which the prohibited weapon could still be used. The treaty must ensure that there are obligations on states to provide assistance on all of the treaty\u2019s humanitarian objectives and to report on implementation, so that they can effectively protect survivors\u2019 rights and help affected communities recover.",
