            "background": "CKP Railways has worked since 1998 on designing bridges, station buildings and track layouts. The engineering design has been completed, and the business case was published in June 2007.\n\nThis organisation is working to reopen the railway - without Network Rail (NR).\n\nIt will be more efficient than calling for NR to reopen it - there is less bureaucracy in CKP Railways.\n\nWe ask that all planning permission for non-rail structures that obstruct the existing trackbed, on any section, be refused - no matter what the economic benefits may be (limited compared to the railway) by allowing obstructing development.\n\nIn order to speed up the reopening process, the project needs grants. Many people have already put bonds into the project, but that is currently far from the amount required to reopen the route.\n\nThe reopening will be valuable for the Lake District because existing roads will not cope with the increasing number of tourists. It will provide an alternative to car and bus on the A66.",
