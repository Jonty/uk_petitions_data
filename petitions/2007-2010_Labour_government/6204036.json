        "background": "It makes us feel sick that many of our young people will not know anything about Hitler, and as a result, know less about the war that Britain and her allies fought and died for just over 60 years ago. How can Britain insult our senior citizens; the veterans who fought and died fighting Hitler's evil regime? And all the Holocaust victims killed just because of their religion through Hitler's ideology? How can we allow the watering down of this subject\u2019s importance by giving unaware/naive children the option to opt out of its teachings? Is it not our moral obligation to ensure the young understand full well what Britain fought and died for? This creates pride. Without teaching about Hitler and his ideology, pupils will continue to take for granted what Britain stands for, and forget the most important event in history; our victory of 'good' over 'evil' this century! \n\nWe must not delete Hitler from the National historical figures for compulsory teachings! It would be wrong!",
