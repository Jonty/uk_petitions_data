            "background": "The Government very sneakily introduced a new limit to when people pay the higher rate of tax at 40%, it is now set at \u00a334,600 as opposed to the previous of \u00a340,000, this now puts a lot more people who in todays financial climate are not high earners on the 40% tax payment bracket, this petition is to request that the governement return to the original rate or higher to stop penalising hard working average wage earners with a tax that was introduced for high earners. Another Stealth Tax!",
