Yet well known celebrities not only make these obscene phone calls in the name of \"comedy\" but the broadcast organisations actively condone this illegal activity and appear to find it funny.\n\nThese celebs are role models for youngsters and I can say from personal experience that it is not funny to be called up out of the blue and have rude suggestions made.\n\nWe call upon the PM to take the necessary action to ensure the DPP investigate this illegal activity and if necessary bring chances against any individuals or organisations either engaged in or appearing to condone this activity.",
