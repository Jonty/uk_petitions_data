Rather than packing home into urban & brownfield sites, I suggest that developments need to be spread across the whole country thus spreading the impact of new homes evenly across the country and bringing some additional income to the rural economy. The environmental impact would also be far less concentrated - we would be able to avoid building on floodplains and encourage the building of low cost, \"greener\" homes.",
