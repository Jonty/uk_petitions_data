It is home to a very special boy, named Craig Vincent Ford.\n\nCraig uses the transport links often, and if I'm honest, I can tell he's not satisfied with them. For all the hard work he does, I think that it is about time we recognised that this boy deserves better transport.\n\nCraig's abilities include childcare, animal care, drug abuse care and about any kind of care you could possibly imagine. He is a marvel. A walking legend. Please. Give him the support he deserves by placing a bus stop directly outside his house. Yes, it might cause our hard working bus drivers hassle. But I strongly believe that this is the way forward: a gigantic step for humanity.\n\nThank you, The Official Craig Vincent Ford Appreciation Society",
