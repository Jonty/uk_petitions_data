            "background": "Increasingly motorists are failing to use dipped headlights in times of poor visibility - and this includes drivers of police and other emergency vehicles. By following the example of other countries and compelling the use of dipped headlights at certain times, the visibility of other vehicles will be enhanced and this will, in turn, help to reduce the number of accidents caused by insufficient or non-existent vehicle lighting during times of poor visibility.",
