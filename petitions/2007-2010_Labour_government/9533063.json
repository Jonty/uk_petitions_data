            "background": "There is enormous disquiet about the huge changes being inflicted on our country due to record levels of immigration. According to opinion polls, this is now the number one political issue - yet the government persistently ignores the views of the British people, most of whom want to see immigration curtailed. This is now our most urgent political crisis. The British people deserve a referendum on immigration, so that we may set a policy on the future mix of peoples in our country. We call on the government to introduce this referendum as a matter of urgency.",
