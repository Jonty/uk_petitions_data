            "background": "With the Native British Bee in serious decline I propose the Government pass legislation to ban all imports and internal sales of none native queen bees and their progeny. This would include honey bee, bumble bee plus any other species of bee.\nThis is to enable the British bee keeper to rear by selection Native bee stocks that are more suited to our local conditions.\nIt will remove the threat of diseases to our existing colonies and also remove none native genetic traits that will weaken and undermine the native bee.",
