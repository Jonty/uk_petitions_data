            "background": "I propose that the government open the airways of britain to television enthusiasts, many own old broadcast equipment (From the old 405-line service in particular) and would like to start transmitting programmes for their local area (For an area not further than 5 miles for example) you could sell off the old broadcasting equipment from the analogue transmitters to enthusiasts for nominal sums of prehaps a few hundred pounds, the result of allowing people to transmit their own programmes would be win-win for everyone, those who do not wish to buy digital equipment could still recieve some sort of service, and the government would benefit from the broadcasting licenses that it would hand out",
