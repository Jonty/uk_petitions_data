            "background": "At present anyone whose vehicle is taxed, insured and with current MoT  has the right to park where they like even outside your house, even over white lines protecting your drop down kerb to your driveway.  I would ask the Government to consider giving residents absolute rights to the piece of road immediately outside their property if neccessary by creating bays marked with the property number.  The householder would have the right to ask the driver to move and if they don't agree to move to ask the Police move them.  This measure is proposed so that residents can legally object to parking by commuters and building site workers working nearby on one of the numerous developments which now seem to blight our neighbourhoods.  For some of us this parking is a nightmare especially when they park with their wheels on the pavement preventing buggies or disabled people's scooters getting by.",
