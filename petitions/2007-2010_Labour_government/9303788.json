I think it's grossly unfair that fuel is going up as frequently as this. Plus the petrol station companies make BILLIONS in profit. Surely they can 'eat' the price rise without denting their profits. They can afford to do this, but us customers cannot. The govt needs to make sure there is a limit in the number of price rises in a year. Obviously, price reductions will be unlimited",
