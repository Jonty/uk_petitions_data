Most of the time you get some spin like 'in real terms its cheaper', if it was cheaper do you think I'd be petitioning? In some of the responses the individual that has started the petition has some good points that are just ignored and answered by generalisations when the petition needs a detailed response!\n\nI therefore ask that this be a petition to actually listen to these petitions and maybe contact some of the individuals for their reasoning behind their opinions then maybe the government might learn from it's mistakes and not blindly keep going with the blinkers on!",
