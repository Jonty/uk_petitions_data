            "background": "Dog breeding for cosmetic reasons has spun out of control. Pekingese dogs have been bred to the extent that most have trouble breathing whilst many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels now have heads that are too small for their brains causing them to have fits. Also, if puppies do not turn out the way breeders want them to look they have them destroyed. There are many other dog breeds with similar problems and I think it is time this was stopped.",
