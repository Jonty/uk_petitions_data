            "background": "I propose that the Government should make it a dismissable offence for Police to use official vehicles to visit supermarkets for shopping, visiting the take away for food or any other purpose that is not connected to crime prevention and detection.  Too many times Police vehicles are outside shops on 'official Police business' just to find the four officers coming out of a take away or shop with bags of goodies.",
