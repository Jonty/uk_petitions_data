            "background": "Following the raids in stores that have been experienced since last week and this week, the already collapsed Zimbabwe is slowly but surely going to result in mass murders or slaughter of the innocent through poverty and severe human rights abuses. The government has clearly failed its people and we are bitter as Zimbabweans. There is no hope what so ever of any economic activity. The only hope, if any, of the nation now clearly lies in the Zimbabweans who have managed to escape the sad journey of poor governance and revive in somehow the lives of those left behind.\nMy polite request is to petition to allow all Zimbabweans whether legal or illegal to work freely in hope of building up the nation",
