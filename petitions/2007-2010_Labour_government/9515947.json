            "background": "The Prime Minister has opted to meet the Dalai Lama at Lambeth Palace and not Downing Street, where Prime Minister John Major and Prime Minister Tony Blair met the Dalai Lama in previous years. \n\nLast year Chancellor Angela Merkel met the Dalai Lama in her office, Prime Minister Stephen Harper met the \nDalai Lama in his office and President George Bush presented the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal. It is only fitting that the UK Prime Minister should accord the same level of courtesy.\n\nThe Prime Minister, will be the first world leader to meet the Dalai Lama since the current unrest began in Tibet and Tibetan regions of China. It is crucial at this time that the Dalai Lama is recognised for what he is: the legitimate symbol of the Tibetan people's struggle for self-determination.Meeting the Dalai Lama at Lambeth Palace sends the message to both the British and Tibetan people that the UK government is not serious about its claims to want to see a peaceful, negotiated settlement.\n\nTherefore we, the undersigned, petition the Prime Minister to meet the Dalai Lama at Downing Street.",
