            "background": "England fans are fed up of an inadequate FA who do not know enough about football to appoint a manager that will take the England football team forward.  This has to stop. They will not get Jose as the appointment process is useless.  We have to appoint a manager that is strong and is tatically sound and Jose is the man to do it.\nA successful football team raises spirits and can bring the nation together to feel as one.  The England football team is vital in the role it plays in society as so many people care about it.",
