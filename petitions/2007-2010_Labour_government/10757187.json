We therefore ask the Prime Minister to introduce a system whereby such phone calls remain private unless consumers opt-in to allow the organisation to make use of them. \nWe nevertheless recognise that it is useful for security purposes that phone calls are recorded; however, they should only be accessed if there is a security issue.",
