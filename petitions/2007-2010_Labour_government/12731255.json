            "background": "Most people in this country are completely fed up with media led politics. The idea that policy can be dictated by what the BBC writes each day is crazy and is paralysing the country.\nWe ask that the government starts doing what it was elected to do and offer real, long term leadership. Frankly most of us don't really care much about what the papers say and it would be nice to hear politicians truly saying what they believe and not spending all their time playing games with the media.",
