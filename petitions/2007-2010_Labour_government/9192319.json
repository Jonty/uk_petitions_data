            "background": "give our prisoner in the uk low paid work as an alternative to importing cheap dangerous goods from china which are poor quality.  china does not have any health & safety regulations on exports to the uk, so high levels of lead and toxins are found in childrens and animals toys. not only this, they often have small pieces attached to toys which can and do choke small children.  if our prisoners in the uk made these goods at an affordable rate, we could avoid the dangerous toys and nick naks from china. by doing this, the prisoners will also be rehabilitated and not get bored whilst serving time. a rolling stone gathers no moss,,,a good way forward to entering society again and a way of payin their debt to society.  we do not need to depend on china`s cheap workforce as we already have one..the prison inmates.",
