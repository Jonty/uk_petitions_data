            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "More people are purchasing 4x4 off road and high performance vehicles than ever before, unfortunately a lot of these users have no idea about the limitations of the vehicle they are driving. There hae been reports in the press all over the UK of accidents caused by people having little or no experience of the vehicles they drive. Therefore I ask the government to consider some sort of test that people purchasing a 4x4 (whether it be a private sale or from a dealership) must pass a test proving they are competent to handle something a lot larger than what people would pass their driving test in. This could also apply to people purchasing a high performance car over a certain power band as again, these have much more power than what would be used for a driving test in the UK. Not only would this make the driver more competent and aware of the vehicles performance and capability, it could help reduce carbon emmisions by these being driven more economically.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this petition.\n\nSi",
