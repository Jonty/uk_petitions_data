        "background": "There are environmental concerns where this island cannot feed its population - reflected in a worldwide problem of population demands. In history meat has generally been considered luxurious. The inefficiencies of animal use for human food, especially with a growing world population's self-perceptions of affluence encouraging aspiration to such decadent consumption can only be understood in terms of meat as a luxury. Beyond such practicalities there are other ethical concerns of cruelty management in this area. Luxury goods should carry the full weight of VAT and here meat is considered to be such a luxury necessitating a 17.5% rate.",
