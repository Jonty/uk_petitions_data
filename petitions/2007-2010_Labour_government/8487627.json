            "background": "I am calling for Rt Revd Rowan Williams to Resign in the awake of recent 'Shaira Law' row:\n\nDr Rowan Williams told Radio 4's World at One that the UK has to \"face up to the fact\" that some of its citizens do not relate to the British legal system. \n\nDr Williams argues that adopting parts of Islamic Sharia law would help maintain social cohesion. \n\nFor example, Muslims could choose to have marital disputes or financial matters dealt with in a Sharia court. \n\nHe says Muslims should not have to choose between \"the stark alternatives of cultural loyalty or state loyalty\". \n\nBritian has a christian heritage and we must be proud of this, and also respect other religion but not in the expenses of loosing our own christian heritage. The histroy of this nation is clear, many people have given their own life who belived in the christian heritage and it is our responsibility to cherish and protect such beliefs.  The recent public outcry is evident that Dr Rowan Williams has now lost people's confidence and should not be the head of the church from here after. \n\nTherefore I am calling everyone to join with me to petition the Prime Minister to find a way to ask Dr Williams to resign.\n\nMany Thanks\n\nRev.G.Gnanaiah",
