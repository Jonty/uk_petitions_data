            "background": "The amount of benefits received by Psychiatric patients is disgusting, The average amount paid to a Psychiatric patient is \u00a3106 per week considering that these people do not have to pay rent,gas,electricity or other household bills this seems a little to generous to say the least. \u00a35512 per year is what it cost to keep these patients in Cigarettes and sweets and bottles of coke. (I know this from personal experience from working in a secure unit) and they still complain that it\u2019s not enough money. Patients used to get \u00a315 per week (pocket money) until some solicitor no doubt on legal aid challenged the ruling and got their monies raised. Please return the amount of monies paid to hospital inpatients back to the \u00a315 per week and spend the rest of the money on something deserving like employing new midwives or cutting waiting lists",
