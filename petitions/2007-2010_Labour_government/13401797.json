            "background": "Mr Brown has denied the citizens of the United Kingdom a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty \n\nI regard this as Treason\n\nWe have a situation as follows:\n\n1) All European \"States\" need to ratify the treaty for it to become \"European\" law.\n\n2) The Irish vote on 02/10/2009 whether to ratify the Lisbon Treaty. The Czech people vote early next year.\nIf either of them vote \"No\" then the treaty will not be ratified.\n\n3)0ne or both of these two countries will preserve our democracy by denying this ratification. Ironically in the past we have not attempted to preserve their democratic processes when the need arose.\n\nOur constitutional freedom depends upon referenda in two countries who owe us nothing. Our Prime Minister has signed away our freedom, without giving us the  opportunity for debate or a ballot that both the Czech and Irish people have had.\n\nOver the last hundred years we have helped to make ourselves and other countries free from domination by foreign governments at a great cost both socially and financially. \n\nDue to the actions of Gordon Brown, we are now dominated by foreign governments; at great cost both socially and financially. \n\nI regard this as an act of treachery against the British people.",
