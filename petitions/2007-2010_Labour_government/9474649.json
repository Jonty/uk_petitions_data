        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Wire rope barriers are potentially dangerous for motorcyclists. These Barriers are a different forms of crash barrier seen on motorways and \"A\"roads if not others. In a crash they stop vehicle's crashing into the opposing lanes on the road or causing other accidents but they are shown to be lethal to motorcyclists. I therefore want the government to remove these barriers (known as cheese cutters/wires) as they make the road more dangerous to motorcyclists, and replace them with more motorcycle friendly traditional road barriers, so that in the event of a motorcycle accident, the motorcyclist bounces off the barrier and is not cut in two by them. Which has happened before in an accident involving these barriers. Thank you",
