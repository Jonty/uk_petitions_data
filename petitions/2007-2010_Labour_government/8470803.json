            "background": "Recent events have speculated a change in our basic laws to incorperate other faiths i.e the Muslim faith, why should our laws change or have one rule for one and one rule for another? why now? PC has gone too far now. We are British and if other faiths decide to come to the UK then they must accept the way we live just as if we were to go to a foriegn country, we would have to accept their laws on their home soil so why should we change our laws? Please do not let our laws change, I for one am proud to be British and so are many others, please don't lose support of your proud british people.",
