            "background": "Many housing association tenants are subject to a deplorable standard of repair and maintenance work carried out by local contractors who are not up to the job.\n\nThis often requires remedial work to be carried out causing more inconvenience and problems for the tenant, whilst allowing the contractor to waste more and more of the tenant\u2019s time and the housing association\u2019s money.\n\nHousing associations are generally disinterested in any inconvenience to their tenants (a disabled relative of mine was left without any means to get washed other than a tiny bathroom sink, for over three months last year due to inadequate repair work).\n\nIf contractors were fined for not doing a proper job of work, they would eventually ensure that they did so, first time, every time.\n\nAs the housing associations will never voluntarily do this, they need to be compelled to do so by law.\n\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister bring legislation forward to compel all housing associations to fine any contractor who fails to carry out an adequate job of work. The fine being the original cost of the works agreed plus a 500% penalty surcharge.",
