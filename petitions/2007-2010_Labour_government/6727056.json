            "background": "Where a parent is left to bring up a child alone and the other parent is absent, support is received from the absent parent via the CSA and it is tax free.  If a husband or wife dies and leaves a young child, the surviving spouse receives a pension based on the national insurance contributions of their late spouse, which is taxed.  Losing a husband or wife when you have young children is bad enough, without being taxed on the payment from the state, when payments from absent parents are tax free.",
