            "background": "For too long only women have been permitted to take part in Cancer Research UK's Race for Life. This should not be the case. As a Man I would like to see equality in the Race for Life Marathon despite only 1% of men having breast cancer it does not change the situation. Race for life should be done for all Cancers and men should be permitted to take part. I personally have always wanted to take part and raise money to support cancer research in the UK. If you believe the same please add your signature to this petition and help to campaign that Cancer Research UK is made equal.",
