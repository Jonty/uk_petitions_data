            "background": "VAT is currently charged at the highest rate (15%) on audio and e-books. This makes them expensive when compared to printed books which are zero rated for VAT. Given that many blind & visually impaired people buy audio & e-books (with their adjustable font size), this is inequitable. \nE-books also offer unrivalled opportunities to make literature more accessible and attractive to young people & all efforts should be made to reduce prices. Given the recent EU vote to reduce VAT on audio & e-books to the lowest rate in 2011, the Govt should take action as soon as possible to reduce the rate before that date, as they have already done in Sweden.",
