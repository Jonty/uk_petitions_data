Mr Hussain went to jail while Walid Salem stayed free due to his injurys sustained in the attack. He then went on to commit credit card fraud, but could not stand court again due to the previous injurys. Its a joke, check his record, google the guy!\n\nGet rid of him, this country needs to start getting tough with these people.",
