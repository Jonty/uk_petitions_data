            "background": "Many individuals and businesses are firmly of the opinion that our current economic difficulties have been worsened by negative reporting in the media, and especially by the BBC.\n\nA perfect example this morning (March 30) on BBC Breakfast was their report on the Australian GP. Their report started with the statement that 270 people are to be made redundant from Brawn GP before going on to highlight their win. Why was it necessary to report in this way when Brawn GP having been dragged from the ashes had no option but to issue redundancy notices which it did (according to BBC reportage elsehwere) prior to the GP? The fact is that they have rescued 400+ jobs in a field of British engineering excellence and are receiving considerable british backing. And to cap it all they have collectively, and regardless of how the rest of the season goes for them, pulled off a remarkable British success.\n\nIt is high time we started talking about some of the success going on around us first and any troubles second.",
