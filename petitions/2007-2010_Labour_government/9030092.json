In my professional experience, one of the pupils I teach got lost on the way to school - easily done since Warrington's transport system is notoriously complex. It occurred to me that one safe system may be for regular bus users udner 12, say, to liaise with bus drivers. What about a policy that shows your administration takes child safety seriously and create a \"Safe To School\" registration system ? Just an idea from my think tank.",
