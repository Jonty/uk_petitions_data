            "background": "We believe that marriage is sacrid and Holy unto God,and that NO man,power,or Government should have the right to split up a legally binding and loving marriage.In 2005,the process for a marriage application stated that after 2 years in this country,persons within the Visa process would if all requirements were met,be granted at the end of those 2 years,a Visa for UNLIMITED Leave to Remain.In April 2007,this was changed,the cost went up,and has now gone up again.The same people who were told  in 2005 they would be granted their Unlimited leave to remain status, after 2 years,now have to take and pass a test.We believe the Government should honor their original part of the agreement,the same as the people who were in the Visa process at that time.That persons here on or before the changed date in 2007,already going through the process,should be granted the Visa they worked toward,once having met all legal requirements,and that persons then entering the country after April 2007 should be made to abide within the new laws set forth from that date onward.Thank you.\n\nJulian and Missy Frost",
