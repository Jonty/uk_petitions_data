Let him go on the formal record denouncing the latest statements of eminent think tank organisations, if he has the testicular strength to do so.  If he doesn't then it means to me that he is continuing to be disingenuous with the british voters and those british voters have a right to be told the truth over what they are paying for.  We have been denied a general election so this online-petition scheme is the only opportunity for us to be able to tell anybody what we feel our elected representatives should be doing in OUR best interests, and not just THEIR best interests.",
