            "background": "More and more company's are realising the profits that can be made from selling advertising space in their premises (eg train stations) or media (eg TV outlet's). Surely we the customer, ie the persons at whom this advertising is directed, should recieve some benefit/payment for our participation in these feats of market research. \nThe rail networks for example have flooded the trains and stations with this advertising (even on the facing strips of steps now) and yet prices only go up and up. \nTV providers now show more adverts than programes, it seems, most channels averaging 4-5 advert breaks for each 30-45 min show and yet prices for the service still border on the extortionate.\nAdvertising has become one of, if not the, largest \"money for nothing\" enterprises that exists today. This is not a petition to withdraw the ability to advertise, but to make sure the target of this advertising, the consumer, gets an appropriate reward for their time and patience in this matter.\nThanks for your support",
