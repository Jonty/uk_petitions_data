            "background": "Suicide: It happens every year all over the world.  What is mainly to blame for such high suicide rates is depression in teens, adults and senior citizens.  I am writing this to you so that there may be more awareness, education and treatment needs to be carried out about suicide so that the suicidal may be understood better, not only by mental health proffesionals but also by their peers.  It is a horrible fact that with depression, quite often a person doesn't feel whole although they hate to say this.  With a more 'all round' view of the suicidal and depressed, I believe that this will decrease suicide rates in the UK.  \n\nThankyou for listening.\n\nReferences: \n\n> My suicial feelings",
