        "background": "Essex County Fire and Rescue Service, are planning on closing my local Retained Fire Station once a new wholetime station opens nearby.  Two local stations are closing, one wholetime another retained.  The two wholetime appliances are moving to the new station with the retained appliance being taken off front line duties.  With a growing population in the covered area of 150k expanding rapidly, the question remains how two appliances can cover one of the busiest parts of the county.  Please sign this petition to keep three appliances in the area as who knows when you might need their help!",
