The professional approach is to just smile, humour them and nod because as the saying goes...\"the customer is always right\".\n\nBut deep down inside, we all know this isn't true and want to smack them up the side of the head and tell them what you really think.\n\nI believe that there should be a National Customer Service Day - Tell It How It Is\" where you are able to turn around to the customer and give them what for, as being at the brunt of rude, aggressive and plain stupid people is enough to send anyone crazy.  I've always been under the understanding that you should treat people how you expect to be treated - I say, let's give it to them!",
