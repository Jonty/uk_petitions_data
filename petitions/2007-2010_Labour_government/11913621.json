In adulthood little more than job seekers allowance is paid, which is deemed to be a short term survival income, for crisis management. Disabled people can bearly afford to go out or have any leisure time. There is no work and many are unable to work. Are they supposed to sit at home all day doing second hand jigsaw puzzles as punishment for being disabled?\nDo the right thing Gordon Brown!Bring back age realated additions to benefits to increase income by 25%.",
