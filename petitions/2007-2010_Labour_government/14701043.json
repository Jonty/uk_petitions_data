            "background": "I would like the Government to consider a take-over of Kraft, using British taxpayers' money, plus donations. I am horrified that Cadbury - one of the few remaining great British brands - has been taken over, with a factory closure announced within the first week of Kraft's ownership. This is the way the Americans do business, and I would like you to seriously consider the implications for the British economy. Buying back Kraft would be a hugely popular thing with the people of Britain.",
