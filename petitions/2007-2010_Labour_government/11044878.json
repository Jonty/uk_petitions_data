            "background": "I was driving through Saltaire recently and had to slow down drastically as the roads were covered in cobbles which had stood the test of time.\nInstead of re-tarmaccing our roads over and over again and all the potholes that tarmac is prone to - how about taking up the tarmac, the next time the road needs resurfacing and revealing the cobbles? Not only are they very picturesque, but I challenge anybody to be able to drive over them like a lunatic! It would cost less to maintain, as they by far outlast tarmac, they would have the effect of actually making people slow down (instead of speedup-slow down-speed up - as is the case with speed bumps) and the public wouldn't be faced with 'sly' fines (by expensive speed cameras) as there is no way you can physically 'speed' over cobbles. It's impossible to travel more than 20 MPH on them.",
