My instructor says my driving is good, even the examiners tell me my driving and control are good, but has soon has I sit a test I suffer from nerves.. Sometimes the things they fail you are on are stupid. Take my last test. I was failed because I didn't drive into the boxed juction, when my exit road was clear.. No cars behind me and the examiner gave me a serious for this...automatic fail... I can only afford 1 lesson a week so my confindence on the road doesn't get built up enough.. There must be a way take the test that is less terrifing.",
