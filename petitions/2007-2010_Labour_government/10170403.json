            "background": "We all know the cost of living is expensive and is set to get even worse... petrol gone up, gas set to go up, electric expensive, food ridiculously expensive, house prices set to slump - in a nutshell it is hitting us all hard and there will be no stopping this unless something is done SOON before there's an economical breakdown. We, working class citizens pump money into this country yet salaries don't match the dramatic uproar of prices we are expected to pay. This has a massive knock on effect as the how society is living and breeding out of control. Mental health is going to cost the government millions they forecast.... is there any wonder why! Let us live a life other then existing to keep the country alive, surely both can be done to enable us to have a little quality of life other then just existing!?",
