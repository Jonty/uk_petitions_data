            "background": "This petition is aimed at Gordon Brown to do more to encourage the teenagers in this country not to carry knives.\n\nOn the 24th of May Robert Knox stepped in to help his younger brother out, a few hours later he was dead after being stabbed by someone carrying two knives.\n\nRoberts death brings the total number of teenagers murdered in the capital this year to 14.\n\nI feel that whatever Gordan Brown and the local police authorities say they are doing to encourage teens not to carry knives  is not getting through and more needs to be done to stop the mindless killings which are going on in this country. Please sign this petition and maybe more will be done. Thanks.",
