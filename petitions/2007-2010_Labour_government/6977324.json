            "background": "It is my view that Members of Parliament and Ministers should be required to fight in any war that they vote for. In the recent past we have seen too many young men and women in ouir armed forces lose their lives in wars that serve no purpose other than maintaining the current political status quo and to ensure the supply of oil to the west. In my view, in future any and all MPs and Ministers who vote for a war should be required to fight in the front line as a demonstration that they believe that their cause is just and legal.\n\nIt may just be that by requirinng this of them they may not be so keen to send out troops into battle and may consider other options more thoroughly.",
