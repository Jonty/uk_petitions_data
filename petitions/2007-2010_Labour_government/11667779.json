            "background": "Royal Marine Joe Townsend, aged 20, had both legs blown off in Afghanistan and wants to build a specially adapted bungalow on his grandad's land so he can leave Forces Rehab Centre, Headley Court in Surrey, and start to live independently. The bungalow would be hidden from the road and on land already owned by his grandad but apparently Wealden District Council ruled his circumstances were \"not considered sufficient\". Local neighbours did not oppose the idea of Joe's bungalow. Please sign this petition and help us make Wealden District Council change their minds to allow Joe the independence he needs and deserves. Thank you.",
