I find there are many people who abuse the systems already in place. People park in them whent hey have no children in them. I think it would be a good idea to let Tax Credits be able to give families a badge to display in their windscreens. Tax Credits know who have children and to provide one for the youngest child being under 8. I think above this age children are capable of getting out of a car in a normal sized parking space. Having these badges in place means superstores staff can see the badge and fine you if you don't have one. I hope you agree to some type of scheme to this big nation wide problem.",
