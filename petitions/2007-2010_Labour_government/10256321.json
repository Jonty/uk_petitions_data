            "background": "Further to Billie Jan's petitions, requesting more advice on colic, can I advisedly petition the govt. to create a guide for care workers on winding and patting babies' backs -\n\nThe case that is going to the High Court, though reported as \"severe shaking\" - may well have been the age old practice of \"winding\" - with no mens rea - in which case, this is unprosecutable as murder or manslaughter.\n\nIn accordance with UNICEF's excellent baby - friendly initiative - can I recommend that advice should include what to do in cases of constipation, use of water supplements, and recommended pharmaceuticals etc.\n\nColic is a problem, isn't it ! \n\nThe worldwide Back to Sleep initiative has been a great international success to tackle unexplained infant deaths - each of them, of coure, a tragedy - I would like to urge the P.M. to develop an NHS policy that addresses dangers and treatments of handling.\n\nAlthough NHS staff practice to the best of current medical knowledge, confusion still remains about clotting e.g. oral or IV administration advice - on anti - coagulant Vit K policy, which is inconsistent ! so the indication is there. \n\nThanks.",
