            "background": "The Government has targets to reduce serious road accidents, yet every year hundreds of accidents, resulting in \"Death or Serious Injury\" are caused by careless or negligent HGV and Bus operators over filling their fuel tanks.\n\nCompulsory fitting of a low cost anti spill device would reduce this statistic to practically zero, make motorcycling safer, saving hundreds of lives and save UK Business thousands in saved fuel.\n\nThese devices also stop siphoning, which is a big problem with HGV's. Therefore the outlay in installing these devices should be quickly recovered in saved fuel costs.\n\nDisplaying educational posters (Like those produced by KillSpills) in vehicle depots will help raise awareness.",
