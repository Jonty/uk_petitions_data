            "background": "Shazia Bashir is the 12 year old victim of one Pakistan's most heinous crimes.  Her short life was fraught with disappointment and harassment. This painful existence ended abruptly in a sordid and diabolical murder inquiry.  Former president of the Lahore Bar Association - Muhammed Naeem, accused of murder and rape and who illegally hired a person under the age of 14, in contradiction of  existing Pakistani child protection laws- has been granted bail.  It is purported that contrived medical reports/death certificates have been supplied to court in an attempt to free a wealthy suspect.  300 lawyers mobbed preliminary court hearings and threatened to burn the homes of any prosecution lawyers for Shazia\u2019s family \u2013 the judge had to defer.  Despite photographs these lawyers have avoided punishment.  The BPCA implores the UK Government to engage with the Government of Pakistan so that a fair trial be undertaken with adequate protection for the prosecution team.  Pakistani media should be permitted to the Court hearings to espouse a fairer trial.  We seek action against the rebel lawyers who have brought the Pakistani legal system into disrepute.",
