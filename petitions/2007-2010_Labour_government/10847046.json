        "background": "this junction has been labelled by local taxi drivers as 'the worst junction in the world'. 2 roads go at a right angle to each other into the side of the a511 (horninglow road). the road markings are a mess and nobody understands who has right of way and how to navigate the junction lawfully. please just change the road markings to a mini roundabout like we have at the opposite end of calais road. that has the same room and has worked just fine for years!",
