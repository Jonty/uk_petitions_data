        "background": "There is currently a loophole that exists allowing companies to be struck-off the register at Companies House without ever having filed a set of accounts. \n\nIn summary, a company can be run for 18 months, made dormant for a further 3 months and then apply to be struck-off the register by making a declaration that it has been dormant for the previous three months. All this can be done without having been  legally bound to file accounts. The consequence of this can be that tax remains unpaid on profits which, after the striking-off process has been completed, cannot be legally reclaimed by HMRC.",
