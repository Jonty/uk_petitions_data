            "background": "Much coverage has been given recently to the search for a suitable replacement for the military Bearskin. Designers such as Stella McCartney and Viviene Westwood have been approached in regards to a possible new design. These hats symbolise not only the history and tradition of the British military but are known worldwide as the iconic symbol of the Queens guard. By signing this petition you add your support to the preservation of the traditional fur Bearskin, as designed for purpose, and to oppose the introduction of a replacement designed by a collection of fashion guru's.",
