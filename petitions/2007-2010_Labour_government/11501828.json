It is unfortunate that some of these people come from dire circumstances but the UK have there problems too.  The UK is a small island with big ambitions to solve everyone\u2019s problems bar their own.\n\nThe point\u2019s system demands looking into because hard working people and families are feeling left out. \n\nUnderstandably some foreign people can be a benefit for areas but that excuse along with Brits are lazy has been taken too far. \n\nIn my area housing is prioritised to these people.",
