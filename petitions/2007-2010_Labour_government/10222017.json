        "background": "This sustainable fuel is being sold at a rate which is always 2p/litre cheaper than Petrol. How the rising cost of oil production affects the cost of this product is incomprehensible, if the product is to be made a realistic alternative to petrol it needs to be much cheaper in order to counter its reduction in efficiency over petrol (BioEthanol is roughly three quarters as efficient). By incentivising with a reduction in duty or legislating against the producer's blatant profiteering the government would encourage more drivers to buy vehicles with a smaller carbon footprint - CO2 is absorbed as part of the production process.",
