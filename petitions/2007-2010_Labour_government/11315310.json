            "background": "Legislation should be brought in limiting top salaries, before anyone say's the top men will go to America or Europe, to what? they are in the same trouble as the Brit's, so no jobs/position's. For them fortunate to actually get something, limit the amount of money they are allowed to take out of the country and confiscate the rest, man you'd be hard pressed to get them on a foreign holiday let alone emigrate. Now is the time to bring in the legislation needed to make things better for the MAJORITY of people and not just for the greedy few!!",
