        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The minimum wage stands as follows:\n\n\u00a33.30 for 16 and 17 year olds.\n\n\u00a34.45 for 18- 21 year olds.\n\n\u00a35.35 for 22 and over.\n\nHow is this fair?\n\nThose doing the same job deserve to be paid the same. Just as sexist discrimination is wrong, so is ageism. The government must stop ripping off our youth and show support for their contributions to society. Their current policy, especially as it was made to encourage youngsters to remain in education, is unjust and unfair. They are condoning exploitation, and it is completely unacceptable. Please sign this petition to urge our government to raise the pitiful minimum wage of those under 22 and show your support against ageist discrimination.",
