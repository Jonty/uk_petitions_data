            "background": "We request this as the BTL speculator are trying to play the humanitarian card by pretending to be interested in the welfare of their tenants, when clearly all they are interested in is their own back pockets and the further fleecing of the British Renting Public.\n\nThey have only profiteered at the expense of many others, first time buyers included, by pricing them out of the market, by elevating house prices to unsustainable levels that they cannot even pay back without begging you for help.\n\nWe, in turn, would like to request that if these BTL investors are going to go into bankruptcy, that the government doesn\u2019t give them a helping hand as they were speculators and speculated at the expense of the UK public. To let life take its natural course.\n\nAlso, to protect the rights of renters, by making sure the renters are secure in the accommodation for a period of 3-6 months whilst the house is being repossessed. That the renters are given a fair amount of time to find alternative accommodation and not thrown on the street by the short sightedness of the BTL brigade. \n\nThank you for your time and for reading our petition,\nOmero Saienni",
