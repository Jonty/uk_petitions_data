However they should not be able to profit from these expenses by employing 'friends and relatives' who have no real job function and neither should they profit from the sale of any house or premises which are claimed as part of their second home. In addition they should pay capital gains tax when they come to sell just as any other member of the public. Items such as Flat screen TV's, New Kitchens etc should not be allowed to be claimed as an expense.",
