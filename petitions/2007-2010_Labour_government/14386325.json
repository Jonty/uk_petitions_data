        "background": "How come it\u2019s so easy to get into the UK?  The other day I saw on the news 3 immigrants who were found in the back of a truck in Kent.  They were given a food and rail voucher and the address in London where they needed to register.  No doubt the taxpayer is now paying for accommodation, food and thinking about letting the rest of the family over here.  When is this country going to stop this? \nI am currently trying to get into Canada. It\u2019s a trauma. Why... to give my kids a better life as I see the UK descend into self-destruct mode.\nSurely if we had an immigration reception centre\u2026 lets say one of our islands a little closer to Norway, Fetlar would be good, then word would soon spread that maybe the UK isn\u2019t such an easy option. \nCertainly don\u2019t give out benefits.  I am sure they could carry out community duties to pay for their up keep.\nRoll on Canada.",
