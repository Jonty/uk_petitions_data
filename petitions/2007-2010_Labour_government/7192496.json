            "background": "This petition demands that the Government brings forward funding in 2008/2009 to dual the A120 between Braintree and Marks Tey. The A120 between Braintree and Marks Tey is very dangerous due to it being extremely overloaded, and single carriageway. Most weeks it is closed at least once, often due to a fatal accident. Not providing these funds for another five or more years will result in many needless casulties & fatalities, endless delays, maintain the misery for local residents, increase Business costs, and prevent the economic benefits of London and Stanstead Airport reaching North East Essex.",
