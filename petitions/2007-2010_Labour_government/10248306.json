Taking finger prints is akin to be being accused of a crime for many UK citizens. So, why does the UK not gain an opt out for its citizens? Failing this, it is only correct that the UK takes finger prints of Americans.\nThe argument of security is non-sense when there are millions of illegal immigrants in USA and the US does nothing about them, because they want cheap labour. Surely, this is also a security issue.",
