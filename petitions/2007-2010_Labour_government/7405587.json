            "background": "Travelodge have decided to go completely non-smoking following the Government legislation on banning smoking in public places in England this year.  This has personal safety implications for disabled smokers, parents of small children, and lone women travellers who are now knowingly being put at risk by being forced outside in secluded places at night to smoke (currently still legal). Think about it, do we need another McCann situation?  The tourist industry will also suffer.  Travelodge policy is unenforceable, dangerous, discriminatory and contrary to current legislation and therefore should be scrapped.",
