        "background": "There is now a recognised link between stress and early miscarriage. At the moment the duty on employers to carry out a risk assessment when women inform them of their pregnancy means that risk assessments can be carried out too late. Please allow women to have the right to request an individual risk assessment from the point they decide to start trying to conceive.\n\nMiscarriages linked to stress occur in early pregnany and women and their babies need to be protected.\n\nMiscarriage can be one of the most traumatic things to happen to a family and this is often not helped by Employer's attitudes.\n\nPlease lets do everything we can to ensure that working Mums can have a safe and stress-free pregnancy.\n\nPlease allow women to have the right to request an individual risk assessment from the point they decide to start trying to conceive.",
