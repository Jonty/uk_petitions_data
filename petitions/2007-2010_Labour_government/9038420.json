            "background": "Diesel spillages are caused by many HGVs and vans which have faulty caps on their fuel tanks or even no caps at all.  Spilt diesel is very difficult to see in wet weather conditions and is as lethal as black ice.  Spilt diesel is a potential killer for motorcyclists and can cause serious accidents for other vehicles too.  This is a hazard that should not be present on our highways and legislation is obviously required to prevent unscrupulous haulage firms and van owners from not taking reasonable resposibility to ensure that they are not creating potentially lethal conditions for other road users",
