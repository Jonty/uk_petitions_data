            "background": "Alan Whicker represents everything that's good in a Englishman. Urbane, polite and utterly without pretention or snobbery. A talented journalist and the ultimate television presenter his 'Whicker's World' show not only educated and entertained the television audience he himself was an ambassador for British values. Politeness, fair play and a genuine interest in learning about the lives of other people from whatever backround. His career as a broadcaster was topped by 'Whicker's War' in which he travelled through Italy recounting his wartime experiences. In charge of a film and photo unit he was often right there in the thick of the fighting and saw many terrible things. Despite this he told he story in his usual quiet, calm and utterly fascinating manner. \n\nHe embodies an old-fashioned Englishness. Something we're in danger of losing . Giving him a knighthood would acknowledge what he is. A thoroughly decent chap.",
