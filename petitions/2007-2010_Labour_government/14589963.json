            "background": "Full body scanners have an important role to play in airport security.\n\nHowever, the computer software that drives the current generation of full body scanners being employed at UK airports is at a very early stage of development. Future relases of the software are expected to produce images of foreign objects being carried by an individual rather than the individual's actual naked body.\n\nUntil this time these machines should be monitored by operators of the same sex as the person being scanned.\n\nThis is because it is unreasonable to expect that in a civilised society an elected government would issue directives forcing individuals to effectively strip naked in front of members of the opposite sex.",
