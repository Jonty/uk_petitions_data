            "background": "I would like to petition the prime minister to offer free prescriptions to all uk residents who suffer with cystic fibrosis.\nLiving with cystic fibrosis is a real rollercoaster,you have ups and you have downs.You worry about the present,you worry about having a future.You fight everyday to live as if it could be your last.You worry about the family coping without you,you worry about the family coping with you.I am lucky, i can work,i can live,i can afford to pay for prescriptions,but i know i am lucky.The majority of people who suffer with this condition,they do not have the lives many of us take for granted.They do not have the finances to chose where to holiday.They chose whether to buy the drugs to prolong their life or to try and live normally,this is the choice that many should not have to make,because without the presciptions they will die,with free presciptions they could live a little longer with the hope that they too could change lives.You could change lives today.Please sign for a better future for all.",
