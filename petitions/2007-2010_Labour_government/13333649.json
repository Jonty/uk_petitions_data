            "background": "Lets keep the call centres and jobs in the uk. Wheres the saying british jobs for british workers. I find when ringing call centres abroad you do not get the best of service due to lack of communication and understanding on both sides and this leads to frustration. There are so many call centres now in India and yet another company in the north east to considering doing the same to get services on the cheap. To me these companies are not really bothered about their customers its all about greed and making millions at the expense of their customers. Particularly in the present climate and more jobs going and increase in unemployment, more reposessions so generally this will have an enormous knock on effect of their actions to get workers on the cheap.",
