            "background": "How many times have you contacted Companies in the UK and spoken to an incompetent call centre operator or general office worker. Often, requests are not processed, calls are not returned and erroneous bills etc issued. There is too much anonimity where employees are concerned- i.e. they are not informed of their errors and or reprimanded for gross incompetence/negligence. Whilst I appreciate that many employees are underpaid, their seems to be no pride taken in their work anymore and they are completely disinterested in fulfilling their contractual obligations. By introducing fines, the persistent offenders should take steps to ensure their employees work to a certain code of practice. Numerous counts of inefficiency should result in disciplinary action. Whatever it takes- lets IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE whether it be banks, solicitors, or phone companies etc. The list is endless and they are ALL getting worse.",
