India and Pakistan are good examples where hundreds of millions of pounds have been given this year alone. This petition believes that those who accept our aid must respect our Christian religion and protect Christians within their country. Britain affords Muslims and Hindus the right of tolerance and free speech therefore our British government ought to demand the same from countries in receipt of our generous help.",
