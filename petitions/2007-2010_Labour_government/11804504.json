        "background": "The current logo on the shirts and promotional material for the England and Wales Cricket Team is \"Three Lions\". This mirrors the logo for the England Football Team but does not reflect the Welsh involvement in cricket. We believe the logo should be two lions and a dragon; this will differentiate us from the football team and also fairly reflect the bi-national nature of our cricket team. We urge the government to use their influence with the England and Wales Cricket Board to change the logo accordingly.",
