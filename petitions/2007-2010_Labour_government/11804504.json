This mirrors the logo for the England Football Team but does not reflect the Welsh involvement in cricket. We believe the logo should be two lions and a dragon; this will differentiate us from the football team and also fairly reflect the bi-national nature of our cricket team. We urge the government to use their influence with the England and Wales Cricket Board to change the logo accordingly.",
