            "background": "As you will notice a third of the roads today (if not more) are currently being used up as bus lanes (no car lanes)which is required for public services to keep to their time schedule which is fair enough, but why should we pay full price road tax when we cant use a third of our roads? therefore I think it is only right for our government to reduce the price of road tax by a third of its price. Dont you agree?",
