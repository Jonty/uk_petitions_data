            "background": "On numerous occasions this year the roads of our local communities have been dangerous due to bad weather conditions. On a daily basis during the winter months our children had to go to school on the school buses when the roads were not safe to travel on. We believe that our childrens lives are paramount and that the local councils should grit the school bus routes so that as parents we can be sure that our childrens lives are not at risk. We are not asking the roads to be gritted every day but only on days when the road condtions are unsafe for them to travel on. East riding of yorkshire council have said that it would cost them 1 million pounds to grit the minor school bus routes but arn't our children worth more than that? People in rural communties pay the same amount of council tax as anybody else so why are we not important enough to have our roads gritted. Our children are worth more than any amount of money and there has already been accidents this school year lets do something about it before the bad weather season starts again in the next school year!!",
