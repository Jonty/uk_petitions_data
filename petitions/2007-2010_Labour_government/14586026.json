        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "EU Council Directive 1999/31/EC aims to reduce the environmental impact of waste landfilling.  The document encourages \u201cthe use of recovered materials and energy so as to safeguard natural resources and obviate wasteful use of land\u201d.  It focuses on recovering materials from current waste streams by introducing stringent requirements for operating landfills.  However, this ignores the impact of landfill sites which closed before the Directive was written, many of which do not benefit from modern pollution prevention measures and are a grave source of concern for surrounding communities.  At the same time many of these closed landfills contain valuable materials that can be safely recovered using modern technology.  Such retrospective recycling would enable the landfill sites to be cleaned in the process.  Local Authorities should therefore be credited for materials recovered from closed landfill sites in their jurisdiction under the landfill allowance trading scheme.",
