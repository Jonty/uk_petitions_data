Of these, 1000 each year \u2013 that's three a day - will die waiting as there are not enough organs available.\n\nUnder a system of \"opting out\" or \"presumed consent\", every person living in that country is deemed to have given their consent to organ donation unless they have specifically \"opted out\" by recording in writing their unwillingness to give organs.  \n\nSupporters of such a system\u2019s introduction in the UK believe that establishing an automatic right to take organs when the donor has not expressed wishes to the contrary would lead to a significant increase in the number of potential donors.",
