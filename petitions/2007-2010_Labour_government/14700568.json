            "background": "A Fresh Start. In order to generate greater credibility and confidence in our parlimentry system, halve the number of Members of Parliment and increase their salary by 50%. Also, 120 Lords in the upper chamber would be sufficient composed of 100 Lords indirectly elected based on each party's share of the vote, plus 20 others appointed independantly from Scientsts, Specialists and Experts. Both Houses would be smaller and more workable. The cost savings from both chambers with fewer support staff, less overheads and expenses would be significant. Welsh and Scottish Members of Parliment should be excluded from voting on English affairs.",
