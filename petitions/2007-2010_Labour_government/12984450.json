            "background": "Newcastle City Council have gone ahead despite objections, and approved the merger of Wharrier Street Primary School with St Anthony's C of E School.  The consultation was flawed and did not reach the whole of the community involved.  There will be job losses and should the Church successfully bid during the competition phase there will be no redeployment.  The freedom of choice has been denied to all of the staff, children, parents and communities involved. We say yes to new school but no to the merger. We feel this decision has been thrust upon us and despite doing a good job the staff in both schools face a fight for their jobs.  This is not democracy this is the powers that be thrusting their decisions upon those involved.",
