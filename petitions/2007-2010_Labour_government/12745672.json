        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently, the rate of Job Seekers Allowance is \u00a350.95 a week for those under the age of 25, where as those over the age of 25 are entitled to \u00a362.30 a week. In training, claimants are entitled to an additional \u00a310, which means that those aged over 25 are getting a whopping \u00a372.30 a week. The figures are based on an ignorant belief that those under the age of 25 need less money than those over 25 and is another example of the Government trying to save money using age discrimination as a weapon against their own citizens.\n\nIncreasing food and fuel prices, including the raising prices on basic clothing items are not covered by the basic rate that those under 25 get, meaning that we are put in a position where we are forced to apply for Budgeting and Crisis Loans solely to pay for basic items such as clothes.\n\nThis is a unacceptable position to be put in and the Government should either standardise the rate of pay for all claimants to the same levels or should change the system to base the rate on circumstance.",
