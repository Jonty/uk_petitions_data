            "background": "In 2009 We saw some pretty bad weather that threw the country into chaos, resulting in school closures for health & safety reasons. In Milton Keynes the average mainstream school was closed for 2-3 days. Special needs schools were closed for 5-6. The reason being the Authority ignored requests for help to clear the roads surrounding the schools so that the authority provided transport could bring the children to the schools. In many cases the school STAFF cleared the roads so that the schools could re-open.",
