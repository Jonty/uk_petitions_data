            "background": "Many people pay the penalty because they either simply forget or do not realise that they entered the zone. \n\nAll the technology is in place for automatic collection of the charge whenever a vehicle enters the zone. \n\nThis facility is allready available but only to large companies with fleets of 10 or more vehicles so why cant individual register their vehicle and pay a small admin charge. \n\nThe argument that the administration overhead would be too high is invalid because the facility to pay by text is allready available and the information about which vehicles have entered the zone is allready collected and cross referenced against payments made. All we want is the human error part of the equation to be removed for those people that want to sign up to an automatic system.\n\nAll those who have slipped up will know the system is pretty well infallible in that it never misses a vehilcle entering the zone. \n\nThe only reason for not allowing this facility to be used by joe public is because it would make a large hole in the revenue stream because inadvertant non payment would be massively reduced. \n\nIt would however be imensely fairer to the people the system is supposed to serve.",
