            "background": "The Endurance Public House has been the subject of a review by Westminster Environmental Health Consultation Team where the prohibition of outside drinking after 6pm was sought. I understand that there was only 1 complainant at the hearing and only 2 complainants in total. I feel that the interests of the 2 residents have been taken out of context in which over 30 residents and local workers were prepared to stand up before the Local Authority to express their support for the Endurance. I wish to give my support to the Endurance and support the ability to drink and socialize outside the Endurance from 6pm to 11pm. The spirit of Soho is embodied by independent operations such as this and to remove such an historic activity would represent a great a loss to London's cultural heritage.",
