            "background": "ICT and the Internet have the capacity to significantly reduce road traffic; this will increasingly happen and could prove to be the Achilles heel of any road pricing policy from a revenue perspective; we already know that commuters contribute more to congestion than any other group. Instead of road pricing firms should be made implement all home-working jobs except where it is justified; I propose that firms pay a congestion tax all personal required within congestion areas; retail businesses should pay a congestion tax on their goods and services. Further, local government must abandon the building of city centre \"congestion magnets\" e.g. the Bullring,Birmingham - it demonstrates lack of planning and foresight. A distributed approach along with ICT strategies would provide more jobs and better quality of life for citizens as well as a bigger opportunity for the post office. Lets treat the root cause and not the symptoms of our congestion problem.",
