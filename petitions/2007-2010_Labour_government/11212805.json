            "background": "We highlight the problems being caused by the Valuation Office Agency's (VOA) late revaluation and presentation of any information to Port Operators in England and Wales.\n\nThe problem is exacerbated by a change in the method of collecting rates on port estates, which was not announced until 2007 (Over 2 years after the date when the VOA should have carried-out the revaluations) and has resulted in operators being faced with massive rates demands, three years back-dated.\n\nOperators see this as grossly unfair and are seeking support to appeal to the Government as the future of many smaller businesses is threatened and we believe the action of the VOA is contrary to Government policy of encouraging investment and jobs within the UK.\n\nThe solution to this crisis is for the backdating demand to be dropped and for a period of consultation before the next Business Rates Review in 2010, giving time for all other aspects to be addressed.\n\nWe hope you can assist by adding your name to this petition and thank you for your co-operation.\n\nGraeme R Nimmo, FICS\nGeneral Manager\nInstitute of Chartered Shipbrokers\nFederation Council.",
