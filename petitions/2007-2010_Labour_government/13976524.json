        "background": "Please do not dismiss the Cambridge Review - we owe it to our children!  The voice of many early years professionals is that children need every opportunity to learn through play, right through to the age of 6 or 7 (especially boys!).  It is disgraceful that we send children to school so young - they are still babies at 4 in so many ways.  They are simply not ready to sit and listen and they gain no advantage over our Scandinavian counterparts whose children start at 6 or 7 and reach similar (if not better) attainment levels.  To send children to school so young, in their eyes, is tantamount to CHILD ABUSE.",
