As there is no registration there is no way of preventing minors from accessing the website.  Whilst you can 'report' indecent content, users cannot get banned as they do not register.\n\nUsers are connected not just by instant messaging, but are also encouraged to use webcams and microphones.\n\nThis website is dangerous, and can and will be used for far worse things than innocent chatting.",
