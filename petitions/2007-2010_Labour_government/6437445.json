        "background": "Modern cars have evolved hugely since the introduction of the current motorway speed limit in 1964 Stopping distances are now greatly reduced from those days as is general vehicle standard and road surfaces.\nPurely to increase traffic flow the limits should be changed. I propose a change to the way they are limited. Lane 1 should be for any speed and all lorries and coaches should be limited to the same 56 mph and prevented from overtaking unless on a hill where a \"crawler\" lane should be implenmented, Lane 2 should have a set speed of 80mph, and lane 3 90mph. It is my opionon that most drivers are happy to travel at 80-90 and can make good progess at that speed, decreasing the short periods of increased speed of over 100mph that we see now simply because people have been delayed by 60mph traffic in lane 2. Strictly enforce the 90mph Top limit and also enforce the minimum limits to keep traffic moving.",
