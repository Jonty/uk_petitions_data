            "background": "most care assistants are working for the minimum wage.  they are expected to complete long hours sometimes as long as 12 hour shifts including nights and still deliver high quality care.  they are expected to complete 5 mandatory training subjects and hold at least a NVQ level 2 in care.  the government are trying to recruit more people into the social care sector with ad campaigns but should be looking instead at the reasons why people leave social care which when asked most care assistants would tell you is because of low paid and long hours. some care assistants are working 12hr night shifts without unsociable hours incentives and working overtime to make up their wages.\nthis petition would ask the government to look at this issue and ask the private sector to look at the way it employs its care staff because without staff a care provider would not function",
