            "background": "The Parthenon Marbles are a collection of marble sculptures which formed part of the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens. Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, obtained permission from the Ottoman authorities to remove sculptures from the Acropolis. The Marbles were transported to Britain, and purchased by the British Government in 1816. They were placed on display in the British Museum, where they are now on view in the Duveen Gallery.\nThe Greek government claims that the marbles should be returned to Athens on moral and artistic grounds, with the aim of reuniting the Parthenon sculptures around the world in order to restore the unity of the monument. So far fragments of the monument have returned from Sweden, the University of Heidelberg and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.\nWe petition the Prime Minister to return the Parthenon Marbles to Greece, as a gesture of respect to a most ancient European civilization, in order to restore the unity of the monument, which thousands of people will be able to admire daily at its birthplace.",
