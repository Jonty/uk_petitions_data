            "background": "In the past 2 years the cost of applying for Indefinite Leave to stay in the UK for a foreign spouse or to apply for Citizenship has increased to over \u00a3800 for an application.  This is unfair on those people who have chosen to marry and live in the UK as they are being taxed to stay togther.  Instead of supporting families this is a tax on people wishing to live together and create a life in the UK.  The fee should be reduced to reflect the actual cost of an application rather than it being a punitive tax on people who have no choice if they want to be together.",
