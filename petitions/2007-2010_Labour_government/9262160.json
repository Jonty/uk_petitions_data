Some are even paying below minimum wage and expecting the worker to make up the deficit in tips. If I give waiting staff a tip I want that tip to go to the person who served me, or, at the very least be combined with the tips of other staff and shared out equally. I do NOT want ANY  of my tip to contribute to company coffers.",
