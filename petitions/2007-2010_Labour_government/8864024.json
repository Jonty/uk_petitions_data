        "background": "All of the major players in the drinks and alcohol and entertainment ministry are making millions out of the excessive and irresponsible retailing and sale of their product. 6,000 people a year are losing their lives to alcohol whilst the drinks and entertainment industry make massive profits year on year. Alcohol treatment services are massivley overstretched, under funded and for people trapped in the misery of alcoholism they are not enough. Alcohol causes illnesses that fall outside of the drug and alcohol treatment world people have a number of physical an psychological consequences that involve the NHS, A&E, mental Health service & police to name but a few. The tax and duty approach has never addressed the marketing or distribution of alcohol products. The goverment need to raise the tax on the most dangerous products such as the super strength lagers. But at the same time adopt a corporate taxation approach to tacking the giants in the industry so they can stump up for the resources that the taxpayer is currently paying twice over to maintain.",
