        "background": "Religion and state MUST be kept seperate. \n\nLeave religion for Church/home.\n\nIts time to abolish this absurd, highly outdated practice - Catholic schools  cause social and sectarian divisions within the community.\n\nAt a time when the Government is devoted to social equality and integration for all, they should be abolishing this absurd status-quo.\n\nCiting the success of catholic schools would be highly unfair to non-Catholic pupils in non-denom. schools, showing an integral inequality in the system. Nondenom. schools are successful too.\n\nThe state still pays for almost all the costs of these schools, yet 15%* is paid by the Church to \"bribe\" the government into retaining their stranglehold on education. (*Source: CEW website)\n\n\"The Catholic nature of the school will underpin all that the school does and all the decisions that it makes. This cannot be achieved without staff who share in the faith of the whole Catholic Church\" - (from CEW website)\n\nEqual opportunities? Definitely not.",
