However, Raj Persuad has given hours of endless amusement to dedicated Raj-watchers as we delight in his ability to make lots of money by stating the obvious.  \n\n\n\"Plagiarize, \nLet no one else's work evade your eyes, \nRemember why the good Lord made your eyes, \nSo don't shade your eyes, \nBut plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize... \nOnly be sure always to call it please research\n\nTom Lehrer - Lobachevsky",
