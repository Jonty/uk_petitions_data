            "background": "We would urge the Prime Minister, in his dealings with Kenya during the current crisis, to consider first and foremost the betrayal of the democratic rights of the Kenyan people instigated by Mr Kibaki through the rigging of the Presidential election (as attested by every independent observer and commentator). Britain should not to pursue a diplomatic approach dressed-up as \u2018even-handed\u2019, \u2018pragmatic\u2019, \u2018in the interests of stability/order/security\u2019 or similar terms, but which effectively endorses the disenfranchisement of a people. We encourage the Prime Minister to meditate on his own position as a leader possessing democratic legitimacy and consider fully what is implied by the message that compromising democratic principles is sometimes acceptable. Most Kenyans are fair-minded, reasonable, peace-loving and freedom-loving and need our unequivocal support in their struggle to regain their political rights.",
