        "background": "VAT is a tax that you pay when you buy goods and services in the European Union, including the United Kingdom. Where VAT is payable it's normally included in the price of the goods or service you buy. Some goods don't attract VAT.\nAt present there are 3 rates of VAT:\na standard rate, currently 17.5%,\na reduced rate, currently 5%, and,\na zero rate.\n\nThis petition is to ask the Government to abolish all VAT. There is no need for it whatsoever, it costs the consumers more money than necessary and generates little income. We all already pay tax in the form of Income Tax and Council Tax, why should we then be taxed again a third time with VAT?",
