            "background": "Whilst it may be little known, a link has been found between Depo Provera, the birth control shot, and fibromyalgia. The mechanism appears to be that Depo Provera causes glutomate excitotoxicity; high levels of glutomate which damage or kill nerve cells. \n\nExcitotoxicity can cause any number of diseases from fibromyalgia, to alzheimers, huntingtons, multiple sclerosis and parkinsons. \n\nI believe that if any woman was warned of the possible consequences they would refuse to go onto this form of birth control and instead explore different possibilities. \n\nMany women have posted accounts online that they developed fibromyalgia after being put on Depo Provera. \n\nAny link must be fully researched in order to give us more understanding of these diseases, excitotoxicity and it's affects on the body, and why Depo Provera causes excitotoxicity. \n\nI ask that the government put funding into researching this disease and, if necessary, removing Depo Provera from the NHS to prevent any more women unnecessarily suffering.",
