        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "the dutch have a wider range of drugs available and within holland there is a more relaxed culture where drug dealers of  cannabis,magic mushrooms and alcohol are safer to supply a product ie not pushing hard drugs at the same time as having a pint,smoking or ingesting cannabis or mushrooms.\n\nas a UK citizen i see the drunk and disorderly most days of the week and in reasonably built up areas like towns and citys we also see the hard drug addicts stealing from shops, people and homes if the government was to adopt a similar attitude to the dutch we may find our streets are safer to walk during the day and at night \n\nthere are obvious governmental aspects to the dutch attitudes i.e cannibis tax / cannibis selling tax prostitue licences and prostitutional tax also smart shop tax, phillisoblin (magic mushroom) tax \n\nthe revenue from such taxes would equally pay for treatment of drug related problems i.e heroin/cocaine addicts being imprisoned for lengthy periods, enforcement of methadone program and long sentences to ensure the addict will be clean from the heroin/methadone on release of imprisonment",
