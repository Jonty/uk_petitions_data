            "background": "People who have been convicted have served their punishments, they do not deserve further punishment by being unable to find a job. 99% of people with convictions are thoroughly sorry and remorseful for what they have done and are completely changed people once they come out of jail. Many people with convictions are intelligent, educated and good people who have made one silly mistake and paid the price. After having served their sentences, these people do not deserve the extra humiliation of having to delcare convictions which they have already paid the price for. This rule should only be waived in exceptional circumstances where the person is considered dangerous.",
