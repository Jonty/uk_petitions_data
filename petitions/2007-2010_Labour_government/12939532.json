            "background": "The design industry is a creative industry and all too often ACID is increasingly aware of the emotional damage suffered by a designer when their designs are copied.  This can have an extremely detrimental effect on their future ability and willingness to create new designs. A dissuasive system of damages for IP infringement needs to be created to discourage design theft.\n\nIn the recently published Government response to the consultation paper \u201cLaw of Damages\u201d, The Ministry of Justice has ignored a Government implementation commitment on all recommendations in the 2006 Gowers Review on intellectual property to improve damages awarded for intellectual property theft. Despite this commitment, the MoJ has failed to address the lack of a deterrent effect within the existing damages regime. Gowers had recommended that the MoJ consult over the creation of such a deterrent function for civil damages awards for IP crime. Clearly, one of the main disincentives to a copier or dealer in copies of pirated goods is the potential remedies available against them should action be brought.  Currently there are no criminal sanctions available for design infringement.",
