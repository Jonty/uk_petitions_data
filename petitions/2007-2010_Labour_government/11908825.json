An ill advised remark  would be a national embarrassment and make us appear to be backward fools on the international stage.  Indeed Rednecks from America would parody our royal family as intolerant, racist, inbreeds.  \n\nGiven that President Obama has a penchant for missile attacks, using pilotless drone planes in Pakistan, we should also be aware of the potential security consequences of Prince Philip angering President Obama.",
