        "background": "Settle's small population of 2400 residents is under threat from some huge developments, one of which is for over 200 new houses on the fields behind the Falcon hotel. Settle does not have the infrastructure to deal with such a massive and sudden population increase, and the character of this traditional market town could be ruined by a large-scale development. We want to make sure that: (1) Our greenfield sites are protected from property developers; (2) Any developments take into account the limitations of our local infrastructure (schools, doctors, roads, rail); (3) Developments are small enough to not affect the character of Settle.",
