            "background": "At the moment there is a law to say that the minimum temperature we have to deal with in an office or building is 20 degrees Celsius. But there is nothing to say that if it gets above thirty action must be taken. Today I had to work inside in heat of 33 degrees celsius and I have to buy my own drinks. To make the matter worse I have to wear a tie and a shirt, which in this weather is constricting to say the least. \nI think there should be a maximum temperature that people should have to work in. Other hotter countries have a siesta at the hottest times of the day because of the heat. So why is there nothing in this country. It would not affect us that often, but would ensure that employers place air conditioning or fans in hot rooms or offices, and that temperatures all year round should be kept between 20 to 25 degrees. \nAll of you that agree please sign up. There are people out there with skin conditions that find it impossible to work in such heat. These people should be catered for.\nThank you for your Support.",
