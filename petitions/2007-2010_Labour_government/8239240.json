            "background": "At present, Child Maintainece is classed as \"income\" when Income Support is calculated. Income Support is awarded to the parent only. As Child Maintaince is intended to provide financial support to the child/children, it is grossley unfair that it should be classed as part of the parent's income. The CM is for the child/children, not the parent!Due to CM payments, my total income support is \u00a327 per week, well below what the Government says I need to live on. I have a choice, either go hungry or use my children's CM payments to supplement my food,etc. In short, taking money away from my children so I can eat.\nI urge the Government to disregard CM payments as income when calculating Income Support.",
