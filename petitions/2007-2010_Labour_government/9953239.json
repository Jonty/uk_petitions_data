        "background": "Pode Hole sub post office serves a community of largely elderly residents as well as land and factory workers, and there is also a well stocked and friendly general store run by John and Rose. Closures of sub post offfices (and main post offices, come to that) have led to huge queues, long waiting times and impersonal service at those left. See the example of Grantham. I urge the Government to seriously consider the social, as well as the economic, consequences of further closures of sub post offices, of which Pode Hole is one of the best used and most needed in this area.",
