            "background": "Sydenham Road is a local high street and a vital East-West London \u2018A\u2019 road link.\nAlthough some aspects of the plan are welcomed by local people, the FURTHER REDUCTION of road width is not. It will cause more congestion to all traffic including buses and emergency vehicles. It will be dangerous for cyclists and will endanger pedestrians when cyclists are forced onto the pavements.\n\nDuring the consultation process, people have consistently said that they do not want more congestion on Sydenham road, Westwood Hill or Kirkdale, nor do they want the pavements widened. They just want them to be cleared of clutter, hoardings, shop encroachment and rubbish. These comments have been ignored.\nDue to the already slow movement of vehicles, HUMPS on Sydenham Road (raised platforms, cushions etc.) are unnecessary. They damage vehicles and shake buildings, cause noise pollution and increase fumes. They quickly deteriorate, creating potholes and uneven surfaces, increasing repair costs to tax payers. \nAll of these will adversely affect the local environment making Sydenham less attractive for those who live, work, shop and travel through it.",
