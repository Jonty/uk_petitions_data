            "background": "I am a 60 year old UK resident with a servere disibility,who has been paying my contributions since i was 15 years old until 2 years ago when my GP told me to stop work.I use the internet alot as going out to socialise is very difficult for me being disabled.I met a very charming Chinese lady who is a retired resident of China  .We have known each other for two years and i have visited her twice.We decided to marry and she would become my full time wife and carer.Aplying for a spouse visa would be quite straight forward.How naive i was.Looking through the visa form there was no referance of disabled people aplying,only the employed or unenployed with a bank full of money.My benefits are guarenteed for my life time.My wife is not allowed to claim benefits you say,neither of us WANT this,we just want to be together,to live on our miniture income and enjoy our twilight years face to face instead of via a PC screen.I have to be supported by public funds through no fault of my own.I went on the Prime Ministers web site at the Home Office for Equality and diversity and found the following statement:Our mandate is to protect the public,regardless of race,religion,gender and DISIBILITY.",
