            "background": "Recent press reports have stated that Channel Five are looking to remake the 80s classic TV show Minder, with Shane Ritchie reprising the iconic part of Arthur Daley, played with such distinction originally by George Cole.  This would be a total travesty and besmirch the memory of one of Britain's best loved TV dramas as well as being in breach of Section 2.1 of Ofcom's broadcasting code (which states \"Generally accepted standards must be applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion in such services of harmful and/or offensive material\").  The concept of Shane Ritchie playing Arthur Daley certainly qualifies under the banner of \"offensive material\".  Therefore, we ask for this great series to be officially protected by the Government and that Channel Five or anyone else are forbidden from remaking one of the \"crown jewels\" in Britain's televisual history in the same manner that the World Cup must be shown on terrestrial television.",
