            "background": "The Schengen agreement is the agreement that allows border-free travel within Europe. Every EU country except the two newest members (Romania and Bulgaria) have signed up. Switzerland and Norway are in the Schengen agreement, even though they aren't EU members. \n\nIf the UK and Ireland joined Schengen, it would mean no more passports for travel to Paris, Brussels, and across the continent. We would be able to secure our borders through effective intelligence sharing, rather than wasting manpower and money on useless paperwork. \n\nThe rest of Europe is already border-free. It's time for us to join in.",
