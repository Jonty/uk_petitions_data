            "background": "Having seen numbers drop in the Air Training Corps and other cadet forces I think that, the government should create a TV advert to advertise the Air Training Corps to youths, as these days they do not know what they could achieve going to such an organisation. i.e free flying, gliding, shooting, DofE etc.\nThe advert should film some of the activities and direct them to a website where they can find their nearest squadron etc.",
