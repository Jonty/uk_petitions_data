            "background": "Too many senior mangers have too much power in schools often bully and intimidate staff by victimising them.  The autonomy in schools is often 99% and therefore staff are often forced to do tasks they are uncomfortable with but are forced to do for fear of there jobs.  More control and legislation needs to be placed on the so called managers and the HR Staff to support rather than destroy staff.",
