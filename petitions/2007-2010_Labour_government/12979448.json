        "background": "As we all know with what has happened with the NRE contract our British call centres are at serious threat if we do not act now. A lot of these call centres have rejuvenated mining communities such as Dearne Valley,  but they will all eventually close with work being shipped abroad if we don\u2019t act NOW. So please petition Mr Brown to stand by his \"British Jobs for British Workers\" and stamp out the transfer of calls going abroad. Not only is it frustrating speaking to someone with little knowledge of the English Language but in these current times OUR jobs need protecting.",
