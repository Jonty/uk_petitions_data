        "background": "I want the government to ban the use of all fireworks in England, Scotland and Wales. It is not only dangerous, but very anti-social. They cause many unnecessary accidents and fires. Which usually lead to scars not only mentally but physically.  They can also cause many deaths. They upset vulnerable people and pets i.e., the elderly and children. I would like to ask the question why do people use fireworks?  Is to celebrate Guy Fawkes who tried to blow up the houses of parliament?",
