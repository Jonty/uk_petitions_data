            "background": "1a.over the last few years one railway removed nearly every other train which stopped at Worstead station. i propose that thy reinstate if not all, the key services for the many people that have jobs and other important needs to get into the city. it would affect the timetable by mere minutes, minutes which often are spent waiting on a stationary train outside of norwich whilst they move other trains around. \n1b. for there to be a revision of the last evening train out of norwich to sheringham, to call at all stops. \n as there are many people working in the city that live outside of the city, national express should amend their timetable to run a train later than 22.45 sheringham bound from norwich. for people who work in norwich there should at least be a service around midnight to transport workers home. there would also be a high demand from people on nights out and recreational trips that would use the services.",
