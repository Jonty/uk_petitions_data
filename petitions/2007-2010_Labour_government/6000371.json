            "background": "By having animal's, particulary dog's, cat's, rabbit's etc. receiving a standard health check-up at least one per year by a veterinary surgeon, will help reduce the amount of animal's dying for no apparent reason.  With these check's being carried out, a veterinary surgeon will be able to spot any signs of illness in an animal that the owner may not.  It will also help reduce the amount of obese and starving animal's, spot abused animal's, and any other suffering an animal may be subjected to.\n\nWe all know taking a pet to see a veterinary surgeon costs money, but those who love their pet's will pay a small fee for a check-up, just to make sure their pet is ok.",
