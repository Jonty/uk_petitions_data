        "background": "Following the recent furore in the national media regarding comments made on the Russell Brand radio show on BBC Radio2, Mr Brand felt he had no choice but to resign his position with the corporation.\n\nMillions of fans listened to his show on Saturday nights and these fans have now been deprived of this pleasure due to the inflammatory reporting of this issue and the complaints received.  At the time of writing there are 30,000 complaints on this matter which is an insignificant number compared to the number of fans of Russell Brand in this country.\n\nIt is the role of the BBC as a public service broadcaster to provide a service to EVERYONE who pays the license fee and not just the small minority who have complained so we urge the BBC to reconsider this matter and to offer Russell Brand an alternative outlet on the BBC.",
