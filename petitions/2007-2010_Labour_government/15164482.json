This is approximately 4000 per day and 1 every 20 seconds.\nIn Britain we are privilaged enough that we never have to worry that our water will kill us so we take it for granted. If this petition is successful and recieves enough support from the public, the government will have to do something about it. By just signing your name, you can help to save the lives of those less fortunate than yourself.\nwww.WaterAid.org",
