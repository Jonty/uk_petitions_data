            "background": "Judiciary independence is not working.  It gives judges carte blanche to ignore the law and face no consequences.  They have a job for life no matter how badly they do the job and how many wrong decisions they make.  This must stop NOW.\n\nWe, the undersigned, ask for:\n\n1.  An independent body to ensure that judges decide cases on point of law.\n\n2.  Case law to be disposed of as it is not real law, it is previous decisions which could be the result of influence or corruption.\n\n3.  A three strike policy to deal with judges who repeatedly ignore the law in their decision making. If a judge makes three decisions which are not based on point of law then that judge should be removed from the judiciary dishonourably.\n\n4.  The route of appeal should only be used to deal with decisions that have been based on point of law.  Where a decision has not been based on point of law, the route should be complaint through the independent body. \n\nIn the interests of justice we ask for these changes NOW.",
