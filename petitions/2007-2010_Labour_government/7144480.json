        "background": "Diesel exhaust is more carcinogenic than cigarette smoke, but isn't regulated like smoking. Rather, our tax system encourages more diesel use.  Recent studies have shown it readily contributes to clogged arteries and lung disease.  Diesel will never be banned but we should discourage it's use by increasing taxes on this dirty fuel.",
