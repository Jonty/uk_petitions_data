It is possible that the only reason it is being pushed to the shelves of supermarkets is to make huge unfair profits from the sale of drugs that will be used to treat the serious illnesses people will suffer as a result of eating it. Please make it law that irradiated food must be clearly labelled in writing as \"IRRADIATED\".",
