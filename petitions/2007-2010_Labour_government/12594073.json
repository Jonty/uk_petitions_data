He appears to be self serving or trying to preserve secrecy of an old boys network. \nHe does not represent the transparency and integrity that the British public expect of their democratic system.\nIt is also intolerable that due to tradition, this person sits immune to the workings of democracy and cannot be voted away. He is \"simply the worst Speaker in living memory\" (Melanie Phillips, Daily Mail, 25 February 2008)",
