        "background": "Technological developments in the modern world have changed the nature of television, and consumers' perception of it, and we believe that some of these developments should have an impact on the UK TV Licence. Principally:\n\nAdvertising is an accepted and widespread part of our culture, and would likely be tolerated by the majority of a BBC audience.\n\nThe BBC iPlayer can be accessed by those not residing in the UK, meaning that UK residents are paying for a service available free to the rest of the world.\n\nWith the second factor particularly in mind, we would like to request that the Prime Minister open discussion on the TV Licence, in the hope that it could be amended or abolished as is determined to be appropriate.",
