            "background": "Single people can claim a discount on their council tax as they live alone, but it is only 25%\nThis means they are paying 25% more than two people living in a household together. With all the help the government is offering people with children and families, hardworking single people feel ignored. \n\nIt is logical that a 1-person household should pay 50% of the tax of a 2-person one as we're only using half the council services two people are - in fact if more than 2 adults live in a house, they don't pay any more - so single people are paying the highest rate of tax per person of any group. \n\nThis would be a small concession for single people but would let us know the Government appreciates our hard work and contribution to society too.",
