            "background": "I am continually horrified at the lenient sentences given to sex offenders, from community service to a few months in prison, where they lead a fairly cushy life.These offenders should be jailed for the remainder of their lives to prevent them destroying the lives of innocent children. They cannot be rehabilitated and we should stop wasting money even trying to change these monsters into useful members of society.Why is it that offenders get far more therapy thrown at them than their victims who will suffer for the rest of their lives? No-body wants them in their community, living near their children. Please, sign this petition so that we can stop these monsters living amongst us.",
