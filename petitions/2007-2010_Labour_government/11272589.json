            "background": "The gov\u2019t has proscribed dozens of terrorist groups. It must proscribe al aqsa martyrs brigade for these reasons:\n\nThey have committed hundreds of brutal terror attacks, including the use of child suicide bombers (e.g. April 2005), that have killed & maimed hundreds of innocent victims.\n\nThe group has a British connection: They claimed joint responsibility for a 2003 terrorist attack carried out by two Britons on a pub in Tel Aviv, Israel. This attack has been cited as the protocol for the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India. \n\nTheir exclusion from the list of terrorist groups is inexplicable given that groups that are far less active, that have killed far few people, & that have no apparent connection to the UK, have been proscribed.\n\nTheir exclusion from the list of terrorist groups can only be explained by the political connection to Fatah. The gov\u2019t should do its utmost to prevent terror & not give way to political persuasions.",
