            "background": "In the month of February 2009, an unusually dry and hot summer, along with arson / human error, lead to uncontrollable Bush fires in the Australian State of Victoria, by the 10th February 2009 181 men, women and children have perished, with thousands more loosing their homes, and businesses, and the death toll expected to rise considerably.\n\nThis Petition is to encourage the British Prime Minister to create an aid package for the Australian People affected by this disaster. The aid package should contain Food and Bottled water supplies, Financial aid to help re-build infrastructure, and clothes to help those who have lost everything.\n\nHelping our own Blood, and former colony is a much greater need than helping a non-related country like Gaza, and I urge the Prime Minister to pledge at least part of this Aid package!",
