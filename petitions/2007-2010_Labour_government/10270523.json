            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many private individuals own preserved buses and ex-HGV vehicles and run them with funding from donations etc. A new taxation catagory may be a way to help preserved vehicle owners. The recent increase in fuel by the oil companies may forse some owners to consider scapping their vehicles or making them static exhibits, so any financial help from the Chancelor would be made most welcome by all. Many of these vehicles are only used when the owner takes them to a preserved vehicle or similar rally. With increses in the cost of fuel we are concerned there will be a knock on effect and manufacturers and suppliers may increase prices on a wide range of goods and services to cover the increases. If this is the case the donations from the public may dry up and make future preservation just a pipe dream and not a reality.",
