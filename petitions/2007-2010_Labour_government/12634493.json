            "background": "Charles Bronson has served three years over his recommended tarriff. He has been caged like an animal in solitary confinement for over 30 years. He has been kept on closed visits for over 10 years and has been denied being able to even hug his 78 yr old mother. The authorities have denied him to progress despite him showing no form of violence in ten yrs. Prison should be about rehabilitation. Child killers, Paedophiles, Murderers and terrorists have been, and still are being freed early on parole.Yet Charles Bronson has not been decategorized, still remains on closed visits, still remains in solitary confinement and is denied all progress. This man should be given the freedom that he deserves. He has paid for his crime, done the time and now should be free to live the rest of his life with his family and friends. He is 57 years old and is not a threat to anyone.His human rights have been severly breached for many years. He is caged and treated like an animal despite having never killed anyone!\nHe should immedialty be granted open visits and de categorized allowing him to progress and should be given a release date as soon as possible.",
