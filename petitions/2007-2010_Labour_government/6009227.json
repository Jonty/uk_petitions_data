            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Road pricing is a pointless solution to the congestion on the UK's roads, the vast majority of which  is caused by vehicles with insufficient speed to ensure a smooth flow of traffic (e.g. tractors), the elderly driving dangerously slowly, and drivers driving dangerously quickly.\n\nTherefore, a much better solution would be to instead implement minimum speed limits on main roads, even if it means limiting slower vehicles to calmer roads.\n\nAs well as this, cars owned or driven by new drivers (less than 4 yrs) should be speed limited to 65MPH. This would mean much calmer speeds driven by new drivers, greatly reducing the chance of crashes.\n\nIn addition to this, drivers should also be assessed by an approved driving instructor or assessor at least every 10 years, to ensure they are still safe to drive, and if failed should have their licenses revoked until they pass a re-test, helping to keep the UK's highways safe from those who are unfit or not able to drive safely and with respect to others.",
