        "background": "It is all fine and well charging people to park but what about those who stay in the city and pay council tax for the privilege? We contribute greatly to the local economy and should not be discriminated against for wanting to park our car in OUR city. The people of Glasgow should be encouraged to frequent the city as they are the same individuals who have to live here. We should also be provided with free parking for our cars. People from out with the cities boundary should continue to pay. This idea, if successful from the residents point of view, should be rolled out country wide.",
