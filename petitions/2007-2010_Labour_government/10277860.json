Is it too cheap to be ethical or too expensive to afford at all?  Now apparently Brown thinks we buy and waste too much. I would suggest he spends a month with the average hardworking family who are struggling to make ends meet before he rattles out this type of drivel.  The real wastage is coming from the likes of him and all the other overpaid, bonus driven, pigs at the trough flunkies we laughingly call MP's, who represent the true greed and waste in this country.  Are you sure you're really listening to us Gordon!",
