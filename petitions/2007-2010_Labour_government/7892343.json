            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The government continually uses wording that is not consistent with the law and excludes the non-religious in society.  As an example, in the recent \"Face-to-Face and Side-by-Side\" consultation (Dec 2007), continual reference was made to \"faith communities\" and the \"Inter Faith Network\", which excludes those in society who are non-religious or indifferent to religion.\n\nIf the government is serious about promoting community cohesion then it must use language that is inclusive to all.  The Human Rights Act 1998, Employment Act 2003 and Part 2 of the Equality Act 2006 all make it an offence to discriminate on grounds of \"Religion or Belief\" and this includes a lack of religion or belief.  So the government should not continue to use the term \"Faith\" which excludes those with non-religious beliefs.\n\nThe term \u201cfaith\u201d excludes circa 8 million UK citizens who are non-religious, based on the 2001 Census, and this figure is likely to be much higher based on other polls and surveys since 2001.",
