            "background": "Every time the government needs to raise revenue they increase taxes on all forms of motoring and claim its about climate change when in fact if you look at the real facts a prius is more harmfull to the enviroment than a 5 series bmw but is in a much lower tax bracket under the guise of being enviromentally friendly. Motorists are not cash cows nor are they so stupid as to buy into eco taxes claims and all the government is doing is making themselves look stupid and dishonest.",
