            "background": "These sad events did not take place in this country, they happened in America nevertheless other countries should learn from them by attempting to make schools and universities safer.\nSchools are generally quite safe due to the whole paedophilia and shool abduction worry. Also, due to the deaths of Holly Wells,  Jessica Chapman and sara payne. But do we need to wait for something so fatal before we do what needs to be done?\n\nSome university campuses are so open plan that literally anyone can walk on and off campus when they want, especially universities that provide services for the public such as a sports centre or cinema for example. Nonetheless, students are entitled to security. Especially when live on campus, there is nothing they can do but trust that universities are doing all necessary to ensure that they are safe and that anyone who tries to endanger anyone else is stopped. However, this is not the case in all universities and not all students feel safe.\nSomething needs to be done before something similar to the Virginia Tech massacre occurs in England or maybe even worse.",
