        "background": "Individual licences to smoke, whereby the purchase of cigarettes could not be made without the presentation of such a licence.\nThis licence will mean that the smokers health can be monitored and government health campaigns could target smokers. This licence could prevent new smokers from starting as the pre-requisite of a licence would be that of a health check to proove that the smoker is indeed a current smoker and the extent to which the individual smokes.\nThe licence would remove the convienience of just purchasing a pack of cigarettes at the age of 18 and protect establishments from serving under age individuals.",
