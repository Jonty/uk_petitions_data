            "background": "Reclining seats do not work in economy class as the person sitting in front of you reclines their seat and the back of the seat is on your knees. This means that it's impossible to get out and the other passengers sitting with you to visit the toilet. Plus cannot use your table, so people using laptops (not all flights have business class) cannot use them. The international airline industry must set a minimum seat pitch size for reclining seats without annoying the passenger behind. At the moment, the typical seat pitches are too small to recline.",
