            "background": "Deputy Defense Minister Matan Vilna'i warned Palestinians of a 'Shoah' meaning 'disaster' or 'conflugrtion'; a word most commonly used in reference to the atrocities of the Jewish Holocaust. Now this horrific and systematic killing is being imposed upon the Gazan's in what could lead to a similar anhilation of the Palestinians. We call for a complete withdrawl of Israeli forces not just from within Gaza but it's borders and the lifting of the illegal embargo that is starving and slowly eliminating the population.",
