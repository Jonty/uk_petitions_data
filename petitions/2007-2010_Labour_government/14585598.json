        "background": "The streets in the East end of Glasgow makes for a shocking sight. There is litter dumped on pavements, grassy verges and any spot you can possibly think of. There is no sight of a street cleaner or any attempt from the council to improve the situation. Walking through the areas of Bridgeton, Parkhead, Rutherglen, Tollcross and many others you find there are few bins and those that you do come across are overflowing and surrounded by rubbish bags. There are children living in and around these areas and it would appear that because it is made up mostly of council/housing tenants, they are not entitled to live in a well kept, decent area. Tens of thousands of people are actively seeking employment and the Glasgow city council could create employment chances for people willing to clean these streets. Please clean up Glasgow.",
