            "background": "Keep Derby and the rest of the East Midlands free. More charges on unnecessary car travel but only with better public transport, safer cycleways & rules.\nClear charges & a direct policy for the charge to go by law to other transport would make it fair & help other transport compete with the cheapness of car driving.\nDerby has increasingly become a city with a single track policy based towards the powerful car lobby, bad expensive buses, strange cycle lanes, no pedestrian crossing or ones that only change for a short period when there are no cars.\nA ring road that destroys any hopes of walking into the city centre, dangerously park cars & illegal pavement driving.\nBusiness, commuting & social activities would improve with a better policy away from cars & less Government money spent on all the new roads that get built every year. Everywhere we go there is a new road being built or widened and it never solves this never ending car madness.\nIt is an intolerable interference with our freedom.\nIf the council is determined to press ahead, then let the people of Derby decide in a fair referendum whether they want congestion charging, but only with a sensible two sided unbiased arguement!",
