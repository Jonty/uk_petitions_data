            "background": "Stephen Gough may be eccentric (especially considering the weather) but he is doing no one any harm. It is ridiculous that he is spending more time in jail than a mugger. He is making the point that, since we are born naked, it is a breach of our human rights to be forced to arbitrarily drape our bodies in bits of cloth. While not many may wish to emulate him, it makes the law look an ass to fill our jails with harmless campaigners.\nScotland is responsible for its own laws, but if the government can approach foreign governments on behalf of British citizens it can surely appeal to the Scottish Justice Minister on behalf of an English citizen.",
