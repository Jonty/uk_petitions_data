            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I ask the government to end road gritting with salt. To seek alternatives - using chains in snow conditions, using winter tyres (tyres currently used on most vehicles are designed for road holding at speed in good/moderate conditions, not snow/ice), compulsory reduced speed limits.\nGrit costs up to \u00a3150/ton, melts some snow/ice, but at temp\u2019s in some areas the resultant solution is slippery, and then freezes. With increased road traffic in recent years there\u2019s more rubber worn onto road surfaces, salt releases this contributing further to slimy slippery roads.\nSalt pollutes watercourses damaging the environment, penetrates/corrodes road surfaces causing damage to tarmac/concrete, leading to expensive road repair bills. It corrodes vehicles.\nUsing winter tyres adds cost to motoring, but is cheap compared to accidents and increased insurance. Chains supplied to motorists through garages and retailers & kept for future freezes would cost government far less than the provision of salt.",
