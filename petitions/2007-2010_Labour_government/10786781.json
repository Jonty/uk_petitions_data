        "background": "The British people are paying a high price for the greed and incompetence of financiers and the permissive regulatory regime that allowed this mess to get out of control.\n\nWe demand that unilateral action be taken to stop further abuses and that an investigation be held into whether individual directors are culpable.\n\nStrong and swift action should be taken against individuals that were incompetent or simply abusing the rules. \n\nFurthermore, any bail outs should be conditional on return of public moneys, in the form of long term loans, much like a reverse private finance initiative.  \n\nAll financial instruments that are designed to act  against the good of the wider community should be banned.\n\nAll guilty senior bankers and their regulators must demonstrate contrition, in the Japanese fashion, on prime time television, preferably when children are watching.",
