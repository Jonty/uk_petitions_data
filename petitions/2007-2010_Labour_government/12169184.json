            "background": "We are alarmed about the proposals being discussed in the media and elsewhere regarding changes to the British monarchy such as granting women equal succession rights and admitting Catholics. The monarchy is a traditional institution and this is the whole basis of its authority. The monarchy as it currently exists enjoys overwealming support from the British public as it is and there is no demand nor appetitie for radical changes to be made to it. We believe that this is republicanism by the back door the purpose of which is to fundamentally undermine the institution of the monarchy. We respectfully ask the Prime Minister to stop such talk and appeal to Her Majesty to stop engaging in any further discussions on this matter.",
