        "background": "As a Registered Mental Health Nurse I am concerned about the growing number of patients being diagnosed with Khat induced Psychosis. Khat is a substance which is taken into the body by chewing leaves. It is illegal around the world, except in Somalia and here in the United Kingdom.\n\nSymptoms of Khat induced include: hallucinations, delusion, mania, depression, and anxiety. Khat has also been connected to insomnia, high blood pressure, and impotence. It also has links to the development of mouth cancer\n\nI am requesting for Khat to become a class B drug, as it contains the equivalent of Amphetamine, so to save the lives of my patients and other people in the community.",
