            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Wirral Borough Council proposes to close 3 schools, including Ridgeway, to create 2 Academies. Ridgeway High School is an Outstanding school (OFSTED 2007)and is 8th best school on the Wirral (based on 2009 GCSE results) only bettered by Faith, Grammar and Independent Schools. The DCSF have asked Ridgeway to join a national project to help other schools improve their own standards in education.\n\nRidgeway at present has approximately 6% surplus of places.\n\nSince 2006 Ridgeway has continuously built upon its success by improving its GCSE results 5 A*-C (E&M) by 10% each year achieving 47% in 2009 and staff project a success rate of 58% for 2010.\n\nWe strongly feel that this success is a result of the hard work shown by both Ridgeway staff and pupils and the commitment shown to the school by the local community. \n\nWe urge you not to allow this success and hard work be rewarded with closure.",
