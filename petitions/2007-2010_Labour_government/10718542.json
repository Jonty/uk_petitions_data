            "background": "The United States want to extradite Gary McKinnon to face a sixty year prison sentence  and have even threatened him with \"being fried\" and as they want to try him in Virginia and they still have the Death penalty, this is very frightening. Since when do we extradite UK citizens for computer mis-use, which carried a community service sentence in the UK. \n  \nAn extradition done on the strength of an allegation alone for a non-violent crime (Gary has always denied causing any damage) but no Prima Facie evidence is now required. We cannot extradite American citizens without proof but America can now take any UK citizen on the strength of an allegation alone. \n\nPrevented him from being extradited to a country that shows scant regard for Human Rights and now advocates and approves of torture being used. They are morally bankrupt.",
