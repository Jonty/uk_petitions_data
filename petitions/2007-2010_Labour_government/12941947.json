            "background": "Instead of the normal 7 day week create a 8 day week. Although this would create alot of current data change to include the new day of the week I personnaly feely the global world would benifit. As an employee I feel the current working enviroment is extrmey stressfull.\nI personally believe that includng a extra day into the current seven day week would reduce global stress ( GB reduce NHS stress costs) You may also be concerned this would drive the current economy further into trouble (with shops being shut0 However surely this would drive online sales to increase?) An with retailers to be cleaver  increase these sales more week on week. As for companies who employ they would lose less than 3 days a month, which in ture is 34 working days  really. What is the cot for a healhy more forfilling life?",
