        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Those signing this petition believe that you should be able to hire a car if you have passed your driving test, with none of the age restrictions that currently exist. As many young drivers are priced out of buying a car through no fault of their own due to the ridiculous insurance costs, they have every right to be able to hire a car if they so wish. Some companies refuse to hire to under 25s and with some categories of car you even have to be 30. Is it likely that a 25 year-old who has 8 years' driving experience is more likely to crash than a 40 year old who has passed their test the day before? No. Therefore a law should be in place that car hire companies should not discriminate against age and should allow customers of any age, 17 or older, who have a full driving licence, to hire a car.",
