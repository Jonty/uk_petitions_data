        "background": "over the last twelve months i have as an owner of both a diesel and my partners petrol vehicle noticed to my dismay that fuel companies have been adjusting fuel prices by different amounts to the point thet what was a five pence per litre difference between unleaded and diesel is now at its current levels upto fifteen pence per litre difference which to me is done purely so that these companies can put forward saying they are cutting fuel costs when in reality they are just ofsetting one against the other and as diesel is unfortunately the most used fuel of transport companies this does nothing to help the current economic climate we all face today",
