            "background": "There should be one point of reference from beginning to end that helps lone parents to become someone in life\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a lone parent with four children. I have been unemployed most of my life due to early marriage and having a family.  However, I\u2019ve tried to regain some control in my life for myself and my children by re-entering education after about 18 years.  \n\nIt definitely wasn\u2019t easily, a matter of fact it was very difficult and rewarding at the same time; as I\u2019d achieved a lot in the past six years than I had over 30 years or so.  \n\nAt the moment, I\u2019ve published my first book, for which I\u2019m trying to gain publicity and awareness so far help I\u2019ve gained has been inadequate and insufficient by most individuals.  \n\nIt seems nothing can be done unless you have MONEY or FANTASTIC contacts\u2026\u2026.\n\nI\u2019m trying to make a difference for my children and me but it\u2019s just not happening perhaps I should do more than I\u2019m already doing\u2026..\n\nWho else feels like this\u2026..? Is it just me!!!!!!!!!!!",
