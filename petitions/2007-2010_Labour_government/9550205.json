            "background": "The CAA is currently consulting on the phased introduction of ModeS transponders across the UK\nAircraft fitted with ModeS transponders are capable of being seen by air traffic controllers on their radar displays and can provide data on location & height\nFew would argue with the value there is in using technology to allow increasing numbers of aircraft to operate safely\nThe real concerns are that the CAA\u2019s current proposals\nunreasonably and arbitrarily reduce the freedoms enjoyed by many air sports for no discernible safety or other operational benefit will force individual pilots and sporting clubs to spend significant amounts of money that they most cant afford\nThis is the 2nd consultation In 2006 the CAA received thousands of responses objecting to their initial plans\nThe proposals are less than those put forward in 2006 but still represent a major threat to the future of many and represent a totally disproportionate approach to an air safety issue that the CAA has not been able to prove\nMy purpose in writing to you is to raise your awareness of the issue and to seek your support in ensuring that the CAA follow a totally true and fair regulatory process.",
