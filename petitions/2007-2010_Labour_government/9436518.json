        "action": "Abolish university tuition fees for engineering and science degrees",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "People who are doing proper degrees which are going to benefit this country are being charged ridiculous amounts of money in tuition fees.  Students doing a three year engineering bachelors degree will be leaving university with a ridiculous \u00a39,000 of student loans just for tuition and \u00a318,000 with loans to cover there living expenses!  More needs to be done for these students who are making something of themselves unlike the students who are doing \u201ceasy degrees\u201d.  The government should not be discouraging people from going to university by charging excessive amounts of money in fees.  People doing engineering or physics should not have to pay university tuition fees.",
