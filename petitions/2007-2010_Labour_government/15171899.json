            "background": "New Immigration rules contradict the very fabric that Britain holds dear to it, diversity and equality. This petition is to convince the British government to ease immigration control with its common wealth countries or states, namely countries like South Africa, who's migrants contribute positively to Britain's economy, by supplying a semi skilled to skilled work force. Immigration controls regarding the middle east, and eastern European countries allow unskilled work force into the country to claim benefits, yet the skilled work force from common wealth countries are being rejected residence or entry, thus not protecting the values of equality within Britain and its common wealth states. Those in favour of the right of equality, and the revision of the immigration rules regarding common wealth countries as above named, please sign this petition.",
