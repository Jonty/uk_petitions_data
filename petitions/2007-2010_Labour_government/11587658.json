            "background": "As a result of a television documentary the Kennel Club has responded by victimizing the Bulldog by dramatically changing the breed standards to which Bulldog breeders adhere to. \n\nThis dramatic change is an experiment at the expense of the poor Bulldog. Never before has a breed been subjected to such a dramatic and fast change and we have absolutely NO idea what impact these alterations will have. For example with a very reduced skull size and very reduced chest and brisket, what will happen to the internal organs, and do we assume that the brain will reduce in size to accommodate a smaller skull? \n\nThe answer to these and hundreds of other questions is simply unknown because it IS an experiment on a finite gene pool which has never been carried out before.\n\nThis is not sensible, nor is it well considered, and in fact is a dramatic over reaction to criticism of the Kennel Club by a television programme. \n\nThe Kennel Club has not considered the welfare of the Bulldog, please help us to stop these changes and save our iconic breed.",
