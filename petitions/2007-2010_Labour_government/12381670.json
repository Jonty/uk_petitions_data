However, as the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies recently, significantly raising taxes on top earners in this way will bring in 'approximately nothing', as the most prosperous are forced to look elsewhere for more reasonable tax r\u00e9gimes.  Tempting though it may be to make others cover the costs of recovery, alienating a very productive section of society will only damage Britain's reputation as a global centre for business and wealth creation, with no benefit for the ordinary citizen.  The Prime Minister and his Chancellor must look for more effective, and equitable, means to cover their borrowing frenzy.",
