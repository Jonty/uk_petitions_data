Immigrants, not the British, MUST adapt. Multi-cultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. The UK will accept different beliefs, and will not question why as long as ours are accepted. Immigrants ask to be here, they should accept and live our way of life. Our culture has taken centuries to cultivate through struggles, wars and victories by millions of people, as have other cultures. Our culture should not be seen to offend as acceptance is key. A call for a review of immigration policies is requested to include the pledge of acceptance to British citizenship.",
