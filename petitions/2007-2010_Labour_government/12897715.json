            "background": "This man is being held inhumanely considering his age, state of health and that his detention in relation to the crime and time already served is not proportionate with modern day \"british standards\" ie a person convicted of a more serious crime today for various political reasons would receive a penalty dramatically reduced compared to when he was sentenced. It is inhumane and I believe against his human rights. There is no consistency with the early release given nowadays to far more dangerous and serious offenders. This is wholly in just.",
