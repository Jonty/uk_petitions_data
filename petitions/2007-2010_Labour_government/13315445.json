The museum has been based in Preston since it was opened in 2001 thanks to a multi-million pound lottery grant. Deepdale was chosen as home to the museum as it is one of the most deprived areas in the region. So far the museum has attracted hundreds of thousands of people through its doors, meeting all visitor targets.",
