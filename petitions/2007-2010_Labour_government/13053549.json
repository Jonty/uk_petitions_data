            "background": "The freedom to roam, or everyman's right is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land for recreation and exercise. While a Swedish style \"Allmansr\u00e4tten\" may not be practical here in the UK there is no public wilderness where wild camping is allowed, let alone camp fires. The argument of damage to the countryside by wild camping holds little weight when much of our natural wilderness has been handed over to honeypot style tourism and/or agricultural and forestry purposes.\n I ask the Prime Minister to add extend the CRoW act to include areas where wild camping and campfires can be practiced on a \u201cDo not disturb, do not destroy\u201d basis and that some of these sites be within our National Park boundaries. This is important for recreational purposes and to keep in touch with the methods practiced by our ancestors which minimise harm to the natural world.",
