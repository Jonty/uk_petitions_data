            "background": "The Humber bridge board have constantly failed in their charge of the bridge running.  They have let the cost of the bridge spiral out of control over 200 million pouunds just in interest over 18 year period. This cost continues to rise, and without help from the government would now be too high to imagine.  This continual miss handling has led to lack of any serious investment in the area's surrounding the bridge.  Also people have had cease their carreer or study.",
