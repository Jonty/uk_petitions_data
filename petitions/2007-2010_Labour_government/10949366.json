            "background": "Suspending VAT on all 'planning permission' required home extensions would accomplish a number of positive benefits at this time of economic turmoil. It would stimulate the building trade industry and continue to provide employment for thousands of construction workers. It would facilitate a 'greener' alternative by expanding the use of existing properties without the need to build on open land. It would bring the VAT rules into equilibrium with zero VAT on new home construction costs. It would provide affordable alternatives to purchasing another home, for example, buy bringing down the costs for loft conversions.",
