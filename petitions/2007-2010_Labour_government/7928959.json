The resale value of the second hand goods is normally so very low and the loss is disastrous for the debtor. We must wake up and stop acting in this criminally backward and uncivilised manner, and stop bailiffs entering debtors homes. It is so easy, in this modern world, to deduct money from bank accounts and benefits.",
