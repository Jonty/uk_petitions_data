This concession is frequently abused by non-disabled drivers by (among other things) the use of someone else's badge.\n\nIf the badge were required to display a passport-type photo-id of the entitled driver, this anti-social, selfish and inconsiderate behaviour might be reduced; it would certainly be more easily monitored and, where necessary, result in prosecution.",
