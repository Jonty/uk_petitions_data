Time to put the 'crass' back into democracy!\n\nThis is a petition to solve a national scandal:\n\n\nTHE ISSUE\n\nHBOS and RBOS failed.\n\nThe nation now owns a majority shareholding in these companies. \n\nThose responsible for cataclysmic failure have been rewarded with huge annual pensions.\n\nThere is no way of recouping these pensions without breaching contracts and thus undermining the rule of law. \n\nIt's unjust and immoral but there is nothing that can be done.\n \nOr maybe there is...\n\n\nA JOYOUS SOLUTION\n\nThe Government declares a New Bank Holiday: \"The National Fat Cat Day\".\n\nYes, one day a year when Sir Fred and his ilk come to Wembley Stadium to collect their pension entitlements in cash and we, the Great British Public, have a day off to vent our spleens and shower them in rotten eggs. \n\n\n\nTHE PETITION\n\nIf you are in favour, place your name below mine and send it on:\n\n1.
