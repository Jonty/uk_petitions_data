            "background": "The UK produces over 30 million tonnes per year of household garbage. Nearly 80% of this is landfilled, where it produces greenhouse gases, nauseous odours and lets vermin proliferate. If this were incinerated, the heat produced could be used to provide about 9% of the nation's electricity consumption.\n\nA bag with 10 kg of garbage has the same energy in it as 3 litres of fuel oil. This incineration can be done with quasi-zero pollution.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Much reduced greenhouse gas emissions\n\n* Virtually no pollution\n\n* Recovery of precious and semi-precious metals\n\n* Landfill volume reduced to ~10 per cent\n\n* No landfill pests or emissions\n\n* Can recycle paper/plastics into energy where direct recycling is impractical\n\n* Energy available as electricity and heat\n\n* Energy efficiency typically about 50 per cent\n\n* Flexible, according to the type of available waste\n\n* Can be adapted for large cities with economy of scale\n\n* Very cost-effective\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Relatively high capital cost\n\n* Requires waste to be partially pre-sorted for recycling\n\n* Less suitable for sparsely populated rural areas\n\nSuch plant already exists in a few places but more is urgently needed",
