        "background": "Situated in the historic Stourbridge Glass Quarter, Broadfield House Glass Museum has a magnificent collection of British glass, much of it made locally, dating from the 17th century up to the present day. \n\nCouncil chiefs revealed last week (mid Jan 09) they are considering closing Broadfield House as part of plans to shave \u00a3120,000 off next year\u2019s museums bill. A proposed move to the Redhouse cone should not be considered as the premises are only on lease from Waterfood Wedgewood, and the size of the collection at Broadfield House would appear to more than exceed the capacity at the Redhouse Cone.\n\nBroadfield House is the only dedicated glass museum in the UK of international repute and ranked in the top five nationwide.",
