Now in a time of crisis inside Zimbabwe when alot of Zimbabweans are crying out to us as a nation to intervene and remove Mugabe from power the Prime Minister is only using words. Mugabe has been in power for 28 years and will not act when confronted by words. The governemnt owes the Zimbaweans a proper democracy after giving the Iraqi's one. This could be a debt repayed to the Zimbabweans after the Britsih colonisation.",
