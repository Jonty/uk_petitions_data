        "background": "We the undersigned wish to ask the government, under the Prime Minister, to \ncarry out a review into the laws against incitement to hatred.  We have laws \nprotecting people on the grounds of religion, race, colour and sexual \norientation, but as yet there is nothing to protect individuals outside of \nthese parameters.  We wish to seek redress, and see that no individual \nshould suffer from websites set up to incite hatred against them.  An \nexample is the late Jade Goody, who was vilified on the internet till her \ndying day.  Other example are the sports commentator Jane Tomlinson, and the \nparents of abducted Madeleine McCann.  Even an eleven year old girl \nsuffering from leukemia, who was keeping her own little blog about her daily \nlife, all these people have suffered from having websites set up to incite \nhatred against them.  We feel the law needs to be tightened, and websites \nsuch as these should be banned, and membership of such sites made illegal \nforthwith.",
