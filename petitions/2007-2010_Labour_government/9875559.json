        "background": "National Service should be brought into force for any person under the age of 21 who is caught breaking the law - i.e. drunk and disorderly, knife crime, gun crime, drugs offenses. The length of time served should be relevant to the crime committed. This will instill a value upon the civil liberties they currently enjoy without imposing a criminal conviction and sentence.",
