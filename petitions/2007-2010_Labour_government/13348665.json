A Subject Access report details any and all contact the subject has had with the police and should only be for the eyes of the subject. As the Criminal Records Bureau(CRB) are not providing subjects with a full service tax payers are having to support people that have no convictions.\n\nPlease read below.\n\n\"The current procedure whereby companies require individuals to exercise their rights under Subject Access provisions at section 7 of the Data Protection Act 1998, as a form of vetting, has been considered to be unlawful for many years and is against the spirit of the legislation. When Section 56 of the Act is implemented, it will become a criminal offence for the employer to ask individuals, as a condition of employment, to go through this process.\" Source: the Metropolitan Police website.\n\nThe present situation permits employers to make requests that were a decade ago deemed illegal.",
