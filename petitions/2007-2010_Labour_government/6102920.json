No.\nSeperate us from non smokers as we don't want to inflict harm on anyone who chooses not to smoke-or listen to non smokers whining.But admit smokers are millions strong and always will be and that we pump major cash into the countrys coffers which will be snatched from elsewhere should we all give up.",
