            "background": "Food and liquid beverage companies in the UK must be, by law, made to place warning labels on produce containing sugar, warning of the dangers to health created by sugar. Refined sugar is treated as a toxic substance by the body and therefore can and often does cause the immune system to be compromised, as well as having a negative effect on blood sugar. This in turn intensifies a plethora of medical conditions, if not directly causing illness and disease. Sugar can and does, seriously damage your health and I'd argue, is as addictive as smoking, and as hard to stop consuming. Too much sugar is a severe health hazard and it's irresponsible of any government not to warn the general public and consumers of it's dangers.",
