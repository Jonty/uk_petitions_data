        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I am starting this petition to help the people of Derby with a serious issue, which could potentially cost lives. Derbyshire Fire Authority proposes to remove one fire engine and 24 firefighters from Ascot Drive fire station. There are currently two fire engines and 52 firefighters at the station. If this proposal is enacted it would cut availability in that area of derby by half this would have a huge knock on effect for the entire city.\n\nThis proposal is the result of two reviews, Future location of Special Appliances and Day Staffing Review. Now Derbyshire Fire authority on advice from the Chief Fire Officer proposes to send the crews from Ascot Drive Fire Station to Swadlincote Fire Station. This will lead to a reduction of 25% in front line firefighting appliances within the City of Derby. \n\nThe Firefighters themselves firmly believe that this reduction in fire cover could seriously compromise the safety of the public in Derby. The firefighters have yet to be shown any evidence that a reduction in cover is in the best interest of anyone and would like the Fire Authority to be more open in the reasoning behind such a decision.",
