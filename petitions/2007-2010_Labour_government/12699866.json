Your MP plays to two oligarchs, their constituents and the party whip. Once elected the party whip has the upper hand. We elect MP's to vote and represent our views in parliament. In order to do this MP's need to be free to vote according to the wishes, requirements and benefits of their constituents. Instead they vote in line with their party through the party whip system in order to protect their own and their parties position. Abolish the whip system and allow our MP's to represent us.",
