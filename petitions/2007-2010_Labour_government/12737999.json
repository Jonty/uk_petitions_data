            "background": "They were the greatest cereals ever known. If you ask the streets of Britain today you will find millions of people miss them. Is it a coincedence that since Golden Grahams disappeared from the British shelves the UK has come under increasing problems? One instance of this phenomenon is such - Knife crime is up as the youth of Britain aren't eating breakfast. As the obvious choice of the 'pop culture' generation, the removal of Golden Grahams has impacted to a detrimental effect upon the under 20's of the UK. No-one of this age is interested in Weetabix, Cornflakes or such bland breakfast cereals, as nutritious as they are. Bringing Golden Grahams back will help in this respect and help your policy in this area of British life.",
