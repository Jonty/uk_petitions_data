        "background": "Financial institutions reward top executives with bonuses far in excess of any bonus paid to their rank and file employees.  The events of the past year have shown that these financial rewards do not create stable institutions but instead reward high risk ventures which destabilise the economy.  The financial bonus system should be revised so that the bonus paid to top executives cannot exceed a stated amount.",
