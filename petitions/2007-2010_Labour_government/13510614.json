            "background": "If it is true that many accidents are caused by younger drivers then why not raise the driving age to 21!\nIt should reduce accidents, insurance costs for other drivers, congestion, it could also reduce the very annoying and dangerous practice of street racing in town centres on weekend nights.\nBy 21 many young people have become sufficiently mature to take their driving responsibilty more seriously.\nHow much longer do we have to see the sad ritual of placing flowers on our  road sides, on trees and tied to fencing where young drivers and their passengers have died?\nI don't believe the monies raised in taxation from fuel and insurance taxes and Road Fund Licence is worth the loss of our young people!\nPublic Transport should also be more used which could increase the useage of dwindling country bus routes and also encouage our young people to be healthier by encouraging cycling, walking etc.",
