            "background": "TFL/Ken Livingstone have today announced a \u00a325 per day band for the congestion charge. The \u00a325 charge will apply to vehicles emitting more than 225 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/k), as well as those registered before March 2001 which have engines larger than 3,000cc\n\nThere are obviously well intentioned reasons for this, but like various other car legislation it is too emcompassing and indiscrimative including large amounts of Londoners who can ill afford another \u00a325 per day! As a quick estimate - this could cost some people up to \u00a36000 a year on top of road tax, and fuel duty that they already pay!",
