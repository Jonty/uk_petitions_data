            "background": "My mother and many residents that live near to her have lived in a total nightmare situation since the smoking ban came into force.  The street drinking, noise level, etc. has forced her from her home which is now unsellable. The Council took over 2 years to take the licensed premises to court and it is still ongoing.  My mother's health deteriorated, stressm damaged ears and I even wrote to many councillors and MPs saying that I thought she was going to die because of it.  The Council have never apologised or compensated her.  She has been financially ruined by street drinking and her life turned upside down. At least if they bought her \"HOME\", she could buy another home not a caravan.",
