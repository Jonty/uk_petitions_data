        "background": "The British government should make Israel pay 2 billion dollars towards the reconstruction of Gaza, within six months. This is because Israel caused this damage in the first place and used excessive force, as verified by the UN. They caused similar infra structure damage in Lebanon two years ago and got away without worrying about the rebuilding costs.\nUnless, the state of Israel is made to pay 2 billion dollars, they will never realise their mistakes. Israel will then attack another country in a similar fashion and will then expect the rest of the world to pick the tab, yes? And this must STOP now!",
