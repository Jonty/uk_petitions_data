            "background": "I wish this government which has previously been the big supporter of the working man to come forward and address the poor state of trade apprenticeships in this country.\n\nAll we hear on the news that there are no engineers left and they are running out and that,  one major concern is that the apprentices that are around now have bad learning/teaching method given to them, they are not given support or good teaching.  They are used as cheap labour for a few years then thrown away.\n\nThe thing to do is go back to the archives of 1950-70s and see how apprenticeships were run and re-introduce the industrial training board to bring up the standard of exellence of engineering on which this country was built.\n\nBritian used to be known as the capitol of engineering now we are a joke, the number of people i know that have done apprenticeships and do not know what to do is appawling",
