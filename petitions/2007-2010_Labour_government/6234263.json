At that time it was too expensive to get a gun, but now, we as citizens should be able to buy a gun at a local store (including cooloff period). Why shouldn't we have access to the same weaponry as the soldiers have in the gulf?\nMaybe it is because the government is scared, as they have made a mint out of us? Maybe they are scared of retaliation?",
