Michael James Thompson was killed whilst in cyprus. the proffesionlism of the army really shon through in providing support. and as a great british public it is our responsibility to honour the service men and women who put there lives to fight for our defence and our freedom. i propose we show our respect to each member of the services returning to great britian. thank you for your support\nLewis Michael Thomspon",
