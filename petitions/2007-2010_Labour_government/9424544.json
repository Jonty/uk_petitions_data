            "background": "There has been an increase in the number of high profile cases where the victims of crime are not being served with the justice deserved. Further, sentencing laws need to be reviewed. Someone who gets a 10 year jail term should NOT automatically be given release on license after serving half their sentence - 10 years for some of the most horrendous crimes, in the knowledge that in 5 years release is probable, is a joke. Allowing people on curfew to take foreign holiday's - how is this fair?\nOur judicial system is a joke and needs review.",
