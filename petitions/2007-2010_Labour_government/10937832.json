            "background": "In this country there are are companies which sell goods and services at a reduced child rate. Good as these reduced rates may be, they are not available to all children, as many companies terminate these child rates at ages 10, 11, 12, 13 14, 15, 16 and 17. The UK Government sees all under 18's as children, therefore all under 18's should be entitled to pay child rates where available. I would like to ask the prime   minister to bring forward new legislation to force all companies that offer child rates to offer them to all under 18s or risk being fined.",
