Richard Dawkins is planning a Campaign which says \"There properly is no God so stop worrying and enjoy life\" This slogan has the potential of people throwing away any moral conscience. It also has the potential if allowed to alienate a large percentage of Christian voters through out the Land. I do believe in freedom of speech and the freedom for people to have the own view on God. But, if this slogan said there is no Allah or Buda is dead or some other deity did not exist there would be a riot on the streets. But because Christians would rather peaceably stand against this attack it seems to go unnoticed. Please do not allow this attack on the Roots of Christian Faith. Our Queen to is Protestant and this attacks her faith to.",
