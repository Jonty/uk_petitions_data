            "background": "Scratch proof lenses costs about \u00a310-25 per pair of glasses you order. Regardless of the material that the lenses are made of, scratches can be made fairly easily without the anti-scratch coating. Thus, this makes a paid of glasses useless. Opticians should make all of their lenses with the basic form of scratch proof coating. I have an eye condition (which the NHS don't give discount see petitions.pm.gov.uk/keratoconusfree) and that means my prescription changes three times a year. This means I have to pay an extra \u00a345-60 a time to get my 2 pairs of glasses and 1 pair of sunglasses (condition makes my eye very photo sensitive). Getting glasses is expensive in the first place. Any help to reduce the cost will benefit all glasses wearers",
