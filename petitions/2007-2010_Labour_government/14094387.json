        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Northern rail service is currently extremely poor. Most services are very infrequent: even many urban commuter services only see an hourly service or less, making it unattractive to many potential users, and many stations lack Sunday services at all; they use some of the country's oldest rolling stock, and two-car pacer trains which were designed for use on quiet rural branch lines are instead used on busy urban services; Cancellations and delays are frequent. \n\nI believe that were this standard of service being operated anywhere near London then it would have been stopped a long time ago, with their new trains and frequent services.",
