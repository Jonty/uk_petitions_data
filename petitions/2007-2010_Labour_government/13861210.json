            "background": "Sir,\n\nwe feel, in the current economic environment and under the cloud of their expenses scandal, that we, the British taxpayer, should be getting better value for money out of our MPs during their extended (and state funded) recessess.\n\nWe suggest that each MP should volunteer their services to either a British based charity or to volunteer in a support role for the British Army in one of the far flung wars they support so energetically from their seats in the House.\n\nThis period would be for 3 weeks per annum in the UK or 1 week if \"posted\" abroad in a war zone.\n\nWe feel that not only would this help to heal the mistrust we hold the Parliamentary system in but it would also help our MPs connect with the electorate for the common good.",
