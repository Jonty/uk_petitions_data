It is against the law for the Tate to prchase a work done by one of the trustees, but a few years ago the Tate paid \u00a3650,000 for a painting done by one of the trustees.\nIt is quite obvious that junk masquerading as art offers the most convenient opportunity for laundering money ever imagined.\n If the government is seriously concerned about illegal drugs this should be stopped at once.",
