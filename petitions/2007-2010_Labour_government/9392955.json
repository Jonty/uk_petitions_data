            "background": "Our fellow citizen James Rawson is very unwell. We must pool together and give each other strength and hope in face of adversity. James needs the public support of the Prime Minister and his government to overcome this difficult situation. Its almost certain that he couldn't vote this week and has thus been failed by democracy.\n\nIt is hereby proposed that James is considered for separate funding upon the advice of a suitably qualified doctor or vetinarian in order to aid his recovery. At the very least, the Prime Minister or the Secretary of State for Health should offer their public sympathy and support during this difficult time.",
