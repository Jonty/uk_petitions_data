            "background": "the attitude of councils is one of intimidation and bullying. i dont know how others feel but i for one am sick of it. they behave in a omnipitant manner,we have never missed a council tax payment, i admit to paying a week or two late, we pay when i get payed, as with most working families payin on time is not always possible. we recieved a letter from my council tellin us that we could no longer pay monthly, but we had to pay in full, otherwise court proceedings would ensue. we explained the reason we were a couple of weeks late was cause we were on holiday our first in years, we were going to pay on our first day back.we were still in the month the payment was due. this did not matter, i was subjected to indifference, i felt as if i were a criminal. we payed that months instalment now we have  a letter sayin we can pay monthly again, but if we are in anyway late, no notification they will send in their agents to retrieve their money.. it beggers belief, how the council can treat people and when you try to complain you are subjected to what one can only describe as bullying and intimidation by people who are at the end of the day work for us the tax payer.",
