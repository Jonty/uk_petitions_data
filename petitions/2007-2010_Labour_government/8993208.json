            "background": "The long hours working culture in the UK is a major cause of stress, anxiety and misery. The government should recognise that its primary duty is to provide for the wellbeing of the people, not to swell the economy at any cost. \n\nThe current tax credit system is intended to keep people at work as much as possible. It should be rearranged to give support for everybody, including those who wish to increase their leisure time, spend more time with families and friends and pursue activities of their choosing. \n\nThere should be a corresponding end to rhetoric about \"hard working families\" to emphasise that there is more to life than work.\n\nThe only loser would be the ugly culture of materialism.",
