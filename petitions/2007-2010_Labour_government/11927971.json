        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With the current economic crisis, we need quick action to get money back into the economy. \n\nBy eliminating student debt, in the short run we would put real income back into the hands of individuals very much inclined to be spenders in the economy - graduates. In the long run, the housing market would likely benefit, with a large section of first time buyers more able to afford property than they are currently. \n\nBoth of these would have a significant multiplier effect, and would promote economic recovery and job creation further down the road. \n\nThis needn't even be free-standing, but as part of a cogent and targeted stimulus package designed to kick-start the economy and benefit the country as a whole. \n\nFinally this lends credence to the rhetoric of all parties that education is a social good, and should be both promoted and rewarded where possible; graduates will play a large role in the future of our economy, and this should be seen as a valuable investment in that future.",
