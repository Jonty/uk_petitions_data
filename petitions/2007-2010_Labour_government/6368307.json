How can a typist working for the MOD claim 1/2 million pounds on a minor thumb injury when a para who has done his duty for this country only get \u00a3125,000 after losing his legs to a land mine & care which he will need for the rest of his life.  The was also an article regarding near misses not covered by PAX surely this is what PAX was set up for to cover all service personnel who receive injuries including those deemed superficial.   We need to treat our armed forces personnel better, Has this country not learned anything regarding issues in relation to service personnel.",
