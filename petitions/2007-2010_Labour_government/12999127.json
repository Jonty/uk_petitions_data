            "background": "Currently the focus of the education system is on what the teacher can do to educate. This ignores the simple fact that a child needs to be motivated to learn. \nMy solution: Motivate the children using peer pressure. If they fail more than a third of their subjects, they fail the year and have to watch their alleged peers go forward into the next year while they stay behind to redo the entire year including the subjects that they passed. in order to pass they actuially have to listen and work t school instead of just harassing the teacher until the bell rings.",
