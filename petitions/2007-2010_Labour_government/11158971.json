        "background": "Stop discrimination against young drivers and educate those who have passed their tests a long time ago.\nEveryone who currently holds a licence would keep their licences but these licences would automatically assume the lowest grading. In order to improve their gradings a driving test would require to be taken and their driving test scoring would indicate their NEW grading of licence. NOBODY LOSES THEIR CURRENT LICENCE. The new system would be used to decide on insurance costs, possible liability in accidents and could also be used for consideration in prosecution for driving offences (mitigation scoring only). The plus side of all this is that people would be ENCOURAGED to improve their driving through the many benefits they would receive in return.\nThe current driving test would qualify the holder for the lowest grade licence. Tests would advance on a scale to reflect the candidates skill levels.",
