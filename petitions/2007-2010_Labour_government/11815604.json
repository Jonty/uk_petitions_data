            "background": "Change firearm lisencing policy to same as shotgun lisencing.\n\nEXPLANATION;\n\nShotgun certificates are not to hard to obtain and I enjoy being able to own what shotguns I want for what use I want, and I believe all shooters deservre the right to what firearms (rifles and large cap shotguns) they want, this means not having to pay a \u00a326 variation fee for new firearms, no need to consult a firearms officer, and basically not go through the hell of applying for a certificate again. Also I believe handguns and automatic guns restored in our system.\n\nI believe the shotgun certificate lisenceing is adequate and suits me not too bad, but firearms, no way,\n\nIs our lisencing system saying british people should not be trusted and free to use their guns and generate money in the process of shooters desires?\n\nI think so. USA gun laws are great for shooters.",
