        "background": "The law on this matter is far to slow and too much in the favour of the tenant. I agree that law abiding tenants should be protected under the law but not at the unfair expence of the landlord. The landlord must be able to evict a tenant automatically if the tenant refuses to pay their rent. To wait 2 months before any action to be taken and then wait on the favour of the court is unfair. I am not alone in now having a tenant that has not paid me for 6 months and yet I still await the courts pleasure - Two months arrears must equal automatic / legal eviction.",
