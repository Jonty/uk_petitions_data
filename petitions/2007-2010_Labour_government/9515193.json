            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Manston Airport has so much to offer to kent that it simply must be expanded to help improve the current air transport situation in London. many of London's major airports are looking largely almost derelict in some areas and this would be a real boost to the local economy. there is already a train service in the area but this should definitely be expanded to provide quick links with the 5 major London aiports and other key centres throughout London ASAP. The Airport is near to London and Dover, the UK's largest port and this would definitley help to expand trade in Kent with the rest of the world. The airport is already extremely well equiped with 1 of the longest runways in Europe and is currently used by many cargo airlines as a cheaper, often better alternative to flying into the chaos that often surrounds London! This is why the expansion of the infrastructure at Manston Airport would be absolutely fantastic and provide a major boost to Kent's already large and diverse economy. Thanx for reading this and I hope you will sign this petition so someone really important can take a look at our situation!",
