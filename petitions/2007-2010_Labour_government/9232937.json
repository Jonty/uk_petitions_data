        "action": "make available an avian flu vaccine to poultry keepers",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present, poultry keepers in this country are not allowed to vaccinate their flocks even if they pay for the vaccine themselves. The government insists on culling even garden pets, small hobby flocks, purebred exhibition fowl and even other birds kept on the same premises like parrots and aviary birds.\nEvidence in south east Asian countries,has proved that vaccinating birds is extremely effective in reducing the numbers of infected birds.Why can other EU poultry keepers vaccinate their flocks such as Germany and France and we here in the UK cannot?. UK citizens are part of the EU too.There is already the availability of vaccine for large parrot collections and zoos, so why not the rest of us bird keepers. There should be one set of rules for everyone, not just a few.Contrary to what DEFRA insists, there is *no* scientific data to prove that vaccinated birds become carriers. If people are prepared to pay for the vaccine themselves, they should be allowed to use it to vaccinate and protect their birds.",
