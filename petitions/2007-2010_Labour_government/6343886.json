            "background": "This 'Reform Treaty' (which is the same Constitution that, under a different title, has been rejected by the EU once already) is a definite risk to the rights we as a nation hold dear, except Primeminister Gordon Brown does not seem to be of a similar persuasion. Oh no, he wants to gamble with our rights and he does so from our government's new home in Brussels! I don't know about anybody else, but my family and I are feeling more and more left out of the equation these days.\n\nSo I put to you, Primeminister, that you hold a referendum as soon as possible and disregard this 'Reform Treaty' because it is bad news for the people of Britain.\n\nKind regards,\nThe British Nation",
