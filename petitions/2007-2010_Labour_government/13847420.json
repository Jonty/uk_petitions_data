It is the act of a fool who thinks that he knows better than the experts.\n\nThis man appears to only want to see 'yes-men' spouting 'reefer madness' style reports, and woe betide anyone who speaks the facts!\n\nI have no particular experience in politics, but even I can see that this country does NOT need a waste of space like Johnson in such an important role, and he MUST be replaced with someone who won't pander to the gutter press for an extra few votes.\n\nIn the end, in this incessant chase for POWER POWER POWER, they only make themselves look terrible and, unless the Prime Minister takes action now, this is an issue that will be remembered in the polling station.",
