        "action": "amend tax legislation to give HMRC discretion to override tax legislation where to do so is necessary to act fairly towards a taxpayer",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "From time to time HMRC take cases before the courts or the Tax tribunal to seek to establish a liability to tax in circumstances where it is clearly unfair for a tax liability to arise. The courts have stated that HMRC have no discretion not to collect tax where the law prescribes that tax is due.  Accordingly they are under an obligation to collect tax whenever the letter of the law imposes it, however unfair it may be to do so in the circumstances of a particular taxpayer.\nMinisters consistently call for taxpayers to refrain from relying on the letter of the law where to do so would be unfair to other taxpayers. Fairness needs to work both ways. HMRC should be given power to themselves refrain from relying on the letter of the law where it would be unfair to do so.",
