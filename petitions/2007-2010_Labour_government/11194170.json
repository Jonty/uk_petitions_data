        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The thought that there is no reward or real incentive for true British family values (traditional as it sounds) - one earner in the family, the other partner bringing up the children, loving and caring for the future of their children and the wider contribution that stable family environment promotes. I therefore suggest that in these cases the earning adult's salary is divided by 2 and the current income tax bands/rates applied to these figures. In the case of a higher rate tax payer the potential would be to split into 2 standard rate tax incomes (granted up to a certain level) and therefore reduce the income tax paid. Both parents are \"working\" to better the economy.",
