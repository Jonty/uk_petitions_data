            "background": "In an age where we are being bombarded about how we are becoming obese I think it is a shame to charge people VAT, for attending gyms, swimming pools and other fitness establishments.  Each week I take my family swimming and I pay for my children to have swimming lessons.  I feel I am lucky and can afford this but for some it is very hard to pay, so surely no VAT would help to get more people doing sport.",
