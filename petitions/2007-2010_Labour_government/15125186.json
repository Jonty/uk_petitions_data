        "background": "My asthma is controlled by taking two different inhalers.  without them I could die.\n\nI currently spend \u00a3172 on two inhalers every year, I cannot afford to pay the upfront payment for the annual prescription charge so I pay for my inhalers when i need them.\n\nThe following conditions do not have to pay for their prescription:\n\n* A permanent fistula requiring an appliance or continuous surgical dressing.\n* A form of hypoadrenalism for which specific substitution therapy is needed.\n* Diabetes insipidus or other forms of hypopituitarism.\n* Diabetes mellitus, except where treatment is by diet alone.\n* Hypoparathyroidism.\n* Myasthenia gravis.\n* Myxoedema \n* Epilepsy requiring continuous anticonvulsive therapy.\n* Continuing physical disability which means the person can't go out without the help of another person. \n\nAsthma is not on this list.\n\nAsthma is a killer, it is becoming more common in the uk and I believe patients should be able to get their medication to help them breath without paying for it.  \n\nSmokers get free patches and gum, they choose to smoke, I didn't choose asthma.",
