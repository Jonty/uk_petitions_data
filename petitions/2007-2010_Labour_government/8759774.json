            "background": "It would pervert the notions of fatherhood, motherhood and family. A cybrid embryo is a clone of a person using an enucleated animal egg. Eg using my genetic material the clone would not be my progeny but the \u201coffspring\u201d of my parents and an animal. Being male I am XY: I inherited an X chromosome from my mum and Y from my dad. This pairing would be responsible for most of my clone\u2019s genetic makeup together with what it received from the animal\u2019s egg. Might not my parents object to a genetic \u201cson\u201d of theirs being a perversion of man, woman and beast? In my case one of my parents is deceased. Since there could be no consent on my father\u2019s side, this cloning would be a clinically-contrived species of rape, necrophilia and bestiality. \nMixing human gametes (ova, sperm) and animal gametes to produce hybrid embryos is a gross violation of what it means to be human. It is a species of bestiality which is absolutely forbidden by the Christian faith upon which this nation is founded",
