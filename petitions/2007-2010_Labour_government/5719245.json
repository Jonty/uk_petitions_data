        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This legislation, if approved, would have a number of 'safety valves' to ensure the well-being of those that might otherwise be induced to donate organs by virtue of pressure or manipulation. \n\nOnly holders of a British passport would be eligible to donate or receive organs. Donors would have to be of sufficient good health, and mental age, such that their decisions could be seen to be made independently. \n\nBenefits would be offered, in a variety of forms, to encourage people from a broad spectrum of society to donate. Be it tax benefits for the more well-off, or income support / a flat one-off fee for those less wealthy. \n\nThis is about saving lives, and for that reason the scope of the legislation does not extend to corpses. That would require further consultation.",
