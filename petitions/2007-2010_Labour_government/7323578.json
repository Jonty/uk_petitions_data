The petitioner is inviting the P.M. to respond with a British response -   \nThe Red Cross, the Global Health, Population, and Nutrition Group, signed the document and pledged that AED would continue its efforts to prepare communities for a possible pandemic. Can you please reassure me that similar work is being undertaken in the U.K. ? \nGive that Communint - the international health initiative is calling for greater awareness of the disease before the epidemic reaches pandemic levels,   the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to commission a professional writer to design a leaflet to distribute to the public. What does the rest of the nation think ?",
