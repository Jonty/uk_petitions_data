Fraudsters may apply for credit in the name of these victims, leading to their credit record being blighted.  If a victim does not apply for any credit in the next year then they may not realise that this has happened.  We would ask HMRC to provide a free credit report for every affected person both six months after the event (May 2008) and 12 months after the event (November 2008) so that anyone who has suffered fraud is alerted.",
