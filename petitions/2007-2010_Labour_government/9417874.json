The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to ensure the British constitution's purpose remains -to provide a parliamentary forum for free discussion, maintaining the equality stated in article 1.\n\nWe the undersigned urge the British govt to explain why one city has an assembly and another doesn't - if there are so many different assemblies assembled separately, then govt isn't an assmebly anymore, is it ?! Does devolvement always mean better representation and administration ?",
