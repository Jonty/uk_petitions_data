            "background": "My argument is that amphetamines and ecstasy are much more well known than mephedrone, which escapes the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nIf we ban mephedrone, someone will research the laws regarding what counts as an illegal drug and manufacture a new one and sell it. rogue chemists and pharmacologists are too smart to be bound by these rules now, so we will get a new wave of legal drugs, which are again in the words of Professor Les Iversen \"amphetamines by another name\".\nWhat I propose is the legalisation, regulation and taxation of either amphetamines or ecstasy, which would cause some public health concerns, however unresearched drugs could be worse, which could be a public health disaster.\nMy final proposal would be to allow retailers of drugs which remain legal to advertise those drugs as drugs and not as \"plant food\", however the consumer must be made aware that any harm that is caused by these drugs is entirely the fault of the consumer and not the retailer. This change can only happen with an amendment to the Medicines Act.",
