We the undersigned acknowledge the irony of using this site to make this point but would like members of the public with a valid point to make to be encouraged to take it up through more meaningful channels which might actually make a difference, and all the lame-brained trolling timewasters wanting people to sign their half-baked rallying calls to be denied further recourse to this outlet for their jejune frustrations.",
