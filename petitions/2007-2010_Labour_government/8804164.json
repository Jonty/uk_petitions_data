            "background": "First and foremost I'd like to say that \"Sat Nav\" is a great advancement in technology that on a whole should help to improve motoring in the UK, but the amount of people that slap a \"unit\" in the centre of their windscreens is quite frankly amazing and surely unsafe.  It's perfectly possible to dash mount (without damage) so the window option just seems a little bit lazy (the manufacturers don't help).\n\nIt's even worse when at night - they're lit up like xmas trees and surely impact on the drivers visibility of the road ahead (interestingly many models have dim functions but unfortunately the only thing that seems dim is the drivers that don't know how to change it).  Not meaning to offend people, I know the easy option is often the one we all take and we don't all read the manuals.  Window mounting is clearly not going to help you see the road ahead, and will be a distraction.\n\nI'm not anti sat nav.  It seems like common sense to me not to block the view out of the windscreen as there are other options.  This shouldn't really need legislation... but I can't see anyone changing to dash mount (not obscuring the windscreen) unless it's a \u00a360 fine and 3 points.",
