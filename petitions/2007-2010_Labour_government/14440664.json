        "background": "Following the recent cyber-attack on a number of US-companies that Google uncovered and which exploited the latest of a number of security holes in MS Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8, the French and the German government have reacted by warning their citizens not to use any version of MS Internet Explorer.\n\nThe exploit has now been published on the internet - so far Microsoft has failed to release a security patch.\n\nGiven the tremendous threat posed by hackers to UK citizens' computers, we urgently request that the UK government no longer ignore this issue but take a public stand to fulfil its duty of protecting its citizens.",
