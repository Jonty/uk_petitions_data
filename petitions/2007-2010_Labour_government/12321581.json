        "background": "Dear Gordon Brown, \nRather than throwing good money after bad, by bailing out irresponsible banks, I have a solution to fix the economy of Britain in a trice... \nIt's a scheme called 'Patriotic Retirement'.  Currently there are just under 8-million workers in the UK aged 50+.  Pay each the sum of \u00a31million subject to three conditions being met: \n1)  They leave their jobs.  8-million vacancies fixes the rise in unemployment. \n2)  They all buy new British made cars, 8-million cars ordered fixes the motor industry. \n3)  They all either buy a house or pay off their mortgage, 8-million house purchases fixes the housing market. \n\nDone!  Economy fixed!",
