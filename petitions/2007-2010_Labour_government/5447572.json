            "background": "Postgraduate medical training has been irrevocably damaged by MMC in a way that will significantly jeopardise patient care. MMC is a complete overhaul of a successful highly respected training system. A failure to engage senior medical staff in the UK has been apparent in implementing this process. Junior doctors are being forced into making misinformed decisions about their careers due to pressure to enter run-through training and aggravated by MTAS. MMC will create inflexible, fast-track and narrow specialty training leading to more junior, less experienced, less qualified consultants, having an adverse effect on patient care. MMC is not fit for purpose; it has the potential to devalue the calibre of British medical training compared to other international programmes. If you were the patient, who would you rather have treat you? An MMC \u201cspecialist\u201d or a consultant trained under internationally respected standards? We demand that: run-through training and MTAS are abandoned.",
