            "background": "Organised campaigns are attempting to undermine the HFE Bill. They are spreading misleading information, intended to create a sense of unease, or even fear, about the changes outlined in the Bill. This can be seen in the petitions on this site; some claims they make come close to being outright lies. \n\nThe Bill will allow scientists to continue important research into embryology, which will lead to insights into inherited diseases and human infertility, and may ultimately lead to new treatments for degenerative diseases. It brings the laws on assignment of legal parenthood in cases involving assisted reproduction into line with changes in our society; specifically it recognises that it is no longer acceptable to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nThe scare-mongering claims of these campaigns bear no resemblance to the reality of what is contained in the Bill. It deserves our support.",
