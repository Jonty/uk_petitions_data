            "background": "All UK cinemas have to pay huge sums of money for films they play to the performing rights society PRS who charge exhibitors annual costs based on admissions. The money is charged because Cinemas play music that is contained on the soundtrack, music that is already paid for by the film makers. The burden is huge on smaller independents who face in a few years the additional costs of updating the projection equipment to Digital or lose not getting the film altogether. The added burden of PRS each year does little to ease the burden and in many ways acts a stealth tax as not even the artistes can claim to receive this money. The government needs to review the work of the PRS and have a transparent form of charges that allow for smaller cinemas to have lighter charge bands",
