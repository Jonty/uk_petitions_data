            "background": "I am starting this petition to try & get the same financial benefits for the families of Stay at Home Mums who currently receive nothing from the Government,for doing this very important job.\n\nIt seems that the stay at home mums who have a husband or partner in employment are being penalised for this & this is not right.Many of us stay at home mums have worked & paid income tax for many years & the first few years of a childs life are special,so why is it that in wanting to stay at home & raise our children many of us face financial problems.\n\nThe government could allow the father to use the mother's tax free allowance as for 07/08 the personal allowance is \u00a35,225 which based on the tax rate of 22% would be a tax saving of \u00a31,150 for the father.\n\nAlternatively vouchers could be issued to get fresh fruit/vegetables & milk on a weekly basis.\n\nPlease sign this petition to try & create financial equality in the status of all Mums.",
