            "background": "Wednesbury Cricket Club(established 1875) is under threat from its neighbours who want to close it down due to cricket balls being hit into their gardens. The club has erected 50 foot fencing, has insurance in place and pays for all damage (which occurs infrequently). However the Neighbours still want us to stop playing and have petitioned the Local Council.\nIn the event that cricket was not allowed to take place on the site the effect on Wednesbury Sports Union and the Local Community would be calamitous. There are currently only four cricket clubs in Sandwell serving a population of 250,000.\nThe club delivers regular cricket coaching to seven Primary Schools and a Secondary School and also hosts school matches and festivals.",
