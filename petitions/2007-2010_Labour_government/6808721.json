            "background": "Sort out the law regarding parking on footpaths\nAs the law stands at the moment the council as to prove that the said footpath was in good repair prior to the vehicle parking on it and said vehicle did the damage. \nThis is almost impossible to prove so the local taxpayer picks up the bill \nThis is what I suggest you do\n\n1.That the car driver is required to give all there details to who ever request them on the spot\n\n2.If the offence is dealt with by the police the police are required to forward the drivers details to the local council so they can put forward a repair charge and or injury claims \n\n3.The council would then have 90 days to Carrie out the repairs from the date of receiving the payment from the driver or drivers insures \n\n4.The driver or drivers insures would be responsible for any injury claim from the damage from the day of the offence till the council carried out the repair \nThis would be as well as any other fine or punishment law says is required \nThis would release council funds of such repairs and claims for more effective use with in the council area",
