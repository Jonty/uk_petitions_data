        "background": "As the direct result of mindless violence demonstrated by Rangers fans in Manchester on 14th May, Manchester City Council have taken the decision to withdraw all broadcasts of the Champions League Final on 'big screens'.\nThis decision should be reversed for several reasons:\n1) It is an ill-considered over-reaction to the extraordinary circumstances of the UEFA Cup Final.\n2) United fans will gather in Manchester City Centre regardless, and will be forced into licensed premises screening the game, creating larger numbers of flashpoints as fans collide and bar service is overwhelmed.\n3) Availability of alcohol can be controlled. Restrict the sale of alcohol until 1900 on the day of the game.\n4) Technical issues can be eliminated by vigorous testing of all screens, with back-up contingency plans.\n5) United fans will not riot in Manchester City Centre, nor will they attack technicians attempting to resolve problems.\nWe, the undersigned, ask that Manchester City Council be directed to reconsider their hasty decision and  allow 'big screen' broadcasts of the game. This is a special event for Manchester United fans and the city of Manchester. It should be embraced.",
