            "background": "Bristol City Council is planning to create a Residents Parking Scheme which means residents will need a permit to park in their designated zone.\n\nA permit for 1 car will be \u00a340 rising to \u00a380 for a 2nd car & \u00a3500 for a 3rd.\n\nWhilst most people would not object to a \u00a340 charge to park outside their own home, and be guaranteed a parking space, sadly this is not the case.\n\nThe Council will be able to issue as many permits as they choose in each zone creating a worse problem than now. \n\nYou will only be allowed to park in your designated zone - if can't find a space there is no contingency for alternative parking - if you park in another zone you risk getting your car towed away.\n\nEach house which is divided in to sub-lets (flats/apartments/bedsits) will count as seperate residences - this will mean more cars than spaces.\n\nResidents will have to buy Visitors Permits at \u00a31 each limited to 100 permits per ordinary permit.  If you are having building work on your house or you have a carer visit they will need a permit.\n\nThere will be no vote on this scheme and the consultation papers are worded so that all answers lead to a favourable reponse to the Council.\n\nThe scheme is planned to start in October 2009.",
