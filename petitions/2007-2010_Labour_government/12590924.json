            "background": "The British education system was once the envy of the world. However now with the increasing bad behaviour, and breakdown in the social order, many of our schools resemble the Vietnam jungles, rather than institutes of excellence. Therefore we strongly believe that capital punishment must be brought into schools to deal with this menace. Age should not be a factor, so we support this deterrent being used in all levels of education, from toddlers at playgroup, to adults on university and vocational courses.\n\nThe Bible states in Proverbs 13-24 \"Spare the rod and spoil the child\". As a God fearing country we should take this to its natural conclusion and beat these miscreants to death. Amen",
