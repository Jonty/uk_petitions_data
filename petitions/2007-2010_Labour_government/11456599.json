            "background": "Ummah Welfare Trust is a leading UK registered International Relief and Development charity operating in over twenty five countries. The decision will affect millions of people who rely on the trust\u2019s projects, especially Palestinians at this critical time. The trust has been at the forefront of responding to disasters and targeting charities in this manner seems to be a conceited attempt to stop the good work in politically-sensitive regions by leading British Muslim charities. Ummah Welfare Trust and supporters of Ummah Welfare Trust have requested Barclays Bank to provide a reason for their decision, but an explanation has not been forthcoming.",
