            "background": "Currently students have to tax and NI on their loan payments, as the payment is calculated on gross income and taken from net (i.e. after tax and NI).\n\nThis should be changed so that the tax is actually paid to your loan rather than the government.\n\nThis small change that will allow most students to make progress on their loans as at the current moment very few do.  As the tax payer has to pick up the bill when loan is not paid off in time. \n\nThere is very little or no cost to the tax payer or the government in making these changes but there is major benefits for the student.  This is also a benefit to the country as this will only make a difference to those who stay and work in this country, this can be considered as an incentive.",
