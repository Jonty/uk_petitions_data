            "background": "This is the second demonstration of his gross lack of good judgement he has given the voters this week.  McBroon is now at variance with both the EU over 'british jobs for british people' AND with one of his own appointed QUANGOs' who are paid to give advice to the government but which advice McBroon seems unable to be able to follow because it is not common sense.  This is no way to run a country and if the ACMD is not to be scrapped then McBroon needs to go to the country to get the opinion of the people paying for this rubbish to find out if they are prepared to continue to pay for it.",
