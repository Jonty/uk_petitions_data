            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A recent survey commissioned by the Havens in London revealed that 56% of people think the victim is partially to blame for being raped and that younger people are more likely to hold these attitudes, and also revealed that younger people are less likely to recognise rape when it happens inside a relationship.   In the light of these findings, it seems clear that sex education in Britain is failing to give our young people the emotional tools they need to understand sex and consent, and what rape means.   Therefore, sex education in Britain needs to be reassessed and revised so that it can teach young people a firm grounding on ownership of their own bodies and respect for others'.",
