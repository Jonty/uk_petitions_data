            "background": "The ICESCR is a UN treaty ratified by many states but implemented by few. It ensures that an individual's rights to a basic standard of subsistence, living, shelter, food, education, work and housing are provided by the government. Economic and Social rights are as morally sacred as civil and political rights which ensure, amongst others, one's right to liberty and life. Acknowledgement of the ICESCR will signal to all, that the state is obliged to ensure that an individual has a right to live a life with dignity. These rights require the state to take positive action in order that every person has the basic equality of material need. The ICESCR has been embraced by South Africa and, in particular, the Scandanavian States. The UK needs to shoulder its responsibilities and realise the incumbent moral duty. Everyone deserves basic corporeal equality and the state should seek to provide just that. Otherwise, the dignity of the individual can not be ensured. Please sign the petition to claim the human rights which society should provide.",
