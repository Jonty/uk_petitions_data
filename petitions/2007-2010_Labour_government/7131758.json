            "action": "take responsibility for the government\u2019s appointed rail contractors and make sure that the companies concerned are providing a service to people in North Kent.  This petition is particularly concerned about Southeastern Rail\u2019s timetable following the introduction of the Integrated Kent Franchise",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The timetable planned for 2009, when the Integrated Kent Franchise takes effect, looks to be completely inadequate for the needs of the North Kent community.  North Kent commuters will have higher costs for the main journey, the added cost of having to include tube travel on their ticket and longer journey times, due to the need to take the tube from St Pancras back to Cannon St and Victoria areas.  There has been no news of any potential improvements.  We will be writing to Southeastern Rail to request more information and more consideration, but in the meantime feel that the government, who appointed the contracts to the rail companies, should have considered the needs of the North Kent community, and should be putting pressure on Southeastern Rail to make sure our needs are catered for.  PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION",
