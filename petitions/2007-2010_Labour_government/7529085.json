They're people, just like us, who had the misfortune - which was totally out of their control - to be born into human-rights-abusing (or impoverished) countries; what would these virulently anti-asylum-seeker people do if THEY had been born in such a country? just stay there for the only life they'll ever have?  If they wouldn't why should they expect asylum-seekers/immigrants to?",
