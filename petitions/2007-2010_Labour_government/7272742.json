            "background": "In the last year it has become very evident that taskforce planning for medical posts has been very poorly managed. This is highlighted by the MTAS debacle and the calls for resignation of many prominent public figures in connection with this. It is also evident that although numbers of medical students has increased exponentially during this Governments tenure, the numbers of posts available to training doctors once they are qualified will not match this. It is evident also, that even through natural wastage, the number of students graduating will far exceed those needed to become doctors thus making medical careers in this country purely service based and therefore unattractive. The waste of taxpayers money in training those who will simply leave the country rather than have to deal with another MMC is disgraceful. We call on those in charge to have open discussion as to how taskforce planning for doctors for the NHS will continue in the future.",
