        "background": "Unlike our friends in America, the UK does not have a National Motivation Day. We all need motivating and having a day where we can all motivate ourselves and others is crucial. It will help build unity and inspire the future generation to achieve their full potential. One day alone will not do this, but this is a reminder of \n\n1st July which is right in the middle of the year, a time where we are half way from last year's resolution and a half way to the next year's resolution. Having a Motivation Day will give us a chance to reflect on what or who motivates and inspires us, work towards current and future goals. This will run throughout the workforce to schools to individuals. \n\nOn July 1st we will hold a conference where we will have a host of motivational speakers and life coachs speaking to attendees of the conference. We will have various workshops on the day. It will be an open conference for all to attend.",
