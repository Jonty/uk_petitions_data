        "background": "With the arrest of an opposition MP by counter-terrorism police officers, it is now clear to many of us that the Labour Government is trying to set itself up as an authoritarian dictatorship. The actions undertaken by this government are frighteningly reminiscent of those taken by Robert Mugabe and other dictators around the world, in stifling political opposition. \n\nEvery action this government has taken in the past decade has been to increase its own power. From the House of Lords Act, to the banning of personal protection weapons, to arresting and imprisoning suspects for months without charge. Now the government is arresting opposition MPs who reveal information the government would prefer kept secret. Not official secrets, just info embarrassing to the government. Using counter-terrorism legislation no less. \n\nThis sort of intimidating behaviour is clearly the precursor to the establishment of a socialist authoritarian dictatorship, with Brown the almighty leader, never to be questioned.\n\nResign, Prime Minister, and allow the British people to elect someone who can be trusted not to oppress our freedom. You are a disgrace to your office.",
