        "background": "Having worked in shops for near 5 years, I see so many places where energy is needlessly wasted. I am also an engineering student, and only now do I fully appreciate how much energy is being wasted across the UK by businesses simply not following good practice because they can get away with it. This could create new jobs as well as cut carbon emissions, as well as lower our energy requirements.",
