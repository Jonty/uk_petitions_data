Everyone involved with the whole case should be sacked too, it is disgusting a doctor could not find broken bones on a 17 month old baby! the social workers in their borough knew he was being abused and yet nothing was done!! as for Sharon Shoesmith what good has she done being The head of Haringey Council.\n\nThis needs to be sorted out! it is not a joke!! i know if it was your own children it would be a different story",
