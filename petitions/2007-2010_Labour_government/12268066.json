As part of this project, several local authorities are being given funding totalling approximately \u00a31m to develop software and web services to improve local information and service provision.\n\nWhile CLG's aim is that these projects are incorporated into a \"best practice toolkit\", we ask the government to reduce duplication of effort and expense and make this software available for other users at the earliest opportunity by releasing each package on deployment under an OSI-approved open source licence.\n\nThough we welcome these projects themselves, as citizens we cannot and do not support this substantial sum of public money being spent to create private, proprietary software.",
