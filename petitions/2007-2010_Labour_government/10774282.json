        "background": "Whilst Health & Safety legislation applies equally to both \"salaried\" staff and volunteers the same DOES NOT apply in relation to employee protection legislation. \nWhilst most charities may have disciplinary and grievance procedures in house, once these are exhausted the volunteer has no further recourse to \"appeal\" if they find themselves victims of unfair treatment. \nCharities DO NOT have to accept ACAS. \nVolunteers have NO recourse on such areas as \"unfair or constructive dismissal\".\n\nI call upon the government to amend all employee protection acts to encompass volunteer labour.\n\nVolunteering is the backbone of many community projects, volunteers deserve this recognition and the right to be treated in the same way as their paid colleagues.",
