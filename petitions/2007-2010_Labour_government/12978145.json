As their rates are far to high and there is practically no service with these companies.These companies build accommindation,run naffi's,messes,and do so called repairs,they have contract tailors,contract storemen,and run our waste mangagement.The more money the MOD give to these companies such as Serdexo. Gives the MOD less money to supply the soldiers for equiptment and ammunition for OPERATIONAL tours of duty. Lives maybe at risk!",
