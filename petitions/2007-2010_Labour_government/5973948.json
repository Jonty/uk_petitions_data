            "background": "With the residents of Gloucester, Cheltenham and Tewkesbury facing a period of 7-14 days without running water due to the flooding of the Severn Trent Water treatment works at The Mythe, Tewkesbury, Severn Trent announced that the flooding would not affect their stated profits of \u00a3300 million for this year.\n\nSevern Trent's contingency plans of a few hundred bowsers is failing and it is obvious that it can never work.\n\nCentral Networks (who are responsible for power distribution) seem to have no contingency plan at all.\n\nThis petition urges the Prime Minister to impose financial sanctions against utility companies who have neglected their infrastructure  and instead channelled money to their shareholders. \n\nIt also urges the Prime Minister to pass legislation forcing utility companies to put fully redundant systems in place so that single points of failure such as the Mythe plant or Walham do not exist",
