            "background": "The government must make it obligatory for all insurance companies to offer insurance to ex-offenders with unspent convictions on a case by case scenario.  Currently most insurers discriminate ex-offenders as a whole, which is unjust.  It discourages them from declaring their convictions, leading an honest/legal life,  and therefore increases the risk of possible re-offending.",
