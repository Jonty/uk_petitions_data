        "background": "Soldiers in the Armed Forces, (Airforce, Navy & Army) should have the same working conditions as Police & Firemen = NO Deaths or Injuries in their careers.  Due to keeping all appropriate safety measures in place at all times.  Such as, eg. In the current wars, collecting up all enemies supply of ammunition and armaments and preventing them from obtaining more from their suppliers. Also by confiscating all ingredients for making home made bombs eg. Fertilizers etc. and dangerous knives and machetes. Then the soldiers would only be worried about the enemy using up their current supply, until they ran out of ammunition. The soldiers would have to keep the area clear.  And keep their distance until that time.",
