The economic consequences of abolishing the ICT will be extremely grave for the UK economy, will weaken the UK's position as a major global business location and will inevitably lead to retaliatory action from our major trading partners.",

            "background": "The Government\u2019s  Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) is considering  restricting Tier 2 to shortage occupations only.  This would be detrimental to the UK economy since:\n\n1. International assignments are  fundamental to talent management within any global organisation. \n\n \n2. International assignees are not long term immigrants to the UK and are not a burden on the state.\n\n3. Any reduction in the number of intra-company transfers would have devastating consequences for many related industries including: rental and serviced accommodation, removals and shipping, relocation management, international schools and the like.\n\n\n4. Any reduction in in-bound assignees would inevitably lead to retaliatory action by other countries thus reducing opportunities for British workers\n\n\nThis petition is presented by the Forum for Expatriate Management and Totallyexpat News.",
