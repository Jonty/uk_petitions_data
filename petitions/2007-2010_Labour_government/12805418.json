            "background": "The government has announced it wishes to bring Broadband to every household in the UK. It wishes to help subsidise this by introducing a 50p per month tax on every landline in the UK. Why should I, as a broadband customer already paying \u00a325 per month pay even more to provide low speed broadband to areas where people may not even want it. Why should OAP's who need their landlines as an essential safety measure pay to subsidise broadband. Let the companies who stand to make the profits from this scheme pay for it.",
