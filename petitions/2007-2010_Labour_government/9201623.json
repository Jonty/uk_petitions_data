I would like to use 1 penny of every litre sold to be assigned to a development organization totally focusing all their efforts and using all resources available to find a cheaper / greener fuel than petrol / diesel. Can you imagine all these 1p's put together every day working with skilled technically minded people / inventors to find / invent a fuel that is clean and green saving the planet and non reliant on the earth's resources. 1 penny from each litre sold would contribute millions of pounds to help find an alternative solution. JUST SIGN UP PLEASE",
