            "background": "It is absurd and against the human rights of the English voters that Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MP's are allowed to vote on English legislation, but English MP's can't do the same on matters concerning those countries. \n\nEngland has already rejected efforts to break it up into regions such as the North East, and clearly wants certain powers devolved back to a sovereign English Parliament, similar to those now held by the Scottish parliament. \n\nIn order to resolve the Midlothian question, we request that the English are offered a referendum on an English only Parliament.",
