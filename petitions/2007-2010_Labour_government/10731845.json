            "background": "Our economy is suffering due to the previous imprudence of Bankers and their regulators and we need to find a way of reviving it before we slide into a dangerous recession. Infrastructure projects are a useful way for Government to stimulate a flagging economy, provided they deliver genuine benefit to the society. We have a need, in this country, for an improved telecommunications network as we are currently slipping behind our competitors in the world market as we cannot provide High Speed Networking to everyone. It would seem that this is an ideal opportunity to combine rescuing our Economy with  building a communications network that will ensure our future competitiveness. The Government should lead this project in conjunction with the companies involved such as BT and Virgin to name but two.",
