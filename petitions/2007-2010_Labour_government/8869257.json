            "background": "The British Beekeeping Association has requested \u00a38m for the government to fund 5 years research into Colony Collapse Disorder. The government has stated that no funds exist within the existing farming research budget. \n\nKept honey bees provide a significant percentage of pollination to food crops, fruit orchards and of course provide honey.\n\nColony Collapse Disorder is a disease which has affected hives in the US and has been reported in France, Germany and Italy. Its entry into the UK is most likely inevitable. \n\nThis fundamental research needs to be performed in order to protect the country bees before it arrives. As in almost all cases, being prepared for something reduces its impact for a fraction of the cost compared to being unprepared.\n\nCurrently only \u00a31.35m per annum is available to the National Bee Unit (part of Defra), this funds all its statutory activities as well as research.\nIf there is no money in the farm research budget, then money should be made available from contingency funds.",
