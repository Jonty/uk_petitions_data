            "background": "for a long time now parents have been campaigning because of the unjust and detremental way that the children and family services are going about removing innocent babies from innoncent parents without any reprecussions, \n\nin alot of the cases the babies will never be returned to their biological families, this is very upsetting for the children and families involved and it is forever not just 5 minutes of the day,\n\nthe children act of 2004 says that the children and family services are to work with all families to return the children/babies to their biological parents but this is routinely over looked by the so called professionals, \n\nalso it is in the human rights section 8 that states that the local authorities are not allowed to intervene in family life unless it is for national security but again this is over looked by everyone involved, \n\nwe request that the prime minister has a sharp hard look at the local authorities codes of practice and actually does allow a proper meaning to \" risk of emotional abuse\" instead of the family services making it up as they go along which is what happens at the moment.\n\nwith respect and thanks",
