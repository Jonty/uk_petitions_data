The convicted murderers, rapists, paedophiles, etc. can take their places. Afterall the non-human animals have commit no crimes against society to deserve such cruel and unusual punishment nor do they possess the correct corresponding physiologies to us humans that the research may or may not be in aid of. Instead of torturing innocent non-human animals before ultimately killing them once they have served their purpose to the men (and women) in white coats use the need for \"lab rats\" as the British equivalent to the North American \"Death Row\"!",
