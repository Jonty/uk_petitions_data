            "background": "Student housing normally contains twice as many people living in a house compared to a family home as the chances are the kitchen and bathrooms can be the only rooms not to have beds in and many students housing has either the loft and/or cellar converted into bedrooms as well. With double of the people in the house, the rubbish also doubles. Some student housing has 8 students living there with one bin per house. If the situation was with a family of 8, they would get either a larger bin or 2 wheelie bins, depending on the council. Bins are overflowing all of the time because of this. Councils have the info on where the student housing is.",
