        "background": "Civil servants deliver support and benefits to those that need them, throughout the United  Kingdom, whether as VOSA inspectors, checking that vehicles on our roads are roadworthy, Customs officers fighting drugs smugglers,  Scientists, ensuring that our food standards are maintained or any of a thousand different roles.  \n\nDespite this, they are treated with derision by Politicians and the media, accused of being 'feather-bedded' pen-pushers, lining their own pockets at the Taxpayers' expense.\nNothing could be farther from the truth;  Civil servants, themselves are taxpayers, often on very modest salaries. \nCivil Servants are doing the job from a sense of public duty. Public service is not about making profits; every penny in profit taken by privatised services is a penny 'lost' from the public purse and not going to provide essential services. The Private sector has its place but that place is not providing public services.",
