            "background": "Recent research has shown that most broadband users in the UK are confused about the limits their ISP places on the amount of data they can transfer.  ISPs are entirely to blame for this because they all advertise a maximum speed but either hide the usage limits in the fine print or refuse to declare them.  In many cases they also fail to provide any way for customers to find out how much of their ration remains.\n\nThe ISPs claim that without such limits they would have to increase prices.  This may well be true, but if consumers cannot compare the services on offer then ISPs will have no incentive to improve their offerings.  For instance, Virgin Media recently upgraded their \"Large\" package from 4Mb/s to 10Mb/s, but with only a small increase in the daily download limit.  Therefore this petition asks that ISPs be required to make these limits clear so that we can compare like with like.",
