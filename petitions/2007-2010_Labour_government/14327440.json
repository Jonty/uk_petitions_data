            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "With so many schools closed and it looking increasingly unlikely that the severe winter weather will ease up, many students are faced with the threat of being unable to do their exams and having to take them in the May/June exam season instead, as those who were able to do them would have had papers released. This would be extremely unfair  on those who don't get to take their exams as they would have a huge volume to complete in May/June. Furthermore, current year 13s would be unable to retake any of those exams before universities accept them based on their results - whereas if they could take them still in February then they could be retaken in June, which would be much fairer (as those who DID take them this season would be able to do that.) Ofqual should tell all exam boards to postpone the January exams by 2 weeks exactly, giving time for this weather to clear.",
