This has made a mockery of the exercise and kept hidden many of the questionable expenses already exposed by the Daily Telegraph such as the practice of \u2018flipping\u2019 second homes.\n\nThe Prime Minister should now make it clear to the fees office and the Speaker of the House that the full unredacted version of MPs\u2019 receipts and expense forms should be published as soon as possible, making all information available in full except for that which would genuinely cause a security issue such as bank and credit card details. \n\nThis should include all notes and letters between MPs and the fees office as well as information allowing constituents to determine where second homes are located so they are able to tell if their MP has been involved in 'flipping'.",
