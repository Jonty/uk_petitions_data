            "background": "Drive the motorway network from Yorkshire to Hampshire at the moment and you encounter five sets of roadworks. As per normal, the amount of road actually being worked on is a small percentage of what's been targetted.\n\nWe should all accept the need to maintain the safety of those people working on the roads but not that they need (or are even able) to be working on both sides simultaneously. \n\nLet's be innovative here by mandating that roadworks may only occur on one carriageway at any one time, thereby minimising the overall impact to traffic flow and the economy. \n\nIn the current economic climate let's not be wasting productive time, raising emmissons from traffic jams and increasing risk any more than is absolutely necessary.",
