            "background": "We ask that unrestricted Bus Lane and High occupancy vehicle access for motorcycles is offered nationwide.\nThe Motorcycling Strategy, published in February 2005 in the Traffic Advisory Leaflet TAL02/07 sought to facilitate motorcycling as a choice of travel within a safe and sustainable transport framework. Recognizing that motorcycling has become increasingly popular, it says its benefits include:\n\u2022 Providing independence and mobility\n\u2022 Widening employment opportunities, especially where public transport is limited\n\u2022 Providing a shorter journey time in congested traffic conditions\n\u2022 Reducing overall congestion and more efficiently using roads and parking spaces\nWe ask that this is not left to be decided at a local level as indifference or apathy has been demonstrated there, and that this 5 year old recommendation is now prioritised for action as the positive way forward in pursuit of a sustainable solution to the transport network.",
