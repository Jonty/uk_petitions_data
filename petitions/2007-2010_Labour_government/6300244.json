        "background": "Weapons, drugs and criminals all travel by road at some point in their distribution. Stop and search speeders and noisy/defective cars, trucks and motorcycles and the flow of guns, knives, drugs and commuting criminals will be severely curtailed. The now almost defunct 'crime check' on roads, by experienced officers, used to harvest large numbers of law breakers and their contraband. Speed cameras do not achieve the same result. Environmental gains will be achieved and, at least, a new breed of safe, courteous driving criminal will result - at best, it will severely restrict the flow of illegal items and law breakers. In either case, it will save lives. If it is a crime war we are fighting, nothing less than an 'army' of traffic police will win",
