        "background": "Religion has played a privileged and oppressive part in British history.  Even now the head of state has an important religious role, unelected bishops help to govern us in the House of Lords, some minor Catholic Bishop holds more sway with the Prime Minister than emminent scientists.  Recently, one of the clergy has called for a Ministry of Religion.  This is all part of the historically oppressive pattern.  A Ministry of Atheism however, would be a true strike for British freedom.",
