            "background": "New labour stated in their manifestation they would be \"TOUGH ON CRIME\".They have not kept this promise.they have let the British public down DRASATICALLY.Where by we have become afraid to chastise a stranger in public.Because we fear the consquence of such actions.\nEven afraid to walk the streets after dark\n\nAfter hearing of the tragic death of Garrey Newlove.And the numourous crimes commited by the so called YOB & KNIFE culture.\n\nI suggest that the government should BAN the drinking of alcohol in public places for teenagers.Also the carring  of a knife in public should be a criminal offence.Unless proved there was a lawful and valid reason to do so.\n\nFailure to respect this law,would be a mandatory minimum two year jail sentance.\nRE:Offend another mandatory sentance.\n\nI hope people who suport this petition.And believe that the law should be changed. Will pass the petition on to as many people as possible.                             To make citizens feel once more secure and regain there confidence in the police.Who do a wonderful job.But their hands are tied by bureaucracy.\n\nShirley Andrews",
