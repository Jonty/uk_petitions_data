            "background": "It is about time that young people of todays society became aware that if they want to be grown up then they have a reponsibility to themselves and to the rest of the country and to behave accordingly. Giving people in a position of power the ability to send the mindless thugs to boot camp will not only create jobs for those running the camps but will straighten out the brainless thugs that we have to deal with on a day to day basis, which could reduce crime and increase personal security and possibly decrease the number of young people claiming state benefits when they are perfectly able to work.",
