            "background": "In Weston-super-Mare there have recently been an appalling number of violent crimes that have included a drunken man being kicked to death, an accusation of the gang rape of a woman and the serious assault of man who simply asked a group of youths to stop urinating against his wall. There is an essential need for more police in Weston-super-Mare, especially during the weekend in the town. We need a fairer funding settlement from the government to ensure we have more police to deal with these problems.",
