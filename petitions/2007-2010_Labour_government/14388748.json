They are having to struggle to find a job, support their families and pay bills all on the tiny amount of jobseekers they are able to claim. Prescriptions and other house costs are free to income based - mostly for people who have never had a job so why not the people who have worked to build up this country! Why not give something back and look after us in our time of need!",
