            "background": "We are currently standing in the middle of a Compulsory purchase order in Toxeth Street, Openshaw, Manchester. CPO policy in this country is dictatorship policy, as it allows councils to rip off people, in our case offering severely low reparations for their property, before throwing them out of their homes. They can do this to anyone they wish in the UK.\n\nWe worked very hard, and it was very difficult to pay off our mortgage. Our shop and home have been built with our own sweat and blood, and now we are being offered an amount of money that does not at all cover the cost of buying another shop elsewhere, which for all we know could then be put under a CPO in the future.\n\nThis policy must be scrapped otherwise it will continue to destroy more. The developers using this policy for their own gains just try to bloody rip off people's homes and money. We do not live free in this land.",
