            "background": "More and more low income families are finding themselves way below the poverty line due to trying to keep warm which is a basic human right, these meters charge large amounts which does not make sense as they should be there for people who are on low incomes and need to keep track on what they have to spend on heating. The reality is nothing like that people are spending most of there already low income on trying to keep their homes and their chldren warm, this does not just apply for families or people on benefits it applies to working families who are on low incomes or the elderly, i have known of people who have died because they have just not had the money to put into these dreadful money making machines. it is just not acceptable we are not a third world country but for people on these meters it feels like it sometimes",
