        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There are too many PCSO's in London and they do not have many powers at all. There are very large numbers of parks in the Metropolitan Police area which come under the Safer Neighbourhoods Teams Patrol zone which they have to patrol in addition to the streets. This leaves the parks very insecure and a haven for criminals such as robbers and drug dealers. Instead of spending thousands on PCSO's who are almost powerless, cut down on the numbers of PCSO's and create a Parks Police Service which covers all parks in the Metropolitan Police and City Of London Police area. Most people never see any forms of security or patrols in their local parks apart from when the local SNT are patrolling sometimes. The Parks Police Service would leave the SNT's able to concentrate on their residential neighbourhoods, and at the same time the parks will be patrolled constantly.",
