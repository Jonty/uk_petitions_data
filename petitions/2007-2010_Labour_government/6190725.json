            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Aim:to gauge public support. Issue:alternative economies to the present day monopolies by banks.Is it necessary to hold in permanence profit as the only value? Identity of value through corporate law creates a top down hierarchy of reduced resources for all by privitisation, credit and debt.The question of inflation must be discussed as it is here a myth must be laid bare.For as a glacier holds ice to feed it's rivers so profit pretends to feed us. A mechanism by which the monopoly is held is speculation. Recessions occur because capitalism needs competition/balance. I believe markets will always be necessary but now critically we must create systems with the fallability of mankind accepted and dealt with. So that the majority may have the means by which they are released from the slavery by which the ownership of their production is dictated by only banks.So greenbacks can be printed for universal healthcare; living wages; cooperatives; participatory democracy; public services that are accountable to the people who use them; food, medicine and shelter as a human right especially in these times of preparing to endure climate chaos.",
