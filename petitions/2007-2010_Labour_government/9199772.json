            "background": "Across the UK the public highway and footpaths leave a lot to be desired. Roads have potholes, raised ironworks, poor road markings and vandalised road signs. The public footpaths have broken curbs, poor lighting, broken or uneven tarmac and over growing trees. As citizens of the UK we pay the highest rate of tax anywhere in the world. With council tax rising and vehicle tax rising I would like to see the condition of the highways and footpaths improved and maintained.",
