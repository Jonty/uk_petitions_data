In this time, despite a request from my mother to move her money to a higher rate account, the bank have only paid 0.2% on her savings compared to 2.75% that is available to other customers.\n\nI believe that a bank should be required by law to pay the best rate of interest that is available to other customers when an account is frozen.\n\nThank you for your interest in this petition.",
