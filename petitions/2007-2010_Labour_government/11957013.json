People should be paid benefits for carrying out jobs given to them by the government, like a wage.\n \nA role should, and can be found for almost any circumstance and thus it is unnecessary to just let people make excuses to be lazy. \n\nThis would benefit the country as a whole, as jobs can be created that improve communities and teach people which will improve their chances of finding work in the future.",
