            "background": "At present it is up to the victim to decide whether to press charges against an assailant.    In a majority of cases the victim knows the person and is too scared of the personal repercussions if they get the police involved.  The majority of assailants know this and this seems to give them a free reign of terror.    The law should protect the victims in what ever way possible not put pressure on an already hurt and terrified person to instigate the legal procedures which should already be there for them.",
