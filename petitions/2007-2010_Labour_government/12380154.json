        "background": "As the recession continues to bite there needs to be more help for those who are unemployed & having to survive on the most basic of benefits, Jobseekers Allowance (JSA).\nCurrently \u00a350.95p per week for 16 to 24 year olds & \u00a364.30p per week for over 25 yr olds.Hardly a kings ransom.\nWith weekly bus passes costing in the region of \u00a310 per week upwards that accounts to more than 10% of their income.\nThey get no help towards high fuel bills unlike people on other benefits.In view of this unfairness we ask that you seriously consider extending concessionary fares to people in receipt of JSA at the very least.\nIn doing this i am quite sure this will help more people to attend interviews & gain employment,which i gather is this governments aim.",
