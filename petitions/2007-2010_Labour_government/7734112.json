            "background": "Forget bio-degradable shopping bags.\nReturn to the simple but effective old \"paper bag\".\nTax those shops that use non-paper bags.\nIf ALL bags, carrier, waste, and gift, were brown or white paper, they can simply be recycled as either paper, or within the commpost bins, or even domestic waste bins. This would reduce the expensive overhead of sorting carrier bags, worrying if they can be recycled or not. And of course any waste wood products can also be introduced at this point into production of paper bags.\nStrangely enough this worked for many years until the fashionistas of the 70' and 80's decided we needed expensive colourful bags to advertise their brands.",
