        "background": "The horrific Jamie Bulger case is just one of a number of sickening examples of criminals getting off too lightly. For the brutal murder of a child the admittedly guilty parties served less than ten years in prison!! \n\nIt is not just in instances of murder, but also of rape, paedophilia, assault and battery occasioning actual bodily harm etc. In America life means life. In the UK however, life often means twenty years or less. The system is far too sympathetic to the guilty at the expense and to the detriment of the victims of this country.",
