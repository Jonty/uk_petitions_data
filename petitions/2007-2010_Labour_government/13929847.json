        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The police have been using their powers for crimes of indictable crimes, robbery, child neglect, violent offences and sexual assault with a caution.Crime has increased by 28 per cent in the last five years.\nThis encourages further more serious crime and a licence for it.\n\nWe ask the government to ask Parliament to re-consider these powers and to create new legislation to deal with such disproportionate powers.\nWe ask that indictable, GBH, ABH,sexual,violent and crimes against children are dealt with full power of the law in their correct seriousness.Also that the power should be bestowed within the judiciary to judge what type of punishment a crime should be given especially indictable or triable crimes (not the police, the police are there to enforce the law not to be judge and jury).",
