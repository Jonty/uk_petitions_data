            "background": "The current 'war on drugs' in many countries is an immoral quest which will never have a positive outcome. Demand for drugs never has and never will be eradicated. The result of drug prohibition is a dangerous, violent black market - one which has the potential to be eradicated if drugs could be sold legally. Ending the prohibition of drugs will reduce violence, reduce prison population, help the economy, re-establish an individual liberty, and, as studies have shown reduce overall drug use.",
