            "background": "1. Peak-hour traffic on British roads is horrendous. Cars are the main component.\n2. Most cars carry just one person. Unless capacity of roads is increased or something is done to reduce car use peak hours will become even worse for everyone.\n3. Between 7.30am and 9.30am on weekdays car parks and organisations with their own car parks should be required to collect a charge (initially 5 pounds per day) if a car arrives with less than two people in it.\n4. The money collected should be spent on traffic awareness courses in schools, colleges and universities so that tomorrow's citizens are participants in traffic solutions.",
