        "background": "Following the uproar caused in the Country by the last few weeks Election speculations and the Prime Ministers lack of a clear statement to abate the speculation until too much damage had been done, I call upon the Prime Minister to CALL A GENERAL ELECTION NOW, to verify his claim that the Labour Party would retain the mandate of the people.\n\nIt is better that the General Election be called sooner rather than later, as it is likely that the real business of Government will be slowed by a constant harking back to this debacle, dominating debates in Parliament and the headlines for the next two years, making the electorate even more politic fatigued than they already are, resulting in an even lower turnout than normal at the General Election when it is eventually called. The longer we wait, the more damage will be done to undermine the people's confidence in our political servants.",
