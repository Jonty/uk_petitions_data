            "background": "There is no method for the BBC trust to be informed of licence fee payers\u2019 views for specific issues such as sporting commentary for Formula 1. The BBC has a 5 year agreement to show F1, using our money! This petition brings attention to a significant number of F1 fans who want the BBC to show F1 but do not want James Allen as its commentator. The petition will highlight a gap in the way that the licence fee payer is represented by the BBC trust and the representative sample of licence fee payers using this petition, will create a way to forward our views for specific interest rather than the overall aim of public service broadcasting. Charter:- the BBC is governed by the BBC Trust, which sets the strategic direction of the BBC and has a clear duty to represent the interests of licence fee payers. Vote NO to James Allen and YES to making the BBC and F1 the best.",
