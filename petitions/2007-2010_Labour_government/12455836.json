This was done on a manoeuvre that you are always told is a dangerous move; dodging an object (not slowing down like an emergency stop). This new test is ridiculous as it teaches new riders bad habits (swerving into the other side of the road!). The government needs to have a complete review on DSA and stop listening to the Europeans, why should we listen to other politicians who drive on the other side of the road! Bring back the old test",
