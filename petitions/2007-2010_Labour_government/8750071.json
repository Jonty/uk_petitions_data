            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current capital in London is anything but central to the rest of the United Kingdom; situated in the far South East it is not even centrally located in terms of the south of England! If the government moves the capital including parliament, and the Royal Courts of Justice Lancashire-the capital of the nation will be truly centrally located for the benefit of all it's people. Situated along the M61 and within minutes of the West coast mainline Chorley is well placed along our busiest transport corridoor. Furthermore, the of Chorley is ideally located to be the Capital of the United Kingdom due to it's proximity to Wales and Scotland(this will eliminate alienation felt in those countries by the fact that the capital is so distant). The move will also assist in combatting the feeling that the UK is run entirely by the South-East of England. In addition the people of the regions will feel as if they are more recognised by government. There is no humour intended with this petition - it aims to draw attention to the feeling of social exclusion felt by a lot of the country owing to the fact that the capital and therefore the government is seen as inaccessible.",
