            "background": "Chetwood Primary School is a successful school which, while always being good, has in the past two years really begun to shine with the professional leadership of its new headteacher and the commitment of its dedicated staff.  The town of South Woodham Ferrers does have a large number of surplus primary places, but the LEA has chosen to consult the population only on one option - close Chetwood - rather than exploring any more imaginative options or even comparing the impact of closing other schools.  We believe if consultation is to mean anything, and particularly if parental choice is to mean anything, the LEA should be consulting on a range of options, not just one, and we encourage as many people as possible to sign our petition to make this happen.\nThankyou from the Governors, Staff, pupils and the community of Chetwood Primary School.",
