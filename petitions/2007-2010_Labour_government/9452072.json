            "background": "Marketisation has become a relentless juggernaut,making inroads into area's  of our lives ,once considered off limits to the profit motive.\nThis includes services which should,provide for our most basic,and essential needs as a society.\nEducation, healthcare,etc,have been opened up to profiteers.\nThis involvement has brought no benefit to the public,the taxpayer or to employee's.  \nMarketisation has created a system, which is inefficient,expensive and less answerable to the public.\nPrivate companies prime motivation, is to owners and shareholders.The public good is not of paramount importance to such corporations.\nIn recent years, companies with no connection to health or education,have been selected, as providers of services,within these areas.Successive  governments have ensured, through use of the  tendering process,that  private companies are the preferred providers,of public services.\nOur  public bodies, were created with, the ethos, of working for the public good.",
