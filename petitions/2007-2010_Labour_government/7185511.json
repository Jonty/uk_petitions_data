            "background": "Factually, criminals are found to be more afraid of being caught than the actual time they serve. The problem: comfortable prisons. These places of supposed fear now better resemble hotels. \nStrip prisons of luxuries and make these criminals pay for their law-breaking. By doing this, the idea of detterance would be of greater effectiveness; crime would bear a harsher complexion.",
