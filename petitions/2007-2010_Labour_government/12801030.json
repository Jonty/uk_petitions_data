I feel that the claim that this will compromise national security is absurd and only gives the impression that the government is being less then candid.\n\nThe Prime Minister has a duty to the country to identify the real reasons for going to war with Iraq, and to expose those that are culpable in taking us into a war where the reasons given have been found to be suspect, and at a cost of tens of thousands of lives.",
