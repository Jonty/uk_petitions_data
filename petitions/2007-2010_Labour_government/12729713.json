They should also be given all the same tax breaks. If MPs struggle to live on \u00a364,000, how on earth are  people who do a job which is actually of benefit to society supposed to live on half (or less)of that amount? MPs should try a real job in the real world(complete with all the idiotic regulations and incompetent interference that MPs have imposed on everyone else)",
