            "action": "remind Hazel Blears, Secretary of State for Communities & Local Government, of the need for her department to begin acting within the spirit of their own recent White Paper \u201cCommunities In Control: Real People, Real Lives\u201d (DOLG 2008) whilst formulating Regional Spatial Strategies nationwide and thus begin to demonstrate some \u201cjoined up governance\u201d within her own department. We call upon the Prime Minister to censure the Secretary of State for Communities & Local Government for her recent statements calling for more building on Green Belt land and her plans to \u201croll back\u201d the Green Belts in order to release land for her unreasonable house building targets. We ask that he instruct her to explore more creative, intelligent & 21st Century solutions to achieving a more realistic national house building strategy. In accordance with assurances he gave to the country a year ago, we ask that the Prime Minister now give full and immediate legal protection to all designated Green Belt land across the country to protect them from his Secretary of State and upgrade those areas of land currently designated Green Wedge and Green Buffer etc. to this same legally protected status.",

            "background": "Hazel Blears is being totally dictatorial in the bulldozing through of her plans for Regional Spatial Plans, contrary to her recent White Paper on Communities. Her \"Roll Back\" plans for the inner edges of Green Belts undoes 50 years of local government planning guidelines protecting the countryside. It's simply wrong and must be stopped. What is DEFRA doing about this? - Nothing!",
