Why then, should they pay the same price as someone who earns a salary? Children who are 14 or sometimes even younger are made to pay an adult fare. How is this fair when they simply are not adults?\nThe prices that under 14s pay are sometimes still far too expensive. How can it be right that a child is made to pay almost \u00a35 to ride a few miles to the nearest town?",
