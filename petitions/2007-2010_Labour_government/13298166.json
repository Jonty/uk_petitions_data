        "background": "I have become a victim of a park fine in a car park that did not have clear signs regarding the fees. THe local paper confirms that they have received many calls from other people who have received the same in this car park, the sign being 8 feet up on a lamp post a A4 size paper with a blue back ground and small print, designed so people do not see it. I have seen TV shows with many badly signed car parks and people get clamped and fined. \nI believe a law should be made on the standard of these signs, that they should be in a place that all who enter the car park can see them and are in large clear print.",
