We understand that the \u00a35 note is most frequently replaced due to the large amount of use it receives.\n\nWe would like to ask the Prime Minister to consider introducing a \u00a35 coin, to make this denomination more widely available and reduce the resources required to replace \u00a35 notes.\n\nWe look forwards to a future with less jangly pockets.",
