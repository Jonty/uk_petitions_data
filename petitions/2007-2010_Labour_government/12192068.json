            "background": "British Summer Time (BST)causes far more disruption and difficulty to the patterns of people living and working in our society, particularly shift workers, than it solves in our current way of living in this modern age.\n\nThe reasons stated for the continuation of this practise are many but unjustified.\n\nA compromise would be to set the time permanently 30 minutes between the two zones and leave it there (eg right now the time is 10:30 BST - so set the time to 10:00  and leave it there.).\n\nLosing 30 minutes of daylight is not going to make that much difference at all.  People will still shop and people with other interests will continue to enjoy them, irrespective of a loss of 30 minutes of daylight..and they will do so in a happier frame of mind if it avoids the bi-annual, avoidable and unneccesary, disruptions that the current practice generates.",
