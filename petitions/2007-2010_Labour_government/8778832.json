            "background": "Quite a few people in Earlestown are concerned about the potential loss of our Town Hall. \n \nThe Town Hall was built and completed in the 1890's. The site for the Town Hall was given by Lord Newton to commemorate his being raised to the peerage. The Town Hall building is attractive and, with its clock tower, a prominent landmark within the Earlestown & Newton Le Willows area. The building makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the area. It also contains the local war memorial on one of its elevations.\n \nWe have learnt that plans are afoot for the Town Hall to be partially demolished and redeveloped as a health centre with proposals that should involve the retention of both the clock tower and the war memorial elevation. We would much rather see the building retained in its entirety?\n \nThere has been hardly any public consultation concerning the future of our Town Hall. The demise of our Town Hall has been kept very quiet by the developer and St Helens Council Regeneration.",
