        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Croxton Kerrial is a small village in North East Leicestershire.  The village is bisected by the A607 road and lies on a rat run from the M1 in Leicestershire and the A1 at Grantham in Lincolnshire.  Melton Mowbray is a focus for traffic travelling between these motorways.  Our village is blighted by heavy traffic, and speeding vehicles on this rat run, despite traffic calming measures and a 30mph speed limit which is not enforced.    It is strongly felt that any change in the Melton Mowbray area (ring road/bypass) will have a further negative impact on small villages in the area by further encouraging more traffic to use this M1/A1 rat run.",
