            "background": "Most car insurance companies charge a cancellation fee and admin fee for cancelling a policy part way through it's term.  These can be as high if not higher than \u00a350 and \u00a335 respectively. Although these are stated in the terms and conditions they are not highlighted when taking out the insurance and how can it really cost companies this much in administration?  Not enough people fight back on this subject and just pay up so the charges will never ever lower or disappear.  Please help to fight these criminally high charges.",
