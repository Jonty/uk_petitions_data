            "background": "The government must wake up to the fact that there are thousands of unemployed university graduates, provided with no specialised help/schemes from the Job Centre. University graduates are subjected to tedious, depressing, unspecialised help from job advisors and placed on inadequate training schemes, designed for those who require basic skills. Something like a New Deal for graduates scheme would be very useful, with opportunities to gain work experience in relative fields.",
