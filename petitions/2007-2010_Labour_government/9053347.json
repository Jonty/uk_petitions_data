I understand this to save money, since helping the unemployed back into work as quickly as possibly increases income tax revenue, how does this argument stand up?  Closing this job centre will not save money in the long term and will make finding work much harder for those people who have no wish to be unemployed, but who need the support of a well staffed local facility.",
