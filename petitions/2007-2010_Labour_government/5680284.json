The Wemyss family owns 70 cottages in the village, 49 of which are being sold off, netting the family more than \u00a36m. \n\nTenants last week received a four-line letter from Mr Wemyss, informing them that their homes are being sold \"as an investment portfolio\" and giving them details if they want to purchase their own property. \n\nBut, most in the village are unable to afford the asking prices of about \u00a3130,000 and the quaint cottages are expected to generate much interest from investors or people looking to buy holiday homes.",
