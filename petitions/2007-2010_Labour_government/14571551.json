            "background": "There appears to be no national guidelines or remit for the effective use of Ambulance Service First Responders.\n\nWe would like to see a natonal training and development framework that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of First Responders to ensure all Ambulance Service Trusts use the same procedures and protocols and have a nationally guided set of rules. This could be linked to a nationally recognised qualification as part of the NHS KSF programme.\n\nWe feel any such process would safeguard the Ambulance NHS Trusts, the First Responders and most importantly the patients we serve. This would make our NHS Ambulance services a world leader in the use of First Responders",
