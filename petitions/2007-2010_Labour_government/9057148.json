        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Alcohol consumption is is increasing, and we are being told to moderate, but it is so easy to have an extra glass or finish a bottle. At present licensed premises use measuring devices that have to be stamped by weights & measures for consumer protection. This makes them expensive. I recently attempted to buy a measuring device at my local supermarket, so I could make sure my glass of wine was 125 ml. They had no such device. If inexpensive or free measures were provided for home use. I feel that it would be a step towards encouraging sensible drinking limits. Perhaps they could also provide a chart to calculate units.",
