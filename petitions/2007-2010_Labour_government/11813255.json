Our hard earned taxpayers money has been thrown at the banks with no reference to us.  Worse still, we have a currently unelected Prime Minister who has no mandate to spend our money in this way.  We demand the opportunity to have a general election as soon as it can physically be arranged.  This is the only way that the British electorate can either choose to support the current Government or to remove them from power.",
