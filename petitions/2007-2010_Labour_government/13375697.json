Lets see them offer their moral support to the troops and travel by road the next, and each time they visit Helmand Province. It appears they consider the amount of helcopters deployed in Helmand is sufficient for the needs of British Troops on the ground. If this is the case and troops are constantly carrying out foot patrols lets see members of HM Government travelling by road and not taking a badly needed helecopter away from the patrols",
