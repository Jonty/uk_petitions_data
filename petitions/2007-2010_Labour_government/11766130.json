            "background": "Day after day supposed experts are paraded before the public by the media with horror stories about the worlds economy. The media are being blamed for compounding the current recession by scaring people back into their homes rather than spending their money. It is particularly galling however when the sound bites that the media quote are often from the very people who are charged with protecting our interests and those of the country. The latest of these from Ed Balls would have us believe that we will all be standing in queues for the soup wagon as happened in the 1930's depression. What the country needs now is objectivity and honesty.",
