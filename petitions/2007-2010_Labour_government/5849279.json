            "background": "That all future new developments must be within a 10 minute walk of public transport, bus, rail or tram, either new or existing services operating in excess of every 30 minutes for most of the day, Monday to Saturdays. \n\nThis rule ensures that only sustainable housing/developments are built. If the need is strong, then public transport can operate without the need of financial support. \n\nIf the cost of providing new or adequate public transport is too high then clearly the new development should not be built as it can't be sustainable and will add to congestion.\n\nThis simple rule ensures that planning and transport coordinate. Because they will need to ensure that future developments lead to sustained public transport services that can be afforded. \n\nLow cost housing developments, with improved public transport, achievable without increased taxation and financial support. Just by implementing this simple rule. Please support this petition.",
