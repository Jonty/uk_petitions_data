            "background": "There was absoulty no point in moving the age up to 18 to buy ciggerets. People that are 17 carn't buy them even though they were aloud to buy them last year. If the Goverment is worried about people's health then what about people over the age of 18 who smoke. People are going to smoke at the age of 18 anyway if they want, and it's not fair that it has been moved up 18years of age. There is absoulty no reason for it at all or it should not have been 16 in the first place.Sign this petition if you argeee that it should be back to 16 years old where you can buy ciggerets.",
