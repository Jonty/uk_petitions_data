            "background": "i feel that any convictions of sexual offences should automatically expel anyone from any public office as one of the main roles of a councillor/ member of parliament is as a corporate parent these kind of convictions makes a mockery of the system and any crime involving children should be punished but if an offence does not receive a prison sentence of over 3 months at the present time anyone can hold these positions and carry on as though they have done nothing wrong this is a disgrace. if we are to protect our children as government policy states this law has to be changed.",
