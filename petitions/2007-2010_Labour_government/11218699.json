            "background": "I would like to see them legalise as we can then start using hemp as a resource again instead of cutting trees down all over the world, you wouldnt need to cut another tree down! This is a billion pound crop which has now been mislead and forgotton about. The truth is that this crop could put large companies out of business as hemp can make over 50,000 products including fuel and oil. this crop is harmful but no one has ever died from a overdose and is this really as bad as drinking alcohol? No. I know that it was banned because of racism but that was along time ago and should be thought about becoming legalised as it could save humanity!",
