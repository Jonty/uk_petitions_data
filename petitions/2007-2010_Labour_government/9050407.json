If MPs are made accountable and have to disclose what they claim for, it will stop this waste of valuable money. \nAlso a BBC reporter claimed last night that MPs were so worried about this information becoming public that if and when it does so many will be forced to resign through embarrassment.\nFor me that says it all, under the freedom of information act 2000 this information should already be available in full and uncensored.\n\nSTOP THE WASTE !!!!!!\n\nAndrew Rickerby",
