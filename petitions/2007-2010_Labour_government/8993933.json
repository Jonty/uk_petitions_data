        "background": "At the moment, the free travel for OAPs and the disabled is available after 9:30am on weekdays. These two groups have more GP/hospital appointments to attend than those who pay for public transport. Many of the above groups may have turned down early appointments so they can travel for free. Even with an appointment at say 10:30, is too early for some as need to travel on two buses.",
