            "background": "The human eye reacts slowly to changes in light: a driver who is dazzled by the front fog lights of an oncoming car will be unable to see a cyclist 200 yards down the road even if the bicycle is displaying lights. The stiffest penalty enforced for illegal use of fog lights is \u00a330: this is not an adequate deterrent. The government should introduce an automatic 3 point penalty for any driver caught using fog lights during clear visibility.",
