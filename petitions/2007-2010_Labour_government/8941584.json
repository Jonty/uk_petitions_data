            "background": "We the british public have had enough of this government ruling our lives. We pay too much tax. You can't breath without someone taxing you. You can't move without someone watching you. We don't all earn hundreds of thousands of pounds like MP's. We don't have people to drive us about, have second homes (that i'm paying for), lots of holidays abroad or people to wipe our bums. Being British is nothing to be proud of anymore. It's a disgrace what you are all doing to what was once a fine nation. People can't live there lives as they seem fit. Immigration is a mess, our police forces are a joke, prison sentences disgusting. If my name waa abdul i'd have a free house and car and be on benefits. But it isn't and i'm not. I'm a hard working british citizen who has to put up with a bunch of clowns running our country",
