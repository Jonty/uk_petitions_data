Or should press charges to recoup the resellers profits.\n\nMore money is made by private individuals illegally re-selling RSC tickets (for Hamlet, David Tennant production, etc) on ebay, than the RSC actually makes themselves from selling them originally.\n\ntherefore unless the RSC does more to prevent this, the public funding should be stopped.",
