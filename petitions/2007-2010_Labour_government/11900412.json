It would allow any Minister by order to take any information gathered for one purpose from anywhere, and use it for any other purpose.\n\nYour information, your family\u2019s information, arbitrarily used without your consent or even knowledge. The very reverse of 'Data Protection'. \n\nAn 'Information Sharing Order', as defined in Clause 152, would permit your information to be trafficked and abused, not only all across government and the public sector, it would also reach into the private sector.  It would even allow transfer of information across international borders.\n\nPlease sign this Petition AND TELL OTHERS. \n\nE-mail your friends, write to your local papers. Be creative, be persistent - and don't delay.",
