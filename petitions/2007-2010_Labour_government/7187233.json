As soon, however, as their income (usually from an activity, such as sport or the media, which hardly benefits society at all!) grows to a level at which they become liable to pay the higher rate (which is only 40% anyway!) off they go to a tax haven where they can avoid paying for others to have services similar to those they themselves have benefited from!  This may not be illegal but it's certainly immoral!",
