            "background": "There seems to be an acceptance of  Myxomatosis and of its impact on rabbits. Due to the large majority of rabbits catching it and being out of sight, we\u2019ve come to ignore it and accept it.\nWhen our pet rabbit died of the disease I was shocked and sickened at the symptoms put upon these animals in order to control their numbers. If indeed their numbers need to be controlled there must be dozens of alternative humane methods of control.\nAny disease which blinds its victim in the first few days, blocks its nose so it can\u2019t breathe, forces it to breathe through its mouth so it can\u2019t eat and then lasts upto and over 14 days so the infection can spread even further is not acceptable.",
