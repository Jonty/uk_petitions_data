It is a known fact that most of these no goods claim benefits and generally milk our system for all its worth.\n\nEven when they are caught (as in the case of Abu Hamza), they are allowed to stay in this country in prison where our long suffering tax payers again have to foot the bill for them. And, in prison they are just as much as a threat to our national security.\nI ask the government and this country, to stand up for our beliefs and stop letting this bunch of hate spreading spongers hide behind the human rights legislation.\n\nIf they are caught having associations with extreme radical groups. Rather then allow them to stay on in this country, be it in prison or out in the street, deport them back to where they came from. And the same their immediate families who are as likely to be as no good.\n\nThis country has become the laughing stock of the world for letting these parasites stay. Their rights, what about our rights?",
