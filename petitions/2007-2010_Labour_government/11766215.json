            "background": "The cornerstone of the BBC\u2019s charter is to be independent and impartial in its coverage. In recent years it has shown itself to be extremely biased in its presentation and often adopts double standards. It often ignores the many complaints received from the public. Examples are the refusal to broadcast an appeal for victims of the Gaza conflict, the sacking of Carol Thatcher for saying \u201cGollywog\u201d in a private conversation (not broadcast) but merely suspending Jonathon Ross who regularly uses obscenities in his broadcasts. The documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed was extremely biased which then led to their refusal to broadcast Crufts unless certain breeds were banned. However, one such breed (a St Bernards) is now featured in EastEnders in a storyline where it may be used at stud. This shows the corporation\u2019s hypocrisy. As they are no longer an impartial broadcaster we feel that they should no longer be funded by the licence payer and should seek revenue from commercial sources.",
