Surely all the do gooders & the Govt can see that if we offered nothing they would all go away to pastures new. Surely someone with backbone has got to do a double take & say WHOOOOO slow down, let us just look at what is happening to Britain. Someone I don't mind who, has got to put a stop to it all, mass immigration too. Just look at the immigrants now on benefits, this with the NHS is bleeding the country dry. I think the the voice of the people needs to be heard, the only way that would happen, is if the people voted for a Champion, someone who is not a politician,as the unrest does not seem to concern them & their kind. I rest my case",
