The remaining 70p in the pound that has yet to be realised is approximately 80 million pounds.\n\nWe demand that the money from Landsbanki Guernsey bank that was 'transferred' to Heritable bank be returned immediately as this money is from our deposits at Landsbanki Guernsey bank.\n\nNOW IS THE TIME for the United Kingdom Government to ensure that the deposits of the Landsbanki Guernsey depositors are returned in full. This will help to restore confidence in its banking institutions.",
