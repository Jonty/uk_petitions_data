            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which manages leap seconds, is proposing to abolish them in favour of adding a \u201cleap hour\u201d every 600 years or so.\nOver hundreds of years, the universal time zone would gradually drift east from Greenwich before the \"leap hour\" moved it back west again. Such a move would see GMT lose its status as the zone in which local time is the same as the universal time by which clocks are set and would be a change with profound cultural implications. We would be decoupling our clocks from what the Sun is telling us.\u201d\n\nIt would also have implications for astronomers, requiring expensive changes to the operating software of astronomical telescopes.\nThe proposed change would mean Britain would have legal issues to contend with as GMT has been enshrined in law since 1880 as the standard by which national time is calculated.\nBritain and China oppose the change but it is backed by the US, France, Germany, Russia, Japan and Italy.",
