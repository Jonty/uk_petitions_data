To make the government further accountable, we ask that the Prime Minister arranges for the publication of the financial costs incurred overseas and at home in support of these operations. The figures should be published within a realistic period (e.g. two months) on a website where all can access the details, which should be given to the media.  We are fed up with hearing of the sacrifices our youth are making with their lives, lets expose the financial sacrifice they are making by adding up the debt they stand to inherit!",
