        "background": "The South London Line (SLL) \u2013 which travels from Victoria to London Bridge via Wandsworth Road, Clapham High Street, Denmark Hill, Peckham Rye, Queens Road Peckham and South Bermondsey is under threat with plans to scrap it by 2012. \n\nWhen the cut was announced in May 2008, Network Rail a replacement service which would call at most of the same stations as the SLL. This has also been abandoned\n\nA behind-closed-doors deal means the \u00a324million saved from replacing this service will be spent on the East London Line (ELL) extension instead, leaving the stations served by the SLL with vastly reduced services into central London. \n\nMPs, councillors, residents\u2019 groups and hospitals near the train line are now fighting to save the rail link which provides a vital transport link to three major hospitals across the capital:  London Bridge, Kings College Hospital and the Maudsley. \n\nThe SLL is already over-crowded and in high demand.  How Transport for London and the Department for Transport can even consider axing this link is beyond comprehension.\n\nPlease sign this petition to show your support for this campaign and help to save the South London Line!",
