            "background": "this is for people who own dogs that have a problems with other dogs. i am one of these people. \n\ntoday while on a walk with my dog, we saw another dog running towards us which i knew this dog could be aggressive to our dog. at this point our dog was on a lead and had a muzzle on- as he always does. this dog began attacking our dog and my dog was defenceless. i was trying to split it up when i was bit by the other dog and injured my hand, badly. The owners didn't even apologise or ask if i was ok.\n\nby the way, i'm 15 years old and have depression problems. its should be made a law for people like my and them to keep our dogs on a lead between certain times to avoid these types of situations. something needs to be done. i accept my dog can be problematic and so should these people.",
