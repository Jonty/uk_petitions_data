            "background": "To create a truly original London and UK, shop signage should be standardised.\nThis should be law, as it is in Ireland.\nIf you have ever been to Dublin, you will find the old shop signage as standard and required by law to be standard. Any signage which does not fall into the standard signage category is by law required to have the words \u201cTemporary Sign\u201d inscribed on it and only be allowed for a set amount of time, i.e. Until completion of authentic standard sign.\nYou will find this to be clean and neat and remind you of what Britain used to look like.\nI have yet to meet an individual who finds the greasy neon and perpex signs attractive.\nAmazing what effect this has on maintaining a town and countries image.",
