            "background": "It is unfair that some properties either private or Council/Housing Association have a water meter and others havent.  I conserve water in all sorts of ways but my neighbour has her hose pipe running most of the day watering trees that dont need watering especially at this time of the year!  A new law should be passed that all houses rented or bought should have a water meter fitted or pay a serious fine.  We need to conserve our water! All our other services are metered why not water.  Hose pipe bans would no longer be required.",
