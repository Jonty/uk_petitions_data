The examination is completely random, rendering some avid attenders of lessons worse off than those who have only have attended one.\n\nThis subject is a waste of time and energy, as most Universities will not accept General Studies as an AS or A2 level. Please get rid of it so students can spend more time focusing on their other A-levels, and not talk about the \"Maglev Train that runs from Shanghai to its airport 32kmd away.\"",
