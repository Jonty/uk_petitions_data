        "background": "This petition is in responce to the ban next april on the sale/hire or importation of samurai swords, which in recent years have claimed the lives of 5, yes five people...\nIn the year 2000, 1,307 people fell to their death while walking down\n stairs (This is a REAL statistic!).  Due to this alarming trend, I petition the government to ban all forms of stairs and stair related travel.  This ban will save the lives of thousands of would-be stair climbers and create a boom in the elevator installation and maintenence industry.",
