            "background": "Network Rail proposes that direct services to Cannon Street should cease to run from the year 2015.\n\nAll Hastings Line trains will run to Charing Cross non-stop through London Bridge\n\nThe outcome will be that City commuters using the Hastings line will either have to go to Waterloo or Charing Cross; or change at Tunbridge Wells to go to Blackfriars\n\nThis proposal will have dire consequences for the villages between Tunbridge Wells and Hastings and has serious implications in terms of their desirability for City workers\n\nNot having access to a direct return service from Cannon Street is also likely to mean that not all passengers will get seats from London.\n\nHaving the option to go to Cannon St is important unless in future all services stop at London Bridge",
