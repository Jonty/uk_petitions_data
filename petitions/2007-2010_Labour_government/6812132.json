But devolution has happened and referring to England as \u2018our country\u2019 is confusing to a public that is not always aware that Mr Brown may be talking about policy areas that do not have a direct affect on his own constituents (to whom he is democratically accountable) because in Scotland those areas are the responsibility of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament and Government.\n\nGordon Brown (Andrew Marr interview, 6 Oct 07):  \u201cBut what I want to do is show people the vision that we have for the future of this country in housing and health and education and I want the chance, in the next phase of my premiership, to develop and show people the policies that are going to make a huge difference and show the change in the country itself.\"\n\nGordon Brown (PMQs, 10 Oct 07): \u201cWe will govern in the interests of the people, and what matters to the people is the health service, education, housing, and we will govern to make education, health and housing better in this country.\u201d",
