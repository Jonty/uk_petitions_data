        "background": "Some mobile phone operators are becoming increasingly underhand in their tactics to keep old customers and tie in new customers. In an age where email and telephone are the dominant forms of communication. Mobile phone operators insist on written cancellation notice being sent by postal mail. Contracts are becoming increasingly longer. They make it difficult to change numbers from one network to another. Phone companies know its too difficult to change contracts. They abuse the system. The system needs to be investigated and it needs to be easier for consumers to switch between companies.\n\na large part of the problem is the tradition of handsets free on contracts. This locks people in. This system neds to be abolished or at least made more transparent. So that consumers know how much per month they are paying extra for the \"free\" handset.",
