        "background": "When the people vote in an election it should be for the person they believe can best run the nation. It is unfair and undemocratic that when a party is voted in, the leader of that party can change, simply because when the population vote, they have in mind the leader who is present at the time and who is campaigning. If the leader should change during the parties term in office, the only democratic way is to call an election and let the people decide if they still hold the same opinion.",
