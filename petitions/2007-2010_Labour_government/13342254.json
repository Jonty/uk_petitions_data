Lets face it, do we really need a man who talks to plants to represent the United Kingdom?\n\nDame Helen Mirren has the expierence of acting as Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II, and looking glamorous (at award ceremonies), for this she deserves to be pitted as a contender for successor, as much so as any other. \n\nFurthermore, the successor should be chosen in an X-factor style tv-show headed by Simon Cowell to decide our next monarch, Judi Dench and Stephen Fry should also be in the running.",
