        "background": "In a leap year those of us who are on an annual salary will get the same amount of pay as any other year, but will have to work an extra day. Why should employers profit from this extra day if we don't? Setting this day aside as a non working day would have no detrimental affect on the economy and would probably boost spending in areas such as leisure and entertainment.  \n\nFebruary 29th should belong to the public as a bank holiday.",
