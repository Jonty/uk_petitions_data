Hospitals will have no more electricity, which means that patients on machines will die in Instantly. Medicines are scarce, and Israel has stopped all supplies to reach Gaza, and is still carrying on with its bombings of the innocent citizens of Gaza. We ask Mr Gordon Brown, leader of one of the most democratic and humanitarian countries in the world to help put an end to this catastrophe.",
