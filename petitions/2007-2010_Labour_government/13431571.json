            "background": "From 1 October bars and restaurants will no longer be able to 'top up' wages to the national minimum using tips. They will have to pay staff the full national minimum wage as a salary. This is a positive step. However, bars and restaurants are able to keep the tips - and if they do this staff may be worse off as they will have to pay NI on salaries, which tips were exempt from. In order to make sure that the 1 October change has the positive effect that was intended the PM should ask Parliament to enact legislation to ensure that all tips and service charges in bars and restaurants go to the staff working on the night.",
