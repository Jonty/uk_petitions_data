The main issue that hits home is the complete lack of any sort of discipline. \nThe children do exactly as they please and the staff can do nothing about it -They go out and don't turn back up until the next day, all the staff can do is report them \"missing\" they have no powers to \"ground\" the kids when they return, they can't withhold \"pocket money\" they can't do anything\nAs a result when the kids become adults they have no idea of respect, they cannot hold down a job (mainly because they won't be told what to do by managers as they have never had to do as they were told whilst growing up)\nCarehomes are ruining childrens lives as a result of this - Its not the staffs fault, they are powerless. \nMr Brown give them the power to discipline children",
