Like then i understand that not all Muslims are terrorists like then not all Germans ect were spies. But in this given climate the best way to prevent terrorist attacks would be to stop those who carry them out from entering the United Kingdom until the Islamic threat has passed. Im not a supporter of any right wing party, i merely see this as a logical way to save innocent lives.",
