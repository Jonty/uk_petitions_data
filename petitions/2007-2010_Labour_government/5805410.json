This has led to the announcement that Plymouth Learning Shop will close at the end of December 2007, meaning hundreds of people who travel from a 20-30 mile radius of Plymouth and local Plymouth people will lose this vital service.  The Government is eager to get people off benefits and back into work are they?????",
