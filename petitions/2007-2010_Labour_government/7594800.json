            "action": "Pass legislation that will ensure all new motor vehicles manufactured after 1 january 2010 and any foreign vehicles using the UK road network achieve a fuel consumption figure of at least 50 miles per gallon at a steady 70mph.",

            "background": "The only way to reduce the consumption of precious non renewable oil supplies is to impose a legal requirement on the motor manufacturers to achieve improved fuel consumption figures. This will also help to reduce emissions to the atmosphere. The fuel consumption figures then need to be improved year on year and this can only be done by imposition of further improvements in fuel economy. The USA have at last started this process albeit a very low 35mpg. We need to demonstrate a greater commitment.",
