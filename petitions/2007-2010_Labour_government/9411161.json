            "background": "There appears to be an increasing trend to modify car exhausts with noisy 'boy racer' car exhaust systems. Despite writing to various local councilors and central government about this problem I have been fobbed off with excuses. The MOT test I have been told should fail any vehicle with a modified exhaust system which generates more noise than the original manufactures equipment, this test obviously does not work by the increasing numbers of noisy cars on the road. The answer I'm told is to record vehicle numbers and report to the police. The answer I beleive is to force suppliers to conform to a national standard before these units can be sold and then penalise DIY mechanics with points on their licence if reported. Please support this petition to help to reduce unecessary noise pollution from vehicles.",
