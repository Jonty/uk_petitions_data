They will no longer be seen as self-employed but instead will be \u2018deemed\u2019 employed for tax purposes.  They will be forced to pay PAYE and National Insurance contributions but will not get employed status.\n\nThe proposals unfairly single out self-employed construction workers \n\nIs the Government planning to introduce similar changes in the law for other self-employed workers such as barristers, IT consultants or journalists? It is unfair and discriminatory to single out one type of worker and exclude other categories.\n\nWorkers\u2019 take home pay will reduce\n\nThe only likely outcome for workers affected by these tax changes is that their pay will be reduced as taxes are increased. There will be no other benefits as a result of this.",
