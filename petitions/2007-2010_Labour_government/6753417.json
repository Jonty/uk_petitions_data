        "background": "Reduce Fuel Duty on Red Diesel for Agricultural Use -  The recent 2p rise in fuel duty is hitting Agricultural Contractors, Farmers and other rural business hard.  The cost is now over 40p a litre which is double of the cost of 3 years ago.  The 10p duty that is included in this could be reduced to allow small agricultural businesses to survive or at very least the latest 2p rise should not have been applied to red diesel.",
