            "background": "The Orangatangs are slowly being killed by man,just like the dodo. Please stop this by banning people cutting the forests down, the orangatangs home, and stop it being  demolished.How would we like it if someone demolished our home?. Adverts have been shown on television, that 80% of forests have been cut down leaving orangatangs homeless. As a result of this, orangatangs have been locked up in cages and been taken away. Or even worse. I hope you will take this further and have a little time to think about it.In conclusion i do not think orangatangs should suffer they are living things . Please try to ban the forests being cut down .",
