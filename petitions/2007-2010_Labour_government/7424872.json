            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "*  Despite there being outstanding approved planning applications for more than 600 new apartments within the borough, Gravesham  Council is apparently intent on approving an application, by  Edinburgh House, for a further +600 without proven need having been established. \n\n*  Not only does Gravesham  Council apparently intend to pass over ownership of key parcels of public parkland to a private developer but they appear to be on the verge of permitting this developer to move ahead without more than token public facilities being provided.\n\n*  There is little long-term gain of any kind, for local tax-payers, with the exception of a one-time payment into civic coffers & a modest increase in the borough tax-base. \n\n*  The proposed 32-storey apartment building will significantly dwarf all other buildings within Gravesend--in fact it is approximately three times the height of any other structure within a 30 Km radius.",
