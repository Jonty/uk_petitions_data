            "background": "I believe that people are dying in this country and others around the world due to the simple fact that people don't get round to signing the donor list!\n\nIf there was a way that as soon as a person is born they are automatically put on the organ donor list, I believe this would be fair as the person in question is free to remove themselves from that list at any time should they not wish to donate their organs, or in the case of a minor, their parents can remove them from the list, therefore not infringing anyones human rights.\n\nI have already started a group on facebook for this idea, it is prooving quite succesful. \nThe link for this is - http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=69884704626&ref=ts\n\nplease take a look at this and join the group, the more support for this the better! this really will save peoples lives of the general public aswell as our servicemen and woman returning from conflict areas.\n\nthanks for reading.",
