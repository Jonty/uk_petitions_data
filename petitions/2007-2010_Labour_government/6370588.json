The auction date was set four months hence, but on the day it was cancelled, as they had not requested the necessary legal documentation.\n\nA manuscript file note of a chartered surveyor was deliberately mis-dated. We wrote a letter on  the 11th, and referred to the Daltons Weekly advertisement to appear the following day (as I knew from the office).  The letter was  received on the 12th.  However, the letter was impressed with the office date received stamp as being received on 16th.  No stamp was  applied to any other incoming mail.\n\nMy credibility as a witness in my submissions to the Ombudsman and Court was completely destroyed, and the Ombudsman only awarded a paltry sum. He thought we had little interest in the auction process, as most of the records of contacts were suppressed by the auctioneer's office.",
