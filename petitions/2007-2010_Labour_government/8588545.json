        "background": "The Isle of Wight Council are intent on reforming the education system.\nTo effect this reform they have proposed 3 options.\nIsland residents have been asked to vote for one of the 3 proposed options.\nAll 3 options do not address the need to improve standards beyond age 13.\nInstead the options proposed will destroy the schools that are currently providing excellent education for under 13 year olds.\nThe process of consultation carried out by the council is flawed, since respondents are forced to choose one of the proposed options, whereas a great many would rather see an option which allowed  standards to be raised WITHIN the existing system.",
