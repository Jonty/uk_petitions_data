        "background": "I think Mr Brown should have a serious look at the tax levels for low earning members of the UK.\nI for example earn \u00a317500 per annum gross. This is for my main only job ( 45hours minimum) as a retail manager for a newsagent/small convience shop company.\nThis figure works out to \u00a31416 gross per month of this National Insurance is \u00a3114 and tax is a huge \u00a3198. Total deductions \u00a3313 a month leaving me just over \u00a31100 for the month. \nOf this \u00a3100 is council tax!! \nI am a young gay male who I feel is being penalised for not having children as I obviously dont get any family tax credit or working tax credit.\nIt seems that Mr Browns government does not look after people like myself that pose very little drains on government resources.\nAs you can tell from this many of my friends tell me i'd be better off on the dole or trying to claim one of the hundereds of benefits.\nIf you agree with me please sign this petition",
