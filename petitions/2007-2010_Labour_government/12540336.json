            "background": "The swine flu situation raises a problem for laryngectomy patients for two reasons. We breathe air directly into the lungs without benefit of filtration through the nasal passages making us very vulnerable to infection. Mass produced surgical masks cannot effectively be used by neck-breathers. \n\nA special filter for neck-breathers is available but despite a long delay it has still to be approved for availability on prescription. It is called the PROVOX MICRON Filter and is marketed by Platon Medical Ltd of Eastbourne. \n\nThere are only about 7000 of us in the kingdom so any assistance in this respect is not going to add a crippling financial load to the NHS.",
