            "background": "This petition requests that the Prime Minister bans extremist political parties from contesting general elections in the UK. Extremist parties such as the British National Party, the England First Party and the National Front, present an unacceptable threat to both the democracy of the United Kingdom, and to the civil liberties of the people of the United Kingdom. Some will argue that this petition in itself is undemocratic. In response to that reaction, with extremist parties' support worryingly on the increase in the UK, one must ask oneself; if one of these parties were to ever gain power, what would they do for the democratic principles and ideals, in which the base of our very society is so entrenched?",
