        "background": "A unemployed couple living together are currently paid \u00a350 per person each week,whereas if classed as single claiments they would each receive \u00a364 per person per week a vast difference to that couple. this happened to us when we were forced to sign a joint agreement, we lost, jointly \u00a356 per fortnight. people simply can not live on this amount and it is about time government recognised this fact.people have to pay for food, electric, clothes and much more ,all from \u00a350 per week. for example the \u00a356 per week, if returned by the government would help cover the extortionate electric bill, or by decent food items, we neither need, nor require luxuries, but if out of work need a decent amount of money to live on.",
