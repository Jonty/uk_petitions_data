        "background": "We want to see that ID cards are NOT introduced using coercion tactics for students and young people. \nStudent Loans, Bank accounts, Driving Licenses etc., should be available to them without first having to spend \u00a3100 on an ID card.\nYoung people depend on these services to forward their career/education and cannot afford the expense or the risk (through ID theft) of an ID card. Effectively forcing young people into this will only anger them and will result in alienating the younger generation from the rest of society.  \nWe ask you, as our PM, to re-consider very carefully what you are doing, and, if ID cards have to be introduced, do it on a complete, national scheme. Dont just target a specific group.",
