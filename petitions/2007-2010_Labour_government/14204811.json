            "background": "Since FCC commenced their franchise of the Thameslink and WAGN routes, I am petitioning that the franchise is removed under the minimum term set which expires on April 1st 2010.\n\nMy reasons are that the new rolling stock has failed to materialise as quick as promised, refuse to heat the trains in the cold weather (no heating when below 0 degress on several occassions), constant cancellations due to driver shortage pre-work to rule, severe and dangerous overcrowding even outside of peak times, toilets with no water even mid afternoon, increased parking fees well above inflation, above inflation regulated and unregulated fares, removal of off peak in the evenings, a now chargeable shuttle service from Luton Airport Parkway to the terminal, taking rolling stock from other operators.\nTo conclude, FCC have failed to provide a service that matches the cost to travel.",
