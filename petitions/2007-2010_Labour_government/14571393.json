The animals should be allowed to breed naturally. And only if they choose to breed themselves. So it works to the animals advantage and to the animals best interests and benefit ie. what the animals would want or like for themselves. There might be enough provided under natural conditions anyway. Otherwise they are overworking the females of the species which is not a healthy way forward for the females of the species both pschologically or also physically, or healthy for us aswell, if the way our food is being produced is not naturally. Otherwise the animals must feel scared and frightened and upset, sad and unhappy, if they are not in their proper and \"optimum- for them\" conditions. Especially when we are supposed to be responsible for them in a parental and hospitable capacity.",
