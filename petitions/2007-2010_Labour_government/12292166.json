        "background": "Viable companies are being bleed dry by Administrators, so their charges should be capped!\nMost senior managers of Administrators, now charge over \u00a3450 pounds per hour and the Administrators' offices clerks hours are charge at \u00a375 per hour when they are probably paid the minimum hourly rate!\n\nAdministrators strip all the value from companies in administration for themselves and not for the creditors!\n\nAdministrators should save companies from going bust and save the jobs of the employees. However, the practice is to accelerate the process of leaving employees without jobs and creditors without payment.\n\nStop these people today and save Great Britain from mass unemployment!",
