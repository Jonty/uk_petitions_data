Is this what our government is supporting?\n\nMy mum got her parking ticket because she was going into the hospital to help a women who had been faint in the town center, had kindly tried to help the women and was told to move her car before she she took the women in the hospital.\n\u00a3700 pounds would be able to help pay our morgage for a month in this difficult time that Britain is going through.\nI am 18 years old and have already realised we are living in a greedy, deviant society also known as Britain.\n\nOne example of this: You cant vote unless you go on 'myvote', so if we miss the deadline- our views aren't counted?\nWOW. The government have thought of it all.",
