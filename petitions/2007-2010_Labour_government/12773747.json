        "background": "In Wales we have only three Further Education colleges that offer a Full time Floristry Course.  With effect from September 2009 two of the three colleges are stopping these courses leaving the Welsh College of Horticulture the only college to offer floristry.  This college is in Mold, North Wales thus preventing students wishing to study floristry in Mid and South Wales unable to do so.  We would like the Education Minister to look into this matter and stop these closures.",
