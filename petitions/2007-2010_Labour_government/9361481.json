        "action": "Expand the Air Training Corps, Army Cadet Force, and Sea Cadet Corps in preference to the CCF",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Government has announced plans to increase the Combined Cadet Force in schools. \n\nHowever the investment would be far better utilised in increasing funding for the three other cadet forces, who parade more often than the CCF (usually twice a week for 3 hours each parade time as opposed to once a week for two hours for most CCF contingents).\n\nThe ATC, CCF and SCC units are open, community units rather than dependent on students at a particular school, generally encouraging better integration of cadets from diverse social, economic, religious and ethnic backgrounds, thus increased funding would reach more people of a far more diverse nature. \n\nSo please support this petition as diverting the funding to the three main cadet forces will achieve far greater results, giving many more young people the opportunity to develop self respect, self discipline, initiative, and self reliance.",
