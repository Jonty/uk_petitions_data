        "background": "I have recently started using public to travel to and from work and have therefore sold my car. \n\nI have 5+ years no claims discount and will lose my no claims after a period of 2 years if i do not insure another vehicle. (5 years NCB = 60% + discount). I do not want to loose my NCB. Therefore i will have to purchase another car shortly.\n\nWhat is the point of encouraging people to give up there car and use public transport.\n\nIf i need to purchase a car in the future for some reason i will be penalised in this way.\n\nNot government legislation but i am sure the government could do something to pursuade the insurance companies. \n\nOr compensate people who have given up there car with a one off payment or tax incentive, or best of all a free bus pass for a year.",
