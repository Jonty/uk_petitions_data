        "background": "Its been brought to my attention that a local community centre at Norton, Stoke on Trent does not allow the Teenagers or youth in its midst to use the facilities even when there are parents willing to run the evening.  Community Centres are not just for T dances and coffee mornings but for a safe place for young people to meet, join groups, practice sessions, dance/meeting nights, useful use of the centres. It's their community too.",
