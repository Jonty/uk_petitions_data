            "background": "Putting the clocks back in the autumn and forward in spring is completely unnecessary, causes mass confusion and disruption to sleep patterns disrupting productivity in the work place.\n\nIt is time we followed the lead of other countries of late and abolished these clock changes.\n\nWe, Britain, are the centre of the world's time. Every country throughout the world uses GMT as a reference for their own time; hence it should be a constant.\n\nThe vast majority of people in the UK find the existing system disadvantageous and the remainder would find abolishing such a such system straightforward and very manageable.",
