            "background": "It was reported in today's (12/09/09) Guardian that minister's are planning on imposing a legal limit on the number of students that can live in any single house, and the number of houses in a neighbourhood that can be used by students. \n\nIt seems alarming that students can seemingly be discriminated against and treated as second class citizens by the government. If the proposal were to be applied to limit the number of people of a given race or religion in an area, that proposal would be outrageous and inconceivable, yet such blatant discrimination against students is somehow acceptable. \n\nIn addition to being counter-productive to the Prime Minister's promise of introducing a 'fairer society,' such legislation would likely lead to an increase in the cost of student housing, placing further stress on already grossly inadequate student loans. \n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to urgently reconsider this idea that student's are legitimate targets for discrimination.",
