        "background": "After losing both legs to an anti-tank mine while serving in Afghanistan, 20-year-old Joe Townsend is trying his best to rebuild his life. \n\nHis Grandfather, David Carter decided to build a modest bungalow on his paddock, to help Joe become more independent.\n\nBut Wealden District Council's planning committee refused Mr Townsend his dream home, even though they received NO objections, leaving the double amputee \"distraught\". \n\nThe council narrowly ruled against the plans, even though there had been no objections.\n\nTheir decision has devastated the wheelchair-bound veteran. It means he must stay in a rehabilitation centre instead.\n\nMr Prime Minister, please use your influence to pursuade Wealden District Council to re-consider Joe Townsends unfortunate 'unique' situation, and hopefully provide Joe with a more comfortable, independent life in the future. \n\nAfter all, Joe has made this extreme sacrifice for his country and should be cared for accordingly.",
