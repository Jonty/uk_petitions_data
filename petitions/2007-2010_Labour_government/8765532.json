I therefore believe that it is only right that The Stig carry the Olympic Torch in London. It is about time that he received the worldwide recognition he deserves. What better way to celebrate Britain and this Great Man (if indeed he is a man) than to fulfill this duty. And what a way to start the Olympic Games!",
