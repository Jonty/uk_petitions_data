Sometimes, it can be a result of caring for someone when your own policies have declared that this person \"isn't disabled enough to claim high rate care component\" and thus access to trained carers.\n\nIf others didn't get involved, they could be left where they fell for a long period of time, then when someone else does help them, they damage their back and still have to provide care for this person because of your policies and they can't get any help themselves when their own health deterriorates as a consequence.",
