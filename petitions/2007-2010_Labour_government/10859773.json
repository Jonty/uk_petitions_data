            "background": "Warrington is being considered as a possible site for a Titan Prison on a prime business location close to the M62. This location is on the edge of a large residential area developed on the former RAF Burtonwood. The area is home to many people and in particular families with children. In turn this means there are 8 primary schools and 3 high schools within a short distance and many nurseries for pre-school children.\nSurely, a large prison of this type should be built in a non-residential area so that prisoners, thier families and associates have no chance of coming into contact with local residents.\nFurther to this, the site on which it is proposed is part of a piece of land which hopes to attract prestigious businesses to locate here bringing thousands of jobs. If you were this type of business, would you move next to a 2500 inmate prison? I wouldn't!",
