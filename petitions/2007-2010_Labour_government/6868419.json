What is wrong with councils collecting more at the kerbside?, items such as plastic bottles/food trays, shoes, old clothing, cardboard etc.\nCouncils that collect the bare minimum are recycling about 18%, councils that collect the items listed above recycle 40%.\nCouncils must be bought into line, so that council A recycles the same items as council B, C and so on.  This will then take more items away from the landfill.",
