            "background": "In both 1996 and 2008, significant disruption to passenger and rail freight services through the Channel Tunnel were caused by fires on board Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs), both of which were associated with hazardous goods (polystyrene beads in 1996 and phenol in 2008). The risks of prolonged reduction or suspension of passenger and container freight services do not appear to justify allowing HGVs to use the EuroTunnel shuttle services until a means of identifying and reducing risk of fire has been established. Highly flammable or toxic cargo should not be allowed through the tunnel under any circumstances.",
