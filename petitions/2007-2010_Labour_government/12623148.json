        "background": "Save the Salford Advertiser Office and all other local northwest based newspapers which will result in redundancies and the death of the local newspaper. \nDear Gordon Brown I am campaigning to save our local offices in Eccles and in turn all local newspaper offices -23 in total. Guardian Media Group have not consulted with the community and is in effect excluding those with a mobility issue from placing an advertisement at front counter which will disappear when the office closes. Merging the offices into the Manchester Evening News has already resulted in a newspaper fourteen pages shorter with a more Manchester Evening News presence within it. Locally I have amassed 2,200 signatures but have vowed to get 10.000 before its proposed closure on October 2nd. Losing our local newspaper is taking away our identity and community voice. One hundred and forty two jobs will go. I am committed to raising awareness and initiating further protests. This was featured on the BBC Politics Show this week. Can you help by contacting the Guardian Media Group on our behalf. I have tried via our MP Hazel Blears but am less than satisfied with her responses.",
