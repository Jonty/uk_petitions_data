It takes me 1 hour to get there and back, ading up to 7.15 hours so far, then 1 hour to get ready in the morning, 8.15 hours, 1 hour homework, 9.15 hours, going on to a recommended 10 hours sleep 19.15 hours of unfree time a day, only being 24 hours in a day this leaves 4 hours 45 minutes a day to do what you like. I personaly find this annoying, upsetting and stressfull! \n If there was no homework then you'd have more free time to do the things you like doing. Whats worse is you get punished if you don't do homework.\nThanx x",
