        "background": "The church of Scientology is recently coming to media attention for being a dangerous cult. This is not at all an understatement. There are numerous documents, court rulings and testimonies that blatantly show the mistreatment, brainwashing, fraud and harassment the church conducts on critics, journalists, ex-cult members and their families. \n\nThis cult justifies itself by calling it a religion even though it's top members have been found guilty and sentenced to prison see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_snow_white\n\nAnd to illustrate some of the harassment in the UK :http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/jun/09/claredyer\n\nThere are far too many sources to list the atrocities this 'Religion' has caused. This is the first petition to out-right ban Scientology and it has come years, years too late.",
