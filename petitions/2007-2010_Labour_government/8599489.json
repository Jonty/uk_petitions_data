            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "BT has recently added to subscribers' Telephone Accounts a sum of \u00a31.50 per month, if subscribers choose not to pay by Direct Debit.  Whatever the small-print says, a Direct Debit is infinitely variable and any amount can be taken from a subscriber's bank account at any time.  In agreeing to DDR payments, a subscriber loses control of his finances and grants a company - in this case BT - unrestricted access, without reference to the relevant bank.  That BT should surcharge a subscriber who objects to such a Payment Procedure is unethical and it is encouraging that the appropriate Watchdog is entering into discussions with BT to resolve this Isueby by June 2008.  In the meantime, we request that such surcharges should with immediate effect be ceased.",
