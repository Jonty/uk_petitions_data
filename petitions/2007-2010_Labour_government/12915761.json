            "background": "Due to poor Government Publicity, there are an increasing number of deserving persons who could legitimately claim state benefits at times of sickness and unemployment who do not know that they can do so. This often results in debt, near starvation and family breakup. At present, the maximum time a backdated claim can be considered is 3 months. This should be increased to an automatic eligibility period of 12 months to help the deserving persons pay off any consequential debts.",
