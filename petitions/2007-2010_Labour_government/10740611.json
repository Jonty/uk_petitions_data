He has demonstated that he is a fundamentally flawed individual suffering from the arrogance and disdain of the public which comes with a public appointment from which one cannot be removed - regardless of the stupidity foisted upon the paying public by his actions.  HE MUST GO AND HE MUST GO NOW.",
