I urge the United Nations to pass a law especially on those countries who practice this and persecute other religious faiths in the name of Islam over all.\n\nChristians in general are facing hostel situations which they have to live in all because they are a Christian and don't want to be a Muslim they are made to live in terrible situations. Their rights are not taken into account. Where is the justice in that? Isn't christianity a religion also? Or is Islam the only faith in the world? I think not so why force this religion onto others?",
