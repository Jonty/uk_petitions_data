            "background": "The government roll out the red carpet to the Saudi Royal Family yet the government of Saudi Arabia is an autocratic regime with an appalling human rights record. Executions, flogging and amputations are imposed and carried out with disregard for the most basic international fair trial standards. In February 2009 a gang-raped woman was sentenced to 100 lashes. 'Offences' include being gay or being a woman unaccompanied by a man or driving a car.\n\nThe UK has turned a blind eye to the extent that we will break international law on corruption to avoid upsetting the Saudi Royal Family so that oil and defence company executives and their shareholders can profiteer. The price is repression and misery in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs a consequence of this relationship we are perceived as supporters and backers of this regime conducting state terror on its citizens. The UK and USA have seen the consequences of our collusion with Saudi Arabia for the security of our own countries. 19 of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis driven to extremism by the extreme conditions in their country.\n\nIt is now the opportunity to restore Britain's dignity and end this stain on our country's reputation and distance ourselves.",
