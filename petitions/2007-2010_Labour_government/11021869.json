        "background": "I am very concerned that public buildings, particularly schools, have no incentive to reduce their consumption of power. I work in a school where lights are on permanently in classrooms, corridors, exteriors and staff rooms, which have excellent natural light. I would like to see schools being rewarded for being energy efficient, with increases in their budgets. I regularly sit in classrooms where climate change is being taught, and where lights are on and blinds closed, heating on and windows open!",
