        "background": "Nurse of 20 years Margaret Haywood filmed undercover for BBC's Panorama exposing horrific NHS Management failings, which were broadcast in July 2005 as part of the \"Undercover Nurses\" program. At a hearing on April 16 she was unjustly removed from the Nursing Register, solely for her actions exposing these failings.\n\nThere is CLEARLY an overarching public interest in standards of care, and whistleblowers must be praised and encouraged, not punished. \n\nFilming was covert, but all those who were filmed later gave permission for images to be shown. \n\nNurse Haywood's striking off is a gross injustice, the specific care homes filmed in the Panoram program have been discussed in the House of Commons. \n\nThe background can be found on line (search for Margaret Haywood on any news site).",
