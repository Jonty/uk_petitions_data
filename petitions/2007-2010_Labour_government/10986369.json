        "background": "This petition is to help Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand reinstated. On the 18th October 2008, they both left 4 telephone messages on Andrew Sach' voicemail, which they have both apologised for.\nThey are both talents in their own rights, and were caught up in the moment of attempting to produce comedy. It is very easy to go over the top with conversations and offend people and being a pre-recorded show this should be the responsibility of the producer, not at the presenters who were doing their jobs of entertaining.",
