            "background": "The Open University claim they have a commitment to being \"Open Source\" - there is even another petition on this site congratulating the OU on this.\n\nHowever, Open University (OU) locks all domestic fee-paying students into using Microsoft (MS) Windows computers and does not allow students to use Apple Macintosh computers or any other platforms. Assignments are not allowed to be submitted using PDFs - the system is designed to accept MS Word documents. OU students study from home, not on a campus, students buy their own computers and basic software, those with Macs are expected to replace theirs. There is no information offered to help anyone on an non-Microsoft computer.\n\nAs a state-funded University it seems unacceptable, unethical and barely legal that the University gives one company [Microsoft] such an unfair commercial advantage that is not based on what is best for the students.\n\nMAKE THE OPEN UNIVERSITY CROSS PLATFORM AND OPEN SOURCE!",
