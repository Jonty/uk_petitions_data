            "background": "At the moment, \"Secret Evidence\" is quietly being embedded in the judicial system and it is being counterproductive.  The evidence for Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq was far from accurate and as a result a well-known scientist died and thousands have died in Iraq including many children, civilians and British soldiers. Why should anyone in the UK have any trust in secret evidence?  To most of us it is a cover-up for dodgy intelligence. When people abroad find out about how secret evidence is used against individuals in the UK, they can hardly believe that this is happening in a a Democratic State.",
