            "background": "If polling day was held on a Saturday then tens of thousands of schoolchildren would not have their schooling disrupted by the need to use schools as local polling stations. \n\nThe disruption to the working lives of school staff and the parents of school children would also be avoided by holding polling day on a Saturday\n\nSince fewer people work on a Saturday than on a week day, more people will find it convenient to attend a polling station and vote, thus enhancing the democratic process.\n\nSince a large proportion of the working population do not work on a Sunday the results of the election can be followed knowing that attendance at work is not required the next morning.",
