        "action": "to rethink the changes to the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act; specifically allowing free use of photographs which will deny legitimate income to copyright holders who licence photographs.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The proposed changes to the 1998 C&DPA will allow free uncommercial use of copyrighted photographs.\n\nPhotographers make a living by issuing a licence for photographs to be used in a given context. Not only will this change deny an income stream, it will devalue the photographs themselves. How can a photographer issue a licence for something that is freely available?\n\nThe proposed changes make no sense whatsoever: If you want to watch a DVD, you pay for it.\nIf you want to watch a film at a cinema, you pay for it.\nIf you want to listen to an album, you pay for it.\n\nIn all of the above you do not own these items, you have a licence to watch,listen to, etc.\n\nIf you want to do any of these in a commercial situation I.e playing music in a shop, you'll need to pay a further licence fee to cover this. \n\nYet for photographs the Government is proposing that they can be freely used by anyone in a non-commercail sense. (On the flip side the Government is proposing to cut off an internet connection if you try to obtain music, films, etc for free.)",
