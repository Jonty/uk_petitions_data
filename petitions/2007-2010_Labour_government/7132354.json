        "background": "In past years the Department of Health has created a very useful calendar of health promotion events (search on their website for \"Events Calendar\" to see the 2007 version).\n\nThe Department of Health has chosen not to continue this into 2008. For many smaller organisations, this calendar is an important way of promoting their campaigns to a wide audience of health promotion professionals and private sector bodies, and we would like to see it reinstated for 2008 and beyond.",
