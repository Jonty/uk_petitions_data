I suggest they show leadership and empathy with those whom they supposedly represent by making 10% of their positions redundant (eg reduce MPs from 659 to 600).  The Boundary Commissions should be given clear and tough targets, which should be pushed through.  It's not too difficult - businesses have to make these tough choices all the time.",
