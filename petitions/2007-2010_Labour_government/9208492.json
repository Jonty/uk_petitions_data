        "background": "Since cannabis is such a wide-spread drug, there is a possibility that people who do not use cannabis will be accidentaly exposed to it, like in parties, clubs or even in the street. Or what if a person visits Amsterdam, and then returns to UK and gets a possitive result in a drugs test? Although the drug is illegal, it would be wise to establish a legal limit of cannabinoids in the blood system, just like alcohol",
