I am a student and so I get free glasses, but most people can't, and this is dangerous, not only for them, but for other people as they may not be able to see where they are going without glasses. The very cheapest glasses are around \u00a330 for the frames, with lenses extra, which can be a lot of money to people on low incomes, especially if they have to get more than one pair.",
