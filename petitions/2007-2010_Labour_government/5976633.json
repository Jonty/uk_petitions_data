            "background": "The GRO\u2019s project to put 170 years of national BMD data online is at least twelve months behind schedule. Due to budgetary constraints and overspend on this and other IT projects, the GRO is now also unlikely to find funding in the near future to create the online index search facility that users of the new service will need to access it. The closure of the Public Search Room facilities at the Family Records Centre building in Myddleton Street in October 2007 and the end of access to the 6,550 physical ledgers held there was intended to go hand in hand with the arrival of online indexes to birth, marriages and death records, a promise that is now in the process of being broken.",
