        "background": "As a parent of three children (2 in High school and 1 in Primary school) I have noticed that the art of writing and spelling has declined somewhat since the use of computers to do work at school and at home for homework.\nComputers have spell check and children just COPY & PASTE from websites to their own work so with not writing I feel they don't take the information in.\nThere should be just one I.T lesson to involve computers and that is it.\nA lot of people have agreed with this and this is why I have started this petiton.",
