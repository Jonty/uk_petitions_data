        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Following the decision just recently by the government to increase the 0% threshold to which you don\u2019t have to pay stamp duty from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3175,000, this is only helping those who can actually buy a property below \u00a3175,000 \u2013 how does this help the majority of us where house prices are much higher?\n\nQ: How can this be made fair to everyone?\n\nA: Change the Stamp Duty to a banded system, in the same way as Income Tax.\n\nFact - if you bought a property today for \u00a3300,000 it would cost you \u00a39,000 in SD. If it were banded like income tax it would cost \u00a32,250 (\u00a30 on the first \u00a3175k, 1% on the next \u00a375,000, then 3% on the next \u00a350,000).\n\nOK, the government is not going to like losing so much money, but even if the bands were adjusted it would still be a fairer system.\n\nIf a house is bought for \u00a3255,000 the SD bill would be a staggering \u00a37,650 instead of \u00a32,500 just because you\u2019d been unable to buy it for \u00a35,000 less at \u00a3250,000! That extra \u00a35,000 on the purchase price has increased the SD bill by \u00a35,150! Ouch! It\u2019s just not fair!",
