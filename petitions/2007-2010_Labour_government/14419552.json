This is environmentally unfriendly and unnecessary. \nAs estate agents have offices and internet websites there is no need for them to advertise in this way.\n\nI ask the PM to set limits to how much hand delivered direct mail an estate agent can send in any one year. This should also incorporate an opt out clause for people who do not want to receive anything.",
