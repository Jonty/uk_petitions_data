            "background": "It is well known that there is a dearth of affordable housing in rural areas. One cause for this is that those more wealthy have bought second homes in these areas, thus pushing up prices and preventing local people from buying houses in which to live in the areas they have grown up. This is unfair. Therefore the government should legislate against people buying second homes; it's greedy (who needs more than one house to live in? You can't be in two places at once) and unnecessary and it has led to a country where hard working poor people cannot afford to own their own home (note, home, not a piggy bank as many second home owners seem to think of these properties).",
