            "background": "Getting a decent amount of snow fall across the whole of the UK is such a rare event that, when it happens, adults and children everywhere should make the most of it. If everyone spent the day sledging, building snowmen, building igloos and having snow ball fights then no one would have to worry about the cancelled trains, the non-existent bus services and the desperate driving conditions.\n\nThat is why a national holiday after 4 inches of snow fall is a good idea. It wouldn\u2019t just reduce accidents and stress but it would probably make us all happier as well!",
