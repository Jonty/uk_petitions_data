Had he arrived six weeks later, he would have been allowed to become a naturalised citizen. Everyone who has come in contact with him - school teachers, church and charity officials - have commented on his admirable character. He excelled in his GCSEs and was offered a place at Cambridge. He would be a credit to this country and wants to go to university with the ultimate aim of teaching. Yet the Home Office has rejected his application and wants to deport him as an undesirable alien.",
