            "background": "The Ombudsman makes ten determinations of maladministration on the part of the former Department of Trade and Industry, the Government Actuary's Department, and the Financial Services Authority. Also, the Ombudsman has upheld a general complaint namely that: \u2018the public bodies responsible for the prudential regulation of insurance companies...and the Government Actuary's Department failed for considerably longer than a decade properly to exercise their regulatory functions. The Ombudsman has recommended that a compensation scheme should be established with a view to paying compensation to former policy holders to remedy any financial losses which would not have been suffered had those people invested elsewhere than with Equitable.\n\nThe Ombudsman has invited the Government to debate her report. I believe they should do so at the earliest opportunity.",
