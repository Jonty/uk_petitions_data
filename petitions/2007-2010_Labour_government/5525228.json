This takes all control away from the legal system, and places it in the hands of the HMRC.  \n\nAccording to the BBC: \"The plan would allow HMRC to bypass the need to get a court order to seize money.\"\n\nSurely this is infringing on human rights, and also invading both our privacy and security.  We are already taxed up to the hilt, we don't need to be left open to any more taxation!",
