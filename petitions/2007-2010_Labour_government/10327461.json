        "action": "Raise Approved Mileage Allowance Payment (AMAP) from the current rate of 40 pence per mile",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In light of the decision to raise advisory fuel rates for using\n     company cars, it remains unfair that the thousands using\n     private cars for work continue to be penalised by rates set in\n     2002 when petrol cost around 74p per liter. With prices now hitting over 115p\n     (56% rise) it\u2019s time the government acknowledged this rise.\n       Since 2002 advisory fuel rates have risen by 5p per mile. The\n     most recent change, (1st June 2008) acknowledges this; \u201cwe are\n     mindful that an implementation date of 1 July might mean that\n     drivers will be incurring higher fuel prices before the new\n     rates become effective\u201d.  Given that the government\n     acknowledges the increased cost for using company cars it can\n     no longer ignore the cost for the use of private cars used for work.\n       We urge the government to review the Approved Mileage\n     Allowance and as a minimum raise it immediately by 5p per mile\n     in line with the agreed rise for company cars since 2002. We\n     also urge the government to commit to reviewing Approved\n     Mileage Allowance every 6 months, as it is committed to do for\n     the use of company cars. Any raises given for Advisory Fuel\n     Rates should be reflected in Approved Mileage Allowance.",
