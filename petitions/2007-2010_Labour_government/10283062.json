        "background": "Wind turbines or wind farms should be sited along side existing motorways and not in the countryside and/or areas of outstanding natural beauty. Due to the openness of the area around most motorways there is usually a good continuous supply of wind energy. The areas around motorways are already affected by noise pollution and are visually blighted. There is easy access for maintenance and undeveloped but unusable areas along the motorway to allow the easy laying of cabling to supply power directly to the towns and cities which require it most.",
