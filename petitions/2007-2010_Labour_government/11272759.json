            "background": "With crime in the uk rising every year and serious crimes like murder happening more often, isn't it about time that the uk law was revised and changed to keep up with modern day crimes and criminals. Teenage crime is getting worse what with murders, stabbings, anti social behaviour etc, why, because they are protected by the law because they are minors. i say if you do an adult crime, you should do the adult time. Let the Police enforce the law with zero tolerance instead of the uk being a nanny state. If you live a lawless life then you should automatically forfeit your human rights.",
