            "background": "A significant number of people who come to this country as refugees have homophobic views, often arising from their religious and cultural background, and some of these individuals commit violent acts  against members of the gay community because of their prejudices.  There have been examples where an offender has been imprisoned, but not deported at the end of their prison term.  Fleeing from persecution is not an excuse for persecuting others here - indeed it calls into question the validity of an asylum claim.  No foreigner who commits a hate crime against a British citizen has any business staying in this country; deportation should be automatic.",
