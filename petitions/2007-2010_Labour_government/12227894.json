        "background": "My husband's late wife and two young sons were tragically killed in a head on collinson in December 2002 after the other driver was on the wrong side of the road. The driver responsible was charged with 3 counts of Death by Dangerous Driving and was sentenced to two years in prison. Only serving one year! He was also given a 5 Year driving ban which is now up. This petition is to ask that the laws regarding Death by Dangerous Driving be revised and sentences passed that fit the crime.\nTwo years in jail for the lives of 3 people aged 26,4 and 1 - does not seem appropriate to me.",
