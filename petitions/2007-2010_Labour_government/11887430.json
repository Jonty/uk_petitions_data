            "background": "It would appear that ISIS Fertility Centre has not been awarded the contract to provide NHS patients with Fertility Treatments such as IVF. The new centres are reported to be St Bartholomews in London and Bourne Hall in Cambridge (70 and 68 miles respectively from Colchester), amoungst others. For patients to have to endure additional stress of lengthy travel times and costs along with losing income from time away from work is just not acceptable. We call for ISIS to be re-instated as an NHS care provider. We are led to believe that contracts are reviewed every 3 years and therefore this will be common procedure until at least 1st April 2012. Please complete the petition to urge the PCT to re-consider this ridiculous plan to make couples have to travel 140 miles for each appointment. Thank you.",
