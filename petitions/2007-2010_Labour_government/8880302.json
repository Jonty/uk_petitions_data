There is no point being held at traffic lights when there is nothing coming in either direction. This\nis a waste of time, fuel and electricity. Our campaign would:\n \n1. save electricity (fewer lights on) \n2. save fuel (no need to brake, stop, idle engine, pull away again)\n3. save time (get home or to work sooner so fewer emissions).\nIt's called F.L.A.S.H.E.R. - Finish Lights At Sensible Hours Emissions Reduced",
