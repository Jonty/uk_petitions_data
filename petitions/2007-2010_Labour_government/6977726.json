            "background": "More and more marine mammals are coming to the coast of the UK and Scotland, and need protecting otherwise they will all die, due to the members of the public.\n\nDespite warnings from police, and other animal charities, people still go and harrass these dolphins, seals, whales etc, all for their own satisfaction, and dont care about the wellbeing of the WILD animal, some even making money from it, advertising the mammals and where they are so people can harrass them.  THIS SHOULD BE STOPPED, as they are taming these beautiful creatures, and therefore they end up getting seriously injured by not having a fear of boats and get serious injuries like part of tails being cut off.  This is totally unacceptable and more laws are needed to protect these, even if they do become tame.",
