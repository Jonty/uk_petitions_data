            "background": "Victims of parental child abduction in this Country are not eligable for Legal Aid at present. Often the legal battle takes place in the Country that the child has been abducted to. Particulary when the Country is a non EU Country there are no conventions to return the child to the legal guardian in this Country. The legal costs can be astronomical and financial aid is unavailable at present. The majority of victims of parental abduction are often from low income families and are unable to afford the legal costs to return a child, devestating lives and often the parent never sees' thier child again. Please sign and help make a change.",
