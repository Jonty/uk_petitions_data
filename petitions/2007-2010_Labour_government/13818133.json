            "background": "For years there has been significant media coverage of accidents where cyclists have been tragically killed or injured by vehicles on the nation's road. Little coverage has been given to the injuries and damage caused by belligerent or inattentive cyclists who persist in disregarding traffic regulations and ride on pavements and in pedestrian areas. Other road users are required to hold third party liability insurance to cover accident and damage as a result of collision. It is considered that cyclists should now be required to hold insurance and a national registration in order to protect road users and pedestrians.",
