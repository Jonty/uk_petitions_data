            "background": "As yet another child gets killed is it not time to try and think how to deal with the problem?\nStop all dog breeding by inexperienced laymen.\nTo only allow approved (council reg) breeders to breed dogs of any breed. This will hopefully stamp out the current trend of breeding fighting/ aggressive dogs and ease the burden on councils and shelters of having to rescue and PTS the thousands of unwanted dogs. At present anyone can breed a litter - you need no knowledge and too many dogs are being bred for the wrong reasons. Usually financial gain - People in council flats or indeed in any unsuitable home without a garden should not be allowed to breed dogs. Fines should be very heavy \u00a31000 min-dogs seized and a ban on keeping dogs for life to those who breed without a license. \nPuppy farmers hopefully to will be put out of business.\nNothing will stop any dog from attacking children however selective breeding by experienced breeders will have a huge affect\nMaybe over the years the bad genes will get bred out and only responsible owners should be allowed to own dogs.\nWe need a change in the law.\nWe must introduce a licence and compulsary insurance to dog owners",
