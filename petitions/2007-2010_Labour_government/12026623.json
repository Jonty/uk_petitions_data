            "background": "The pub industry's in crisis and we're at risk of losing one of the icons of British culture.\n\nAround 40 pubs are going out of business every week and thousands more are expected to close. Experts estimate another 75,000 people could be made redundant as a result.\n\nBut it's not just about the economic impact another tax rise will have. It will push up the cost of a pint at the pub - unfairly putting the social drink out of touch for thousands of people.",
