        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I want the govt to take an active role in the behaviour of court and legal system to ensure they protect the needs and rights of the victim. Especially children of a very young age. A 4 year old has not the deveoplment, strength of character, comprehension or vocabulary to fully take part in cross examination in an adult court with defence lawyers usuing adult concepts and ignorance of child's stage of development. I am ashamed to be British and find it very upsetting. Surely this incident is an issue that Parliament needs to address.",
