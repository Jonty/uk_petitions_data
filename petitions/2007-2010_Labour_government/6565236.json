            "action": "Introduce Legislation that makes it mandatory for Doctors to supply a carbon \"Carmel\" copy of every prescription for the patient to keep and for the Pharmaceutical Industry to clearly label all medicines with the medical name of the medicine not the brand name and the dosage per tablet or 5 ml if liquid etc.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "My Mother was admitted to hospital on the 30th August 2007 after the wrong medication was dispensed to her by her pharmacy. My Mother subsequently died.\n\nIt is my wish and that of my Family that we honour my mother and undertake to prevent such tragic events happening again.\n\n1) Whenever a prescription is handed to a patient it is accompanied by a carbon copy typed or neatly hand written. I propose it is called the \"Carmel\" copy in honour of my late and dearly loved Mother.\n\n2) The Pharmaceutical Industry ensure that every package (Box/Container/Bottle) has a labelled area in an agreed background colour that ALWAYS identifies the medication and the dose i.e. Amoxicillin 250 mg. (Cigarette Manufacturers have to do it!!!)\n\nThis labelled area should then match exactly the patient\u2019s copy of the prescription as handed to them by their own GP and enable them to prove they have been given the correct medication by their pharmacist. \n\n3) A Public Education Campaign should be undertaken to accompany the introduction of the carbon (Carmel) copy prescription.",
