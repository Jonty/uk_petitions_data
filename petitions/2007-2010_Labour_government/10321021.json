If an e-petition receives signatures equal to 50.1% of the number of votes in the last general election, it should be considered an indicator of general opinion and thus lead to a national referendum on the issue in question.\n\nSince the number of people required to meet the 50.1% target is large (but still shamefully low given the potential number of voters in the UK!) this mechanism can't be abused and would give an accurate portrayal of the general opinion.",
