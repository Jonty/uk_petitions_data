The use of taxation powers in such a manner is unacceptable, is against natural justice, and is discriminatory. The government should instead encourage by whatever means at its disposal - for instance by means of grants, corporation tax discounts or rebates - those private companies which provide such services to improve their offerings across the UK.",
