The people are fed up with those who recklessly and knowingly drive vehicles while unfit, or who drive in a manner likely to cause an accident, and yet face no responsibilty for hurling a ton or more of metal at innocent road users. If a person can commit murder by punching innocent passers-by whilst drunk, why are they not guilty of the same offence while sat in a vehicle?",
