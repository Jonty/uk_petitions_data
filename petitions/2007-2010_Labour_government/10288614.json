            "background": "We have heard on the news recently that our prisons are becoming full and that some of the criminals may 'roam' our streets sooner than they would have done which means they are not being 'punished' for the crime they committed.  If there is no room in our prisons, why don't they send the criminals to the army where they can be trained up and go to fight in the war in Afghanistan.  Obviously the ones who are fit enough should go, but it seems that we are sending young innocent people in the army to fight in the wars who lose their lives where we could be sending the criminals of this country to fight for us as their punishment.  It makes sense that we have these criminals going to fight in a war, rather than back on the streets where some are bound to reoffend.  The gun and knife crimes have risen of late, these people are cowards who think they are 'men', well, let's send them to do a 'man's' job!",
