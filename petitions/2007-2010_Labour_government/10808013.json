We feel that in the last 20 or so years so much of our past cultures, sports, hobbies, way of life has been lost.\n\nPart of this is bell ringing, and the sounds of bells coming from Abbeys,monastic communities, \nRetreat Houses, Churches and Cathedrals.\n\nBells should be able to ring out and not be subject to attack from\nNoise Pollution officers.\n\nBells ring out not just for services but for joyfull and sad occassions and this should be allowed to happen.\n\nPlease sign our petition.\n\nThank You.",
