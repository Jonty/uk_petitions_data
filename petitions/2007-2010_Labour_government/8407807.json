Loans taken after 2006 are valid until repaid or a maximum lifespan of 25 years.\n\nWe urge the PM to backdate this 25 year decision as we have received exactly the same education as those from 2006 onwards.  I personally have projected my payments to last 38 years which is grossly unfair on students who made the effort to attend university between 1998 and 2006.",
