            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "House prices reaching ten times average earnings is causing numerous social problems, including the inability of young couples to afford a house suitable to start a family, depressing birth rates and increasing tensions in our society.\n\nThis problem has been severely exarcebated by the use of buy-to-let mortgages, which did not exist in 1997, and now make up 10% of the housing market. The interest charged on these mortgages is tax-deductible, saving the 40% income tax due, whereas since the abolition of MIRAS in 2000, owner-occupiers have received no tax relief whtsoever.\n\nWhile the petitioner recognises that interest is generally a normal business expense and therefore tax relief is due, residential housing is clearly a special case with shelter is a basic human right, and with a finite supply of property on the market, it is wrong to give those buying homes for profit an advantage over normal families.\n\nAlthough BTL landlords do provide a useful service, this would still continue if mortgage interest were to be taxed, as the reduced house prices would mean higher pre-tax yields.\n\nAccordingly Mr. Brown is petitioned to end the unfair tax concession with immediate effect.",
