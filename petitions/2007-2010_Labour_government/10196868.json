            "background": "With the traditional British Pub finding it harder and harder to stay in business and with cheap shop bought alcohol fueling the youth binge drinking culture; we would like the Prime Minister to consider lowering tax on alcohol sales in public houses. The loss of revenue from the tax cut could be balanced by increasing the tax on alcohol sold in off-licenses and super-markets etc. This is the sensible option to tackle under-age drinking, and would help breathe some much needed life back into the floundering Great British Public House, especially after the blow it's been dealt due to the smoking ban.",
