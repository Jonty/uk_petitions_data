            "background": "Gordon Brown in 2005 announced an increase in future spending on renewing more than \u00bd of England's primary schools, with an investment of \u00a39.4bn over 5 years. 3 years later, we have not seen a single penny.\n\n2 years ago the school had an inspection by the community fire officer. A number of shortcomings were identified; with two of the major issues resulting in the school being prohibited from holding assembles in the hall and a limit of 80 individuals in the canteen.\n\nWe have tried to work with the Council to rectify this, but we have made no tangible progress. The latest proposal is not to even consider the school\u2019s case for another five years!\n\nThe school started in 1820, with the current premises being built in 1911. The school has expanded to 7 single year classes. 4 temporary class rooms were added without addressing the communal requirements. The facilities do not meet educational or health and safety standards necessary for a 21st centaury primary school.\n\nPlease sign and support us.",
