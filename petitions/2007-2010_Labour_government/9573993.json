        "background": "Recently a 36 year old woman went to a pharmacist in a major high street supermarket to obtain emergency contraception as her usual method of contraception had failed.\n\nShe was denied access to the emergency contraceptive pill because of the pharmacist's personal religious beliefs.\n\nThis is unacceptable - pharmacists should make such decisions based solely on sound medical reasons, they should not be permitted to allow their personal religious beliefs to restrict other people's access to contraception.\n\nDispensing emergency contraception where it is needed is part of the pharmacist's job. \n\nWe should not permit pharmacists to let their personal prejudices stand in the way of other people's access to important pharmaceutical products.",
