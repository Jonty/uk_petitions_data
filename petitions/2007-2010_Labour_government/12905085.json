        "background": "Dear Sirs\n\nI have no support for nor affiliation with nor sympathy for wrongdoers.  However Ronnie Biggs poses no threat to society.  His treatment is inconsistent wiht the mild and irresponsible treatment given out by the authorities to much more serious recent offenders.  His situation in relation to other cases is now a situation that represents no danger in contrast to other more dangerous individuals who are free and not arrested or caught and set free almost immediately.  Whether he avows remorse is immaterial.  Compassion can be unilateral and in this case should be so.  The current incarceration of Ronnie Biggs is not consistent with the publics wishes or common sense.\n\nHe should be freed forthwith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nNigel Lee.\nPortquin, Weybourne Road, Farnham, Surrey, GU9 9HE.",
