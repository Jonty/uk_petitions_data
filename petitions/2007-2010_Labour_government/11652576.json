It will never be secure, it is an idea that is potentially dangerous, and is an invasion of privacy. \n\nFollowing the loss of numerous public information over the last year, those with children under 18 and other individuals have lost all trust in Government departments. \n\nIt is also extremely unjust that MPs, council members and celebrities have their own rules that their details would be kept off of the database. \n\nWe want children to be protected, but by creating a database covering details of all children that is accessible by thousands, it is not ensuring their safety, especially when CRB checks on staff members do not always follow correct procedures, placing children in further danger.\n\nStop this now!",
