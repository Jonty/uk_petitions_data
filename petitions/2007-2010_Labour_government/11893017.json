            "background": "I am dyslexic and do not disclose my condition on job application forms as I know that they just get put on the rejection pile as some people think dyslexic people are thick and stupid. This is not the case.\n\nOn the few job application forms that I have disclosed my dyslexia, I didn't get an interview. On applying for similar jobs without disclosing it, I got interviews.\n\nPlus if a colleague admits to having dyslexia, employers should do more to help the dyslexics such as more training, finding suitable roles within the company etc.\n\nMany dyslexics get dismissed due to making mistakes caused by their disability.\n\nAlso I would like to see employers recognising that dyslexia affects people differently. Some can have problems with numbers whilst others have mobility problems.",
