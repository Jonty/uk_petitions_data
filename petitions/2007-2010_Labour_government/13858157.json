            "background": "The TV advertising industry is currently regulated by the industry itself. Whilst the ASA code is adequate, its compliance is only passively monitored through the process of considering advertising complaints, and those considerations are biased heavily in favour of the industry.\n\nThis means that institutionally-accepted manipulation of public opinion through the all-pervasive medium of television is an accepted part of British society today.\n\nWe want that stopped. We want TV advertising to be vetted before transmission by an independent body.",
