        "background": "In Scotland, in 1992, wheel-clamping on private land was banned overnight. It was declared to be extortion and theft. Many clampers don\u2019t have offices and work from PO Box addresses or from mobile phones. Charges can range from around \u00a350 to over \u00a3500 for the removal of clamps and towing away fees. England should not be subject to these unjust extortions just because it is unable to get individual representation in the UK Parliment, therefore I urge the Prime Minister to bring about discussion of the abolishment of private clamping companies in England and/or the UK as a whole.",
