            "background": "Health matters are a sensative topic but this subject can be a little confusing.\n\nThe macrobiotic diet is an organic way of eating and producing natural food to produce a healthy and holistic way of living. Macro means large or big or long; Biotics means life.\nThis way of eating has been around for atleast 4/5000 years.  It is based on 2 forms of energy upon which all life is projected.\nYing and Yang; Ying is expanding energy Yang is contracting. Everything we eat in this world today is either Ying or Yang energy or a combination of the two. The foot we eat sometimes maybe healthy or balanced the energy generated from it is or YIN OR YANG the more refined it is the more unbalanced the less refined the better.\nMost modern doctors have either not heard of Macrobiotics or confused it with being a vegetarian or in some cases a vegan.\nMost doctors have identified a degenerative illness from the symptoms, Fever, diarrhoea, dizziness, rashes, vomiting, headaches aches and pains etc.\nHolistic doctors who have studied homeopathic medicine based on \u2018Chinese philosophy\u2019 and have defined and understood the basics of macrobiotics for the cause of the disease rather then just treating the symptoms.",
