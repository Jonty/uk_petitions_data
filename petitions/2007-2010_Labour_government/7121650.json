            "background": "One of this country's best loved eccentrics, Timmy Mallet is probably best remembered as the colourful presenter of the popular children's entertainment series 'Wacaday', that ran on TV-am between 1985 and 1992 as part of The Wide Awake Club.\n\nHe actually made his name in radio broadcasting, which he has been involved with since the 1970's, before becoming one of our most popular television personalities.\n\nNot only has he used his talent and personality to also carve out a successful music career with Bombalurina, he has used his success to help raise money for many charities over the years, and not many people know that he is actually an accomplished artist as well.\n\nWe believe that he should finally be recognised for his great contribution to children's entertainment, and for services to broadcasting over the last 30 years.",
