Already Northern Ireland puts up with a far lower wage than the rest of the mainland, whilst our house prices soar faster than anywhere else in the UK.  If you want to invest in peace why then deny the people the right to a fair wage?  \n\nWhy should the worth of workers in England be more than those of Northern Ireland when we are contributing to the same economy?",
