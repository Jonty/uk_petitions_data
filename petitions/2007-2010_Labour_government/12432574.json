        "action": "amend the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 to remove the illogical definition of the word gypsy.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960, as amended by subsequent legislation, states (24 (8)) that \u201cgipsies\u201d means persons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin.\n\nThis definition is illogical, because the word gypsy is a racial term.  Using the word gypsy to define anyone who lives in a caravan makes no more sense than saying that anyone who wears a turban is a Punjabi.\n\nThis petition is not being merely pedantic.  It is not helpful to meaningful public consultation if anyone who objects to having a travellers' camp built near to their home does so at the risk of being labelled racist.  Sadly this does happen from time to time.\n\nThe Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 should be amended to state that the word gypsy cannot be used to refer to just any person who lives a nomadic lifestyle, and also that it is not racist to object to the establishment of a travellers' camp.",
