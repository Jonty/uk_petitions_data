        "background": "Volunteer drivers who use their own cars to enable elderly and disabled people access health care, shops, social events etc. are being overlooked of by this Government. A tax exempt mileage allowance of 40p a mile was fair in 2002 but with the recent steep increase in fuel charges is now quite unreasonable. If the Government wishes to promote volunteering more must be done to recognise and support the excellent work being done by this valuable group of people.",
