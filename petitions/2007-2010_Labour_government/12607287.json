        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In April 2007,the Ogaden National Liberation Front(ONLF) terrorists killed more than 70 Ethiopians & Chinese workers. As partially documented by US Committee on Foreign Affair below,the ONLF has been known to assassinate officials,lay mines,burn hospitals,villages & vehicles of local Somalis who do not join it. The ONLF kills few Ogaden Somalis but it focuses its killing on non-Ogaden clan Somalis,a reason why local Somalis call the massacres by ONLF a genocide like Darfur. Months later,the ONLF killed 200 Ethiopians more as reported on VOA. Ironically,the ONLF leadership lives in London.Ethiopia fully cooperates with the UK to fight terror but the UK never showed sympathy to terrorist attacks in Ethiopia. How long will UK ignore terror financed and managed by ONLF leaders in UK?Ethiopians worldwide demand the UK to end its double standards & condemn the killings by the ONLF terrorist group.
