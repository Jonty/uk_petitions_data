        "background": "I have recently been disgusted with the number of crimes against children and our vulnerable members of society, which are hitting our headlines at the moment, and the seemingly soft sentences dished out to the sadists and peadophiles who commit these crimes. I would like as much support as possible to this petition for tougher punishment, to STOP NOW this cruelty and aggression towards children and persons who are unable to defend themselves.  Being a father myself, I am unable to comprehend how any human being can cause harm, pain, suffering, neglect and even death to any human being, let alone the defenceless.  Please please please, lets unite against these monsters and eradicate them from our society forever, if we can save even 1 life then this petition will have been worth it.  Harsher sentences would surely deter the evil beings from committing these crimes.",
