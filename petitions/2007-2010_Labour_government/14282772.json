        "background": "Southeastern Rail is the only operator servicing parts of Kent and the London South-East. Yet, the level of service provided is grossly inadequate to demands. Prices are very high, timetable does not meet the demand, and services are notoriously cancelled for the most trivial of reasons (rain, wind, half an inch of snow, the proverbial leaf on the tracks). Stations are dirty and mismanaged, and staff are completely uninformed about the state of the service and the fares, and are unmotivated to help customers. Announcements about cancellations due to lack of staff or rolling stock are a daily occurance.\n\nAn inquiry should be ordered to find out why this service, so vital to the region, is run so inefficiently, and, if necessary, the mandate to operate the service should be given to a different operator, who can meet the required demand.",
