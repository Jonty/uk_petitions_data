            "background": "Two million people have received inaccurate electricity bills in recent years.  Due to deregulated energy industry's inability to transfer customer information between suppliers due to lack of common data formats. When customers transfer custom, data between user and new supplier needs to be transferred correctly, or as in my relative's case, you receive someone else's bills, meter number & are transferred to another company when they do - in error! Demands for their supply then surmount and 2 years later STILL trying to resolve.  \nThe Prime Minister and Government should take action to protect its energy consumers, when electric companies customer service/complaints depts/energy watchdogs are woefully inadequate in my experience.",
