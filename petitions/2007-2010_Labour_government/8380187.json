            "background": "I am a Learning motorist. Of the three of my most dreaded situations on the public highway, the worst is that of hitting, injuring and maybe killing a small, poorly educated child. One who has never been informed of just the reason why it is NOT a good idea to cross the road having not checked for traffic, from behind a parked van. I propose that an hour a week should be spent with ALL school children form the start of the reception period to the end of jr education, studying, and practicing how to use, and understand the road safely. It is my belief that alot of undeserving motorists will be saved the horror of court cases over the death of children, and lives could be saved with this simple application of basic education that frankly should have been introduced years ago.",
