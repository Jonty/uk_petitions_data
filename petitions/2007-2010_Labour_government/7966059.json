            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We the undersigned agree that EU schools that use the term 'British' or 'English' 'School' should do so under license of the UK DFES and EU so that they are meeting the same basic standards of an English operating institute, enforced by OFSTED and supported by the GTC, such as lesson provision, proper support for teachers and NQTS, and also the upholding of the British based profession wherever the associated terms are used.I believe all of these schools need to be inspected by an unbiased and external inspectorate.The vision is for the improvement of standards in EU schools that use our National Curriculum or GCSEs for both the students and teachers that deliver the curriculum.",
