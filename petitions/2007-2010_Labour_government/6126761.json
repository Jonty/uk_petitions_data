            "background": "Currently, at the age of 18 it is possible to gain a license to drive a bus, and be responsible or the saftey of upward to one hundred people.\n\nAnd yet to drive a taxi, and be responsible for the safe transportation of a maximum of five (excluding people carriers) you need to be 21.\n\nWhy the age gap?  If the individual is eighteen or over, and has held a driving license for a year, then why can't he or she be allowed to gain a taxi badge?  It is impractical to be able to gain a PCV license at 18--quite plainly, buses seem much harder to operate than taxis--but to have to wait until 21 for a taxi badge?\n\nCurrently, Northern Ireland allow for drivers of 18 and older to apply for a taxi badge, why can't this system be applied to the mainland.  For many drivers aged 18-20, it would be a furfilling and practical job to be able to take, thanks to its flexiable hours and working enviroment.",
