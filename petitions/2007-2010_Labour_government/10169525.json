        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Because of the excessive packaging on goods across the board including food products and all household items our council taxes keep rising every year, councils have to recycle all our rubbish at the cost of the tax payer so if the supermarket giants were to be held responsible and incurred fines for excessive packaging then the waste which inevitably ends up in landfill sites polluting the environment would be significantly reduced, thus saving money and valuble resources. With the threat of imposing fines we would all be saving money and stop the unneccesary rubbish which is rotting around our countryside.",
