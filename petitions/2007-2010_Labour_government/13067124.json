        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The opportunity to apply for UK identity cards should be made available to Ex-patriot British Citizens who are not currently resident in the UK but are resident in the EU.\n\nBritish Citizens who are Spanish residents were denied a Spanish EU identity card after changes in legislation in 2007 and there are apparently no plans to issue Ex-pats with UK ID cards.\n\nWe feel this is discriminatory as citizens of other member states who are not residing in their own country still have ID cards.\n\nWhen British Nationals begin to be issued their ID cards and subsequently move to another EU member state will their cards be taken away from them? \n\nWe Britsh who currently work and live in other EU countries are likely to end up in administrative limbo as newcomers arrive with ID cards and we do not have them.\n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to look into the feasibility of issuing said cards from at the least Embassies or better still Consulates.\nThankyou.",
