            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "During the 2007/8 academic session it came to the attention of the DIUS that student prisoners were receiving full funding for study. As student prisoners are already housed at the tax payers expense they do not need the cost of living element, therefor the DIUS took the decision to rescind entitlement to all elements of funding. Unfortunately this includes entitlement to the loan for tuition fees. Therefore any serving prisoner is no longer entitled to any element of funding for any academic session that is spent wholly or partly in prison. Meaning, for example, that if a person is released from prison on the 17th September and wants to start a degree, they would have to wait until the following academic year to be entitled to funding. It also means that no serving inmate can study for a degree unless they can personally fund it via an alternative source. In addition current students who are serving a prison sentence have had their funding rescinded and will not receive any further support. Once they are released they will be able to continue with their studies but will have 1 year of funding taken into account under the previous study rules.",
