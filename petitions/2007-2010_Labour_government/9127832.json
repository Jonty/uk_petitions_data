            "background": "The royal mint claims the new coin design represents ALL nations of the UK, however, Wales is not represented in the Royal coat of arms and therefore is not represented in the new coin design. This is discriminatory and an insult to the Welsh nation. The new coin designs should immediately be reviewed to include symbols of all FOUR countries of the UK.\n\nA search of the website found no similar petitions, so no overlap or duplication exists. The only other petitions related to brittania, and they had all been rejected. No other petition exists specifically looking at representation of the Welsh nation on the new coin design.",
