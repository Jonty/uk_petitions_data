It is ludicrous and ubelievable that they are being denied the right to settle in this country, and have to go through the immigration procedures, when we allow people of other countries in without question. This country owes a debt of gratitude to these brave soldiers and the least this government can do is to ensure that they are treated equally with other members of the armed forces on pay, pensions and settlement.",
