            "background": "Spouses and dependants of serving F&C citizens though not being on active service endure more mental anguish and stress than imaginable. Presently, they are treated like second rated citizens. The current rules are that once the serving soldier has successfully gained citizenship, dependants will generally be able to obtain Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK 2 years after their serving spouse or civil partner has been naturalised as a British citizen. Once they have obtained ILR, they too may apply for naturalisation providing they have by that stage been resident in the UK for at least 3 years. Surely, their naturalisation should not be a privilege but a right.",
