            "background": "Gordon Brown -not chosen by the citizens of the UK to be Prime Minister, yet sees himself being in a position to make decisions on our behalf. How can someone make decisions on our behalf when we didn't even choose them to do the job?\nOUR REFERENDUM - important to us - we pay our taxes that pay your wages Mr Brown, therefore, do we not employ YOU and not the other way round? Mr Brown you are not fulfilling what the labour government promised and excuse me if I am wrong but you are still part of the Labour party aren't you? Your decision today about no longer allowing a referendum for the citizens of the UK is yet another broken promise. \nThe undersigned people support me in requesting that the british citizens have their referendum as promised or that you allow the british public to select another person to lead us, for us to employ a leader who can lead the UK into the future, a person who is proud to be british and have faith in their fellow countrymen. To allow the UK to be the UK with it's rights respected, to give the british citizen a UK to be proud of instead of ashamed of.\nI ask you the british public to support this petition or lose the UK forever.",
