This is an obvious example of the government being duped and the taxpayer being taken advantage of for personal gain by privileged individuals and must be stopped.  All taxpayer funds must IMMEDIATELY be withdrawn from HBOS.  If HBOS goes under as a result, then shareholders can blame it on the party!",
