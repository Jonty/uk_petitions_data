            "background": "Set targets by all means necessary for all persons to be using self surficiant energy in every home, business or buildings in Great Britain by 2020\n\n1) By using Solar, wave, wind, tidal or hydro power, and to be constantly updating, looking into new and better ways. \n\n2) To be free forever for everyone, starting with the poorest first \n\n3) Companies like British gas & EDF will eventually have to close due to irrelevance or will have to change\n\n4) It would cost around \u00a310 trillion, but by cutting services such as the armed forces and presents in illegal wars, not letting any more people through our borders, managing the population better we could do this\n\nIn 2009, the UK government announced that all homes in Britain were to be brought into line with requirements to reduce the amount of energy we used by 2030. The plans are intended to help cut down the amount of money we all spend on fuel bills and to reduce our carbon footprint and targets that a quarter of all homes in the UK will have the energy makeover by 2020 and the rest by the final deadline of 2030. By 2020, this will enable the country as a whole to reduce the carbon footprint of households by 33% - this is not good enough and unacceptable",
