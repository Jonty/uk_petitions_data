        "background": "The fact that there is a large proportion of the budget being either given or proportioned to exterior beings rather than focused on how the homeland security forces (police etc) are being supported is a gross negligence to the people of this great nation.  The fact that many police roles that are not needed are being given to finding one person who may be dangerous, or giving other countries money to help when they have had a flood when our own are obviously inadequate, is a travisty of our country and our people.  Why should the people who fund this country through either rates paid, donations given or pure hard work be sold short to appeal to the international community?  What country has offered us aid in this time of crisis for so many of our population.  If media and goverment comment is to be beleived none yet our populace is the first to offer aid to others.  Whay cannot this goverment see that some of these funds must be redirected to make sure we remain a kingdom united and not just a country of opposed forces",
