Funds from the Government simply are not in place or have they been side-swiped in our network of quangos?  Perhaps the Government could contact real small business owners/sole traders through Customs and Excise and reach real people, find out their problems.",

When I try and get help from trade associations etc. you are met with the usual \"Quango\" syndrome.  The Banks are acting like stuck pigs.  I think there are many people in a situation like me  ... late 50's early 60's .... cannot afford to retire ..... not enough work ...... not a member of an ethnic society etc. etc.",
