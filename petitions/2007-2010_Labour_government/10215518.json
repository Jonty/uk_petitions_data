THERE IS ONE POINT WE MUST EMPHASIZE THAT BIG INVESTMENT IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION MUST BE ACCOMPANIED WITH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION LIKE PATENTS REGISTRATION TO ENCOURAGE ENTHUSIASTIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. WITH A VIEW TO OUR WIDE RANGE OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, I THINK THAT THE PATENTS WOULD BE FLOURISHING SO MANY THAT THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE PATENT OFFICE WOULD HAVE TO BE IMPROVED MUCH TO SUIT SUCH FLOURISHING AND BOOMING. YES, WE ARE BUILDING THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND THE WORLD. LEGISLATIONS OF ALL FIELDS WOULD HAVE TO BE KEPT REVISING FOR NEW CHALLENGES OF ALL FIELDS. OF COURSE, WE WOULD INVEST AFTER FEASIBILITY BE DONE VERY WELL.     THANKS!\n\n            KARL AND ANNA AND FAMILY",
