            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Childrens playgrounds have become a Health and safety nightmare when it comes to developing. As a child I remember a time when Playgrounds/Parks for children were fun, there were risks involved in playing on the equipment but never any really serious accidents happened. Today playgrounds are less fun for children and teenagers to play in. Changing the law will give more interesting equipment for them to play on, plus decreasing the amount of youths on the streets with nothing more to do than break the law and become antisocial. All parks should have sign's thus saying \"the public use this area at their own risk\" and more interesting equipment like the old \"witches hat\" should be brought back in to playgrounds to attract those young thrill seekers.",
