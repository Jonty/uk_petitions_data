        "background": "Britain has not paid any amount to the Republic of Cyprus, adding that this failure to pay ''amounts to a violation of the Treaty of Establishment on behalf of the British side.'' House President Demetris Christofias, speaking at the plenary session, expressed the general wish of all political forces for the dissolution of the British Bases in Cyprus, adding that the issue must be examined in depth and be decided on collectively. ''We do not exercise sovereignty on the Bases' territory. We question, rightly, the sovereignty on behalf of the British on the Bases,'' he added. Christofias said ''we certainly want the dissolution of the Bases, but how and when and the rest we must look into responsibly, for the financial issues and everything, and for the issue of sovereignty, because we do not exercise sovereignty, they claim that they have the sovereignty, so these things must be clarified.''",
