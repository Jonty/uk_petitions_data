        "background": "My grandparents' water meter is underneath some communal shrubs outside their front door. So when they get a bill, they have to wait until a younger relative visits to read the meter for them. It's impossible to read the meter as it's about 1.5 metres below the ground and when it rains, the meter gets covered in dirty water. My grandparents have contacted the waterboard to make sure the meter is read by one of their meter readers, but this doesn't happen 100% of the time. \n\nThere are many people who have water meters underground which are impossible to read. Either install them somewhere where it can be read or get meter readers to do the impossible meters. It makes me sick thinking how much some people are overpaying their waterboard because they are unable physically (movement and/or eyesight) to read it.",
