        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We would like HM Government to set-up a Parking Ticket Authority to monitor that all Councils and Independent Car Parking Companies are not over exceeding there authoirty in setting fines for infringment of their services. We beleive that the General Public should be given more freedom and that the regulatory authority should have the final say in the decision if the Parking Ticket should stand.\n\nOne instance of parking fines being unfair, is that if the ticket has fallen on the floor by wind catching it, you will be given a parking fine.  You are unable to appeal until the second fine has come through. ie the fine has doubled.  This should not be allowed.  If the fine is not turned around you then have to pay double the original fine, which is completely unfair. \n\nThats' why the Parking Ticket Regulatory Authority is needed so the general public can present there case to the Regulatory Authority for a non-biased verdict.",
