        "background": "As a single mum and working full time it is expensive to send my daughter to nursey as it is, but havin to pay for childcare costs on bank holidays and staff training days,  i think as goverment you are making  a profit out of parents. You as a goverment are all for working parents but at the same time penalising us. Many parents are on low incomes and having to find additional funding for school holidays results in struggling with finances.",
