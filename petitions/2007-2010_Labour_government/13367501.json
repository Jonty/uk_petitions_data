        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The tar sands are killing our planet and quite possibly our people too. Burning natural gas to extract crude oil from the bitumen in the tar sands generates up to three times the greenhouse gas emissions as conventional oil and gas production does. Today, crude oil production from the tar sands generates 27 million tonnes of GHG annually. But now, tar sands production is expected to multiply as much as four to five times by the year 2015 to meet growing demands. As a consequence, conservative estimates show that greenhouse gas emissions from the tar sands could well leap from 27 to 126 million tonnes by 2015. \n\nAs a democratic country committed to tackling climate change we should make a stand against these disgusting places - something must be done to reduce production of oil from the tar sands, and eventually close them down for good.",
