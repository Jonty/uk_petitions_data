            "background": "The British economy is under enormous strain with the rising cost of living caused in part by the credit crunch and the rising cost of oil. In 2007 the big four oil companies generated \u00a359.5 billion in profit, substantially more than in 2006. We urge the Government to curtail this profiteering at the expense of the already suffering British economy immediately and keep those billions in the hands of the public and industry.",
