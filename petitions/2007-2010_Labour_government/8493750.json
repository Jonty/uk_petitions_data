        "background": "After Caroline Flints ill thought out outburst and for her demonstrating that she is not in touch with reality, now that does she hold any experience in this field.  Such irresponsible kite flying should not be made exploiting vulnerable people.  Shouldn\u2019t the Housing Minister concentrate upon improving the run-down council estates and improving services, not to mention addressing the thousands of children living in horrendous conditions as priorities?  Her recent attempts to avoid such responsibilities must demonstrate that Caroline Flint is not fit for purpose.",
