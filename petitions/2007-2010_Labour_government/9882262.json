            "background": "A recent proprosal would force unmarried mothers to name their baby's father on the birth certificate, unless the mother and child are deemed vulnerable. The penalty for refusing is a \u00a3200 fine.\nIf a father walks out on a mother and baby in the early stages of childhood or in pregnancy, why should a mother be forced into naming the father on the birth certificate, and therefore having to share parental responsibility with someone who clearly does not want it.\nMothers should be allowed to raise their children in a way they feel best, and not be forced into a situation where they must compromise their child's wellbeing by having to satisfy an administrative need to name both parents on a birth certificate.",
