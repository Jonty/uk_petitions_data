            "background": "Minki and Jenny two Standard Poodles have been in police custody since 1st June 2007. They are being held as \u201cevidence\u201d under suspicion of sheep worrying. They have been held at a secret location, with infrequent access to a groomer, and virtually non-existent access to their owners. For a dog approximately 52 days is equal to a human year; which is a very long time when nothing has been proved, and proceedings are progressing very slowly. These dogs are cherished family pets, who have been taken and withheld from their family. Dogs and humans are suffering needlessly, and should be reunited as soon as possible.",
