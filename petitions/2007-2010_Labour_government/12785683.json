            "background": "I propose a reduction in airport tax for people who off-set the CO2 emissions of the flight they take.  This would have two beneficial elements to it: it encourages people to off-set their carbon emissions from flights, which are large, aiding the U.K. in meeting its goals in reducing the effects of carbon emissions, helping the nation to reach the targets set in the Kyoto treaty and other pacts; cheapening to cost of flying, stimulating the travel industry economy during these troubled times",
