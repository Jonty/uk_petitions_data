These are safe, friendly and neutral places where children of separated families can spend time with one or both parents and sometimes other family members. They are child-centred environments that provide toys, games and facilities that reflect the diverse needs of children affected by family breakdown. \n\nNACCC has an endorsed accreditation process which shows that all NACCC centres work to agreed and approved national standards ensuring that families using the centres are safe and well cared for. \n\nNACCC offers a range of support services to its membership including a telephone helpline, training, specialist advice and support for new centres, good practice manual, publicity materials and a CRB disclosure service. \n\nNACCC also provides a voice for Child Contact Centres, promoting their role with national and regional decision makers.",
