So every time they make an error in an assessment no compensation for costs or interest or damages consequential or otherwise are available.\nCurrently the lower courts have no jurisdiction over the CSA or Sec of State. this should change so the CSA are responsible for their assessments and actions and individuals can recover costs and damages\nThe only redress is to the High Court or European Court of Human rights.\nA change in the legislation is urgently required.",
