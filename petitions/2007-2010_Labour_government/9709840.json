        "background": "Apparently our TV licence fee is now wasted on part (up to 40%) of the cost of staging this fiasco.  \n\nIt is likely that we would be asked to withdraw from future competitions, this will be no loss.  \n\nOur only 'benefit' is to avoid a qualification round, and the funds could be better spent improving cultural links with the rest of the world.\n\nThe 'contest' result is now predictable even before hearing a song: the voting, which was always suspect, has become more obviously partisan.  The Eastern and Balkan countries (many not European) consistently vote for their neighbours and major trading partner. \n\nPresumably the cost of a 'phone vote is much less in the old Soviet empire (if indeed this is the method used there?)\n\nThere is virtually no chance of a winner from Western Europe so let's follow the lead of other Western states and stop.",
