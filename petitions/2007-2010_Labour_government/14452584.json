This ruling will, effectively, lead to many legal claims by Greek Cypriots wishing to seize the assets and properties of many people in Europe and, especially, here in the U.K. Yet again, the EU and our so-called UK Guarantor Power, has shown the world their true colours, by  completely ignoring the human rights of the Turkish Cypriot people. We have been treated in an unequal and unjust manner for far too long and enough is enough!",
