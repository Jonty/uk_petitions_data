            "background": "Many carers have to travel either to and from person they care for , with them or on there behalf. Some (although it would apear not all) disabled people have travel for free or at concesionary rates. Carers do not have a high income and travel costs are another burden on already over streached pockets. The government does not pay min wage to carers (at least 35 hrs for 50.50)  This could be a real help to carers who provide help for others. Personnally I spend \u00a321.50 a week on travel as a min out of the \u00a372.00 total I get (carers allowance + income support) it is a large lump to find. My caring role makes it impossible to take on extra work. As most will know it is impossible to know when you will have free time as disabiltie's do not run to a diary of only happening on a said 35 hrs. 'Free time' is the time you snatch in well moments. Help those helping others in a real way.",
