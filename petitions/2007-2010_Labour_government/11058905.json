I would like to re-train in another trade like plumbing or electrician, but at the age of 36 can find no free training, i cant afford to pay for training so im forced to look for employment in manufacturing which is shedding jobs not creating them.Its a vicious circle.\nMake re-training FREE for ALL those of ALL ages who have been made redundant and have not found suitable employment within 6 weeks.",
