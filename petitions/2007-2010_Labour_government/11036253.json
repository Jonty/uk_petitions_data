            "background": "We request that the Prime Minister, forces the energy companies to reduce energy prices in line with current costs of fuel, by offering them the simple choice to reduce bills or face a windfall tax of over 50% of their profits.  It is absurd at this time, that the British Government is standing by whilst the economy slips into recession, borrowing money to give us tax cuts - we would have more money in our pockets this winter, if the fuel bills were lower! And our children would not be burdened with the cost of this borrowing as they grow up.",
