            "background": "Peaceful marches by monks chanting prayers turned into the SPDC's thugs insulting and beating monks, as if they were ordinary people or animals. As a result, tens of thousands of monks have refused to accept any donations from military personnel.\n\nThe objectives of these peaceful marches are: \n\n(1) For all Burmese people to be able to live comfortably and without oppression. (2) To release all political prisoners including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n(3)  For national reconciliation \n\nDuring these peaceful marches, the monks are reciting \u201cMetta Sutta\u201d (discourse on loving-kindness \n\nHowever, the violent military regime and its thugs used live ammunition on peaceful demonstrators. Monks and innocent civilians have reportedly been killed by regime troops. \n\nThis incidence is not the answer that will resolve current problems in Burma. Despite the request by the world to the regime to exercise restraint, the stubborn SPDC keep dealing with things in their own way, the only way they have known since 1988.\n\nTherefore, we would like to appeal the UK government to intervene to stop the shooting of and violence against innocent and peaceful demonstrators.",
