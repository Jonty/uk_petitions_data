            "background": "It is well recognised that many parents invest in out of hours tutoring or pay for a Public school place for their children. Many times it is cited that Public schools provide better quality education and better discipline. The number of pupils in each class enables this to happen. State education needs classes of twenty or less at Junior age and fifteen or less at infant age in order to improve the quality of children's experience at school. At a time when parents/carers have less time to spend with their children due to long working hours, many children seek the attention they crave through disruptive behaviour. This measure would help achieve improved behaviour and educational standards.\nFurthermore, it would help reduce teacher workload and the numbers of teachers leaving through yet more initiatives aimed at solving these problems but ultimately doomed to failure.",
