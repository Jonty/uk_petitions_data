If race was irrelevant then there would be no need to state a colour what so ever.\nWho knows more on the London streets? New comers? or people who have lived here all their lives?\nThis is not to say that new immigration cannot apply for these jobs if they wish to pursue this career path. There is no need to degrade the white English that do apply for these jobs or stop them from doing jobs they want to do because of the colour of their skin.",
