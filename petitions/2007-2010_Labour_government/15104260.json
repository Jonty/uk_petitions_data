            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The way National Insurance contributions are currently structured is inherently unfair. Earnings upto around \u00a344,000 per annum attract deductions of 11%. Above this amount, the Upper Earnings Limit, there is only a 1% deduction. Therefore, someone earning \u00a350,000 would pay only 1% on the \u00a36,000 above \u00a344,000. In simple terms, this means those earning around \u00a350,000 pay the same proportion of their salary in National Insurance contributions as those earning \u00a325,000, whilst Premiership footballers, bankers, et al, earning \u00a3500,000+ pay only around twice that of those earning \u00a350,000. Rather than imposing the additional 1% tax on everyone earning over \u00a35700 per year, it seems fairer and more sensible to remove the upper limit for high earners.",
