        "background": "The Government claim to be \"pro-business\" and \"pro-entrepreneur.\"  However, IR-35 penalises professionals who have identified a gap in the market and have taken advantage of this.  This is the classical definition of an entrepreneur.  They are not tax evaders, as they all either become incorporated and so pay both dividend tax on director's fees, National Insurance employer and employee rates and PAYE on their taxable income; or they pay the full NI employee rates and full PAYE on all earnings.\n\nSo why try to attach a contractor, who does not benefit from a company's holiday, medical, pension or other employee schemes, to a company just because they have worked for that organisation for more than 2 years?\n\nAttaching such professionals to an organisation that has requested their services for a specific period of time, without any employee benefits, is not fair - one of the core values to any tax system.",
