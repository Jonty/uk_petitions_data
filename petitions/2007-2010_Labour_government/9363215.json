            "background": "To declare where all the  money raised in taxes is going in the form of a balance sheet available to all. Include how much  money leaves England in the form of aid and to where.   I fear that these days we are 'punching more than our weight'.  Companies have to do it so why not Governments. Taxes of one sort or another are continually rising out-stripping any income and  dimishing living standard.   Suicides occur, marriages and families are broken, debts cause misery to many families.   Those in control appear to have no knowledge of the living standards of those who are retired or on low incomes.   They make no effort to prevent or deal with fuel poverty or effectively control other local authority taxes. What is wrong with a one tax for everything on the ability to pay, or is that just too logical.   Money saved by removing civil servants alone, would help end the misery of many thousands of vulnerable people and centralise the tax system under the control of the Inland Revenue, who already have the information on everybody to carry out this task.",
