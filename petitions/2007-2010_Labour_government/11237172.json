            "background": "It is widely reported in the mass media, quoting the spokesperson for multi-national supermarkets that they will continue to sell alcoholic products as part of their loss leader sales strategy. In many cases it is reported that \"alcohol is being sold cheaper than water by supermarkets\". Clearly this cannot be right and at least is an irresponsible and reprehensible action by the mutli-nationals. I would further suggest that any supermarket promoting alcohol in this manner is not a responsible licencee and should have its licence to sell alcohol suspended for a minimum of 12 months.",
