            "background": "Small and medium sized businesses form approximately 65% of UK Gross Domestic Product (according to Government figures).  The current economic climate with rising oil prices, and the impact this has, will impact small and medium sized business to a much higher degree than larger business.  The Government should do more to ensure that Britain's economy is equipped to survive the economic crisis that is looming by ensuring that small and medium sized businesses are supported adequately to avoid mass losses of these life bloods of the British economy by lowering fuel taxation for businesses, reducing the hefty payload of pointless legislation and by creating the right environment for MORE small and medium sized businesses to open up.  More small/medium sized businesses in Britain equals a more sustainable economy.",
