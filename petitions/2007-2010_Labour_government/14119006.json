        "background": "Gary McKinnon is a gentle, sensitive individual who wouldn't hurt a fly. He was fascinated by UFOs, and on a web search for more information about extra-terrestials, stumbled into classified areas of U.S. military and NASA computers. Entry to some of the supposedly classified sites did not even require a password. He faces ten serious charges of 'computer hacking' and a seventy year jail sentence in the U.S.A.  Gary committed his so called 'crime' in Britain.  Gary's trial should take place in a British Court. Why are our politicians giving in to bullying demands from some U.S. officials to extradite Gary McKinnon to an American prison to await trial? It shows a ruthless lack of compassion for a vulnerable adult who intended no harm to anyone. The terror of life in an American jail has been hanging over Gary's head for the better part of a decade. Allowing Gary McKinnon's extradition will weaken the autonomy of the British judicial system and erode our civil rights.",
