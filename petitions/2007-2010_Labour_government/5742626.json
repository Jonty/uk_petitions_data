        "background": "Currently, anyone above the age of 16 is classified as an adult when it comes to ticketing at many leisure venues. This is unfair as a huge number of 16 year olds and indeed young people still in education do not earn money. It is therefore unfair, in my opinion, to classify our Country's in-training Future the same amount to leisure venues as earning patrons. It seems that 16-21 year olds are only regarded as adults when more money can be made from them. This needs to change.",
