            "background": "Why is it that we can travel to the European mainland and buy tobacco goods at a fraction of the cost in the UK, eg 50 gram packet tobacco in the UK costs nearly \u00a312 but in Belgium it costs \u00a34.\n\nThis would also negate the need for Customs officers trying to stop smuggling\n\nThis would not only bring money in to the UK economy but would mean that it would make it less attractive for criminals as well.",
