So far we have had 25,000,000 sets of names and personal details being lost or stolen, illegal immigrants being granted NI numbers, illegal immigrants being put in charge of processing immigration paperwork and the list goes on.\n\nIt was reported Tuesday 19th February's Metro that senior officials from HM Revenue and Customs are to receive bumper bonus payments of \u00a323,000,000, up by nearly 25% on the year before.  For a department that has shown the level of incompetence as this one this wholly is unacceptable.",
