In November this year the Chief Executive of RBS promised to pass on the recent cut in the bank of england base rate to all of its customers.  This was a lie.  In fact, thousands of customers of the Virgin oneaccount have not seen rate reductions as promised, only 1% of the rate cut was passed on, and that a month after the base rate cut.  No response has been heard from the Bank on the recent 1% rate cut.  This petition requests the Prime Minister intervene in a bank which we the people control and insist that they honour their promises.",
