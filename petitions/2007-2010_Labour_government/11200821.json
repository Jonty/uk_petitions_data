        "background": "The Virgin Oneaccount is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, a bank that of course is now state controlled.  In November this year the Chief Executive of RBS promised to pass on the recent cut in the bank of england base rate to all of its customers.  This was a lie.  In fact, thousands of customers of the Virgin oneaccount have not seen rate reductions as promised, only 1% of the rate cut was passed on, and that a month after the base rate cut.  No response has been heard from the Bank on the recent 1% rate cut.  This petition requests the Prime Minister intervene in a bank which we the people control and insist that they honour their promises.",
