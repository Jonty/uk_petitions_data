            "background": "Dear Sir,  We already have a National Shooting ground, just why can that not be used. With the input of a mere Million or perhaps 2 Bisley could become World Class in all respects. The ranges are already in place, new equipment has been in place since the floods of a couple a years ago. There is a Main Line Rail Link not more than a Half Mile away. A very close link to the M2/M3/ M4 and M25. There is a vast area that can be used for parking for\nthose that wish to drive to the venue.\nTo to expend Millions on a venue that\nwill, if information is correct, be demolished on completion of this event, appears to be an utter and complete waste of resources.",
