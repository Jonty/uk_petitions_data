            "background": "I have been the victim of 2 violent racial attacks. I have also been victim of race discrimination, harrasment and assault by Police officers in the Dyfed Powys Police force. There is no support from the Commission for Racial Equality. One cannot afford solicitors fees. The independant Police complaints authority are not independant. So basically us minority groups have knowhere to turn resulting in being continually a victim of race hate and crime. I urge the Government to address this issue and give support to individuals so they have the legal support they need.\nThere are now many non Welsh people settling in this area and race crime is becoming nearly an every day occurence",
