            "background": "Vehicle Fuel Duty should be split into two components, one refundable and one not.\n\nThe value of the refundable component, x pence per litre, will define the target fuel efficiency level, the target mpg. Motorists that achieve the target mpg, over the course of a year, will get a full refund of this component. Those who exceed the target will make a profit and those who fall short will make a loss.\n\nInitially the combined value of the two components should not exceed the current level of Fuel Duty.",
