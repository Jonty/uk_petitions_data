            "background": "Many inner city gardens (front and rear) are being paved over, either to create parking spaces or patios, and this is causing flooding, as well as removing green spaces.  I propose a system of tax rebates for ground not paved over (or covered in decking) with extra rebates for trees in the garden on a sliding scale according to height.  Obviously care must be taken to avoid light-blocking etc.",
