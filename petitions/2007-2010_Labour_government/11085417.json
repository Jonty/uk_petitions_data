            "action": "introduce a fairer system of road tax by scrapping the current annual charge and putting it on fuel.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current system of road charging is unfair in many ways but most particularly in the way it penalises people who, do not use the roads very much but who, nonetheless, need their cars to get about because of the poor public transport service. \n\nThe proposed method of charging would make the people who use the roads most pay more (and what fairer system is there than that).  Those who have large gas guzzling vehicles will also pay more.  It could also lead to more responsible driving as people cut their speeds and change their driving habits to save fuel; although this I doubt.\n\nFurthermore, there would be no way that people can escape paying for their use of the roads, as happens today.  People who go on the roads without paying their road tax generally don't have insurance, or, properly serviced vehicles. These people are a menace to other road uses.\n\nWith little ingenuity, it would also be possible for insurance to be collected and a certificate displayed on the windscreen, say, as it is done in France.",
