            "background": "Having been involved in a car accident with an uninsured driver hitting me from behind I have discovered that the way the UK deals with car insurance is dated & ineffective.In the UK there is no way of identifying if a driver has car insurance when exchanging details.In some cases the other driver will be uninsured.\nI propose that we introduce the introduction of proof of car insurance in the UK by enforcing (by Law) the display of a car insurance disc in the windscreen of every vehicle showing the expiry date for insurance and the names of the drivers who are insured.I also propose to make it law to carry a booklet of detachable car insurance slips in your vehicle to exchange in the event of an accident.If the other driver is unable to provide this information then it will allow innocent law abiding drivers like myself to identify the driver is uninsured.At this point we can contact the police at the scene of the accident and prosecute the driver.This will also deter uninsured drivers.",
