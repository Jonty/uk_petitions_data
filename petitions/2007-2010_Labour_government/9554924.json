            "background": "To put into context, I drove today up the M6 at 70 mph for 1 hour. Including HGV's I passed a total of 33 vehicles. In the same hour 147 vehicles passed me. With such an openly flaunted law it begs the question why?. I concluded people drive at a speed which they believe is safe and within the limits of the road conditions, their ability and that of the vehicle. The 70 mph limit (introduced in 1965) needs to be changed to reflect current motoring conditions.",
