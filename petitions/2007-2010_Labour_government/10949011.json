        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Imagine the situation: Its the 3rd or March. You come home from work and find a letter addressed to the home occupier from a bank that you have no dealings with.  The letter states that the bank is reposessing the house in 12 days time.\n\nYou have just paid a months rent to your landlord.  and now you find out that your tenancy agreement is more use as toilet paper than as a protector of your right to a roof over your head.\n\nYour landlord fell behind in the mortgage, and is being reposessed.  The house will be taken by the mortgage company and you will be evicted by bailifs in 12 days time. How is the average renter going to obtain an additional months rent and a deposit for a new house in 11 days?\n\nIt is morally right to protect the innocent in this situation by changing the law to require the bank to provide 2 months notice to tennants, and for the bank to receive rents direct from the tennant during the notice period.\n\nIt protects the tennant. It protects the bank and its shareholders.\n\nIt is morally the right thing to do.",
