It covers all tastes and has a wide ethnic background.\n\nWhile many pieces of music are famous for a short time. When there popularity fades there is a danger of it being lost. How many classical composers can you name?\n\nThe archive and museum could be a repository for written and recorded music and could have areas for studying and performing music.\n\nThere are many locations which would be suitable and might generate money for the local area.\n\nA national music archive and museum would be a welcome cultural addition to this country.",
