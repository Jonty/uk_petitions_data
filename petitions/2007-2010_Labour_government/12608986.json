The cross-party nature of this scandal shows that simply disciplining MPs cannot restore full public confidence in Parliament, but a general election will allow the public to have their say on whether their MP can be trusted with the power given to them by the people. An election should take place as soon as possible, to allow the public to have full confidence that their MP is working for the constituents, rather than themselves.",
