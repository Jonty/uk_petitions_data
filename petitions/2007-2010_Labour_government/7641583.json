            "background": "FOR over half a century one of Plymouth's most senior citizens has devoted his life campaigning for the people of Devonport and Plymouth.\n\nHe led the campaign to pull down the Berlin style wall around Western Europe's biggest naval dockyards, that so blighted the post war community of the ancient town of Devonport.\n\nHe led the civic fight to restore Mount Wise Pools for a deprived community to enjoy outdoor swimming. He fought for the restoration of Tinside Lido, Drake's historic Reservoir. Where England's first fresh water leat brought water to the centre of Plymouth.\n\nIn his twi-light years he is still passionately campaigning for the people of Plymouth with his wise, historic counsel.\n\nMany ordinary Plymothians in Devon's biggest city feel it is time Eric Johns was honoured by HM the Queen for his dedication, loyalty and service to the people of Plymouth.\n\nGiving him an honour would be indeed a popular and right move to make by the PM Mr Gordon Brown.",
