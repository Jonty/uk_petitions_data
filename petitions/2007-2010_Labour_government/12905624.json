        "background": "Teachers in England will need licences to work in the classroom which will have to be renewed every five years, under government plans.\n\nThe proposal, intended to weed out weak teachers, is included in an education White Paper announced by Children's Secretary Ed Balls. \n\nI agree about weak teachers being a problem in the education system, however I also feel that this is what Continued Professional Development is for. \nI do think that it undermines the ability of the teachers and the universities that have provided the education to develop the teachers of the future. Surely ofsted is something that keeps us in line already and identifies areas of concern?\n\nPlease sign the petition to show that you disagree with these proposals.",
