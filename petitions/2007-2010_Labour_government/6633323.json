            "background": "It is not only people who have to pay inheritance tax who are not able to pass on their hard earned assets to their children - this is happening every day when the ederly are forced to have to go into residential care because of ill-health and are paying exhorbitant fees which will swallow up the whole of any money they have worked and saved for all their lives.  With fees ranging from \u00a3300 to \u00a31000 a WEEK it doesn't take long for any inheritance to be completely used up.  I'm sure that my parents worked hard not only for themselves but because they thought they would leave something to their children.  My mother is now in residential care as she suffers from dementia and the money from her modest flat will probably last a few years at the most.  We need a ruling such as they have in Scotland that if a person needs residential care they should not be charged for it.",
