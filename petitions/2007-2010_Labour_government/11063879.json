            "background": "On a the DSA website, this statement was made about motorcycle and moped users: \"This user group has been identified as having a high risk of injury or death\"... In most of these cases, it is not down to the way the motorcyclist was riding, it is the ignorance of other road users. \nI believe that the Practical test for Driving should be just as hard to pass as the new Motorcycle Practical Test. Why should it just be the riders who suffer? Because no matter how safe a rider you are, you always get the other road users in cars, buses lorries etc that don't pay any attention. And then the biker gets the blame when there is an accident...\n\nVisit the DSA website to read the full report.",
