For the 2008 FA Cup Final, Portsmouth and Cardiff fans have been allocated fewer than 25,000 seats each leaving a massive 40,000 seats to \u201cothers\u201d. The last time Portsmouth made it to a FA Cup final was in 1939, for Cardiff it was 1927. It is a travesty that the real fans of both teams are unable to attend the match, not only as it\u2019s probably a once in a lifetime event for many of the fans, but also as it takes from the atmosphere inside the ground when 40,000 people don\u2019t really want to be there.\n\nThe government needs to act, like it did for the broadcasting of competitive games for the national team. We petition the sports minister and the prime minister to act in the interests of the British people and not in the interests of Wembley\u2019s mortgage. Help us save our sport from businesses!",
