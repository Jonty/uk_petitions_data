        "background": "When you try to dial a 0800 number from a mobile phone, you get a recorded message 'access to this number is not free of charge'. Now all of the major mobile networks have made 0800 numbers not part of the inclusive minutes for contract mobile users. There are a few exceptions such as Childline, car breakdown services. For many people, they only have a mobile number. Some are believing they are making a free call, infact it is costing them around 20p a minute. This needs to be stopped or at least companies can give us a geographical number for mobile users for the time being to make a call for a cheaper rate.",
