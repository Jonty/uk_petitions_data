            "background": "i chose not to give my 2year old MMR and will do the same for its booster and for all my other children when the time comes as i have seen adverse reactions and developmental regression commencing immediately after the vaccine and believe the two are closely connected.\ni call for the government if it will not give single vaccines on the NHS, to at least offer a percentage of funding so that low income families like ours can afford seperate vaccines for our children, even though it should be the right of all to choose. i want to protect my children in what I BELIEVE is the safer way but i cant afford it so am left with the choice of the risks of the diseases, the risks of the triple vaccine which i have seen firsthand, or getting into debt, and no country should allow this to happen to its people in a modern world.",
