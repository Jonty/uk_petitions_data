If Harrow Council\u2019s plans go ahead, it will be lost\nbefore the summer of 2008, as a new leisure centre is to be built\nwhere it stands. We are convinced that there is room for the new\ncentre and the skatepark to exist side by side.\nIt has been a breeding ground for talent for nearly thirty\nyears and must be left for us to enjoy for many years to come.\nThere\u2019s no time to lose.\nIf we act now, we can save our skatepark. THANK YOU!",
