            "background": "Religious Education in schools is incredibly bias, children are drilled with the information of Christianity from a young age even though Christianity is a recent religion, children are not given a choice in what they believe or what they learn, we should remove the problem of forced religion in schools. Religious education should only be available from college level or beyond and allow children to explore all faiths rather than the restricted few.",
