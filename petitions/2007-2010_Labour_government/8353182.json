        "background": "The Government has now withdrawn the analgesic co-proxamol except for special named patients (for whom nothing else works) at their GP's risk. It is NOW clear GPs will NOT take this risk. Tens of thousands of patients are now left in unnecessary pain. DoH should be as good as their word, in Hansard, and issue a Patient Indemnity Form transferring the GP's  risk to the patient, as with anaesthetics. This can be done overnight. Please let it be, and end our agony. Pulse magazine found that 94% of rheumatologists favoured retention.",
