        "background": "I feel that the public have not been made aware of this increase and the fact that it is to go ahead prior to the now phostphoned budget.\nWhen the VAT was lowered from 17.5% to the current 15% fuel duty was increased at the same time by two pence per litre and will not be removed once the VAT duty goes back up to 17.5% in December of 2009.\nThe Right Hon. Gordon Brown PM stated during Prime Minister's Questions on July 16th 2008 ;\n \"In recognition of the problem people face with petrol, we are freezing duty on petrol for the full year.\"\nSo why is it that this increase is coming in less than a year later and during this massive economic crisis that we all face with unemployment now hitting two million and banks being baled out left right and centre.\nThis increase must NOT be allowed go through with the cost of oil decreasing but the cost of living still being  so high. I also feel that the public have been kept completely in the dark on this increase which makes it an unfair increase.",
