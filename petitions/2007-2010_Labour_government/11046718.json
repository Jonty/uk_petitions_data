The fund was granted to set up schemes that help boost skills and create job opportunities. However, the council has spent \u00a324,000 of the fund on Christmas lights. This petition calls upon the Prime Minister to introduce Government or independent monitoring of Chesterfield Borough Council to ensure it does not get away with this again. We call upon the Prime Minister to make sure Chesterfield Borough Council uses the money for what it was intended for. We welcome the grant of \u00a34.2 million which shows a commitment from the Government to address this serious issue.",
