Please commission the design of a standard format sheet instead of scraps of paper. Some units at present each develop their own, which leads to inconsistency. In my professional experience, the standard of care received by the patient is affected by poor communication particularly in respect of :\n\n1. Diagnosis - especially in terms of common ailments\n \n2. Whether the patient actually knows ! \n\n3. PMH\n\n4. Breaches of confidentiality",
