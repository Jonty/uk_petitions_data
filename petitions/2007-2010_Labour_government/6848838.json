            "background": "Currently, other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, are eligible for free precriptions. Rheumatoid Arthritis is chronic too, requiring life-long and, often numerous, mediations. I am 36 years old and currently have 5x medications treating my condition. Apart from having to suffer this debilitating and painful disease, why do I also have to suffer financially? I am still working (with difficulty but dignity) and paying taxes. There are currently over 360,000 people in the UK with the same fate. Help us!",
