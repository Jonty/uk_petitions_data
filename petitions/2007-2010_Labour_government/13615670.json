            "background": "Horse theft has resently, been on the increase, the media tell us. In the USA, it is discribed as, an epidemic, and new laws are being implimented, as a deterent. Pets and Equines, have in the past, been treated with the same status, as a TV or Video, and because of this, the courts are just giving, a slap on the wrist. It is suggested that the USA's new law, should reflect the pain and anguish of the owner, and the pet, and provisions made, for compensation for emotional distress. In this country 'theft' can earn a 7 year sentence, but it is rare. Police Forces are not trained in specifics, and some list it, as a 'Grey Area' as they are unsure, of the current legislation. It needs to be much clearer,\nand to do this, you will need to lobby, your MP and other interested parties, to set up a Consultation Paper. The thieves need to know, that a far more serious action, will be taken against them, as in the US laws. Please sign my petition, and contact your MP. Thank You",
