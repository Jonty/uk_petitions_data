Just because you can not solve your problems you have to get inocent people into it to solve it for you, Do you think it is fair? You don't go to war and neither of your family members do. Prince Harry went to war and came back straight after knowing he could get killed. All we ask is to solve your own mess and not put British citzens lives in danger because of your arguments with other goverments!!",
