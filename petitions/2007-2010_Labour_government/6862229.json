They are hitting out at the public, who are NOT responsible for any gripes which they may have.\n\nI would love to have the opportunity to spend whatever free time I have, helping to sort, transport and deliver mail, thus helping the public as a whole to maintain normal life. All it needs is a national volunteer organisation to put this into action.\n\nIf postal employees knew that this would happen, it would also be a great incentive for them to co-operate in meaningful talks, rather than walking out.",
