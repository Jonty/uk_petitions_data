        "background": "I think the petition says it all. For my part, I am sick of having my life adversely affected, and my income reduced, by Royal Mail employees striking. They are hitting out at the public, who are NOT responsible for any gripes which they may have.\n\nI would love to have the opportunity to spend whatever free time I have, helping to sort, transport and deliver mail, thus helping the public as a whole to maintain normal life. All it needs is a national volunteer organisation to put this into action.\n\nIf postal employees knew that this would happen, it would also be a great incentive for them to co-operate in meaningful talks, rather than walking out.",
