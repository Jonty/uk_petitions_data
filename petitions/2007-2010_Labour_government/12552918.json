        "background": "I fail to understand how credit card companies, many of whom are banks, are able to dictate extortionate interest rates to struggling UK consumers. Some of the rates quoted are 30% above the base rate, and these entities are able to change the terms of their original contracts at will. Why is there no apparent regulation of these reprehensible activities, which equate to loan shark tactics, complete with intimidating automated telephone messages at unsocial hours and a universal incompetance?",
