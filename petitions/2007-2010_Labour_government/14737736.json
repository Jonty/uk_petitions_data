            "background": "this is the site of the earliest royal dockyard responsible for the construction of over 400 warships. unlike the history visible on the surface in neighbouring greenwich the great dock ,basins, and slipways of deptford lie under a thin screed of concrete. they could easily be opened up and put back into use,for the restoration of historic vessels,for training & education and to trigger a renaissance of ancient and the birth of modern cutting -edge marine skills. this is a protected wharf,a facility that a forward-looking city should seek to preserve .it is unique as the only self-scouring deep water wharf on the upper tidal thames.the existing development proposals will destroy this priceless gem forever.",
