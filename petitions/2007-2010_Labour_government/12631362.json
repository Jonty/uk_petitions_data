He claimed for jobseekers allowance and has been told that becuase he only pays class 2 NI contributions (what the government tell him to pay!)he is not entitled to one penny. Yet asylum seekers can come in to this country and claim benefit. My husband has paid taxes for 30 years. This beggars belief and is totally unfair!I want to know why he can't have a penny and yet people who haven't given anything can claim????",
