            "background": "The claiming of expenses by Members of Parliament should be transparent and accountable. Their salaries and expenses are paid by the tax payer and should be disclosed for all to see how money for exspenses is used.The fiddling of expenses in the Houses of Parliament is rife, fiddling expenses is institutionalised  throughout Westminster, it is the same with M.E.P.expenses. This petition is to call for a law that all Members of Parliament and Government Ministers have to declare every penny they spend on expenses and the employment of staff. These people are taking advantage of their position by exploiting the trust the tax paying public put in them. As the petition scrutinising team seem to be unable to understand my wording I am forwarding a copy of this petition to the Sun and Daily Mail newspapers.",
