            "action": "reform council tax system to system which is just and does not penalize poor people!",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Current system where Council Tax based on property value is not just because\n- it penalizes property extension and improvement\n- currently poor people [most pensioners] must pay 25% or even more of their net income to council while high-earners pays nothing in relation to their income.\n- system is not based on ABILITY TO PAY.\n\nMy petition is to change system to charge some percentage of VAT as Council Tax / local tax.This system has following advantages:\n- people with low income will pay less so they can spend more - this will improve their lives and economy as well.\n- property extension/refurbishment which alters property value will not be penalized by raising taxes. This will boost construction industry as more people will decide to improve their houses!\n- tax is in line with ABILITY TO PAY [less You spend less You pay and vice versa]\n- less administration&much lower cost of collection\n- clear system\n- system will encourage local councils to create better environment to businesses.",
