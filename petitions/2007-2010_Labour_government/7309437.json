            "background": "The WNAA is not funded by the Government - it relies solely on the support of public donations, which, however frequent, slow the operations of the busy life-saving Helicopter and crew! Each month, the WNAA is called out around 110 times for incidents which require the fast response of the highly professional crew based at Coventry Airport. Its costs the WNAA about \u00a3500 to fly one flight - something which could save many lives would be for the government to fund it and allow the life saving work of the fantastic crew to go on.",
