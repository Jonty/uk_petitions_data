It doesn't matter whether they have been in the job for 5 years or 5 minutes - whether they have significant experience or whether they are newly trained - the pay is the same.  There are no ranks to move through so consequently we are slowly losing all of our experienced PCSO's to the regular Police Force.  We appreciate the value of local knowledge the PCSO's gain during their time on a patch and when they are \"lost\" to the regular force, the community pays the price for this loss.  We urge you to consider this at a national level.",
