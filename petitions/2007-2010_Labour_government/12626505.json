        "background": "We ask the Home Office to release full details of all concealed and censored information relating to Unidentified Flying Objects, Extra-Terrestrial technology including anti-gravity, zero-propulsion and free energy technology which has been hidden for years. We ask the home office to be honest and show other nations how truly transparent we will allow ourselves to become to aid humanity. We want all information regarding alien abductions and human implants. \n\nThe disclosure project is doing it's job and now it's time for the British public to do theirs. \n\nAt a time so critical in the development of human life we must learn to share these technologies and open the worlds eyes to the 'Grey' elephants in the room.",
