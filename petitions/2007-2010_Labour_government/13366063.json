            "background": "The WHO has recently ruled that boxes of Co-Codomal tablets be restriced to boxes of 32 tablets. These tablets give great relief to many people suffering from various illnesses. Before the restriction boxes of 100 were on sale at around \u00a35.75 for 100. Now the price has incrased to \u00a34.99 for 32. This causes much financial hardship to the infirm in addition to further unnessecery visits to chemist. Tablets should not be taken above the maximum of 8 per day meaning that 1 box may only last 4 days.",
