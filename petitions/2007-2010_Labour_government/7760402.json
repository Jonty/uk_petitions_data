Help the British people to feel proud to be a part of such a fantastic country, which has seen so many men and women fight wars to keep the country alive and kicking.  Introduce National Anthem singing in school assemblies across the country, as they do in Australia.  Bring back National Service (we don't need more prisons, just more National Service camps). If newcomers don't want to adapt to accepting our British ways and beliefs, then turn them away.",
