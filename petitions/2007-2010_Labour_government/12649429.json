Her Majesty\u2019s Attorney General (2005) per Lord Hope \nthe rule of Law enforced by the Courts is the controlling principle upon our constitution is based \n\ncriminal assets \nProceeds of Crime Act 2002 introduced powers to seize and recover assets is clear and explicit \n\ncomplicity in a crime \nan individual is complicit in a crime if he is aware of its occurrence has the ability to report the crime but fails to do so \nas such the individual effectively allows criminals to carry out a crime despite easily being able to stop them \neither directly or by contacting the authorities thus making him a de-facto accessory to the crime rather than an innocent bystander",
