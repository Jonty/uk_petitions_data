            "background": "Hate parties such as the BNP that want to govern this country need to be stopped. They cause hate among communities and could destroy the morals of society. I understand that in a democracy every party has the right to go into a general election, however in the 21st century these hate parties need to be stopped. We need to make a stand and show the world we are a race blind country. We need to stop them campaigning and handing hate leaflets across the country. Racist parties need to be blocked from having a voice. They fuel terrorism amd fuel racial discrimination. End this in the 21st century of today.",
