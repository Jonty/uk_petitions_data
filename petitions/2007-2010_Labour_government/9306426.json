            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "With his rubbish collected only once a fortnight, Gareth Corkhill's wheelie bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut. \nAnd for that, the father of four finds himself with a criminal record. Magistrates convicted the 26-year-old bus driver after hearing evidence that the lid was four inches ajar, which is against rules to stop bins overflowing.He was ordered to pay \u00a3210 - a week's wages - after he declined to pay an on-the-spot fine imposed by the local council's bin police, who visited him wearing stab-proof vests and carrying photographic evidence of his crime. To add insult to injury he was told to pay a \u00a315 victim surcharge to help victims of violence - despite there being no victim - and threatened with prison if he failed to pay.Rapists, murderers and other violent criminals who have earned a jail sentence rather than a fine are immune from the penalty.If you feel as strongly over this as I do then please sign this petition and lets restore some common sense to our country.You would honestly think that the lunatics have taken over the asylum!",
