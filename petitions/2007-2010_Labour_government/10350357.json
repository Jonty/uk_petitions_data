            "background": "Mr. Brown, Over the past 11 years you have constantly stated that the economy was in better shape than it has ever been in. This is not true. Your government has refused to do anything about the high rate of fuel duty imposed on the electorate. 68% of the cost of 1 litre of petrol is an outrage! Why has your government not introduced a fuel price cap? Your government has mis-spent public money over the 11 years in office and it's time for a change!",
