            "background": "The War Memorials Act of 1923 allows a local authority to add names to a war memorial whether it owns it or not; however, some local authorities will add names and others refuse, this has created a cruel anomaly. \nAn example being one fallen soldier from Ipswich having his name added to the local war memorial but a soldier who died in the same incident who hails from Harlow has had his family's request to have his name added rejected by the local authority. \nWhen the UK has lost so many brave service personnel in recent conflicts and campaigns it is harsh that a local authority should reject them in death when there is no valid reason to refuse the family\u2019s request.",
