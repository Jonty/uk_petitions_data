            "background": "A government review has concluded that the Royal Mint should \u2018mov[e] outside the public sector.\u2019\n\nThis move towards privatisation should be opposed, for several reasons: \n\u2022 the Mint has performed well in the public sector, turning a financial deficit into a \u00a310 million surplus; there is no evidence to suggest that the proposed change would benefit its customers or employees;\n\u2022 it is a world-renowned \u2018brand\u2019, with a 1,000-year history, whose prestige and service standards should not be jeopardised;  \n\u2022 privatisation usually benefits only the companies taking on public sector work, leaving users and taxpayers with a poorer, and costlier, service; \n\u2022 the Mint employs 750 staff in South Wales, an economically deprived area hit hard by the recession; their livelihood could be at risk if a new owner, seeking to boost profits, were to cut back on jobs, pay and conditions, or even transfer the work abroad;  \n\u2022 in a recession, it is unwise to make public services more dependent on private capital.",
