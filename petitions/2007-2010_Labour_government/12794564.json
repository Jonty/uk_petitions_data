That newly appointed members to the Upper Chamber no longer be given a title ie:  Lord; Baroness; Lady etc.  Peers ought to be on a par with the rest of society, not labelled in old fashioned terms which lend themselves to snobbery.  Hopefully this would also ensure that individuals with real skills and sense of service would come forward to serve rather than those seeking an \u2018honour\u2019.\n\nAn end to \u2018automatic\u2019 transfer into the Upper Chamber by certain former MPs.  Each application to be fully considered on merit, not as a \u2018grace and favour\u2019 appointment.",
