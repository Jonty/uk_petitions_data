            "background": "Please change yellow keep school clear road markings, to red keep school clear road markings, for the safety of our children and people who abide by the law, for the safety of our lolly pop men and women who get abuse from people not abiding by the law, who think stopping to drop chilren off, parking on them whilst taking their children into school and some who park on them just because theres no where else to park. If we changed the yellow keep school clear road markings to red keep school clear road markings, it will give the police more power to remove the vehicle, because there is no waiting, stopping or parking on them at anytime, so please help with the safety of our children and children of the future.",
