            "background": "It took me 4 months to get a job, after I was made redundant. I have been to many interviews, assessment centres during that time. Everytime I went to one of these, I never went further. Yet, my former Asian colleagues that were made redundant at the same time all got jobs within six weeks. We have roughly the same length of service in the industry give/take 6 months. This section in the Equality Bill is hypocrital of the act. It's pure racist. Employers and the govt should scrap any targets they have for employing ethnic minorities. People should be employed based on if they are experienced for the job, not for the colour of their skin. How can this be equal?",
