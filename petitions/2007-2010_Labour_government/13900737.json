            "background": "Totally re-write the UK tax laws. Delete any clauses that reduce HMRC income but are a long term drain on finances.\nKeep in clauses that will reduce long term benefit by allowing people not to be a burden on the Exchequer e.g Pensions, private health care.\n\u00a357.5 Billion per annum is being avoided by evasion and negative clauses.\nBy streamlining the system to be easier to manage, revenue would increase through less wastage of bureaucracy and loopholes.\nSee my Newsnight appearance in Politics Pen!!!! Which incidentally got 4 no votes as the idea is too big and numbers to great! How scary is that???\n\nThe Institute of Fiscal Studies published a paper on Tax Evasion in which the Government and HMRC freely admit our laws are too complex, and do not necessarily tighten restrictions, if anything the more complicated the laws, the more loopholes there are for people to dodge taxes.\nIf they can't understand it all what hope do we, the common man, have?",
