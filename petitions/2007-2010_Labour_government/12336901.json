        "background": "It is now apparently inappropriate to expect that elderly people should receive the care they need, or so the Nursing and Midwifery council would have us believe. \nMargaret Haywood has been struck off their register after reporting failures in the care of elderly people at the home she used to work in. \n\nAfter reporting these things to her bosses and after no action had been taken, she decided to make her observations more widespead by reporting them and filming the conditions for the BBC.\n\nThe NMC expect us to believe that patient confidentiality was breached and that this is more reprehensible than the disgusting way these elderly people were being treated.\n\nCome off it NMC, get your act together. You should be applauding her not punishing her. If it was my Grandparents being let down so badly, I would want to know.\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8002559.stm",
