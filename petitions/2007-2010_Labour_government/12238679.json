            "background": "The taxpayers of this country simply cannot afford to continue funding the criminal activities of BBC employees which causes Ofcom to impose huge fines against the people who have paid the BBC Licence Tax.  I for one would vote immediately to scrap the BBC and let it operate (though I doubt very much whether it could) as a commercial enterprise without ANY public financial support.  We need a referendum on this matter and we need it now, before Ofcom gets his teeth into any more of our BBC Licence Tax payments.",
