        "background": "Many carers are getting a raw deal because they have to stop work to look after someone be it a relative or friend. Carers Allowance is a pitiful amount of money for such an essential service and to make matters worse it's classed as a taxable benefit so if you claim Income Support or Tax Credits it gets taken onto account as earnings and you end up getting paid even less, same goes for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. This petition is to ask for Carers Allowance to be made into a stand alone benefit the same as Disability Living Allowance (which has to be getting paid to qualify for Carers Allownce).",
