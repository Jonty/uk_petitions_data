            "background": "By the introduction of a toll for using the UK's Roads, the vehicle registration would be held upon a database that could be accessed using the Automatic Number Plate Recognition camera's and when the vehicle leaves the UK if the toll was insufficient for the period they were in the country issue on the spot fines.  This should go some way to stopping the unfair competition of the foreign hauliers and help combat the unfairness of people who come to work here and bring their vehicles, this could also bolster the government coffers.",
