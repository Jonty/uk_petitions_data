        "background": "In almost every other Nation in the European Union, the drinking and purchasing age for Alcohol of a low abbreviation is 16. Examples being Beer and Wine. \n\nThousands of British Teenagers flock to the streets on Friday and Saturday nights, and underage drink out in public, where they can and are easily encouraged to commit many crimes such as criminal damage and disturbing the peace.\n\nThey are also vulnerable to the criminals in our society.\n\nThis is why we urge the Prime Minister to lower the drinking and purchasing age for Alcoholic Beverages below 15% Alcohol to 16.\n\nAs a result:\n\n1)Teenagers will have the ability to be in a safer public house environment, where they are at less risk to society and themselves.\n\n2)Pubs can limit the amount of Alcohol a teenager can drink, therefore reducing the risk of \"Binge Drinking\".\n\n3)The increased revenue will give a much needed boost to the struggling public house industry.",
