            "background": "For years the local council has been wavering over how best to regenerate Stirchly. The options were either a Tesco superstore or a retail park development cooperating with the already existant Co-op supermarket. \n\nAs the Tesco would be practically next door to the Co-op it would bring little to the area; simply reproducing what is already there. The retail park would bring a greater diversity of shops to Stirchly, attracting more people and creating far more jobs than the Tesco would. As part of these plans local social clubs would also benefit, helping the community.\n\nPlease sign the petition against Tesco destroying another British town.",
