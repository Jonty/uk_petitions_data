These in my point of view, and many others, could be the start of something great.\n\nOver the past 7 years there has been an increase in youths disrupting / vandalising etc in Taunton, due to a lack of areas of 'activity areas' for them to go. \n\nMy proposal is to find a field / warehouse / area to build a skate park or dirt jumps for the Many bike riders taunton and near by areas have.\n\nTaunton has a frequently used and easy acess trainstation, so that it will be home to even people from otherplaces, increasing local busnisess sales and interest, and altogether keeping Tauntons youths out of trouble and giving them something to look forward to after school or college.\n\nAll we need is this one thing. \n\nPlease sign.\n\nMatthew Gerrard",
