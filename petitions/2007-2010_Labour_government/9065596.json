            "action": "We the undersigned petition and call upon the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Transport and the Government to include within the Access For All funding programme railway stations on the routes running between Dartford and London, so that commuters using these stations can make use of step free and easy access; and further petition the Government, local authorities, the Mayor of London, the Greater London Authority, South Eastern Trains and Network Rail to work together to improve access arrangements at train stations for local commuters.",

            "background": "Many railway stations on the lines between Dartford and London have poor access facilities for disabled passengers, those in wheelchairs and also those with walking difficulties. Commuters with pushchairs and heavy luggage also struggle to use and access railway stations and platforms.\n\nThere is \u00a3370 million of Government funding available through the Access For All programme, however, the Government has denied funding to bring most of the stations along routes between Dartford and London up to standard. Stations such as Erith, Plumstead, Deptford, Albany Park and Woolwich Dockyard have either none or very limited step-free access to their platforms. At other stations, such as Belvedere, access from the ticket office to other platforms can be problematic.\n\nThis campaign and petition is to raise awareness of this important issue and pressure the Government, train operators and others to take action to improve station access.",
