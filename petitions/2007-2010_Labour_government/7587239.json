            "background": "A new report, released today, shows how common MRSA transmission is in the workplace. \"Super bug Staph Infections in the Workplace: The Threat, Ramifications, Risks, and Recommendations for Prevention\" by the American Centre for Disease Control should not go un - noted by the British DoH because infections are occurring much more frequently than previously believed. The petitioner is calling on the British P.M. to outline how employers can best react to this  health risk which has spread beyond hospitals into schools and now workplace environments. Given that sites include phones, computer keyboards, bathrooms, and worksite fitness facilities - the petitioner is calling on the UK govt to legislate to ensure hazards are minimised before it is too late - In the US, more people  died in 2005 from MRSA than AIDS. Maybe you could commission a professional writer to design a leaflet to :\n\n1. Highlight how employers and employees can reduce their risks and prevent the spread of the disease should it strike their workplace.\n\n2. Educate employers about the legal risks if an outbreak occurs.",
