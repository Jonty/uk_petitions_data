            "background": "At 16, you can legally have sex in the UK, but to buy a sex toy, or more sexier lingerie you have to be 18. \nWe want the age lowered to buy these things to be 16, but also more education about sex toys, so people have more knowledge about sex toys, so they are used safely, so it becomes more pleasureable and not cringey.\n\nWe understand that some people may have concerns about this petition, but we are not forcing anyone to buy a sex toy, we just want to be able to buy a sex toy, if we, under 18s, want too.",
