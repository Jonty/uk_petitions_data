            "background": "Lord Elgin removed the marbles that sat on top of the Parthenon on the Acropolis in Athens. On bringing the marbles to Britain they were \"cleaned\" in the incorrect belief that they were dirty when in fact the marbles had been painted at the time the Parthenon was built. Athens has now created a fabulous Acropolis museum, which is soon to open, and it is only right that Britain and the British Museum return these valuable pieces of Greek history and culture back to their homeland.",
