        "background": "This petition is to reinstate the Death Penalty into UK law.\n\nThis penalty would become appropriate in such cases as premeditated murder, assault resulting in death, death caused by drink/drug driving, serial rape, paedophilia, acts of terrorism etc.\n\nI also suggest a maximum 1 year period of grace between sentencing and execution.\n\nAt this time we are able to determine guilt better than at any point in history, so a relatively swift execution of the sentence should not be an issue.\n\nThis would help reduce prison population, the burden on the tax payer and give the victim's families the justice and closure they deserve.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of giving something back to the society, from which these criminals have taken so much, I suggest that after execution their organs are used for transplant.",
