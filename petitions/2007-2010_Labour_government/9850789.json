        "background": "We feel that actively encouraging the game of Cricket will encourage good values, due to the games history of fairness, and the exceptional ways in which the majority of cricketers conduct themselves, both on and off the field.\n\nCricket has always been entrenced in good strong social, moral, and family values, and has always been exceptional at binding local communities together, free from racial, religious and class prejudice. \n\nWe feel now, that this is more essential then ever, as we are living in troubled times of violence, family and social breakdown, and also in a time, when more than ever, children and young adults are carrying weapons, with the intention to use them, to mutilate or murder another human being, or to defend themselves against attack, from those intending to harm.\n\nCricket binds communties together, and allows people from all generations to socialise, enjoy themselves, and share space, in a a sporting and social experience that is truly enjoyable.",
