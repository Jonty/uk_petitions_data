            "background": "As of 1st April 2008, disabled people will no longer be able to have their carers travel free with them on buses.  Many Disabled travellers are unable to travel unaccompanied, such as Blind, Severe Learning Disablities etc.  These people should have the right to have their carers to travel free with them. The withdrawal of free companion travel will affect many disabled people's living.",
