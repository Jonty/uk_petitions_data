            "background": "Fees such as reference checking are being charged at prices up to \u00a3200 + VAT per person. Why should the tennant pay those fees when that is a service for the landlord? Tennants are not asking to be referenced, the landlord is. And you can also get charged \u00a3100 + VAT just to be given a copy of the tennancy agreement, a document that can be found on the internet for free. On top of that, there are letting agents that charge nearly \u00a350 + VAT to renew the tennancy. All they have to do is print out another copy of the cover sheet and change the dates! How is that worth \u00a350. Tennants should not pay letting agents fees, landlords should as they are the ones being represented.",
