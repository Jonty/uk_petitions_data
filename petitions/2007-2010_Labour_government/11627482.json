            "background": "One in seven couples seek medical help for infertility.  The treatment can be time consuming, expensive and traumatic, but getting time off from work is often difficult for both men and woman. \nCurrently in the UK there is no legal obligation to give an employee paid time off to undergo fertility treatment.\nFertility treatment although not a sickness issue is a health issue and is therefore something employers should be concerned about.\nAllowing employees paid time off for fertility treatment means they are more likely to be loyal, motivated and effective members of the workforce. \nUndergoing treatment is stressful and can be traumatic. Having a sensitive and supportive policy (separate from a sick leave policy) is likely to reduce sickness absence, staff turnover and improve productivity. \nThe government should be working with employers and Trade unions to have a set policy in place across all employers, so that employees are treated fairly and no unnecessary stress is caused.",
