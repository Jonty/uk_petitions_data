            "background": "This petition stands for free speech and traditional British values of freedom and fairness.  \n\nMany regard the BNP as a 'racist' or 'Nazi' organisation when it is clearly not:  every party is entitled to change and since Nick Griffin came to office in 1999 he has worked hard to change the image (and policies) of the party, which are still evolving for the better. \n\nYes in the 60's and 70's it had links to the far right but look at labour 20 years ago, look how much they have changed.  Unless the government has forgotten the majority of people in this country are indigenous white British people then there is no reason why a party like the BNP should not exist.\n\nPeople should not be spending their time calling the BNP 'nazi's' when Islamic terrorists are posing more of a threat towards Britain and its way of life.",
