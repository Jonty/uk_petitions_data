            "background": "For most of the 20th Century the House of Lords has undergone reforms. In 1999 Labour finally removed the hereditary principle for the majority of peers. In 2009, in Brighton, the Prime Minister pledged to continue House of Lord reform.\n\nThis is a start but there is still much to do. By signing this petition we acknowledge that the House of Lords does play an important role in the government and therefore want it to represent the people of this country.\n\nThis can be achieved through providing an elected second chamber using proportional representation to account fully for the great variety of political opinion within the UK.\n\nDue to PR usually producing no clear majority, this House will not be dominated by party politics and therefore can review legislature from the Commons with less bias and necessitate parties working together. This will mean that the government will be more accountable to a representative body of the people.",
