This would increase the saftey of children young adults and the elderly, be more environmentaly friendly on the ozone and would be kinder to animals . I have spent the last 5 or 6 days trying to keep my horses from bolting  out of the field or injuring themselves becuase of the noise created by the fire works . If the fire works were to used at orginised events only this would be far safer all round .",
