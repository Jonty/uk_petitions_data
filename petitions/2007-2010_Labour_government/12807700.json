            "background": "The proposed TAX on phone lines to raise money for Broadband is unfair and unjust. It should be abandoned as it is not fair on those who do not have any interest in broadband especially some elderly who have no interest in the Internet. It is also unfair on those who are happy with their current internet facilities. i.e. Do not require TV access via Broadband.",
