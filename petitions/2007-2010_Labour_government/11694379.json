As a suffer from both asthma and anaphylaxis this is very expensive for me. Diabeties is a long term killer where as asthma and anaphylaxis are instant killers. I am not asking for you to make all medications free, just those prescribed for astham and anaphylaxis to be given to suffers free of charge.",
