        "background": "Mugabe has been responsible for the murder of lots of \nparty opposition leaders and their supporters in his 28 \nyear reign as a dictator. He also  has tortured over 10,000 people in Zimbabwe for just trying to free their country and have their voices heard but instead have fallen foul to Mugabe's genocidal regime.\nOur voices must be put forward so that we can speak up for those that either don't have to courage to or just are too scared.\nWe, as  a powerful nation,  can pull together and put so much  pressure on Mugabe that he is forced to step down as ruler. It may be hard but we have a powerful world with powerful countries in it if we all pull together as one,  then anything we put our mind to is possible. It's proven.\nThank You",
