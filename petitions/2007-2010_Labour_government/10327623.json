            "background": "The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick was the third most senior order of chivalry in the United Kingdom. Established in 1783, it was an order of knighthood and the letters \"KP\" followed the person's name.\n\nThe Order was, sadly, discontinued after the secession of the Irish Republic from the United Kingdom in 1922; the last holder of the KP was His late Royal Highness The Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester who died in 1974.\n\nI feel that the time has come for the Order to be restored, albeit with some slight amendments. Like its sister Order of the Thistle, it could be bestowed upon Northern Ireland men and women who have held public office or who have contributed in a particular way to national life. I propose that the Order be available to women and, therefore, the letters KP and LP would pertain.\n\nIrish Citizens would have the Right to omit the degree of knighthood whilst keeping the Order's other privileges and entitlements.\n\nI further propose that the Chapel of the Order could be relocated to St Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh.",
