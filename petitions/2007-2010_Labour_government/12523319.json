            "background": "It is illegal to provide air traffic control feeds from within the U.K. due to an antiquated law that dates back to 1942.\n\nThe antiquated law states that although it is not illegal to sell, buy or own a scanning receiver in the U.K., it must only be used to listen to transmissions meant to be broadcast to the general public.\n\nOFCOM has stated on numerous occasions: \"It is an offence to listen to any other radio services unless you are authorized by a designated person to do so.\"\n\nThis means that it is illegal to listen to anything other than general reception transmissions unless you are either a licensed user of the frequencies in question or have been specifically authorized to do so by an authorized person.\n\nI believe this law should be abolished. Air Traffic Control transmissions are real time and could not be used in any situation which jeopardizes safety or security.",
