        "background": "The teaching of mathematics at high-school level is unsatisfactory. Students are left with a very false impression of what the subject really is, where most believe it only involves tedious algorithms to follow and rules to remember and learn.\n\nIf they are taught the proper axiomatic method, the students will be able to understand where theorems come from, and more able pupils will be able to derive some themselves. It is through this method that they will be able to get a proper feel for what mathematics will be like if they choose to follow it as a profession, and will probably seem a lot more interesting and be a better representation of pure mathematics. Students will develop the rigorous skills required to be a mathematician, rather than acquiring them at a later stage.",
