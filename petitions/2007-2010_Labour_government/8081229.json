            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The government are investing \u00a3370m to fight obesity in children. sign this petition & make the government recognize that investment into skateparks will reduce obesity, & build the fitness levels of the nations children. Skateboarding, Inline Blading, & BMX, are the 3 sports that are practiced in Skateparks. There are estimated to be over 9 million participants of these 3 sports in the UK, which is a wasteland when it comes to professionally designed facilities, they are usually a poor token gesture from a local council. I have negotiated with my local council in Taunton Somerset for over 5 years, we have the land, drawings, planning consent, what we don\u2019t have is funding & its almost impossible to raise, this story is replicated across the UK. The government makes millions in revenue from computer games, this money should be ploughed into skateparks. The people in power need to recognize the needs of the modern child. PLEASE invest in our children, invest in professional skateparks.",
