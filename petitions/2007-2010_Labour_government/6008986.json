            "background": "July 2007: Britain agrees to US request for RAF Menwith Hill intelligence station in North Yorkshire to be used as part of the American missile defence system.\n\nDefence Secretary Des Browne said the system was \"a building block to enhance our national and collective security\".\n\nCND said it was \"outraged\" by the move which it said had been done without consulting MPs or the public. \n\nMeanwhile the international situation remains dire. Key among recent moves have been agreements to site American missiles in a number of countries near  Russia. Premier Putin has made clear this is seen as a very serious threat and will be responded to \"asymmetrically\". \n\nBritain's agreement to this is, therefore, helping to start a new Cold War and an escalation of threats. With the major dangers humanity faces, it is not confrontation that is needed now, but cooperation.",
