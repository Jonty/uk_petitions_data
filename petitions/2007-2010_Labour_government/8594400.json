            "background": "The health advisory body Health England are proposing that all smokers should have to obtain a permit (costing \u00a310) which they would have to present in shops every time they want to purchase cigarettes.\n\nI object to this as it is a stealth tax on behalf of the NHS.  I resent back door legislation.  This is still a government elected by the people, for the people.  Therefore this should be a subject for public referendum, not enforced upon us without consultation.\n\nSmoking should be an adult activity.  It is therefore not appropriate to treat smokers like children who are not fit to make choices about their own health.",
