            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The left-handed have a really raw deal in our society. Most objects are designed for right-handers (everything from rulers to scissors to knives to guitars), and where left-handed alternatives exist at all they are often priced at a premium. Often this discrimination is simply thoughtless - for example, printing the scale on a measuring jug only on one side, or pens firmly fixed by chains to the right-hand side of tellers' windows in banks.\n\nAs a result, it is stressful for left-handers to live in a right-handed world, and can even be more dangerous for them (e.g. when using right-handed tools). This is so serious a problem that left-handers' average life expectancy is several years shorter than that for right-handers.\n\nThis petition calls on the government to make illegal the overpricing of left-handed goods, to require manufacturers to make left-handed versions of right-handed goods, or at a minimum to require ambidextrous versions suitable for use by all, and to require anyone dealing with the public to make reasonable provision for left-handed customers.",
