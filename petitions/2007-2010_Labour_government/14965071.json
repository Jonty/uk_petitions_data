            "background": "I think it's a disgrace that to watch the likes of the English Premier League football matches, that we have to pay a ridiculous fee to a large corporation.  I'm not saying that every match should be free, but on average there's mostly at least ten matches a week in the Premiership, why can't even one of those matches be given to a free channel?  It's ridiculous that certain companies appear to have a monopoly on this, why can't the government intervene, and tell these companies to either stop being so tight or face sanctions?  It's simply nothing short of price fixing because they know fine well there's no competition.  Football should be for everyone.",
