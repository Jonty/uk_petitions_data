            "background": "The UK has many small islands that were previously inhabited but are no longer inhabited (e.g. those of Scotland that were previously inhabited by crofters).  The UK also has many over crowded prisons and criminals who cannot be sent to prison as there is no space for them.  If we build more prisons on uninhabited islands, in particular those with hostile climates, this will create more spaces in prison without taking land away from other uses, make escaping much more difficult and reduce reoffending.",
