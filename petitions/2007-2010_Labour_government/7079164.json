            "background": "Lets get rid of these yellow boxes and put some brains back on the roads, lets use all the money wasted on speed cameras to hire more police who actually are useful in preventing accidents and can do other jobs then just catching people who may edge over the speed limit by a few mph. Police officers have common sense that a yellow box doesn\u2019t, sometimes there are genuine reasons for being a few miles over the speed limit, like overtaking or coming to the bottom of a hill, that a police officer would see and could deal with then and there rather than spending more of our tax money dragging people though the courts. These cameras are nothing more than a way to make money they nether prevent or reduce accidents and can actually cause them e.g if someone slams on their breaks when they see a Gatso, so lets get some real police on the roads and get rid of the yellow cash machine",
