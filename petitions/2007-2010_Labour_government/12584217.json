            "background": "Members of both Houses of Parliament should be reimbursed in proportion to the work they carry out on the nation's behalf. The Prime Minister's recent suggestion of an attendance allowance would have permitted Members to sign in and immediately leave the premises as Members of the European Parliament can do. An hourly or more frequent allowance based on clocking on and off would avoid this abuse and also go some way to address the problem of some members having other employment and some not. They cannot be in two places at once. Individual Members' allowances could reflect the distance from their constituencies to the Houses of Parliament, and payments could be phased to cover parliamentary recesses. There could be further payments for audited provision of surgeries in constituencies and for essential travel on parliamentary business, but not for electioneering and other party activities. Adjustments could be made for certificated sickness, Members being found asleep in the Houses of Parliament and so on.",
