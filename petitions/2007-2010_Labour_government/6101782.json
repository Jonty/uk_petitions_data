        "background": "'Perfidious Albion' rules again with its mealy-mouthed 'thanks for.. valuable and loyal service..to the British Forces in Basra' at the same time as abandoning 91 loyal Iraqui interpreters to absolutely guaranteed torture and death as 'collaborators'.  There are 63 others in only marginally less danger when we eventually leave Iraq. The UK allows terrorist/traitors with British passports to come and go, yet denies a safe haven for a small group of genuine allies.  If the USA and Denmark can welcome them, why can't we?  We should be ashamed.",
