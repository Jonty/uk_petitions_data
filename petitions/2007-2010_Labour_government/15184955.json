            "background": "Please consider banning GM crops in the UK entirely.\n\na) they have no real long term scientifically proven benefits.\n\nb) there are many potential long term dangers to the entire ecosystem, related to using GM crops.\n\nc) GM crops are not properly tested and due to the nature of evolution taking millions of years, cannot ever be tested properly in laboratories.\n\nd) (i) companies like monsanto aim to monopolise the food industry by patenting their strains of GM crops.\n\nand (ii) when patented crops cross breed with surrounding natural crops the patent owners have legal means to sue the victims of the cross bred crops.\n\ne) organic crops are proven to contain higher nutrition than normal crops and GM crops, so should be considered more valuable to society.\n\n\nGM crops are potentially extremely dangerous, may allow for monopolistic companies to control the food industry and have no proven long term benefits, please ban them!",
