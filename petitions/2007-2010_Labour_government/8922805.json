            "background": "The 2008 Budget has targeted ALL DRINKERS, not just antisocial mainly young and possibly in many cases underage binge drinkers. These binge drinkers are most likely to drink strong alcoholic drinks that allow them to get as drunk as possible in the shortest possible time.\nIt is highly unlikely that they consume either Real Ale or Scotch Whiskey as these appeal to more sophisticated drinkers who enjoy the whole drinking experience, not just the alcohol content.\nFor the sake of mainly English but all British Real Ale Brewers, Scottish 'Scotch' Whisky producers and all British community pubs, please give Real Ale and Scottish 'Scotch' Whisky Duty categories of their own. Being in their separate Duty categories would enable Real Ale and Scottish 'Scotch' Whisky to be taxed at a lower rate. Increased sales as a result of lower taxes would secure more jobs, and could actually net more tax due to increased sales.",
