            "background": "There has been one government recognition that 2008 is the appointed National Year of Reading, in which the transcript records that he spoke to 3 children at a top technology school in London about a total of 3 books.\nI would like to call for him to at least ask his many ministers to visit their constituency's schools to talk about reading and to encourage more authors to talk to readers, both children and adults. Also, National Year of Reading is meant to raise the level of reading not just for children, but for adults. In this age where many people cannot discriminate between the context of 'two,' 'too' and 'to', literacy should be embraced as a way to combat this. (Though for goodness sake, not foisted on the poor teachers!!)",
