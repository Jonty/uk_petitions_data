        "background": "I have noticed lately, that many mothers have been spending their child support money unwisely.\n\nI am requesting that the government take more control, particularly in younger children on this money being spent on requirements such as clothing and nappies, as well as food.\n\nIf the child support money was given to the receiver in vouchers or supplied via an arrangement made by the CSA, this could give the person giving the money confidence that the money is being well spent on ensuring that the child is being looked after (on the resources front)\n\nThis would also eliminate (to a certain degree) the ideology that some mothers can have more kids and have more of an allowance to spend.",
