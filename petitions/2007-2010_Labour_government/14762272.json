        "background": "Recently Human Rights Officers have come out in saying that the Airport Scanners are unlawful.\nHow can this be?\nIt is a safety measure, surely its better to walk through a scanner and be properly checked than just to have the beep (metal) system as security.\nWhat are the Human Right Officers so worried about? \nTheir words said \"...discriminate against vulnerable groups or harm good community relations.\"\nHow can this be if the scanner is for every person that goes through the airport? Its not discriminating against any particular ethnic or religious minority. Its for EVERYONE\nIf people protest that much about something which is not actually doing any harm, its becuase They are worried of the outcome for themselves, not for others.\n\nSo say YES to airport Scanners what harm is there in doing so? Other than better safety!!!",
