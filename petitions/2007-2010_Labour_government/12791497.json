        "background": "A gold medal is a gold medal. In the 2009 New Years Honours only 17 of the 35 Paralympic gold medalists, compared to all of the Olympic gold medalists recieved honours. Most of these gold medalists have again been overlooked in the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours.\n\nWhy? Because the Paralympians had to win 2 golds to be considered for an honour. However, some athletes could only win one gold, such as a handcyclist. Even so, a Paralympian who won four gold's did not recieve the same honour as an Olympian who won three. \n\nHow can these great athletes be overlooked just because they don't happen to be in the Olympics?\nWe want equal recognition for all gold medalists.",
