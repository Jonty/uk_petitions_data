        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The cost of pet ownership has increased substantially recently and with the economic situation putting many people in financial difficulty, there is a real concern that a growing number of pets will not be looked after properly.\n\nRSPCA figures show an increase in abandoned animals left with the charity last year, up from 6,500 in 2005 to 9,500 in 2007, and the worsening economic situation could lead to more of our pets being abandoned or failing to get vital medication and veterinary checks.  \n\nPetmeds recently conducted independent research which found that more than one in five pet owners are struggling to pay for their animals\u2019 upkeep.\n\nWe believe a Pet Poverty Fund should be available as an option of last resort to which struggling pet owners can apply for help. By providing this fund we can at least start to address the issues and try to reduce the strain put on animal welfare charities and local authorities.",
