However, as an English degree student, I understand very little of what these governmental acts actually mean.  If we don't understand the law, or our rights, we should not be punished for breaking them, as we are as ignorant of what we do as a child or someone with a mental illness.  What I propose is that a leaflet is issued to every citizen with a comprehensive summary of laws old and new, so that we may be more fully aware of whether we go against the law or not.  Only then may we be trully responsible for our actions.  This might also benefit the enforcement agencies as there would be less lawbreaking due to ignorance.",
