Now is the time to move swiftly forward to set up this NIB to directly promote investment and spending to halt the spiral of recession.\n\nThis bank, established by the government and lending on commercial terms, would be based out of:\n\n1.  Branches of the Government owned Royal Bank of Scotland, National Westminster Bank and Northern Rock\n\n2.  The GPO and\n\n3.  Newly established branches.\n\nThis initiative moves beyond recently introduced liquidity measures, US TARP and interest rate cuts to actually place the quantitative liquidity precisely where it is needed to halt the accelerating decline in the economy.\n\nWe beseech the PM to announce this measure before Christmas.",
