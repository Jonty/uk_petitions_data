            "background": "I think that lone parents of children over 12 still have responsibility for their children and should not be forced to claim Job Seekers Allowance and be allowed to be full time mothers if that is what they want to do.  Otherwise we are creating a society of latch key kids and kids up to no good on the streets because there is no one home.  My mother was a full time mother and I have only been able to work part time because of the support of a partner.  If anything happens to the children or they get into trouble then the parent is still responsible for them.",
