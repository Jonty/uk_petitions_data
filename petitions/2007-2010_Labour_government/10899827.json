        "background": "Over the last number of years, Scarborough Borough Council have levied obscene parking charges on locals and visitors to the town. Now they add insult to injury by building a new traffic scheme on two of the main roads into the town that is literally choking it to death.\nA journey down one Seamer Road (A main artery into the town) once would take 10 minutes max is now taking 30 - 40 minutes due to the excess of traffic lights that have been installed. The locals have complained bitterly during the construction, and SBC have taken no notice whatsoever - just head down and ploughed on regardsless of local opinion. Mr Brown - please take them to task before they ruin one of the jewels of the North Yorkshire Coast.",
