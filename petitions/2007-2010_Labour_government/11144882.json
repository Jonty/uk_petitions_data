This means that anyone who criticises a religion can be put in prison.\n\nThis resolution is clearly just to protect the interests of one religion - Islam.\n\nNo religion is above criticism.\n\nThis resolution, if adopted and enforced by the UK will completely destroy free-speech.\n\nThe Prime Minister should make a binding pledge to the British people that our country will not adopt this draconian law and therefore will continue to allow free-speech.",
