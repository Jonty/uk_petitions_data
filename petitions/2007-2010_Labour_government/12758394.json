            "background": "Raising the age of compulsory education in the UK is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nWhere are all these extra teenagers going to go? Are there magically going to be extra places for the many children who otherwise would not go to College?\n\nWhy force youngsters into another two years of education that they may not want? Is leaving school at 16 and getting a job not ambition enough? Keeping those in education that don't wish to stay will only see an increase in violence in schools and truancy and the quality of education will suffer. \n\nFurther Education/Sixth Forms/Tertiary Colleges are there for those with the ambition and intellect in a particular area of study to further their education - it should remain a choice for all teenagers and we should not be forcing young adults into further education who would rather not continue studying.\n\nThose who want to continue education do so. Those who don't do not. Why force them to do otherwise?",
