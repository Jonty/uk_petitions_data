        "background": "An extra public holiday was granted in 2002 for the Golden Jubilee and it was a great success. The Diamond Jubilee will occur in the same year that Britain hosts the Olympic Games. Two such monumental events may never occur in the same year in Britain again. If the suggested week-long public holiday was granted it would not only increase support for the Olympic Games and the Royal Family, it could be the greatest festival in Britain since the end of the Second World War.",
