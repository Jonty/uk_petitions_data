            "background": "Privatisation of Britain's railways has been a failure. Fares are high, service is poor and there are no signs that the private sector will make any significant investments in our network. UK train operating companies are making healthy profits from government grants and subsidies whilst not providing the British people with anywhere near an adequate service. The UK, already far behind other EU countries at the time of privatisation, is falling further and further behind their vastly superior systems. The private sector has no initiative to do anything other than sweat our national rail system for a profit. Letting this situation continue is short-sighted, our economy depends on the connectivity of our towns and cities, and the UK will never achieve its carbon reduction whilst public transport is so poor.",
