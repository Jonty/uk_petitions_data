            "background": "The race for the Christmas number one slot used to be an integral part of the build up to the Christmas period, and encouraged many singers and groups to produce many much loved and memorable festive hit records over the years.\n\nHowever, since a certain TV talent show has started to release a song each Christmas, most bands have decided not to not bother, and now there is no new Christmas music being made. \n\nWe would like the PM to ask if this could be changed, and allow the race for the Christmas number one slot to become fun again. There is still a demand for Christmas music, which was shown with the rise up the charts at the end of last year of old Christmas songs from downloads.",
