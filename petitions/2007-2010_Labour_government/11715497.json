            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current Distance Selling Regulations permit a customer to reject goods within seven days.\n\nVendors may require the customer to return the goods, but under DSR must refund as soon as possible, even without evidence of dispatch.\n\nThis has led to an increase in the number of rejected goods which refunded, remain unreturned.\n\nThe cost of persuing these cases increases costs which increases prices for all, and taxes if it results in criminal proceedings.\n\nI propose a change in the Distance Selling Regulations to require the customer to obtain, and produce if asked, evidence of return of unwanted goods, before the vendor makes refund. \n\nWhile this may not eliminate such fraud completely I beleive it will reduce both the temptation of casual fraud, and also the frequency of such occurrences without increasing the cost or inconvenience to the customer, and ordinary taxpayers.",
