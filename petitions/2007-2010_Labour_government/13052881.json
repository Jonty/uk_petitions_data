            "background": "To take banks out of the question, to create a society where the people run the country and money does not. \nAs long as money exists happiness does not.\nA society can run itself free from climate disasters, free from money problems, free from crime and punishment, free from everything it currently has. A society can be run by itself for itself, if only it was given a chance to prove itself.\nTodays future is bleak, but a future run by itself could be only years away. Automation is accessible, polution free transportation is accessible, we even use it today and are currently, but slowly, implementing some into today society.\nThe only winners in todays society are the bankers and those alike.",
