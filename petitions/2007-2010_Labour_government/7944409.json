            "background": "Since 2000 there have been 119 international warnings against psychiatric drugs. Serious and even life-threatening drug effects have been withheld from consumers, who sometimes are unaware that they can report drug adverse reactions to the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), and this could have prevented deaths. \nPsychiatric drug effects can include anxiety, agitation, blood disorder, hallucination, hostility, psychosis, depression, strokes, heart attack, liver damage, diabetes, seizures, suicide, violence and death.\nPsychiatrists have also failed in reporting drug side effects to the authorities or manufactures.\nTherefore we, the undersigned, urge the PM to direct the MHRA to require drug manufacturers to add prominent boxed advice at the beginning of drug product information and displayed on medicine containers telling consumers: \u201cYou are encouraged to report drug side effects to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\u201d and provide contact details.",
