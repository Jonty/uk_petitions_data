            "background": "In the late 1950\u2019s and early 1960\u2019s the Thalidomide scandal resulted in children being born without limbs, with internal injuries, with damaged eyesight and hearing and in some instances being left with severe brain damage.\n\nThe tragedy took an enormous toll on the families of these children.  \n\nThe challenges faced by the parents of Thalidomide children brought them face to face with the policy makers of the day;  resulting in better access to education, the widening of the criteria for issuing disabled parking badges and improved access to mobility equipment and everyday adaptations. \n\nForty eight Thalidomide-impaired people have died.  This number excludes babies still born or who died shortly after birth.  Countless parents have also passed away still remaining unsung heroes in this story.\n\nThis petition is to request that the Prime Minister and the Government, to honour the work of Thalidomide impaired people and their families in a manner similar to the way victims of other tragedies.",
