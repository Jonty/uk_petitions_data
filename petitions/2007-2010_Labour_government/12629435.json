        "background": "* The Committee of Standards in Public Life should deliver a number of alternative pay and expenses packages that are capable of being posed as questions in the referendum.\n\n* MPs should not be permitted to vote on their own pay and expenses package until the result of this referendum has become known.\n\n* Such a move would mean that MPs would be 'informed' what package to vote for, one that is acceptable to a majority of UK taxpayers.\n\n* If our MPs are permitted to vote on a new pay and expenses package without this referendum the current climate of self-interest and lack of oversight will be perpetuated.\n\n* This measure can and will force some integrity and oversight into the system and ensure that we the people take a measure of responsibility for our politicians.",
