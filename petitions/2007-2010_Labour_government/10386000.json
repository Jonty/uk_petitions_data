            "background": "I propose that the Prime Minister should create Cycle Friendly day or days whereby all motorised forms of transport (excluding public transport) are restricted or banned from use so as to allow days of free roaming in complete safety for cyclists and other non-motorised transport users. This I feel would benefit everyone as it would encourage a more active lifestyle as well as allow people the ability to explore our wonderful countryside as well as our cities and, I would hope, enrich peoples lives through shared experience.",
