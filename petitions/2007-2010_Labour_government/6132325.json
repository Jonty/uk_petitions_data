        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The positive move of free bus travel for seniors from Spring 2008 will attract seniors away from rail use,already often perceived as an expensive mode of transport. This will be unfair competition for the rail industry causing a diminution of rail travel amongst this huge and rapidly growing section of the UK population. Bus travel will be for all but rail travel will be only for those in paid employment, high personal wealth or with good occupational pensions.\nWe need parity for rail travel to sustain the rail industry and to offer seniors a real choice of public transport.",
