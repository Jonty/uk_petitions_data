            "background": "All hospitals should employ a controlled cleaning force to cut the spread of infections. They should be under the control of health proffesionals and not employed for profit. They should be employed in all areas of the hospital and provided the best cleaning equipment and chemicals to combat the spread of infections. Belief is that a motivated,  professional NHS cleaning service would go a long way to cutting the spread of opportunist infections within hospitals. thankyou",
