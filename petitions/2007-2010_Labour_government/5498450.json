            "background": "I cannot be the only Person who is getting tired of hearing about medications and treatment that thousands of British people require, but sadly do not get due to them not being 'cost effective', or individuals living in the wrong area of the country.  Such as Cancer treatments and Alzeimer's medications etc.\n\nIf this is the real reason then why do the government still continue to provide full Medical care on the NHS to foreign visitors and asylum seekers etc.  Surely if policies were to change, and people who have not contributed towards these services (through Tax and National Insurance) over a number of years, were required to contribute a little towards care and treatment,(I am not saying all) the NHS would have more income and in turn allow 'non-cost effective' medications etc. to become available to all individuals who require them.  After all, In many countries these individuals have to pay full health costs.",
