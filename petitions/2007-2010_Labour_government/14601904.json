In my opinion, If sixteen year olds are allowed to risk their lives for their country, Then why can't they be given the ability to vote for who they are fighting for? If they can devote their lives to another person (Marriage) and sign a marriage certificate, Then why can't they sign a less important and more simple document being the ballot paper?",
