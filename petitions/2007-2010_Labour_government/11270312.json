Bring back the Note as a symbol of the strength of Britains financial base and economic commitment - past, present and future.  Review its withdrawal only after the 2012 olympics.",

            "background": "The British Pound Note is probably one of the most recognised symbols of financial security - or at least it was.  So many Britains have never even seen a pound note.  There are no easy fixes to Britains current economic problems, but sometimes a symbol can evoke far more in a population than any speech or action ever will.\nThe old Green pound note, especially the 1970's version with Britannia on the back, would serve well as a focus of our countries need to do what is required to come out of the economic downturn stronger than ever before.",
