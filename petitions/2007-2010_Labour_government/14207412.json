They contribute to air and water pollution; costing our NHS in cancer care over the next few decades.\nAlternatives include glass include anaerobic digestion, improvements of packaging, increased recycling, to name only a few. Incinerators create ash which still requires landfill - which is running out fast, we need to prevent the waste from being created in the first place. Incinerators are not sustainable and produce tonnes of CO2 emmisions.",
