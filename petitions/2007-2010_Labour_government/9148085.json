            "background": "As of April 5th, 2008, the basic rate of income tax set at 10% has been abolished. Taxation now starts at a rate of 20% for all earned income over \u00a35,435 per annum, increasing the tax burden for all those earning under roughly \u00a318,000 while the burden for those earning above that figure has lessened.\n\nWe, the undersigned, consider this to be a grossly unfair and regressive revision of UK taxation policy, and not in keeping with a society that protects its poorest members. We call on the Government to reverse this change and restore the 10% rate of income tax.",
