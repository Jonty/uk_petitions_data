        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The chief constable of North Wales, described the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as \"not fit for purpose\" and \"immoral\" and urged its repeal.\n\nHe said: \"The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 should be repealed and replaced by a new Substance Misuse Act based upon the legalisation and careful regulation of all substances of abuse in one consistent manner.\"\n \"UK drugs policy for the last several decades has been based upon prohibition with a list of banned substances placed into three classes - the ABC system - and draconian criminal penalties for the possession or supply of controlled drugs.\n\n\"This system has not worked well. Illegal drugs are now in plentiful supply, and have become consistently cheaper in real terms over the years.\n\n\"The number of users has increased dramatically. Drug crime has soared equally dramatically as a direct consequence of the illegality of some drugs and the huge profits from illegal trading have supported a massive rise in organised criminality.\n\n\"Most importantly, the current system illogically excludes both alcohol and tobacco.\"",
