        "background": "Long-term illnesses have a detremental effect on the UK economy.  These people are no longer capable of employment and contribute nothing to society.  They use NHS resources that should be spent on the economically active and are a drain on social servies and the benefits system.  Humane assisted suicide of the disabled would free up resources to help the long-term unemployed into work (those that have the potential to contribute to society) and also help the NHS give better care and treatment to those that are able to get better.  This appears to be supported by the majority of the working population and many of the UK's newspapers.",
