This conference was attended by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, U.S. President George Bush, French President Jacques Chirac, and many other world leaders.\nIn the September 2002 Johannesburg Summit, these same 22 counties re-affirmed their commitment to reach the 0.7% goal. This would provide enough money to raise the $195 billion per year.\nSo far only Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Netherlands and Denmark are actually donating this amount or more. Help take action to make our country also keep to the signed promised.",
