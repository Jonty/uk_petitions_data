        "background": "In September 2000, the 189 countries of the United Nations unanimously agreed to \u201cspare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty,\u201d specifically hunger and the \u201cmajor diseases that afflict humanity.\u201d\nIn the March 2002 Monterrey Conference, 22 of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries agreed to make \u201cconcrete efforts\u201d towards the goal of each giving 0.7 per cent of their national income as aid to the poorest countries. This conference was attended by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, U.S. President George Bush, French President Jacques Chirac, and many other world leaders.\nIn the September 2002 Johannesburg Summit, these same 22 counties re-affirmed their commitment to reach the 0.7% goal. This would provide enough money to raise the $195 billion per year.\nSo far only Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Netherlands and Denmark are actually donating this amount or more. Help take action to make our country also keep to the signed promised.",
