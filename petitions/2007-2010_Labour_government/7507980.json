This country has always been Christian and now the government is doing its best to ignore our traditions. For most christians it is important to keep up Christian Festivals and uphold the Birth of Christ. This wouldn't happen in a Muslim country so why do we change just for them.\n\nI am discusted with this party and will not vote for them again.\nRegards\nBeauty",
