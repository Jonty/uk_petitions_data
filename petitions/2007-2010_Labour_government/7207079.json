            "background": "This is in response to a petition which says the minimum should increase to 10% so that the debt would be repaid more quickly.  I agree that it would, and of course it would also mean that the individual would pay less interest on the overall debt, but what about people who COULDN'T AFFORD to pay 10%?  In any case credit card statements make the point that the less you pay every month the longer it will take to settle the debt, and the more interest you will end up paying, so I imagine most people already pay as much as they can.",
