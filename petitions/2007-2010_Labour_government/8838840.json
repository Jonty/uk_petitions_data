        "background": "Details have emerged of a ban on RAF Wittering personnel wearing service uniform outside of their base, in fear that airmen serving there could be abused by the local civilian population.\nThe hardworking members of our Armed Forces should not have to pander to political views on the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, and should feel free to wear their uniform in public without fear of harm or abuse. Wearing Service dress in public can help to raise the profile of the Forces, and in so doing reduce hostility and increase interaction between the MoD and wider society.\nWe petition the Prime Minister to assure the British public that, security concerns aside, the Armed Forces will in future be allowed and actively encouraged to wear their uniform in public, and with pride.",
