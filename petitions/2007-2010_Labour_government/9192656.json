            "background": "Creating something that is part human part animal (inter specie embryos) needs strong regulations. Another example of significant public welfare risks is nuclear power, which is heavily regulated to ensure good control. \n\nThe unelected quango, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has breached regulatory requirements in granting licenses permitting the creation of human-animal hybrid embryos. Legislatures for the 1990 HFE Act had not envisaged the embryo as human and not 'animal-human'. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 does not allow licensing of animal-human hybrid embryos but rather contains a prohibition on the creation of such embryos. The failings of the HFEA demonstrates its inherent weaknesses.  \n\nNewcastle University has claimed to have created the first animal-human embryo and the HFEA. This week licensed King\u2019s College London to conduct similar research. Help to stop the floodgates opening and sign this petition .",
