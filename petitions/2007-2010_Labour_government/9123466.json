But many women are also sufferers and scientists at the University of Aberdeen, who carried out the research, said the lower levels of treatment for women were \"worse than we anticipated\".\n\nThey did not put the findings down to simple sexism, however, and said \"broader cultural factors\" were at play.\n\nThese include the fact that men are more likely to display classic symptoms, such as chest pain, and that men are more likely to be encouraged to visit the doctor than women.\n\nThe researchers called for a campaign highlighting the problem among women to be launched.",
