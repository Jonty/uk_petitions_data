            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Pub companies are charging their tenants an astonishing 65% more for their beer than is necessary. The true cost of a barrel at the moment from John smiths for 12 gallons is aroun \u00a335-\u00a340. Pub companies like Enterprise Inns, Admiral Taverns and Greene King are charging around \u00a3109 for a barrel. The only real cost to the pub company is transportation provided by Scottish & Newcastle, and it in no way justifies 65% difference. This must end now. And give publicans the choice to purchase beer elsewhere. Thus saving revenue for them and reduce the cost of a pint and bring back trade to our local pubs.",
