        "background": "Did you know........If you are a single person and become homeless.........you have less rights and access to basic facilities in this country than a convicted prisoner!....basically you are last in the line for being offered housing or temporary accomodation.\n\nFor example;- when you lose your home (say through mortgage default).....you lose access to the following basics that we all take for granted in our society :- You lose your Right To Have Access to a Bank Account, Your Driving licence, A Passport, Access to a Mobile Phone, Your Right to Basic State Benefits, Entitlement to Tax Rebates, or to Pay Tax, and your Right To Vote!...all because you have no fixed abode!....is that fair or right?\n\nAll these problems could be solved if the government introduced a `National Accomodation Address Scheme`.\n\nSo what is it? and how does it work?\n= You register your ID details with the passport office and are given a security card and security password to allow you to access a roaming \"PO BOX Number\", this then allows you to re-direct & pick-up mail via a phone call anywhere in the country to any post office or council office pick-up centre, and give you entitlement to a \"Legal Address\"!.",
