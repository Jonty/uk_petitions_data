            "background": "The evidence is overwhelming that a regular simple blood test for PSA can identify early those men at high risk of prostate cancer and particularly before symptoms are recognised. Early identification means longer life.\nIn America, where PSA screening has to be paid for, the death rate from prostate cancer has dropped to one in six. In UK it is 9000 deaths from 30,000 case diagnosed per year.\nregular testing would highlight the rate of change of PSA - the key indicator to aggressive or benign prostate cancer. Don't believe the enemies of preventive screening, sieze the opportunity and sign up today before it is too late!",
