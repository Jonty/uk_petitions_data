        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The news suggests that the FSA has decided not to enforce any rules relating to city bonus payments. In the current financial situation with tax payers supporting much of the financial sector due to mismanagement it is unacceptable that tax payers money goes to support companies giving these bonus payments. The FSA should be given the alternative of enforcing these issues or be closed down and replaced.  The FSA's failure has in part been blamed for this problem. Unusual times call for unusual measures.  The public will not tolerate massive bonus payments for efficency to individuals who have fiddled while the financial Rome burned around us all.  The effects of this will hit everyone and they should suffer as much as the rest of us.",
