            "background": "Many members of the British Army and the Royal Air Force who served in the BRITFORJOR detachment to Amman between July and October 1958, either came from Cyprus to this campaign or were transferred to Cyprus afterwards. They were on active service for up to eight months but did not receive any medal in recognition of their service, because they did not complete the required 120 days for the Cyprus GSM and nothing was awarded for Jordan. It is known that King Hussein of Jordan wanted to award a Jordanian medal to British servicemen but the British Government declined. This means that about 500 men received no recognition at all and they deserve to be acknowledged.",
