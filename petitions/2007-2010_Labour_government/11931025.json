            "background": "Jim Fitzpatrick, the Roads Minister proposes to reduce the current 60 mph limit on rural single carriageway roads to 50 mph, on the basis that it has been claimed (by the company which supplies Average Speed Cameras !) that this will reduce road deaths.  This is yet another example of blanket legislation by this government, using the mass restriction of the people to tackle the irresponsible behaviour of a minority.  A similar scattergun approach is being pursued in tackling alcohol misuse in Scotland.  The Government needs to ensure the police are doing their job by enforcing current limits at dangerous spots on the road rather than taking this lazy civil service approach to restricting the freedoms of the great majority of responsible drivers who enjoy being able to drive safely at sensible speed on open roads.",
