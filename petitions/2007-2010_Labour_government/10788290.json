            "background": "We protest against the Government's explanation for refusing settlement rights to the Gurkhas in that they lack \"strong ties\" with Britain.\n\nTo quote Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing the Gurkhas in the High Court: \n\n\"To say this is to ignore the special debt this country owes to all Gurkhas, past and present, whatever their brigade's location and whatever their date of discharge. They have served with great distinction and extraordinary courage. \n\n\"Their long and dedicated service links them inextricably to the people of this country and creates a debt of gratitude and honour. \n\n\"What matters is the fact of service, not the location of service. \n\n\"However distant their country of origin, whatever the location of their headquarters at a particular moment in history, however remote the battlefields on which they fought and risked their lives and shed their blood, all the Gurkha soldiers, past and present, were fighting for this country.\"",
