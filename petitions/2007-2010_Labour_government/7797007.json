We have an exceptional NHS Healthcare in the World and must prevent loosing the NHS to the private sector at all costs.\n\nIn future, all foreign people coming into the UK will not be allowed free NHS treatment unless they can prove they have a valid British Passport and have been in the country for at least 10 years.  \nPrior to the 10 years, all foreigners coming into the UK will have to pay for private medical healthcare by taking out insurance like any other Country in the World!\nThis would immediately free up hugh long waiting lists for treatment on the NHS for those British citizens who have paid into the system all of their lives which is the way forward for the NHS. \n\nYours sincerely\nLong Serving NHS Employee",
