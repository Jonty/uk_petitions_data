People who expose cruelty and neglect to patients in order to stop their suffering and bring it to the attention of others in authority and make the information available to the public should be awarded a medal. After doing so this person should have full protection from the law and employment regulators  so that they are not in fear of losing their job or suffering themselves for exposing such wicked behaviour.  I feel it is about time medals were given to those who deserve it, thus by doing good in order to save others.  In rewarding them you will be saying thank you and making it possible for others to come forward and expose wrongdoers.",
