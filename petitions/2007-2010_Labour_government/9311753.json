            "background": "Having just come back from holiday via Liverpool Airport It seemed strange that only one of the two Iconic members of the Beatles is referred to in the name of the Airport. After all, McCartney was more than an equal partner in this song wrting phenomena, and he was and is the one who throughout his life has kept his links with Liverpool, unlike Lennon who emigrated to The USA.\n\nWouldn't the:\n       \"LENNON McCARTNEY AIRPORT\"\nbe a more appropriate name for Liverpool's gateway to the World?\nPlease support this petition and write to Liverpool Council",
