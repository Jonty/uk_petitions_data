        "background": "He is supposed to uphold the values of British Society and Culture and yet, Dr Williams chooses to dishonour the 52 innocent people who died in the London terrorist bombings by suggesting that we adopt aspects of the very laws that the bombers want us to adhered to.  Be warned my fellow citizens, if we adopt anything sharia, it will be a dangerous and vile stepping stone into adopting more sharia laws.  Do not let the lives they took be in vain!  Reject sharia at all costs!",
