Outside school, publically name and shame offenders aged 10 to 17. For 'joy riding', other theft and violence, the birch for first offences. Second and further offences, one year at borstal, run by military personnel. Borstal should consist of hard labour 14 hours a day plus two hours of military drilling, seven days a week. Adult prison should be equally harsh. Forget criminals' 'human rights' in favour of the rights of their victims and OUR society!",
