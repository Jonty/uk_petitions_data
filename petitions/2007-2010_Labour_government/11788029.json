        "background": "Currently if an employer provides fruit for its employees it is considered a benefit in kind and therefore taxable. This puts many employers off as it greatly increases the cost. \n\nSurely, the government should be supporting employers that want to do this as it promotes good health and should make employees more alert with a greater attention span. This would fit in with the numerous government initiatives promoting healthy eating.\n\nObviously, limitations are required to ensure that this does not become a way of avoiding paying taxes or companies paying people in food.",
