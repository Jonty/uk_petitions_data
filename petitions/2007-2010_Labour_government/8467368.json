        "background": "Recent considerations appear to suggest that a change to the existing pattern of Premiership games where each team plays each other home and away. There is now a suggestion where an additional one off game is played at a foreign venue. It is mooted this game would be for the traditional 3 points for a win and 1 point for a draw and would be added to the existing total of each clubs points. Each club would be drawn at random to play their one off game with the top clubs seeded so they did not face each other. The completely arbitrary and unfair proposal could end up in the scenario where club that only needs one point to avoid relegation and another needs three. The club that needs one gets a mid team table where the team that needs three gets the leaders! This suggestion is ill advised, an abuse of the fans and the players and a purely mercenary tactic by people who do NOT have the love of the game at heart.",
