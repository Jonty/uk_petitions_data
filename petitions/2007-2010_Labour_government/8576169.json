        "background": "Sunnybank primary school in Potters bar has been serving the community for nearly fifty years and is now due to be closed at the end of the summer term 2008. Hertfordshire council has decided that the sale of the land, given the value, will help balance the books. With increasing child population of Potters Bar I believe this will cause overcrowding in our local schools and eventually lead to the building of another \"new school\". Sunnybank is a great primary school and should remain open.",
