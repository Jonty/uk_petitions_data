        "background": "The credit crunch and rising unemployment means that home repossessions are on the increase.\n\nWhilst people who are unable to pay their debts should not be bailed out as a matter of course, it is wrong that children should be punished. Eviction has a traumatic effect on children and also disruptive in having to change schools etc\n\nIt is also costly to the taxpayer as all families who lose their homes must  be rehoused by local authorities and if no homes are available, they have to be put into bed and breakfast accomodation, a very costly option.\n\nWhenever a family with children under the age of 16 is facing repossession the Government should buy the house from the mortgage lender.  The family could stay in the house as tenants until the youngest child reaches the age of 16. The Government could then sell the property on the open market.\n\nSuch a policy would be no costlier than the existing system of having to rehouse families in any case. It could be profitable for the Government when the housing market recovers.",
