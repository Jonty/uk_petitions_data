            "background": "I am sick and tired of teachers using \"sick pay\" advantages not to come and teach at school. Moreover, we as a taxpayer finance these sick off days and instead we have to pay the supply teacher as well as the teacher who is \"ill\". \nMaking most state school teachers self-employed will make them realize that that\u2019s the way it goes: if you don't come to school to teach - you wont get paid, as simple as that!\nMaking the teachers self-employed will have its own disadvantages, however as a self-employed you will pay less tax and also you could make claims.\nMaking the teachers self-employed will improve their attendance. Furthermore, this decision will 100% improve education in BRITAIN!",
