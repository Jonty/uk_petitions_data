            "background": "This petition is to try and get a similar pay scheme to what the T.A have for special constables. A bounty for acheiving a set amount of hours on duty. The roll they do today is very different from what they were doing 6 years ago. It's not fetes and football matches. They are now frontline officers without membership to the police federation who no longer support their regular counterparts but replace them. They are now also getting response trained. This is a lot of responsibility for no pay. Please pay them and recognise them for their efforts.",
