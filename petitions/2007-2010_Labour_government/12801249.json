            "background": "My opinion is it should be enforced for all persons under the age of 18 to wear Helmet, Protective Jacket, Protective trousers and Gloves. It is seen far too often where parents take there children out on there motorbike in jeans and tee-shirt. Or young riders on bikes in shorts and shirt. I think a minimum Protective equipment margin should be put into place for under 18's either being pillion or riding for themselves (including scooters). anyone older than 18 should know better (and this would also make them think more) my aim is to get young riders into the good habit of wearing the right gear so that there are less fatalities.",
