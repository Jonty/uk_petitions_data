Quite how this documentation shows whether or not we are money laundering is beyond me, but what does concern me is the number of people that then have access to a lot of our personal data, which could then potentially be used for fraud.  There is not only their staff to consider; anyone breaking into the Estate Agent or Mortgage Broker's offices will have access to all their client's personal data in one place.  Is buying ones only home really indicative of money laundering activities?  I could understand the requirement for this sort of information when I set up new bank account a couple of years ago, but not for when buying one's sole home, with a reasonable size mortgage.",
