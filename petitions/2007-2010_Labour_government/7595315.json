            "background": "To be charitable, there appears to have been a mistake in the funding available to the STFC which means that univerisity physics departments and major international projects are \u00a380 million or so short.\n\nWhatever the reason it is poor long term policy to cut funding to fundamental science and will drive the very people we desperately need overseas.  It is also very unfair to those who may become unemployed.\n\nPlease find the money to restore the funding and ensure this will not happen again.",
