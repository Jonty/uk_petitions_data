            "background": "It has become apparent that the Minister of Armed Forces Bob Ainsworth has decided that up to 2400 T.A. appointments within the Royal Corps of  Signals need to be closed due to funding. We as T.A. soldiers have enlisted and put our lives at risk since the beginning of WW1. Closing down 12 Sig Group, 33,34 and 35 Sig Regts would not be \"okay\" as many of the T.A. soldiers will not be willing to travel to farther places, such as Derby etc. Place like N-U-L, Birmingham, Shrewsbury, Coventry, and Runcorn do not have enough soldiers on the street as it stands. We need to get out on the streets of England and show our worth, and prove we are needed!",
