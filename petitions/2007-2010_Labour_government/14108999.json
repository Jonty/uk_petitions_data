        "background": "Both Germany and France are concerned about the effects of wifi technology especially with children (ADHD is increased 4 fold where wifi is installed in schools - according to reports) and are choosing to install wired internet.  Adults complain of nausea, dizziness and loss of memory and it could cause sleep disturbances if the population is exposed to it 24 hours a day.  Are we prepared to risk our health and the health of our children without finding out more?",
