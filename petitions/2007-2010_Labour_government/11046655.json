        "background": "It is an almost unanimous opinion that education should be promoted, and there is strong evidence that those in education for longer are usually more successful in life. However, there are fundamental flaws in the plans for raising the school leaving age to 18.\n\nThough I recognise the benefits of the suggestion to raise the leaving age to 18, now, I feel, is not the time, certainly when other educational reforms should be considered, particularly with regards to primary schools and increasing the efficiency of learning at an earlier level, and also to consider the multitude of problems associated with raising the leaving age.",
