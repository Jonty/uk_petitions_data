If this situation is accurate and continues, then one can quite rightly make the assumption that there will be yet another civil rights blood bath in Africa. The U.N is the body with the remit to investigate such situations, and as Zimbabwe is a member state of the UN, they are best placed to determine the accuracy of these reports, and take appropriate action.",
