Local authorities are given responsibility or supporting these people (a population equal the size of Cardiff). Appropriate support barely exists until people get so depressed and anxious they qualify for mental health support. Access to services is prevented by:\n\n\u2022\tProfessionals refusing to take responsibility \n\u2022\tDiagnoses that are wrong, confusing, late or not made\n\u2022\tService being inappropriate for individual needs\n\u2022\tBudgets being too tight to allow for an appropriate service\n\u2022\tLack of understanding/knowledge amongst professionals at all levels\n\u2022\tAbsence of appropriate services\n\nThe law (community care, human rights, disability legislation), demands that people are supported in leading as independent a life as possible. It is manifestly obvious that this is not happening in this population and will not until a dedicated budget is created.",
