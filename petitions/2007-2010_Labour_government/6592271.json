These are measures introduced in the new Highway Code which has come into force in the United Kingdom, tightening controls against anyone who distracts themselves in any way while driving. For this to take place they will need to ban everyone with kids to carry them in the vehicle. this may seem extreem but we all know that kids from time to time cause a distraction. EVERYONE AGAINST THIS SHOULD PUT THEIR NAME HERE",
