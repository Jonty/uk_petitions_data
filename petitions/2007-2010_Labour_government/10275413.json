            "action": "introduce legislation to make it unlawful for body organs donated without charge to the NHS to be given to anybody who is NOT being treated under normal NHS priority of treatment rules so that patients who can afford to go private (or have the costs of going private paid by their government, thereby circumventing NHS regulations) cannot jump the queue.",

            "background": "The selling of freely donated organs to EU patients who are having operations paid for by their government is legalised fraud and theft of the organs used.  Where surgeons are operating in a private capacity on ANY patients they should be required to source the organs from anywhere other than the NHS organ donation scheme.  It is immoral for surgeons to profit from using organs donated free of charge to the NHS.  It has to be stopped.",
