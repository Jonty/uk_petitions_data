            "background": "With an ever diversifying society, educational establishments need to change the approach that is taken to the upcoming generation of children, focusing more on cultural differences in society. Mixed race children are becoming one of the most prominent minority 'races' in our schools today, but yet they are not recognised as an individual group with specific problems, needs or difficulties. I am urging the Prime Minister to consider additional methods of training and systems in schools so that mixed race people are more understood and represented in our future community. There is currently not enough support for the individual needs of this group, as the proportion of mixed race adults in our society is significantly lower than the generation coming up - who will need help guidance and support, rather than feeling isolated in a society that doesn't recognise they exist.",
