I believe that with current aviation technology and the cooperation of airlines and manufacturers such as Airbus and BAe systems, we can use the same airframe design but update the engines, wiring, avionics etc. To create a more efficient and airline and eco-friendly Concorde. Leaving its original airframe in place. Leaving inplace or increasing her performance.",
