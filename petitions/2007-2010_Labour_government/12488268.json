So join with me and abolish torture.\n\nWhy torture someone just because you haven\u2019t got what you hoped for or what you want. That just makes you a greedy monster. Act like mature people and abolish torture worldwide. I\u2019m part of it and I will go as far as I can to abolish it. \nLets get everybody to act like humans and be friends together. Please think. Would you like to be tortured for a very long time? NO. Help us to do what you can.",
