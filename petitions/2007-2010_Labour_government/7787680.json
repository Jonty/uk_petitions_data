The fact that she is terminally ill and will not be able to afford even palliative treatment in the country to which she has been \"removed\" means that she has effectively been condemned to a painful death. \n\nDo we, the people of the United Kingdom, really want our government to carry out this kind of action on our behalf and in our name? Surely there is room for compassion for the dying or did those who administer the law on our behalf see a 'soft' target to boost their figures?",
