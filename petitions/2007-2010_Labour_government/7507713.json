            "background": "We understand that the threat of terrorism to the UK is serious and should be dealt with appropriately. However, this will not be achieved by extending the current 28 day detention without charge to 42 days.\n\nThe 28 day detention was agreed through cross party consensus and did not go through the House of Lords until a sunset clause was included into the Bill.\n\nAn extension to 42 days is not based on empirical evidence that current detention laws are inadequate.\n\nThis petition also asks that further announcements of detention extension will be announced in the Houses of Parliament, where proper scruinty can be given to the Government.",
