If people want the protection of law afforded by marriage, then they should marry to get this protection. If they want protection in law, it exists, they should show a commitment in marriage, then the law will commit to them. No marriage/civil partnership should give no rights, not undermine the commitment of marriage/civil partnership by changing the law to suit people unprepared to commit to each other or the state",
