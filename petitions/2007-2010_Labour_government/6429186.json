        "background": "It is wrong to allow none married couples to be given the same protection in law after a set amount of time cohabiting. If people want the protection of law afforded by marriage, then they should marry to get this protection. If they want protection in law, it exists, they should show a commitment in marriage, then the law will commit to them. No marriage/civil partnership should give no rights, not undermine the commitment of marriage/civil partnership by changing the law to suit people unprepared to commit to each other or the state",
