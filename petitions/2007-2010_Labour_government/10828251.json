            "background": "So I hear Gordon Brown wants to ban Staffordshire Bull Terriers. Any dog can attack, the same as humans. Why doesn't he push for stronger sentences for animal cruelty rather than wiping out a whole breed? Staff's are receiving the same treatment as Pitbull's because they look similar & people let them get into the wrong hands. Why pick on a breed for the way it looks? You cannot simply get rid of something because it looks \u2018aggressive\u2019. If they were human this would be racism and not allowed so what gives anyone the right to treat these loving animals (when treated correctly) so appallingly? My Staff is now 5 & was neglected and when he came to me he was underweight & nervous. A cat & a Jack Russell have attacked him & he ran away both times. Does that sound like a dangerous dog to you? All they want is love and care.\n\nCan\u2019t you vet people who wish to own a Staff? This country's already lost all it's right's & now we are going to lose the right to be animal lovers? You cannot dictate to us how to live our lives and what pets we can keep, we have our own voices & that will never change.\n\nPlease help save these adorable animals before it's too late.",
