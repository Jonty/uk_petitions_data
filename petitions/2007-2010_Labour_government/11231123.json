The chip is vunerable to data theft, as it can be read by anybody with the right equipment and has even been proven to be duplicated without much difficulty, and will hense not prevent forgery.\nThe chip is far too vunerable, and provides too much scope for would-be data criminals. What is the point? Please ban the use of Biometric Chips in UK passports.",
