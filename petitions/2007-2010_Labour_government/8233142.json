        "background": "This petition is to stop Government bodies and Local Authorities from introducing draconian policies on staff and by-laws on the public by extending the scope of legislation by going one or more steps further than the law dictates. \nExample: Such an organisation has introduced a ban on staff clocking out and going outside for a cigarette break, but does not stop people doing the same to go to the bank etc.\nThis type of senario is frequently occuring and often brought in because of individuals prejudices or the organisation attempting to gain an award and NOT through real democratic processes.",
