            "background": "The former Langworthy Hotel has been earmarked for demolition. It is the only old building of historical and community interest left on Langworthy Rd, Salford 6. \nSalford City Council has left the building to languish and it has lain empty for many years, despite attempts to secure it as a community asset. This government actively encourages and advocates asset(building)transfer to local communities. \nWe ask that Salford City Council reconsider the proposal to demolish this lovely old building and support the asset transfer option.",
