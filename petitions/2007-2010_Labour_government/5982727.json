            "background": "There are many sufferers of IBD (Crohns disease and Ulcerative Colitis) that are not entitled to a blue disabled badge, as walking is not always an issue. IBD is a life long disease that can severely impair the ability of sufferers in leading a normal life, with frequent periods of uncontrollable diarrhoea. Many sufferers will park at short notice to use public toilets in an emergency and receive a parking fine for doing so. This is, I believe a contravention of our basic rights and would like the scheme to be reviewed to include IBD sufferers, or to provide a shorter period badge to allow for toilet use without penalty.",
