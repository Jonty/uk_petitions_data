            "background": "Many thousands of us are trapped in a fixed rate mortgage deal with horrendous penalties if we try and renegotiate. These deals were taken out by families trying to protect their homes and income. The government has bailed out various industries and the banks who have either made bad financial decisions or have suffered because of the economic downturn. Gordon Brown also needs to help the families who seemingly also made a bad financial decision to fix their mortgage rates. If all the families were able to take advantage of the lower interest rates it would help boost all sections of the economy. There would be more disposable income available and people would be more confident to spend. Much has been made of the historic interest rate cuts but they are not of benefit to all and more help needs to be offered.",
