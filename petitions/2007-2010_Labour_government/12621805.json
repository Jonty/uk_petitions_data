        "background": "The reason for the petition is that, the economic downturn has created a massive increase in the number of skilled workers out of work. This has been exacerbated by the influx of cheap labour from Eastern Europe. \nThe effect of wage equality would be, that the UK home grown workforce would be competing on a level playing field based on skills experience and quantity /quality of work. \nThe current climate is forcing wage rates down to levels that are non-liveable with, and creating hardship for those who can find work, with the need to work unacceptably long hours for a reasonable take home pay.\nHome grown labour is being undercut by cheap imported labour at a time when the country is in a deep recession.\nThis is morally indefensible.",
