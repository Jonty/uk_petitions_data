            "background": "I do not feel you fully understood, or acknowledged, the argument proposed in the previous petition.\n\nWe feel that if \"[m]any parents want their children to benefit from collective worship whether or not they have a strong Christian belief themselves\", they should take it upon themselves to involve their children in collective worship.\n\nWe do not, however, feel that it is fair that ALL children should be SUBJECTED to the religious traditions of strictly one faith (funnily enough, YOURS!) in a secular society and at secular schools.\n\nWe understand that pupils can be withdrawn from collective worship but, like stated before, this puts unnecessary pressure on parents and children within the school and their community. This leads many to go against their own moral judgement and leave their children within the collective worship of someone else's god.\n\nWould you feel happy knowing your child and their friends were being forced to collectively pray to Allah, Jehovah, or even lord Xenu, every day?",
