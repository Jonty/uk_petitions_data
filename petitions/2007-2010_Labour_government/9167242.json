            "background": "While we totally understand that all athletes have devoted years of their lives to their sports, surely it is not too much to ask that they boycott the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Games in Beijing.  This will not harm their medal hopes, but it would be extremely difficult for the Chinese authorities to explain the lack of other athletes to their own people, particularly if other countries joined in the protest as a way of expressing their abhorrence of the Chinese record on Human rights and their treatment of the people in Tibet.",
