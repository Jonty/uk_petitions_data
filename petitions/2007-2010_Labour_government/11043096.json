            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Because of the extraordinary drop in house sales during this economic downturn, I have estimated that the Stamp Duty collected by Government will drop from approx. \u00a36.5 billion in 2007 to approx. \u00a32.5 billion in the next 12 months. To give the housing market a massive kick-start by implementing this measure, it would cost the Treasury less than \u00a32 billion when you take into account the knock on effect on retail sales, which would help to replace some of that \u00a32 billion, together with saving thousands of jobs in the retail sector - and therefore saving unemployment benefits being paid on those lost jobs and maintaining the income tax from them. This relatively inexpensive method of stimulating the economy would be felt almost immediately, would be cost effective and would eventually pay for itself many times over.",
