This rather misses the point. \n\nIt is rather the case that \"Reason\" is in need of very real support. The scientific establishment has been under threat from the merchants of ignorance for hundreds of years. The oppression of scientists, such as Galileo and Copernicus, who gave us the first realistic view of the universe despite the pressure from the Church, continues afresh today with renewed vigour. Scientists at the forefront of medical research are being openly attacked by ignorant extremists in several groups, especially the religious right in the US who are even now exercising a malicious influence on politicians. In this country the scientific establishment is routinely under threat on several fronts. It needs defence, preferably from the very top of society.",
