        "background": "Every two weeks or so, the price of fuel at petrol stations has increased. As the major petrol station companies have made billions of pounds in profit, it should be only fair for these companies to use their excessive profits to cover the extra costs and tax. The petrol companies can afford to do this, but the consumer cannot. Also, they should only be allowed to increase their prices maximum of twice a year. Price reductions should be unlimited and should decrease when the cost of oil reduces",
