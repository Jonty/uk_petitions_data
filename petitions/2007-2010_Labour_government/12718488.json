            "background": "There are plenty of meta-studies which have failed, to date, to show the efficacy of many complementary/alternative medicines. A national body - similar to NICE - should determine whether any applicant organisation or individual has made a case for the efficacy of their treatments. In the absence of such accreditation, organisations or individuals making claims about their product or treatment should have to declare that they are \"not accredited\". This would offer the public some protection from false claims, and offer critics of the treatments some protection under libel laws.",
