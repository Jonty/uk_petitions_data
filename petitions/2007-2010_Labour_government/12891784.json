            "background": "This petition asks the Prime Minister to refuse to recognise any government installed by the military of Honduras and announce that all British trade with and aid to Honduras will be suspended until the elected President of Honduras is restored to power.\n\nThe military in Honduras have overthrown the elected President of Honduras, Jose Manuel Zelaya, after he attempted to hold a referendum on changing the 1982 constitution of Honduras which limited Presidents to a single term in office.\n\nThis constitution was written at a time when Honduras was notionally a democracy but in fact opposition supporters were murdered by military death squads, with the tacit approval of the Reagan administration and then US ambassador to Honduras John Negroponte. It is unusual in democracies for a head of government to be prevented from standing for more than one term and it is not undemocratic to change a constitution if a majority vote to do so in a referendum.",
