            "background": "I have been involved in a police incident where it has come to my attention that police constables are allowed to complete witness statements together to ensure no details are overlooked.  I have been informed this is as one police constable might forget something that the other may have remembered and this was making it difficult to administer justice.  However, if one police constable forgets something that the other one remembers i do not see this to be a problem as certain details might be overlooked in a long incident.  It is only if statements become inconsistent should there be anxieties.  Now this is a different problem all together than just forgetting a fact in an incident.  This will never be the case if police constables are quite regularly completing witness statements together.  It seems justice is not a given right, but one we must all fight for.  I urge you to support this very important issue as innocent people could be in prison as we speak",
