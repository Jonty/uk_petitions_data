            "background": "As with the current heating allowance, people receive it as a payment directly to their bank accounts. I have heard of pensioners using this money towards alcohol, trips out etc. Then complain that they cannot afford to heat their homes. The heating allowance is designed to pay for heating during the winter. To make the payments go towards heating, the govt need to introduce a voucher so it can only be redeemed for paying/crediting heating bills. Pensioners will need either to present the voucher with an energy bill to pay at a post office or bank. Or they phone their energy provider's call centre and quote the unique voucher number.\n\nThis voucher scheme will prevent the money being spent elsewhere and reduce fuel poverty.",
