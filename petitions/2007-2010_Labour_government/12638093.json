David Cameron is now saying that the vote for the new Mr Speaker should be held in secret.  WHY, we the people need to know who voted for what or for whom.  WHY should anything which is done on our behalf as routine business in the House of Commons be shrouded in secrecy.  Secrecy has been used in the past merely to avoid embarrassment for successive government failures and personal failures of elected representatives and this must be stopped.  We are paying for it, we have a right to know what is going on!",
