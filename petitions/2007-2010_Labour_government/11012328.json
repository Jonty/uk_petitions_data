            "background": "The poorest in this land are being screwed by the financial institutions of this country in their rush to recoup the losses of their failed activities and fundamentally flawed decisions of recent times, despite that they have been given billions of taxpayer pounds to bail them out.  The government has access to endless amounts of cash - as it so admirably demonstrates every day through its overseas grants and military adventures into the Middle East (nothing yet benefitting directly the people who are putting up the money, like access to new medications for the seriously ill or improved transport facilities to enable people to get to any work they might have).  These are unusual times, Gordon tells us, so let him do something unusual and, for a change, directly help the poorly paid taxpayers of this land.  My last pension annual rise on 1 April gave me GBP3.49p per week net.  Tax changes introduced on 1 October now take back GBP12.50p per week net - the latest IMPROVEMENT to the tax regime in this country was the cause.",
