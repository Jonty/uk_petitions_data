        "background": "Most children watch television at some point in their day. Nowadays numerous tv channels provide a huge range of childrens' entertainment in varying quality. When approriately supervised and moderated this is a popular and welcomed method, trusted by parents which allows them a brief respite. Yet every time our children watch favourite programmes they are faced with the relentless bombardment of commercials advertising every possible toy and latest electronic gadget This is an outrageous abuse of parents' trust not to mention our children who are so vulnerable and hugely influenced by TV.  As with Junk Food advertising, if this exploitation and overwhelming emphasis on acquiring material things continues it will cause untold harm to millions of children and place additional and avoidable pressure on UK families. I urge the Government to support UK families by banning the relentless advertising of toys and merchandise on childrens' tv. It is a deliberate and systematic exploitation of our children. Please support my petition for a complete ban. Vulnerable children and families stand to gain a a huge amount from from such effective action.\n\n\nYour sincerely\n\nRobert Cowan",
