            "background": "Some financial institutions such as RBS have a policy of dismissing employees for not managing their personal finances and in the event of an employee being declared bankrupt it is gross misconduct.\n\nHow can a bank that is in effect bankrupt due to terrible financial conduct be allowed to enforce such a policy. Banks should have a social responsibility to support their employees through these difficult times. \n\nNow that most banks are 'owned' by taxpayers, lets bring policies into the new age and adapt to economic climates.",
