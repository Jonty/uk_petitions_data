        "background": "The Performing Rights Society harass small business owners to buy an annual Music Licence from them if they play any kind of Broadcast music on their premises. This includes small shops, workshops, garages, hairdressers and many more. They claim this is to support artists and songwriters. The reality is that artists and songwriters, that are any good, earn much more than average through royalties paid by recording sales, concerts and radio stations. It should be a basic right for small businesses to operate a licence paid radio set without making further payment to the PRS. The current legislation which allows the PRS to raise revenue by threat of legal action should be abolished as it is out of date and irrelavent to today's music industry.",
