            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current and proposed changes to the road fund licence are completely unfair and bear no relationship to the mileage and therefore the emissions from a car. It is simply a duty on owning the car. I propose, retaining a minimum fee for the tax disc of \u00a320 (no 6mth option, no refund of tax option)for every car, including classic and disabled cars. Retaining a tax disc is favoured by the police and is a good mechanism to check insurance status & presence of an MOT. The remainder of duty should then be collected by adding 15p per litre to fuel. 15ppl & \u00a320 for the tax disc would raise approx \u00a3200 per average driver of 10,000 miles PA @ 40mpg, high mileage drivers would pay more, low mileage less. Tax paid would bear a direct relationship to emmisions, foreign drivers would also contribute. This is the only fair and green way to tax emissions. Pensioners doing minimal mileage would only pay a fair tax, company representatives doing tens of thousands of miles would pay proportionately.",
