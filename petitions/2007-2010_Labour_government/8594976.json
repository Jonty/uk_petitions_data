            "background": "As well as the distribution of music and films, there are other far more serious problems that have grown on the internet without any intervention by police or otherwise.\n\nI implore that the standing prime minister should give more resources and infrastructure on this matter, to stop child pornography on the internet and all forms of child abuse, and re-assess the current penalties that these crimes consequence to. They need to review and do more to catch these people on the net, including shutting down of any sites that have such things and collaborating with p2p programs to catch them. From the news everyone in UK, especially the government should realize that re-hab is not working, and life imprisonment or other chemical altering drugs are the only solution.\n\nI and I hope everyone that signs this petition, will not stand down and be de-sensitized by the cases of child abuse happening before our eyes and let these things happen to the most vulnerable part of our society. Lets do something about it, and now.",
