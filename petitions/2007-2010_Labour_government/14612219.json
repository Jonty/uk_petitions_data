However, if I leave my employer or retire I cannot renew my membership and most people aren't eligible as only certain employers are eligible.  In the US anyone can join as long as they pay the membership fee, but, in the UK the major supermarkets challenged that and won, this isn't fair and is against our human rights to shop where we like. The major supermarkets already do well enough out of us and need a bit more competition, neither Tesco nor Sainsbury are going to go out of business because of Costco.  I would like the freedom to shop where I like in this country.   Make Costco membership available to everyone who wants it.",
