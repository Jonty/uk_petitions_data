            "background": "The Right Honourable Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\nGiven the current situation in Zimbabwe we are asking you to consider an amnesty for Zimbabweans that are currentlly in the United Kingdom.   Given the fact that Zimbabwe is now a war zone a country that has been isolated by the world and the imminent sanctions that are earmarked to put the country in a much worse state.  We are kindly asking you to give Zimbabweans an amnesty to stay in the UK.  We are also asking you to allow those people that are still waiting a decision from the Home office the right to work so that they can support their families back in Zimbabwe bearing in mind the fact that all food aid has been suspended into Zimbabwe by the Mugabe regime. Zimbabwean people are hard working and asking you to use your authority by allowing Zimbabweans to contribute to the economy during these harsh economic times by allowing them to work.  We understand that previous governments have declared amnesty to the people of other politically ravaged countries and as such we have confidence in you and your government that you can do the same for the Zimbabweans that have been affected by the Mugabe regime.",
