        "background": "I realise this petition has been made before but I believe this is testament to the view of the British public. Whenever the football is on the television, or else at important occasions, I always cringe when our national anthem is sung. It is not that I do not appreciate or value the monarchy, simply that we have a far better anthem in Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance march. What with 2012 fast approaching, and the expectation for us to win gold medals, I feel it would be much better if the crowds joined together to sing what cannot be denied to be a far more rousing, patriotic, and tuneful chorus. I hope you will view this as a serious request, and one that is at least worth putting to the vote.",
