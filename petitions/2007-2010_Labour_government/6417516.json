            "background": "To scrap the Healthy eating grant (2009).The government is not going to persuade people to eat healthy food by giving out money to individuals. There will always be people who have no interest in healthy eating, A good example of this is the group of mothers who took orders for junk food outside the school gates rather than encouraging their children to eat well.\nWhat would they spend their \u00a3120 on?\nIf you are the type of person who eats healthy food \u00a3120 will not change anything and if you are not well, it's a good night out and a takeaway.\nI find it difficult when in one days newspaper there is not enough money to pay for drugs to save peoples sight yet a week or two later there is \u00a370-80 million going spare to fund something that common sense could cure.",
