        "background": "I declare that the UK bans all discrimination of any kind.\n\nNo one should be given any preferential treatment of any kind, regardless of race, age, sex, gender, etc.\n\nAll people should be based on merit on what is best and not on anything else.\n\nNo one should be employed on any basis other than merit and are they best for the position, and not to meet government do-gooders requirements that they feel an area is under represented... \n\nin the long term under representation will correct itself and does not need government interference which in my opinion brings trouble and only fuels groups like the BNP\n\nBetter to act for long term than short term measures which will only fuel resentment.\n\nThis should be done for all walks of life, not just in the work place.\n\nIn addition to this I feel groups set up for certain areas and specific types of people should be banned, as a \"white Male group\" would be found to be both sexist and racists (and rightly so), so for example a \"Female Black Group\" should also be, or asian groups, etc.  These should be illegal and not promoted by the government.\n\nBy doing this it would ensure all groups are open and improve integration and not segregation.",
