            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The top winning prize money should be  limited to \u00a31,000,000 (One million pounds) and not given as one large prize amount. Should the prize fund be, for example \u00a323,000.000 on a particular weekly draw, further draws could be made making 22 other entrants eligable for a \u00a31,000,000 win. This I feel would encourage more donations to be made towards the Lottery Fund due to the public being given more chances of becoming a millionair. One Million Pounds would assist any entrant to the Lottery and give them a better life style",
