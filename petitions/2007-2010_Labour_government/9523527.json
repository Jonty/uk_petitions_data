            "background": "We believe UK households & businesses should have the right to choose whether or not they have a phonebook delivered to their doorstep. 75,000 tonnes of business and residential directories are produced every year. In the age of the Internet, for many people phonebooks are used rarely, if ever. The environmental cost of landfill and the water and fuel used in their production, distribution and recycling is completely unjustified in this day and age. We're asking for a centralised opt-out system for phonebooks, very similar to the mail preference service",
