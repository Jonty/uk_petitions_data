            "background": "Ive heard today of a new Green Tax which is supposed to add at least \u00a3230 on home utility bills, why are we being taxed again when we can't afford the bills we have to pay already.  This country is losing all respect for this government and the government seem to have no respect for the public, we need some action here, and if everyone finally petitioned and spoke their mind, we, remember, employ the government, not the other way round, our money is ours, not theirs.  Green tax is another way for us to pay for the wind turbines, solar panels, just like adding \u00a32 pounds to our telephone bill to pay for broadband the companies cant be bothered to connect, petition this green tax to be abolished for good, or we will be paying not just the debts but living in poverty because we're paying for everyone else, including those who sit on state benefit.",
