        "action": "Remove the FSA's statutory powers to place freezing orders on, or seize assets of non-regulated UK companies",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, petition the Prime Minister to remove all powers held by the Financial Services Authority to freeze assets of companies which are not regulated by the FSA.\n\nThe newly formed Cameron Farley Action Group, which is seeking legal action against the FSA for their apparent reckless behaviour with regard to client monies held in Cameron Farley Ltd, have discovered that on 2nd September 2008 the FSA froze the company which clients had invested millions of pounds in, and then presided over the subsequent loss of approximately $17 Million with apparent disregard for clients' interests. Had the FSA not had the powers to take this action then client funds would have been better protected without any FSA involvement taking place. Without the powers they would have had no legal grounds to do so hence our petition to have their powers to place injunctions on non-regulated companies removed immediately.",
