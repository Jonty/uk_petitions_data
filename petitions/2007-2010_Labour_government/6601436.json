The majority of the clients i work with claim over \u00a3200 in DLA, Income Support etc. Many have little or no financial commitments and this Money is often spent on luxury items. Many of my clients have thousands of pounds in the bank and still get high rates of Benefits. Being offered such a large weekly allowance gives my clients no or little motivation to improve there personal situation, find a job or look to the future.",
