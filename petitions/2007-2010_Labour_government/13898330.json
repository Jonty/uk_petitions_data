There should be stricter conditions of use and a better process of reporting and removing of dangerous people from the network. Facebook should take more responsiblitly for the people who use it and should make the site more secure for minors. Facebook is being used by millions so this is a serious issue and at this moment is wide open to abuse. Policeing of the site is needed and restrictions should be set up for children using applications containing adult material. There should be larger penalties in place for extreme violations of terms and conditions. MAKE FACEBOOK SAFE FOR CHILDREN",
