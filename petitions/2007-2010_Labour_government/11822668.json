They said a court had thrown out similar \ncharges in a related case in 2006.\n\n\"There is reasonable suspicion that on the first count (of insurgency, \nterrorism) he committed the offence. He will be placed on remand,\" \nmagistrate Livingstone Chipadza ruled on Wednesday.\nHe dismissed the immigration charge, however.",
