            "background": "Many tenants in the UK are not leaving the landlord's property despite Eviction Notices and so it has to go to court which costs time and money. Because of the difficulties in removing tenants fast in the UK, perhaps because they are damaging the property, making it uninhabitable, perhaps are violent, causing harassment to landlords or neighbours, they need to be removed quickly for the landlord's or neighbour's safety.  Some landlords in the country do not want to let their property any more because it can take up to a year to remove them, often with no rent being paid.  If it is made a criminal offence then rent costs won't have to go up to pay for insurance and landlords can re-let the property quickly and prepare any damage.  Taking up to a year to remove some tenants is unacceptable.",
