            "background": "We the undersigned petition the PM to change the way Incapacity     Benefit is determined following major surgery. Hospital staff     should automatically be allowed to issue a sick note for either     3 months or 6 months depending on the seriousness of the     condition so that patients don't have to queue outside a     doctors surgery in order to obtain a sick note when they should     be recuperating. \n\nThis adds to their stress and sets back     recovery. Incapacity Benefit should automatically be granted     for people with major surgery and they should not have to show     their scars to prove what operations they have had in order to     get a sick note. This system as it stands is a disgrace and     bureaucrats should reconsider the implications of this current     system as it stands. Please please help change it.",
