            "background": "All internet users have a right to be protected from material that has become freely available on the Internet in huge quantities, but is illegal under British law.  This includes pirated music and movie files, extreme violence and hardcore pornography including child abuse.\n\nThe British government should develop and maintain a list of internet sites and services known to host content that is illegal in the UK. British ISPs should then have a statutory obligation to block those sites and services, thereby protecting their customers, particularly children and young people, from unlawful and dangerous material.",
