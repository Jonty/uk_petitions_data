            "background": "Disabled bays designated for Blue Badge holders are being abused by selfish individuals who think it's okay to park in them.  There is no legislastion to prevent this abuse.\nThe disabled bays are infrequently (if ever) monitored, the best that can happen is the offender politely being asked to move, which can be (and often is) ignored.  \nMost people take the attitude that 'it's only for a minute' and lazily park in the bay because it's closer to the door or the cashpoint machine, not thinking if a disabled person drives past and the spaces are all full they have no way of knowing how long that person will be, leaving them little choice but to struggle from a distance or go home.\nWe need to send a clear message that the mis-use of disabled parking bays is unacceptable and illegal,giving a \u00a360 fine will do that.\nThe Scottish Parliment are debating this issue (MSP Jackie Baillie).          \nWhy aren't we?\nPlease sign this petition and get your friends/family and colleagues to do the same and let's make disabled parking bays for the disabled and help make our lives that little bit easier.",
