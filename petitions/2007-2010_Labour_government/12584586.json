        "background": "The British public expect their members of parliament to act honourably, honestly and with high standing of morals in the way they conduct business.  It is unacceptable that they have claimed expenses for items that are not true to the spirit of the second home allowance.   \n\nTo claim their actions were within the rules is totally unacceptable!  The actions of these MP\u2019s have tainted all members of the House of Commons as:\n\nThieves, crooks, benefit cheats, scumbags, liars, dirty, dishonest, fraudsters, etc\n\nFurthermore the trust, respect and integrity of the House of Commons have been washed in the mud.\n\nThe British people expect the allowances will be changed so the MP\u2019s will not cheat the system again.  Taxpayer also expects their money back from those that have ripped of the British public to benefit themselves!",
