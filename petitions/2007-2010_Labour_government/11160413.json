        "background": "Currently Scotland only pay \u00a35.00 per item for the their prescriptions, where we in England have to bare a cost of \u00a37.10. By April 2011 Scotland will have abolished their charges altogether. \nMy question is why can't our Government do this. Maybe if they stopped funding the Scottish Government every year and paid a little more attention to England's current financial situation we wouldn't be in the mess we are in.\nPlease support this cause, the more signatures we get the greater the chance of getting through to the Prime Minister.",
