Common law marrages are not recognised by this draconian institution.  Many number of ex service men wish to re-enlist often at a considerable cut in wages, but are unable to do so as they are unable to bring there families with them, and as the wages offered by the forces are so poor private renting is not a finacialy viable option.  The forces are undermanned are seriously lacking in experienced staff, buy not recognising common law marrages they are they are seriously reducing the number of not only re-enlistments but inital recruits.  How can the forces expect a soldier to risk his life and give his fully loyalty and support to them when they don't return the favour?",
