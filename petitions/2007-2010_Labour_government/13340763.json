            "background": "Any petition with more than 6000 (roughly 0.1% of the population) signatures should be held as a national referendum.  The reason for this is many petitons with a great amount of signatures are being ignored even if they are in the interest of the people.  To hold a national referendum for every petition would mean people voting all the time, but having an opportunity every month for people to vote on petiton that have more than 6000 signatures would be true democracy.",
