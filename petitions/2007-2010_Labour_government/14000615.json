            "background": "History plays a crucial role in Bangladesh-Pakistan relations. Bangladesh had won its independence from Pakistan after waging the War of Liberation in 1971. Bangladesh has suffered a lot during that period and rightly expects an unconditional apology from Pakistan for the action of its army.\n\nAfter 38 years, Pakistan has yet to express an apology of any sort or accept the war crimes that have been committed. The Hamoodur Commission, set up by the then Government, had concluded that members of the Pakistani army bore responsibility for various crimes. Pakistan is not known to have provided any form of compensation for the harm inflicted or for rehabilitation purposes, to Bangladesh or to any of the victims. We would like the British Government to remind Pakistan that they owe a national apology for the war crimes committed to Bangladesh.",
