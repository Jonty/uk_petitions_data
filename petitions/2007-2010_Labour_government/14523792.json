            "background": "The 19 state African Elephant Coalition are asking the European Union to take a clear stance in support of a nine-year moratorium adopted in 2007 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).  \n\nTanzania would like to be able to sell 90 tonnes of ivory, and Zambia a further 22 tonnes.  Both need permission from CITES when it next meets in Doha, Qatar, from March 13 to 25 to be able to do this and the EU's stance is crucial to the decision that CITES will make.\n\nAny move to abstain from the vote would signal the demise of thousands of African Elephants, not to mention both Black and White Rhino species.  Sierra Leone has just announced the killing of it's last Elephants and ten Elephants were massacred in Chad last week where the Elephant population has dwindled from around 6,000 to about 600 in the past few years alone.\n\nThe EU should NOT support the trade in ivory products and Britain should be instrumental in the push for the trade ban to be maintained",
