        "background": "More and more employers are recruiting temporary workers rather than permanent staff. The temporary worker has little rights in the workplace and can find themselves out of a job where no reason has to be given for their dismissal within the probationary period. Better rights and working conditions need to be given with regard to how temporary workers are treated with regard to pay and holiday entitlement. There should be a maximum term for which the employer should be allowed to have temp staff before making them permanent. Too many jobs these days are temporary with a \"view\" to becoming permanent, which is not often the case. People need job security, which is difficult when these people leave one temp job to be in another temp job, as that is the only work they can get.",
