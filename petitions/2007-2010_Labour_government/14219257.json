        "background": "We, the undersigned would like St. Pancras to give our Residents Concessional tickets and support them gain opportunities to explore other Economic choices that Europe has to offer plus giving them opportunities to learn foreign languages & gain better understanding of foreign cultures. The economic oversight causes our young people to feel desolate in their own Community & its progress. Our situation not only creates undesirable opportunistic risks for the Residents; but also undermines our low-income Residents. We believe that the Regeneration should benefit the whole Community and for this reason; we would like you, to ask Camden Council & St. Pancras on our behalf to make provisions for Travel Concessions for our Residents.  We believe this support is vital for our community if they are to gain a positive advantage in Europe. We urge you to support our petition and remind ST. Pancras International to uphold the promises they made in the Neighborhood Renewal Consultations processes.",
