        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Mercury is a highly toxic substance. It's used in dental cavity fillings for millions of people (including children).\n\nIt's scientifically known that mercury vapour escapes, & small amounts are passed into the bloodstream and organs.\n\nAs people with these fillings eat & drink, mercury is being swallowed. As they breathe traces of mercury vapour can be inhaled. Brushing one\u2019s teeth will also cause the emission of mercury to increase.\n\nThe world's biggest health regulator warned that mercury fillings can be dangerous. Despite this, the British Department of Health ignores the risks.\n\nMercury has been implicated in the cause of Arthritis, Lupus, MS, ME, Dementia (PSP, Alzheimer's & Parkinsons), heart conditions & infertility.\n\nDentists have been found to have high levels of mercury in their bodies and hundreds of practices in Britain now refuse to offer mercury fillings.\n\nSeveral European countries have banned mercury in fillings.\n\nAs a British citizen, concern still remains: Dental surgeries are STILL putting the highly toxic Mercury, into people's mouths and many are unaware of any of the dangers and possible side effects.",
