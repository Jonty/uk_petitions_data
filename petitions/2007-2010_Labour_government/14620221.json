            "background": "Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are different - but the media treats both conditions as the same. Articles complaining of burdensome diabetics draining NHS resources are harmful and hurtful and are refering to patients with often preventable Type 2 diabetes, but the media frequently fail to make this distinction prefering the single term diabetics. Understanding of diabetes is most associated with Type 2. Renaming Type 1 diabetes would allow for a clear distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. There are also possible socio economic advantages to sufferers of Type 1 if a change of name took place as the seriousness and clear distinction between the majority of Type 2 diabetics and the minority of Type 1 sufferers was recognised and understood, including the 2010 debated and implemented Blue Badge Scheme in Wales which failed to recognise type 1 diabetics as benifactors of the updated scheme, not forgetting the ability to easily and clearly ringfence and identify funding to the specific Type rather than to diabetes in general.\nThere are approximately 2.6 million diabetics in the UK and of these it is estimated that 350,000 have Type 1.",
