            "background": "I installed my first wind turbine on a pole set in concrete, only to find because it exceeded 3m in height, i needed to pay 135 pounds planning permission with NO guarantee of success.  Reducing it to 3 metres meant it does NOT make any meaningfull power. \n\nMy garden is a more efficient place for the turbine than on house due to having less wind turbulance.\n\nHowever, i also feel that turbines on houses should be able to go beyond the peak of the roof at least 10ft before needing planning consent which should make it easier for homeowners wanting to install domestic turbines.",
