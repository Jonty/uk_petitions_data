        "background": "Australian Developer Multiplex Stannifer (the builder of Wembley Stadium) has appealed against the East Cambridgeshire planning decision to reject the Mereham development. A public inquiry commences on 9th October 2007 and we need as many people as possible to oppose the plans which would create a new town the size of Ely on farmland south of the A1123, west of the A10, east of the Twentypence Road and north of the Great Ouse between Stretham and Wilburton.\n\nSuch a huge development would irrevocably change the rural nature of the surrounding villages, cause further traffic overload and hazard on the already congested A10, A1123 and A14 and stretch local services to breaking point. The Multiplex Stannifer plans are for predictable high-density Noddy houses that do nothing to reflect the qualities and traditions of the local villages - yet more banal, unimaginative architecture of the type that blights so much of our country. \n\nPLEASE support our petition to protect the precious landscape, infrastructure and community of this part of East Cambridgeshire.",
