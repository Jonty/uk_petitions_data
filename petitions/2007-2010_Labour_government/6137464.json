        "background": "Rather than education and debate designed to inform free choice, modern Government seems to favour banning activities of which it does not approve.  \n\nThis removes choices and the opportunities citizens have to learn from those choices.  It restricts their experiences and, often, bans have unfortunate and unintended consequences.  \n\nWe believe it is time to allow the UK's citizens to make informed choices without bans.",
