            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current legislation (ref. DfT website) states that while bicycles that are used during the hours of darkness MUST be fitted with a headlamp, there is no such requirement for bicycles that are used only during daylight hours. This arrangement is clearly open to abuse, since hundreds of thousands of \"daytime\" cycles are regularly used at night-time. This poses serious dangers on the roads, not just to the cyclists but to all motorists during the hours of darkness.  A cyclist with no lights on at night is  virtually invisible, yet is still allowed to use public roads at the same time as motorists, who are expected to have fully functioning lighting. If a bicycle is classed as transport, then it should be subject to the same lighting requirements as other vehicles.\nIf the government is serious about encouraging the use of bicycles then the law should be upgraded to provide better protection for cyclists and other road and pavement users. The compulsory fitting of headlamps to all bicycles of all ages, irrespective of whether they are used in the day or night-time, is thus called for.",
