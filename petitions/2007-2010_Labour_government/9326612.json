            "background": "The UK has been seeking for some years to deport a number of individuals whom it alleges pose a threat to national security. It has acknowledged that these individuals could not ordinarily be deported, because of the real risk of grave human rights violations that they would face in the countries to which they are to be returned.\n\nThe UK government has therefore sought, in each of these cases, so-called \u2018diplomatic assurances\u2019 from the countries to which these individuals are to be returned that the individual will be treated in accordance with international human rights standards. These promises are unenforceable in any court of law.\n\nTo allow a person to return to a country where they may be subject to torture or flagrantly unfair trials, contravenes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and as such, measures should be taken to prevent it altogether.",
