        "background": "Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic auto-immune disease.  Sufferers are not currently entitled to a free flu vaccination if they are under retirement age. After retirement age they are called in automatically and funded.  \n\nDoctors do not stock enough vaccine to provide their rheumatoid patients with a vaccination as the vaccines are government funded.\n\nThis also applies to receipt of the swine flu vaccine when available.\n\nThis petition is particularly relevant to anyone who takes prescription drugs to control their rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAs a group with an auto-immune disease we should be treated the same as other groups with auto-immune diseases who are entitled to the vaccination.",
