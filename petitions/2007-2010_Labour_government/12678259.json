        "background": "Caravans, towed by vehicles clog the roads of rural Britain and create additional congestion on rural \"A\" roads. There are limited amounts of dual carriageways and it can be infuriating to drive at no more than 40 miles per hour when stuck behind a caravan. Each caravan takes up additional road space and thus should be subject to road tax. Such revenues created by imposing a levy upon caravans could be used to improve the general condition of the roads throughout Britain.\n\nLike many other luxury goods, caravans should be subject to taxation!",
