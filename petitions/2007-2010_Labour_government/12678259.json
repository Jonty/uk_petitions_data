There are limited amounts of dual carriageways and it can be infuriating to drive at no more than 40 miles per hour when stuck behind a caravan. Each caravan takes up additional road space and thus should be subject to road tax. Such revenues created by imposing a levy upon caravans could be used to improve the general condition of the roads throughout Britain.\n\nLike many other luxury goods, caravans should be subject to taxation!",
