        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We hear talk of how the British do not spend enough quality time with their families: parents always absent due to their work commitments. Why do we then penalize parents when they take their children on holiday during term time? How strange we British are! Travelling abroad or within the UK to enjoy some quality time when we can afford it is frowned upon! We \"have to\" take our children on holiday when we are ordered to, in order to line the pockets of the travel industry! Where is the justice in such a law? Let's ALL enjoy the luxury of a holiday with our children. Rich and poor alike! Is this luxury only for the rich in this country? THE CHEAPEST HOLIDAYS ARE UNFORTUNATELY WHILST OUR KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL! The British work the longest hours in Europe! The British are NOT ALLOWED to spend an enjoyable couple of weeks with their children when it is most affordable! Mr Brown, you are a family man so please read this and consider my words.",
