        "background": "There are some 5.5 million British expatriates (source: IPPR), nearly one in 10 of the population. They represent a wide cross section - from students to pensioners. Many are Britain's unofficial ambassadors abroad and a significant proportion remain British taxpayers for the whole of the time they are overseas. The majority have close family and other ties back in the UK. All have the right to vote in UK general elections and European parliamentary elections in the UK. This sector's affairs, concerns and interests, hitherto sorely neglected, should be looked after by a dedicated Ministry providing expertise, information and support in all areas including civil rights, health, finance and legal matters.",
