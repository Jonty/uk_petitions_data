        "background": "I am making this petition because of personal circumstances and that of many of my family and friends. \n It seems that young people (under 25) are only entitled to tax credits or ANY other kind of financial aid, if they are on low incomes, when they have children! what kind of incentive if this for young people to better themselves and work at careers.\nI earn \u00a35,000 p/a. Yes 5K! that is it. \nlike many other in this country, i can not afford to live properly. And yet because i am only 21 years of age and have no children, i am not entitles to any kind of help. Not tax credits, not help with my ridiculously high council tax, or my rent or anything! This is wrong.\nWhere is the help for the majority of people ages 16-25 who actually want to do something with their lives?!\nor should we all go and have children and develope drug addictions in order to get any financial aid?!",
