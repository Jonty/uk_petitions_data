            "background": "since the drinking hours were extended in public houses selling alcohol. i have to put up with disorderly drunks returning home from the public house between midnight and 5.00am. during this period i cannot get any sleep to get up in the morning. due to these minority of people, i am unable to sustain long term employment, despite all the efforts from my doctor and the job centre to help me off long term sick (9 years) and back into work. i am unable to move because there are no council homes available and the police take too long to respond to catch the culprits.",
