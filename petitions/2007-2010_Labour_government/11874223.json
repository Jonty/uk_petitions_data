            "background": "Do you know that teachers are now allowed PPA time, contact time and directive time during their long working day!!!!Some teachers manage to leave school before their pupils @ 3.30pm. They should be IN SCHOOL doing these other jobs between 3.30-5pm daily. They should also only have 5 weeks holiday like every one else, this would give them plenty of time to plan and prepare.I have yet to meet a teacher that admits to staying at work til 5pm.This doesn't include Heads, Deputy Heads and Year Heads who are generally more contactable.",
