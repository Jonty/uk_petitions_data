        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A businessman, Munir Hussain has been jailed for attacking a burglar who held his family hostage and threatened to kill him in his own home. \nWhen Hussain\u2019s teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he turned on his captors. One, Walid Salem, was cornered and with the help of his brother, Hussain set upon him the court heard. \nSentencing, Judge John Reddihough said it was his \u201cpublic duty\u201d to jail Hussain. He said that people should not be permitted to inflict \"their own instant and violent punishment\". \nWhilst Hussain was sentenced to 30 months, Salem who has 50 convictions was allowed to go free to  return to a life of crime and has since been charged with credit card fraud.  \nIs this the standard of justice that British citizens can expect,  where a career criminal can break into your home, take you and your family hostage whilst making threats to kill and yet retain their liberty?\nWe deserve better. Munir Hussain deserves better and should be freed immediately.\nI am not affiliated with the Hussain family in any way but was so incensed at the injustice they have suffered that I was compelled to start this petition.",
