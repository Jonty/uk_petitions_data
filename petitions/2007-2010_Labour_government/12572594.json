Some of the claims that have been made my MP\u2019s recently could have resulted in disciplinary action had those MP\u2019s made their claims whilst working for a company in the \u2018real world\u2019.\n\nWe require that the Government create a well funded, permanent and transparent public body consisting of members who are not and have never been a Member of Parliamentnor an employee of an MP.\n\nThis body would have the right to request all expenses submitted by MP's.  The body would be obliged to investigate all claims and administer disciplinary action against MP's who have made false or misleading claims.  This body would also be required to publicly publish its findings (it would not publish details of MP\u2019s where no misconduct has been proven).",
