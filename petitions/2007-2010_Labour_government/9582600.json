            "background": "The trend to replace the normal 'armco' solid central reservation barrier with the cheaper steel cable wire barrier is a serious problem. This cable with steel post uprights is tantamount to murder if a motorcyclist was involved in an accident and collided with it! In this day and age of \"Health & Safety\" it is unbelievable that it has been passed by the Highway authorities!? Surely this infringes on the human rights as it will effect the choice of transport, and influence the purchase away from a 'dangerous' motorcycle to a nice 'safe' car! This is another biased attack on two wheeled transport! Motorcycles are cheaper and more efficient to run than most cars and also the carbon footprint (CO2 emmissions) are much lower, but the Road Fund Licence (tax) is still over \u00a360 for a +600cc bike?",
