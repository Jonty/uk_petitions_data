            "background": "The Scouting Association has introduced a policy that only allows Scouts to carry knives if there is a specific need.\nThe reason given was that the law is too confusing and risks legal trouble.\nClearly it is legal for Scouts to carry knives as they have been doing so for years, so we ask for you to clarify the law to allow Scouts to again have the right to carry knives, and allow the trust given to them by oath to be upheld.",
