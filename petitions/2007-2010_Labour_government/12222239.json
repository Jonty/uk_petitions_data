            "background": "Cigarettes contain an unbelievable cocktail of chemicals and metals ie: Polonium_210 (highly radioactive element)  Acrolein (formerly used as a chemical weapon)  Hydrazine (very toxic chemical used mainly in rocket fuel) plus Arsenic, Cadmium, Lead, Nickel etc etc! \nIt is beyond belief that in this day and age of health and safety gone mad and the government's so called initiatives to help people become healthier they still permit cigarette companies to add poisons to tobacco, which in other circumstances such as food, fertilizer etc would have been banned already. I believe there would be fewer smoking related deaths and illnesses without these highly toxic and dangerous chemicals. It is not enough to say people should give up as there are a lot of people that find it extremely difficult to give up and those that simply don't want to.\nI don't believe there is any possible excuse not to ban them immediately.",
