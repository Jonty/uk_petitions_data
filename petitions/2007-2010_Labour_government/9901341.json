            "background": "Currently there is no limit on the age of which one can stop driving. You are able to renew the licence with very limited tests. Reaction time, restricted head movement, eye sight and judgement are all factors that affect elderly drivers on the road. I think it should be the law that when a driver reaches 65 they have to re-take their driving test, and every 5 years after this. This would be government funded. This would reduce the amount of accidents on the road. Some elderly drivers have never even taken a driving test. The law needs to be changed.",
