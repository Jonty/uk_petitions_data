            "background": "Following the Laeken European summit in 2001 the Commission reported \nthat pensioners receiving less than 60% of the National Average Wage were at \nrisk of living in poverty. The UK government signed a commitment ensuring \nthat older people are not placed at risk of poverty and can enjoy a decent \nstandard of living.\n      With the exception of the UK, all other countries are adhering to this \nundertaking, while the UK pension is just 16% of \nthe national average wage.\n\n      It is a fact that 1.4 million pensioners are known to be living in \npoverty. Many receive an income that excludes them from seeking financial \nhelp from the state.\n      UK pensioners are subject to means tests unlike their European \ncounterparts. This is a demeaning system.\n\n      On behalf of UK pensioners may I ask you to call on the Government and \nall politicians to urgently recognise the needs and value of pensioners. \nThis would ensure that promises made in 2001 are implemented without delay \nso that by 2011 - ten years after the promise was made - the State Pension \nwill have reached 60% of the National Average Wage.",
