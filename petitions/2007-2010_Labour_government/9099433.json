Around 90% of people do not know that ISA regulations will be changing from the start of the new tax year, including 29% of the people who currently have one of the tax-free savings vehicles, according to online broker Selftrade.\n\nFrom April 6, the maximum amount people can pay into an ISA each year will increase from \u00a37,000 to \u00a37,200, of which \u00a33,600 can be paid into a cash ISA, compared with \u00a33,000 now.\n\nPlease explain :\n\n1. The distinction the two types of ISA: cash ISAs and stocks and shares ISAs.\n\n2. If \"people will be able to transfer funds held in cash ISAs into stocks and shares ISAs without using up any of their annual allowance, while people with Child Trust Funds will be able to convert them into an ISA on their 18th birthday\", how does this benefit the population ? \n\n3. Why 62% of people in the UK do not have an ISA ?",
