He has also stated that he would be happy to do so.\n\nAs the former head of the UN Weapons Inspector teams responsible for searching for the alleged Iraq WMDs Mr Blix is uniquely placed to present pertinent and detailed evidence to the inquiry team. \n\nIt is inconceivable that such a key player in the build up to the conflict should not be questioned at an inquiry into that conflict.  \n\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister to ensure that Mr Blix is summoned as a witness and his evidence heard.",
