        "background": "I am disgusted at the complete ignorance this government is showing in respect to the numerous petitions at the No. 10 site. Several petitions have called for a reduction in fuel duty, all of which have met with the same ignorant response that \"fuel duty is just one of a number of factors contributing to the price\" and that \"fuel prices remain a matter for the supplier and in effect are nothing to do with the government\". Do you think we are stupid? The fact of the matter is that the government is taxing fuel at a rate of around 70% of the retail price. Such high levels of tax must be passed on to the consumer, suppliers cannot be expected to foot this bill alone. The point is that fuel duty is far too high and that public transport is not a viable alternative to many people. We demand a reasonable response to our calls for a reduction on fuel duty.",
