This is the second huge case in a short time where they have sat aside & let another child be tortured & killed by their carers (the first was Victoria Climbie 8 years ago).\nMore laws need to be put in place for Child Services, more needs to be done to protect these young, innocent children from further abuse & in the worst case, death.\nWe urge the Prime Minister to look into this & do something about this problem which it seems will only get worse over time.",
