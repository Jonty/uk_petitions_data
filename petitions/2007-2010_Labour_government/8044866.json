            "background": "Representatives of foreign governments and their family members are knowingly committing crimes - including rape and murder - in this country because our government lacks the moral fortitude to remove diplomatic immunity and treat the perpetrators as the common criminals they are.  Diplomatic immunity is seen, by the representatives of 3rd world countries in this country, as a licence to commit crime, with impunity, outside the bounds of the law of the law in their own country.  Diplomatic immunity needs to be abolished and needs to be  abolished immediately.",
