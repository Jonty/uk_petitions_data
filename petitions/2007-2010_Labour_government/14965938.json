            "background": "Margaret Hodge has a dismally poor record when it comes to taking the advice of experts at EH and the 20thC society on matters related to 20thC architecture... Preston Bus Station and Birmingham Central Library have both recently been turned down for listing by Margaret Hodge, despite recommendations from EH. \n\nEnglish Heritage recommended Birmingham library be listed Grade II. But the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment disagreed, and its apparently influential role in Ms Hodge's decision has alarmed Twentieth Century Society director, Catherine Croft. \"Cabe does not have any historic building expertise,\" she said.\n\nShe said that the Culture minister had given too much weight to public and commercial opinions.",
