It seems that our civil liberties are being eroded before our eyes in the name of \"security\", what with mass surveillance, proposed internet and email recording, and even car tracking! And the people are powerless to stop it. It frightens me to think what this country may be like ten years from now.\n\nThe 1688 Bill of Rights was designed to stop this sort of madness and protect democracy and liberty, we need it back before its too late.\n\n\nPS, if it so happens that this petition proves to be popular, yet the Prime Minister still decides against it (as is what happens so often with other popular petitions on this site), then that will only confirm that democracy in this country is indeed dead. Its time to listen to your people, Mr Brown.",
