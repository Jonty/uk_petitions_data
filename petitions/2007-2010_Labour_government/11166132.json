Yet of ALL the petitions I have signed, the Government, be it Tony Blair's or Gordon Brown 's, have never acted on one of them and they have just paid lip-service to them all.\n\nI propose that this web site is a complete waste of time and it may as well be closed down for all the good it does, because the Government NEVER act on any of the concerns raised on it by the Public and quite frankly don't seem to care.",
