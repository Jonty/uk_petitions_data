We are well served by local independant traders who are competitively priced and cater for all our needs.\n\nWe do however need our community pub. It is the focal point of our estate, to meet friends, family, acquaintances. It offers support to the old and vunerable and enhances our lives: football teams, pool teams, dart teams, dominoes, family days, disadvantaged kids club. Its closure would fracture a once tight knit community with no venue to meet and stay in touch.",
