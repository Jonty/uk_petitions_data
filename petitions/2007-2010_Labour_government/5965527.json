            "background": "Councils across the UK are increasing road closure charges made to organisations wishing to hold parades in their local towns at such a rate that they are now jeopardising such parades as Remembrance Day, which are of national importance.\n\nWhilst health and safety issues are of course important, the charges for road closures are growing at an alarming rate, in one area alone from \u00a3300 per road to \u00a3800, and as such are forcing such important events to have to be scrapped as they are simply unaffordable.\n\nNational pride should not have to be measured on affordability - and therefore it is requested that Councils be asked to consider either greatly reducing or scrapping entirely road closure charges for such events as Remembrance Day.",
