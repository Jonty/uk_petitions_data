            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It seems logically unfair that some people pay to off-set their vehicle's carbon emissions, on an annual basis, and yet they still have to pay the full road-fund licence amount which has been imposed specifically because of the emissions of vehicles. Some people may pay anything up to \u00a350 a year because their consciences tell them they should, yet there is no encouragement from the government to do so. A system of discounted road tax for those who can prove they have paid an appropriate sum of money (to a government approved body) to off-set their vehicle's carbon emissions would encourage more people to do so thereby, over time, helping to counter the damage their vehicles have caused.\n\nEven a discount of \u00a310 per annum - which could be introduced on-line via verification codes - might be enough to encourage more people to off-set their carbon emissions.",
