            "background": "Student loads should not contribute towards your income for means tested housing benefit claims.  All students should be able to claim housing benefit if they are not working.  If student finance was provided privately then the loan would not be classed as income.  This has led many working class students without family support to live in poverty in order to struggle to pay full rent costs which are often already inflated.  We the undersigned request that the government changes the way that housing benefit is asessed so that some students in full time higher education will be eligable for housing benefit.",
