            "background": "With the newly announced analogue radio scrappage scheme and the existing digital switchover, student radio is under threat! They have a direct effect on the UK student population and campus life affecting almost 2.5 million students with over 10k students running the stations and is free from commercial pressures (and hence run on a small budget). The proposition is for the policy to support moving student radio into the existing FM bandwidth or preferably making allowances to put student radio on existing DAB local multiplexes (whilst keeping costs down)",
