            "background": "The government plans to raise the prices of alcholic beverages in the uk to stop binge drinking is unreasonable, as the majority of people who work for their money enjoy drinking in moderation. An increase in prices would make innocent people suffer for the odd few who take drinking too far. An increase in cost would cause the market to suffer, particularly in the economic downfall.",
