        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is for the stopping of congestion charging of motorcycles. Motorcycles do not cause congestion which is the whole point of owning/riding a motorbike.They also give out considerably less emmissions than cars and vans. The current congestion charge laws state that only motorcycles under 1 metre wide and 2 metres long are exempt from paying. The average bike over 125cc's is longer than 2 metres by about 9cm so we are paying the charge for that extra 9cm! The research has obviously been done by Mr. Livingstone and his office to find out that a vast majority of motorcycles are over 2 metres.",
