            "background": "England is currently one of the most restrictive countries in the world when it comes to firearms ownership. \n  However, guns are still easily available in Britain to those willing to buy them. Therefore all this control means is that good law abiding citizens do not have firearms, while those who are willing to break the law and commit violent crimes, do have firearms.\n  The myth is that gun control reduces violent crime, however since 1991, there has been a 71% increase in the UK's murder rate per 100,000 people, while in America it has seen a 41% decrease per 100,000 people, despite firearms ownership being legal.\n\n  It therefore is common sense to legalise firearms ownership to law abiding citizens, who have no criminal record or record of mental illness, and who have passed a firearms safety course.",
