            "background": "This petition is to make sure that all sun lotions are thoroughly checked to ensure that they provide the protection from the sun that they claim they provide.  Manufacturers should be prosecuted for producing sun lotion if it does not protect against sunburn to the standard stated on the bottle.\n\nRecent research suggests that sun lotions claim to protect to a higher factor than they do.  This endangers us, our families and our children and puts us at risk of skin cancer.  \n\n\nWe need to know we are protected when we apply sun lotion.",
