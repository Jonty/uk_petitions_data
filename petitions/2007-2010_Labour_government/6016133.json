            "background": "please sign this important petition it is also an appeal, many care homes up and down the united kingdom employ care staff that have not undergone the appropriate training or even hold an NVQ qualification, this results in young people getting jobs in a care establishment and thinking its a way of getting easy money, this is speaking of 10 years experiance and witnessing some horrible and horrific ordeals that elderly residents have had to go through. i am hoping for a legal requirement that care staff have to have an nvq level 2 in care before there even considered for an interview for a care setting, i appreciate that crb disclosures were brought in by the goverment but i dont think this stops abuse. please think of these elderly residents and support this petition.",
