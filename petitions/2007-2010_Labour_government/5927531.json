            "background": "The government must instigate an emergency appeal to allow charitable donations and fundraising with the objective of assisting the numerous UK communities hit by devestating floods. \n\nThrough creation of an umbrella organisation, the appeal could easily gather publicity and enable funds to be channeled into community recovery programmes. \n\nThere is not reason why this disaster should be treated any differently to more glamorous international projects. I urge people to join in this call for simple procedures and urgent action.",
