            "background": "In the light of the collapse of Globespan Airlines, and after XL also went bust, thousands of travellers will lose their money because of corporate irresponsibility.  Airlines need to protect all travellers, not just those who pay by credit card or book package holidays. The money paid in fares by passengers should not be available for the company to spend, but kept somewhere so that refunds can be automatically given if the airline ceases to trade.",
