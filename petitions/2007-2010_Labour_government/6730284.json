For example Europe.  If there is no referendum, at least find out what the country wants by asking all the country and not a poll that only asks 1000 people.\n\nLet everyone have their say.  The government is here to run the country at our request, lets remind the government we like to have our issues raised as well as their own agenda's from time to time, and as they are OUR public servants, they should ask us our thoughts on their idea's. and try and implement a few of our idea's too.\n\nlets get more power back to the people, its our country, our government, let us help mould our Future.",
