            "background": "More and more families have divorced Mums and Dads. The current legislation automatically assumes that the main parent is the mother (in most cases).\n\nThis means \"good\" Dads who takes an equal involvement in their child\u2019s upbringing are still asked to pay maintenance to the mother, even if they earn less than the mother.\n\nThe CSA reduce payments (of 15%) by 1/7 for each day the Dad cares, this means only a 50% reduction for 100% shared care! A dad who looks after his child for 4 days out of 7 still pays the Mum!\n\nThis is a petition for this mathematical error to be corrected! Shared care should equal zero %. \n\nRather than the current stepped reduction of\n\n15% 0 day\n12.9% 1 day\n10.7% 2 days\n8.6% 3 days\n7.5% 3.5 days (shared care)\n\nWe would propose to use a start point of 17.5% with 5% steps per day.\n\n17.5% 0 day\n12.5% 1 day\n7.5% 2 days\n2.5% 3 days\n0% 3.5 days (shared care)\n\nThis would encourage fathers to take responsibility for their child\u2019s upbringing rather than discouraging it as the current system does.",
