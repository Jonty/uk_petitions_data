        "background": "The credit reference agencies Experian, Equifax and CallCredit hold a large amount of sensitive data about each and every UK individual which can affect things such as whether that individual gets a bank account, credit card, loan, and even a home or a job. As such it is imperative that the CRAs comply with the data protection act and verify the authenticity of the data they hold.\n\nUnfortunately they do not and will not do this choosing instead to accept the word of third parties that the data they are being provided is accurate when infact it is quite frequently not.\n\nAs such we request the prime minister close the credit reference agencies unless they are able to fully comply with the data protection act",
