            "background": "We believe that the Government is right to ban Michael Savage from entering the UK and would like that ban to stay in place. Although freedom of speech is a wonderfull thing it should not be used to insult others because of race, religion or sexual differences. If Mr Savage were allowed to enter our country we believe his \"free speech\" could incite tension and even violence between people in our multicultural and tolerant society. Please keep the ban in place.",
