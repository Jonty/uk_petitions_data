        "background": "Having been diagnosis with Reiters Syndrome ( Urinary condition) when I was 19, quite a few years ago, I was told that I could live the rest of my life without getting it again or I could have it for the rest of my life. I still have the condition today which means that I can have an accident anytime. This is something that makes people embarrassed so they don't make a fuss about it but they still have to live with the ailment, as does their families, and they need to launder their clothes & bedding more often than \"normal people\" but they don't get any help with the costs. Living on Benefits only I can't have any luxury's like a new bed every couple of years, the amount of time it takes to destroy a mattress, or even help from the water board towards our water bills. So if we can raise awareness of this condition then more can be done to help sufferers with their embarrassing illness.",
