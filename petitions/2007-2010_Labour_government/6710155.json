            "background": "People who claim unemployment benefit and immigrants wanting citizenship etc should do a minimum of 20 hours per week community service.  \n\nIf we have a million people claiming unemployment benefit, how many are able bodied enough to do a full days work for there benefit? \n\nLets get them out cleaning the streets, parks, start a community service group in all boroughs that has access to an unused workforce, where groups (i.e community halls) can request a workforce for free (as we are paying taxes that cover the benefits), to do service at that community hall.  \n\nLets get the people putting something in to their community to get something out (benefit).\n\nIf they refuse to do these \"community jobs\" then they should receive a lower ammount of benefits (as they are refusin work etc).\n\nAnd the same for immigrants, work for citizenship, if they want to live here, let them contribute 1st too.  Im not asking for a slave labour force, but value for money, my money, your money, the countries money.\n\nlets get a workforce for the community supplied by the community.",
