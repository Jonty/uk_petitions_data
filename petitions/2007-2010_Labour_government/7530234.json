The student has a 1 in 4 chance of getting the answer correct. The student should have to work out and the write down the answer and not be able to guess. I have also seen an A level Biology question, it was on the ethical treatment of water fleas in an experiment. Although ethics has a place in biology, biology should remain the core and not become a sociology A level. My science GCSE questions in 1997 were harder.",
