        "background": "Calculating the Nutritional Standards for school lunch menus will be extremely expensive in terms of time and resources for school caterers. Many do not have the specialised expertise and are finding the exercise very stressful, and many have already left the profession. In a recent poll of school caterers at the LACA conference, 88% of delegates said it would be impossible to produce popular meals for secondary school children based on the current nutritional standards. \n\nComplying with the Food-based Standards will ensure that healthy meals are prepared, so calculating the nutrient content of foods does not serve any useful purpose. Finally the approach to the Nutrient-based Standards is fundamentally flawed due to inaccuracies of the figures.",
