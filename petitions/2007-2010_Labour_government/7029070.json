This is against international law and cannot be interpreted as anything but collective punishment on the civilian population of Gaza.  Gaza is an occupied territory, as such, Israel as the occupying power is obligated to look after the humanitarian needs of the populace.  \nI urge the Prime Minister to condemn this inhumane and abhorrent legislation, in line with international values and laws.  If he doesn't condemn these actions, we petition the Prime Minister to give a full explanation as to his reasons why.",
