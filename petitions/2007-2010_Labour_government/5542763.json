        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Whilst the idea of drastically cutting pollution is very attractive, the proposed LEZ charges for the whole area within the M25 are going to be inhibitive especially to small businesses who use vans. Charging \u00a3100 per day to drive within the M25 area will eventually force van drivers to stop trading as they won't be able to afford the levy. Additionally, a lot of them won't be able to afford to buy a newer van to comply. Also if logistics companies using lorries to deliver their goods have to pay their much larger levy, they will just pass on the increased cost to the public. I petition the Prime Minister to reconsider the amount of charge presently planned, especially in respect of the smaller business man.",
