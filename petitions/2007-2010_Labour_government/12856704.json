            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Leeds City Council and Metro are seeking government approval of their application for \u00a3250 million to fund a scheme called New Generation Transport (NGT).  The stated aim of the scheme is to create an improved public transport system.  The intention is to establish a new bus network using dedicated bus lanes.  Much of the \u00a3250 million will be used to build new roads and widen existing roads to create the dedicated bus lanes.  But by getting buses out of the way of cars, these new bus lanes will increase the vehicular capacity of our roads, and encourage use of the private car.  And in due course, this will inevitably lead to further congestion.  \n\nLeeds City Council and Metro could achieve their stated aim of creating an improved public transport system using dedicated bus lanes at far less public expense and cost to the environment, by locating the dedicated bus lanes within the existing highway.",
