        "background": "Article 8 of the Human Rights Act guarantees the right to family life. Deportation of a spouse is obviously an infringement of that right. It can only be justified if the spouse has done something wrong. But it is now clear that the Home Secretary has the power, which he has used, to deport a spouse simply because he or she is under 21, even though the authorities agree that the marriage is a genuine one and no question of a forced marriage arises. And this power can be and has been used even when the spouse has not committed any offence meriting deportation.",
