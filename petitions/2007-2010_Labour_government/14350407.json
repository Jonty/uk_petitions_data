            "background": "Those people who had high interest accounts in the Icelandic Bank prior to its collapse didn't pay their interest into the public purse therefore it is misappropriation of taxpayer pounds to use our contributions to compensate those account holders when the bank failed.  Now that the Icelanders have, sensibly in my opinion, refused to pay compensation, then OUR government should set about getting misused taxpayer money back off those account holders.  They should, individually, sue the Icelandic government for their money.  It is not a taxpayer problem.",
