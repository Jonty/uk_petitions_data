        "background": "This proposal is for the consideration of a knighthood for the six creators of Monty Python, namely -\n\nJohn Cleese\nMichael Palin\nTerry Jones\nGraham Chapman\nEric Idle\nTerry Gilliam\n\nWe have the knighthoods of people such as Mick Jagger and Alex Ferguson for music and football, so why shouldn't the Pythons be knighted for services to humour, or comedy? Their films are world reknowned, and they have influenced comedians for many years.\n\nThis petition is no joke, and I feel the Pythons should genuinely recieve a knighthood - I'm sure the british publi will agree.",
