        "background": "The whole of the Rugby World cup coverage (some of it on Digital TV channels) has been ruined by constant advertising breaks. At the start of a game, we hear the anthems, then have an ad break! Same at half time, no analysis to speak of. During Boxing matches, there is an ad break every 2 minutes - at the end of every round! During the Grand Prix, there are ad breaks, when anything can have happened! When will our youngsters learn about the qualities of the game they have just seen if the \"pundits\" only get 2 minutes to analyse the play? If Commercial channels win a bid for major sporting events, it should be on condition that there are no advertising breaks.",
