Tourists are missing what our communities have to offer as nothing exists for them to do so. \n\nThe local parish councils have to resort to using long domain names or names which are less relevant and not the first port of call for web users.\n\nThe lack of parish websites also can slow in-migration as people cannot find out information about what kind of a community they could be living in.",
