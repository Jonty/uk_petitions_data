Excessive alcohol consumption is causing expense in health care and policing and is causing days lost to work, as well as domestic  (largely unreported)misery. The public purse needs the money but no-one needs alcohol to survive the downturn. Substantial tax applied to it and health warnings displayed on its containers should be employed urgently",
