            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Prime Minister, during the last decade, was adamant that the 'Sustainable Investment Rule', along with the so-called 'Golden Rule' were essential measures of Government financial competence.  This worked throughout the period of the expansion of the UK economy, but is being dropped as soon as stresses have apeared in the economy.  Surely, if these rules were relevant when the economy was booming, they must be equally relevant now, especially given that we must still be in the same economic cycle since the Prime Minister ended the period of 'boom and bust'.  We therefore call on the Prime Minister to retain his economic credibility and retain what he consistently claimed was an essential test of his economic competence.",
