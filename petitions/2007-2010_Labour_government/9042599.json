            "background": "When Chinese Communist armies started entering Tibet in 1949, the Tibetan Government sent an urgent appeal to the United Nations to help Tibet resist the aggression. The General Assembly was advised by Britain and India not to take any action for the time being in order not to provoke a full-scale attack by China. But to most countries, China's attack on Tibet was aggression. It is estimated that 87,000 Tibetans died in the uprising against China in 1959 and in 1961, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 1723 (XVI), in which it explicitly recognised the right of the Tibetan people to self-determination. The UN called on the Peoples Republic of China to cease \"practices which deprive the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms, including their right to self-determination.\" \n\nThe present situation is a clear violation of the human rights of the Tibetan people to freedom of speech, freedom of association, and to campaign for their right to self-determination.",
