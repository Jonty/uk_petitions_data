            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Water Industry needs greater regulation to ensure that it does not continue to increase its profits to shareholders.  Greater regulation may also lead to re-nationalisation of such an important industry.\n\nThis is necessary as in recent years the water companies have used various excuses to put the burden of cost of improvements of infrastructure on its customer.\n\nThis burden can only increase with greater investment in water infrastructure required in the next 10 to 10 years to adapt to the demands of global warming.\n\nIt is important that new regulation is considered soon as the corporate water companies want the regulators to allow them to raise water rates as much as is need to meet the challenges of a changing climate that require investment in the water collection and drainage infrastructure of the UK.  \n\nThe government should take this opportunity to look at regulation of this industry as part of their policy on helping the UK adapt to climate change.\n\nPlease sign this petition.",
