            "background": "A national paper reported on 26/07/09 that documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show millions of homes have already been secretly assessed for a new stealth tax for householders with views or partial scenic views of any kind, patios, conservatories and even a nearby bus stop. \n\nIt is alleged, Inspectors will also be given the right to gain entry to homes to check valuation details.\n\nNot only is this an invasion of privacy, it is unfair to tax people on decisions they may have made several years ago.  How many of us would have bought the house we now own, laid the patio or built the conservatory we now have if such a tax already existed?\n\nWill people also suffer because local authorities may take advantage by making decisions purely based on revenue....e.g. erecting bus stops everywhere to increase catchment areas and hike up taxes?\n\nI petition to abolish any plans to introduce the stealth tax on properties, as alleged.",
