            "background": "Dear Mr Brown, as a person who is a sensible drinker ie two or three pints per weekend, and also someone who has a partner in the pub trade I find it deplorable that you may think it credible to tax people who like a drink AGAIN to bail out your fiscal plans. We know that a drink will do harm or so you you say. As you are tee-total, you you would say that.(why not tax Iron Brew as its full of suger and sure to rot young and old teeth alike) The fact is Mr Brown you need to tax either beer or tabacco or fuel to cover the debt from you deals to bail out the banks of well scotland mainly.but never mind, only 13 more months to a conservative government I hope or I will be emigrating from the once Great Britain! au revoir",
