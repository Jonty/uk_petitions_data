            "background": "Eastbourne Technology College is a rapidly improving community school. The staff have worked exceptionally hard to bring about improvements in GCSE results, and the Contextual Value Added score is amongst the highest in the County. August\u2019s results brought it above the National Challenge floor.\nEast Sussex have announced plans to fast-track the school into an academy. We do not believe that this is in the best interests of ETC- it should be given the support and resources to continue improving, as a Community School.\nWe agree that the school needs investment in buildings, but would urge the Government to support this through \u201cBuilding Schools for the Future.\u201d\nStaff have serious concerns about the lead sponsor, Sussex Downs College, which is in dispute with its own staff over retaining nationally agreed contracts. \nWe believe the school should remain owned by and accountable to the community. In particular, to fast track the process will deny the local community a full and balanced debate.",
