        "background": "A petition to make sure that all accident and emergency consultants are given better training on Fibromyalgia, and the symptoms a major flare up creates. \n\nWe also demand that consultants stop forcibly discharging us from our hospital beds; just because the illness shows on no tests, does not mean the patient is making it up. \n\nIf we are brought in to an A+E department, we expect those looking after us to know about our illness. \n\nWe do not expect to have to educate the medical profession ourselves, when we're at our sickest and feeling awful.\n\nWe do not expect to have to fight for basic care and treatment, just because a consultant has never heard of Fibromyalgia and would rather dismiss us, than seek further knowledge.",
