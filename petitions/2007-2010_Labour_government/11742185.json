            "background": "Every year there are thousands of dogs killed by their so called owners, enouranged to kill other animals or even attack people, which also results in their death.\n\nI strongly feel that it is the way that any animal is brought up that determines how they act around others.  \n\nThere are too many dogs abandoned or used as weapons in this country.  Too many people able to get hold of them and parade them around with a 'Don't mess with me or I'll set my dog on you' attitude.\n\nI myself gave a home to an English Bull Terrier.  She did not get on with other animals but after lots of hard work she became the most loving dog I have ever had.\n\nI strongly feel that if all dog owners were to be inspected and have to have a licence and pets microchipped, there would be a lot less dangerous dogs and irrisponsible owners out there and a lot less children being mauled to death in their own homes.  All owners will be able to be traced and held accountable for the actions of their pets.\n\nAfter all a dog is for life, and part of your family.",
