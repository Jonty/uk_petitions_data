The massive contribution Alan Turing has provided to this country both in helping retain its freedom with his codebreaking skills during WW2 that led to the defeat of the Nazi war machine and his pioneering work that led the way towards modern computing which has benefitted all mankind should never be forgotten. Alan Turing was a genius ahead of his time and deserves recognition for his part in the creation of the computer age we all live in and a fitting tribute would be for all to learn of this remarkable man via a statue of him in Trafalgar square.Without the work of this man last century where would we be today I ask you?",
