        "background": "our justice system is a total joke and laughing stock in its lenient sentences, cushy open jails with tv, computers, gyms rife with drugs and is absolutley no deterrent to season crooks. Also the sentences handed out are so short for such violence and crimes which cause long term distress to the victims (a worse sentence than the criminal gets) that getting put in jail is not even a punishment as the crooks can simply get fed, fit and plan their next crime.\nif we copied the american style of judges dishing out lengthy sentences, in harsh, hard but fair jails it would send out the message that \"deliberate and wicked\" crimes will not be tolerated and will lead to a punishment that aims to hurt and put you off re-offending.\nthe government knows this would be voted in if it were a referendum question so instead of words, actually get tough on crime and also tough on stupid outdated human rights laws that cares more about criminals not victims!",
