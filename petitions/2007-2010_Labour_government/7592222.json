Signing away powers to unelected eurocrats after breaking a promise to hold a referendum was the final straw. Loosing millions of sensitive data files with no one in government seemingly accountable or doing anything about it. Breaking the covenant with our armed forces and the defence minister doing two jobs. A vote of no confidence in the Home Secretary and the Police considering striking. Mass uncontrolled immigration again with no-one doing anything or being accountable. Failing schools and hospitals. The list goes on and on. We have had enough of lies and spin and demand this government resign.",
