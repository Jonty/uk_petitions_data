            "background": "This is the latest thing from councils. If they find a broken or missing paving slab, they just tarmac the area. What happens is the tarmac sinks lower than the paving stones. This leads to an uneven surface. This can lead to many trips, slips and falls. I myself have sprained my ankle 2 or 3 times by this. If councils actually bothered to use paving slabs, it would be cheaper overall for them as not to pay out as many compensation claims. I would claimed compensation if I required an operation on either of my feet.",
