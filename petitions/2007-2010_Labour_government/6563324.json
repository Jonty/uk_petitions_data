            "background": "Currently criminals are given a sentence which can be drastically reduced for reasons such as good behaviour. The victims of crime have lost all faith that a sentence, given by a judge, will be served in full. To create integrity criminals must know that they will serve the full sentence for their crimes. Furthermore any bad behaviour whilst in prison should be subject to further criminal charges, just the same as if they were on the outside. If found guilty a seperate sentence should be given. This will create the motivation for criminals to be well behaved whilst in prison.",
