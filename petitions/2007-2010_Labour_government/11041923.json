            "background": "The 60,000 children who come into or remain in care each year must be cared for by the very best foster carers. So the place of foster carers in our society must be acknowledged, their immense value appreciated and their status elevated. Who else but foster carers are going to give these vulnerable young people the start they need in life? Surely, foster carers are truly and primarily the key with which to unlock the doors of opportunity for these children. If the government accepts the fundamental importance of foster carers, it must have a record of their demographic features and the national gaps in foster care availability. I suggest that it must recognise that importance by creating a National Register of Foster Carers and using a Register for better planning of foster care availability Foster Carers are not simply \u201cnice people\u201d or \u201ckind people\u201d who have a soft spot for children; foster carers are professional people, should be recognised as such, and should be afforded the status that National Registration would bring.",
