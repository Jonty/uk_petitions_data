            "background": "On October 18th 2008 a radio broadcast went out on Radio 2 on Russell Brands late night show. Jonathan Ross was a guest on the show and an interview was meant to take place over the phone with Andrew Sachs. When nobody answered the phone call it went onto the answer phone. At this point certain comments were made concerning Mr Sachs' Grandaughter and Russell Brand. The Show was prerecorded and passed the BBC's screening. We think that it is silly that jonathan ross and russell brand were suspended from the bbc, for the younger viewer we found it rather humorous, the show was not designed for the older listener, we understand that the message got out of hand but apologies were made. It was truthful with what was said, all be it bad taste but truthful. We believe that the whole thing has got out of hand and as license payers ourselves we think we should be allowed to keep our entertainers.",
