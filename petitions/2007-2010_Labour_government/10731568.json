        "background": "Norwich is the largest city in England to not have a unitary council, its needs are very distinct from those of rural Norfolk that surround it and a unitary city council is the best way of providing a focused approach to meet these needs whilst providing adequate accountability and accessibility to the people\n\nThe Boundary Committee\u2019s recent proposals for a single Norfolk \u201csuper authority\" will move local government away from the people to such a degree that it will defeat the point of local government\n\nNorwich, the biggest city in the eastern region, would be represented in the county councils cabinet by one lone councillor. This is unrepresentative undemocratic and unacceptable.\n\nThese proposals also pose a danger to the city\u2019s role as an economic driver, attracting investment to the whole county, which would be impeded by lacking a dedicated council to oversee the urban issues affecting the city and manage the huge growth predicted for it in the coming years.",
