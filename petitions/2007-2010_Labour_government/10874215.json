            "background": "If UK citizens lose any money from the collapse of ICESAVE, this will be taking the UK economy back many years where the only safe place to put your hard earned money is under the mattress. This uncertainty is very damaging for the enterprise economy as it reduces the incentive to make any money if you can't even rely on a bank not to give your own money back to you. The government must fully protect all such savings.",
