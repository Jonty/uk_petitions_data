            "background": "The rules governing the process of claiming expenses should be the same as the rules that apply to each and every other employee in the country who has to work away from home. Many thousands of employees have to stay away in hotels and are forced to limit their expenditure which usually includes: hotel room at the lowest logical rate, meal and reasonable refreshments (tea, coffee etc), the cost of 1 personal phonecall per day to family (usually limited to \u00a31) and laundry cost if staying away for more than 3 consecutive days. All benefits (like fuel, cars, telephones, broadband) that are used for personal matters should be taxed - the same as the tax-paying public.\nAlso, disallow all claims relating to the cost of homes (whether it's first home, a second home or other) because it cannot be argued that any home (first or second) is necessary to carry out parliamentary duties. They need somewhere to live even if they were not an MP. If an MP does choose to buy a second home, it is their choice but the cost should not be met by public money.",
