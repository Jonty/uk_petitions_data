            "background": "As a flat charge, the Air Passenger Duty provides no incentive for airlines to run their aircraft more efficiently.\n\nAn emissions-based charge or duty on aircraft fuel would provide a direct incentive for airlines to reduce their overall fuel usage or carbon footprint, to run their services more efficiently, and to further prioritise more efficient aircraft in future purchasing decisions.\n\nIt would also avoid excessively penalising very short but necessary flights for example between island communities and the mainland, while also automatically creating a higher effective charge for longer flights.",
