            "background": "All of the bridges that I have named above are very high and cross wide estuaries, making them very exposed to high winds. Wherever structurally possible wind turbines should be erected along their length.\nPlease see my other still current, (November 2007), petitions requesting tidal barrages to be built across The Solent, the Strait of Dover and the Thames Estuary, all of which could carry wind turbines along their length, plus requesting the scrapping of nuclear / atomic power stations.\nSomeone else has petitioned for a tidal barrage across the River Severn Estuary, please sign that too.",
