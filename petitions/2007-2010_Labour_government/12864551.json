        "background": "One thing about asylum seekers seeking asylum in the UK is although we accept that some claimants may have come by aircraft a vast majority are passing many EU countries which have democratic processes in place to get to the UK which is an isle. It makes no sense, especially when people are queuing in France which is just as democratic and free as the UK if not more waiting for their chance to get to the UK. We would say that these people are not genuine and are entering the UK for other means and should be immediately removed.",
