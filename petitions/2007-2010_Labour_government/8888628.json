            "background": "The age limits system used to determine when individuals can do certain things (such as drinking alcohol in a bar) is crude, unfair and ineffective. At present, we assume that upon reaching the age of 18 someone is sensible enough to purchase alcohol. As we can increasingly see, this is not the case with a certain proportion of people. It is also unfair on the individuals who could drink responsibly (yet are underage) that they are required to wait until they're 18, purely because of the irresponsibility of others. People mature at vastly different rates, rendering age limits too crude for society. What if people were required pass a highly extensive test on alcohol, concerning everything from safe limits to the effects on the body? Irresponsible individuals would not put the effort in required to pass such a test. It is highly unlikely that those capable of passing the test would provide alcohol to those unable the acquire a license in this way.",
