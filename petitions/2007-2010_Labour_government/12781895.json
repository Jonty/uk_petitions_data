            "background": "Legislation was passed in 2007 for implementation in 2010 which means that women, who were born after 1950 and have paid full stamp without breaks in service will now not receive their pension until later than their 60th birthday. This is on a sliding scale according to birthdate. Those affected have not been notified of this change to their rights. People may be making important life decisions based on the belief that they will receive state pension at 60. This may not be the case if they are not 60 until after 2010. This is an outrage, largely as the legislation has been passed without consultation with those it affects. Many women will not have employer pensions and may be self supporting. This legislation forces them to work longer and is totally unacceptable.",
