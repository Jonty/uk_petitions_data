It has now reached \u00a376 and has gone up vast amounts over the last 5 years alone.\n\nThe fees since 1983 are as follows:\n\n1983-2001 \u00a336.00 three yearly\n2001-2004 \u00a360.00 three yearly\n2004-2006 \u00a3129.00 three yearly\n2006-2007 \u00a343.00 annually\n2007- \u00a376.00 annually\n\nNurses should not have to pay this much simply for wanting to work in a caring profession, and paying our taxes to contribute to society. Fee rises of this magnitude are unreasonable to say the least.",
