            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This is very very simply.\n\nIf you are listening to music on your radio, on your computer; having a BBQ at home or listening to music in your car and do not have a license from the performing arts society (prs.co.uk), then you are breaking the law.\n\nKwik-Fit are being sued to \u00a3200,000 pounds because their employees had their personal radios too loud and members of the public could hear the radio. Because the company did not have a license to broadcast, the PRS are taking them to court.\n\nOn a smaller scale, I have seen letters to companies stating that if you listen to music in your office without a license, then you are breaking the law. The PRS collect royalties and distribute this to artists. Many of which may say contrary but that aside, as you read this, I wonder how many of you are technically breaking the law?\n\nSo, if you want to play your CD in the office while you work, and you company allows it, bear in mind that if the someone hears you, you need a license.\n\nSo please sign up to get this ridiculous law more clearly defined.",
