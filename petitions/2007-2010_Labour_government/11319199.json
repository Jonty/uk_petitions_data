        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "By permitting residential property in conjunction with the currently allowed commercial property into SIPP's the benefits would be\n\n\u2022 A much needed boost to the housing market & economy as the tax benefits would encourage existing owners as well as new buyers to purchase/transfer properties into the tax efficient SIPP.\n\u2022 Encourage mid to long term investment into the house market there by creating a much more sustainable market with more reasonable rates of growth  \n\u2022 Provide greater confidence to lenders and thus liquidity to the lending system as banks would be taking out smaller loan to value mortgages (typically 50%) \n\u2022 Encourage greater transparency within the property market as institutional and FSA regulated bodies would be involved.\n\u2022 Encourage the improvement & maintenance of rental stock as investors would be holding investments over the longer term. Therefore raising living standards for tenants as well as providing quality housing stock for long term private or council tenants.",
