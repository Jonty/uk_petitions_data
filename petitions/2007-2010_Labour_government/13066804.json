            "background": "We are asking Gordon Brown and the British Government to abstain from eating meat at least one day a week to make a positive impact on the health of not only themselves but also the planet. The world's leading authority on global warming Dr Rajendra Pachauri says that people should have one meat-free day a week if they want to make a personal and effective sacrifice to help tackle climate change before going on to reduce their meat consumption even further. UN data shows that meat production and consumption are to blame for 18% of greenhouse gases - more than cars. Imagine how much CO2 could be saved if the British public - led by the government - committed to reducing the amount of meat they eat. We want the British government to become pioneers in the fight against obesity and global warming by eating more vegetables to help to save the planet.",
