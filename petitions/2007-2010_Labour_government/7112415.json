        "background": "Ronnie Biggs is a sick man who needs medical attention. Keeping him in prison after four strokes is barbaric and inhumane. There should be enough proof in the fact that he lived in Brazil for over 30 years without involving himself in crime for him to be released. The only reason that he is in prison is due to the British Prison System needing a scapegoat for all the mistakes they have made over the years. Why not use the limited space in British prisons to confine someone dangerous.",
