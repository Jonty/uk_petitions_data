        "action": "provide more funding for local authorities and communities to spend on flood defences in the county and for the Environment Agency to increase its budget on Lincolnshire Coastal Defences.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Until 2002 the Government paid for the flood defences in Lincolnshire and we ask the Prime Minister to look into the matter and help to relieve the council tax payers who pay 7% towards flood defences. Unless there is more funding by the Government on coastal defences there will be serious flooding in the county within 5 years. Lincolnshire produces about 20 % of the national food supply saving billions of pounds per year in imports and flooding would destroy crops and have a long term impact on soil productivity.",
