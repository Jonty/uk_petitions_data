            "background": "Until 2002 the Government paid for the flood defences in Lincolnshire and we ask the Prime Minister to look into the matter and help to relieve the council tax payers who pay 7% towards flood defences. Unless there is more funding by the Government on coastal defences there will be serious flooding in the county within 5 years. Lincolnshire produces about 20 % of the national food supply saving billions of pounds per year in imports and flooding would destroy crops and have a long term impact on soil productivity.",
