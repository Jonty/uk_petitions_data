            "background": "Help make Clydesdale's MPs more transparent and 'honorable'.\n\nPetition to have the current Lanark and Hamilton East MP stand down before next general election. If the current MP is allowed to remain as an MP till the next General Election (within a year) then he'll automatically receive a huge pension paid by the taxpayer. How can this be justified when this MP has claimed a total of \u00a3115,227 between 2001 and 2007 as additional cost allowance. He has also claimed:\n\n* \u00a3400 per month for food, the maximum allowed without receipts, over 11 months in 2004-05.\n\n* \u00a3200 for food in August, 2004, when the Commons was in recess.\n\n* Between \u00a3445.14 and \u00a3728.68 for mortgage interest on his designated second home.\n\n* \u00a31500 for furniture.\n\n* \u00a31400 for carpets.\n\n* Over \u00a31000 for electrical goods including \u00a3489.95 for a 26-inch LCD television.\n\nMore details can be found on the Hamilton Advertiser newspaper article of 28 May 2009 entitled \"MP claimed \u00a31000 a month and didn\u2019t have to submit receipts\".",
