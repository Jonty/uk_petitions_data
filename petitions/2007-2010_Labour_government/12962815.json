        "background": "There has been around 6 suicides from this building 1 of them being my dad back in 2003, it seems the owners of this property dont care about human life and as usual it all boils down to money.Meetings are being held around maybe putting safety netting up which at this moment in time isnt being funded by the owners themselves.Its such a hot spot for sucicides now and isnt fair on the families and friends who have to experience this grief.Also passer bys who witness it.This building needs knocking down end of story it has to much gloom surrounding it and the town it self doesnt attract many visitors to fill it.Enough talks please pull this horrible building down before another person takes their own life.",
