            "background": "Living in a town where nightclubs and bars are very populous, there are many doormen and I feel from personal experience many of them are incompetent. I have been refused entry before (despite being and looking over 21) because I have no ID, the legal age is 18 not 21, 25 or any higher. All door supervisors have to do is pass a 3 half-day course and they are given a licence and very excessive powers. I feel the training should be extended and made harder.",
