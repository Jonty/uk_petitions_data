While we are sinking billions of pounds into the 2012 Olympics, projects such as \"Alice\" at Daresbury Laboratory and \"e-Merlin\" at Jodrell Bank are likely to be canceled due to relatively small levels of funding.  Such projects are investments in our future as a country prepared to investigate in World Class projects.",
