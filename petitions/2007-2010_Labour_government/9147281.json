            "background": "A number of major Science projects are likely to close down due to insufficient funding.  While we are sinking billions of pounds into the 2012 Olympics, projects such as \"Alice\" at Daresbury Laboratory and \"e-Merlin\" at Jodrell Bank are likely to be canceled due to relatively small levels of funding.  Such projects are investments in our future as a country prepared to investigate in World Class projects.",
