People start drinking heavily beyond the boundaries of 18.\n\nI beleive a law should be passed that should limit alcohol consumption.With the advent of complusory ID cards with biometric technology, I'm sure this is possible?\n\nThe government wants people to stick with alcohol limits, this could be done by making drinkers present their ID card at the time of sale, which allows them to buy the limit of alcohol on a daily basis. \n\nThis tough love tactic would curb underage drinking and violence on the streets. People in reality don't need more than 2 pints of beer a day, that's more than enough.",
