            "background": "The Network Railcard enables reduced rate travel for people off-peak in the south-east of England, in the former British Rail Network South-East area. It is inherantly unfair that the area of the country with the best rail service and the most affluent people are provided with this discount on their rail use whilst everyone else in the country is not. The Network Railcard should be made available to everyone in the country and should cover the entire national rail network, in effect becoming known as the \"National Network Railcard\".",
