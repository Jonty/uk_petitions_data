            "background": "While I do not struggle to pay my energy bills, many people, and especially pensioners do.\n\nToday 21/02/08 British Gas announced huge profits of \u00a3571 million.\n\nIt is time for the corporate greed to end. It is not in the interest of the citizens of this country to be held to ransom by energy suppliers. \n\nClearly the market is not working.\n\nGas and Electric is an everyday necessity not a luxury. The soaring cost to the domestic consumer has and will lead to serious consequences for some, even death as they cannot afford to stay warm.\n\nThose on low incomes, the sick and disabled need to be protected from such greed. And now with the latest price rises so do working families.\n\nIt is time something was done, for the good of the people of this country.\n\nThe interests of the people shoud come before those of sharholders.\n\nEnough is enough!!!!",
