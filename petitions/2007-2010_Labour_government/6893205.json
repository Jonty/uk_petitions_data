        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The European Union is supposed to work on the basis of an economic level playing field for the good of all its citizens. While European legislation designed to create the level playing field in terms of currency, open borders e.t.c. has benefited businesses it has not provided sufficient protection for workers.\n\nIt is now time to introduce a minimum wage of at least 5 euros per hour across the European Union. The European minimum wage must be reviewed annually to take into account inflation and living costs. \n\nSuch a European minimum wage would apply only where individual member states did not have a minimum wage set at a higher rate.\n\nEuropean minimum wage legislation would include safeguards to prevent individual members states lowering their minimum wages to meet the European minimum. They would have to maintain a differential. The aim would be to 'level up' over the next 10 years.\n\nA European minimum wage is a important step in reducing economic inequality and making the European Union a better place to live in. It is also an important first step in the introduction of a global minimum wage.",
