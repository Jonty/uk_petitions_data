        "background": "We urge our Prime Minister Gordon Brown to stop wearing a blue tie. The public voted for a Labour government which has the colour red. Not a conservative government which is strongly associated with the colour blue. The leader of the Labour party should be wearing a red tie most of the time, and certainly not a blue one \u2013 the colour of their political rivals. Gordon Brown, since becoming Prime Minister has been seen on most occasions wearing a blue tie, even when he made his first speech as PM. This obsession with a blue tie can confuse visitors to the UK and a red tie would make Brown\u2019s position more clear. \nIt is a shame to see Brown in a blue tie and it may stop some people voting Labour as they may immediately associate a blue tie with the conservative party. A blue tie may be the difference from Labour winning a general election and Labour losing. A red tie would be much more suitable, but having a colour which is linked with a strong political rival of the government is not on.",
