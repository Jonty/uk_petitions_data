            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This has come about as our school transport was recently tendered out to a company who did not offer restraints.  The ages of the children were 4 - 11 years.  Most children could not reach the floor nor the hand bar in front of them (as the transport was just a public bus).  The law does not require coaches/buses which are hired privately to have seat belts.  This needs to be changed to ensure all children are safe.  Our provider, after oposition, was changed by our local council, but unfortunately not before a child was hurt when he fell off the seat.  Please change the law, for our childrens safety.",
