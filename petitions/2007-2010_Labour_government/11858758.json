Based on an average of \u00a31 per week per person as statutory this would give funding to Help those in desperate need of it. Payments would be given per household and not per person. This would have a dramatic effect on the whole of the country and gradually we would see a far better off britian.\nI have already started to get people interested in this idea and have a group on Facebook called Lets get this country back on track.",
