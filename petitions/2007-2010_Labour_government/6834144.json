        "background": "Ethnic minority employment laws need to be abolished, this is blatant racism and discrimination, people who are qualified enough to do the job are discriminated against when someone of a different skin colour or race is hired to just to fill a quota. \n\nEveryone in the UK need to be treated as equals by the government and employers. \n\nIf someone has the skill to do the job they should be hired, it shouldn't be based on race or religion, i feel deeply offended whenever i have to fill out an Ethnic minority form, im White and Welsh but why should I be asked this when i go to a job interview? why does it matter? \n\nIf you don't like this obvious racism then please sign this petition. \n\nThank you",
