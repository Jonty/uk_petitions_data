        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Carol Hill's talk to the parents of a child tied up and violently whipped, after the school had informed the parents the child had been involved in a skipping accident, led to her dismissal. Ms Hill's actions were in the best interests of an innocent minor, compared to the school who have clearly covered up the truth (as demonstrated by the different information in their accident log entries and letter sent to the parents), and then fired the individual who exposed them.\n\nMs Hill did a good deed for the right reasons, and has lost her income because her incompetent and questionably qualified bosses came out badly as a result. Her sacking is a great injustice and should be rectified immediately.",
