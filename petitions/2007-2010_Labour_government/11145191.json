        "background": "The present crisis are created mainly by the mortgage lenders, bringing the construction industry to an almost complete halt and loss of thousands of jobs. The economy can only be kick-started when the construction industry begins to build houses again, which would only happen if people in relatively safe jobs under the present climate (such as teachers and fire service employees) are not refused mortgages. \n\nSecret to recovery from present crisis lies in construction industry (and that depends on mortgages not being refused for silly reasons).",
