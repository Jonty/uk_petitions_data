        "background": "I think the current Government have their priorities wrong. We, the voters and citizens of a proud country would like to remind you that we may be your charges when it comes to running a country, and how said country reacts to global issues but as a country we have no confidence in the current situation. Global warming may be an issue that we need to face, but Immigration, mortgages and paying tax on money that has been taxed (fuel,etc) are issues that need fixing now. To any Government, I would suggest you have a majority on side before asking us to stretch ourselves and right the wrongs that our history, or other countries have created. Call a General Election. As far as I can see, Labour will probably win but its our decision, not yours. I would love to see another political party step up to the plate with proper policy that works for everyone. At no point should you ignore the voters that pay a lot of tax, and then pay it again by stealth tax, you will lose the core of our country to emmigration. Anyone who can earn money on merit here, can earn it elsewhere. Give us the choice that a democracy is meant to have.",
