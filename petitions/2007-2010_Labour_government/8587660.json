        "background": "Local Fire Authorities are cutting back on the fire service because of lack of funds. These cuts are being made to front line fire cover. Lives will be lost as a result and it seems that Government and councils make money the priority instead of lives.\nLocally our service is likely to lose our whole time cover and the manning of the hydrolic platform. In the past 24 hours both have been responsible for saving lives from a major fire in a block of seven flats. Eleven lives saved. Had the cuts been made it would be a different story. These cuts are across the country and they should be stopped. It is time that lives were put before money.",
