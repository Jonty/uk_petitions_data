            "background": "The VAT cut that was revealed in the Pre-budget report last year was ineffectual and little more than a publicity stunt by a government that doesn't know what to do about the 'economic slowdown'/ recession.  The 2.5% cut has hardly helped any consumers, and certainly has done little to boost retail sector.  Why would you buy an item simply because instead of \u00a3100 it is now \u00a397.87?  Instead the government is loosing vital income, that could be used to cut the public debt (of \u00a3775 billion - April 2009 - or \u00a312,574 per person) and thus stop some of the inevitable public spending cuts that will be coming our way in the following years.  In the next few years we have a choice of higher taxes or lower public spending, and surely a VAT cut which we have hardly noticed yet the budget badly can't afford is not the way to go.",
