            "background": "This can be achieved by the mandatory use of a reward system based on a sliding scale of percentages of monies returned to creditors.This system would be fair and transparent when compared to the current practice adopted by most private insolvency practitioners, which is based on varying rates(\u00a360-350 is usual)per hour for different grades multiplied by hours claimed.This method of working is not subject to any ongoing control and therefore costs are entirely determined by the insolvency practitioner(I.P.) who renders their own invoices and pay themselves from monies collected and sales of assets,\nA recent example for a medium sized engineering company showed I.P. costs of \u00a3950,000; if the percentage scale used by the Official Receiver is applied, the costs would be \u00a395,000 thus returning over \u00a3800,000 to creditors.A reward system would cost the government nothing and return more cash promptly to small companies,reducing cash flow problems and the potential domino effect of an insolvency.This problem is increasing daily and a recent industry source has stated that insolvencies in 2009 could reach 32,000.\n\n  G.Skinner",
