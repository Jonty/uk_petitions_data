            "background": "We would like a holiday in the UK to celebrate all of our wonderful children. We would like to promote their good health, respect their personalities and celebrate their happiness . We hope this day will be set as a public holiday where our communities can join together and unite in celebrating our children. Many countries around the world celebrate a National Children's Day as a public holiday holding lots of colourful and decorative community festivals. We think it's time for the UK to have a National Children's Day. \n\nWhy do we want to do this? Because we believe our children matter. We believe all children matter. We believe that each and every individual child matters\n\nThis is to positively implement a new holiday where everyone benefits. Children are our future so lets make them count!",
