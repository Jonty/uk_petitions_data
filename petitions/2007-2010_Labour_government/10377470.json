            "background": "Given the recent financial market turmoil; rising prices; failure to mark SATs; and poll ratings of the present Government; any attempt to ban the cheap offers available during \"happy hours\" must immediately cease. Happy hours are the life blood of many establishments, and the joy of many drinkers. The Government must recognise that banning happy hours will not result in a cultural shift towards sensible drinking, but instead will contribute towards potential wild rioting and looting.",
