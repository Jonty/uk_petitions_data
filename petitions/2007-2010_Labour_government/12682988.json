        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The whole fiasco of MPs' allowances and expenses claims have left the electorate totally disenchanted with the current political system. One MP has immediately resigned and a small number of those MPs have chosen not to stand at the next general election.  More MPs are expected to announce that they will not stand at the next general election.\n\nMPs standing down would receive a golden handshake in the form of a payment which could be as much as \u00a3100,000 for a Cabinet member. Given that the money is funded by the taxpayer, and this money would \"reward\" MPs for abusing taxpayers' money to fund their lavish expense claims, the Prime Minister should engage with Parliament, as part of his plans to reform MPs' expenses, to propose Parliament votes to prevent any of those MPs from receiving any form of golden handshake, although MPs should still get their pensions.\n\nThe Prime Minister should also put forward proposals that Parliament votes to prevent any of those MPs from getting a peerage.  This would ensure taxpayers' money is used most efficiently and would prevent these MPs from continuing their \"gravy train\" of expense claims.",
