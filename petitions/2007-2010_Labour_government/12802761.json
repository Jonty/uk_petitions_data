            "background": "The Death of Scoobie Santino has affected so many people in many ways...The sheer cruelty of how he died will never leave our minds..and also the affect it has left on his loved ones..We need to feel safe, it seems however, that this is no longer the case. So we need to have CCTV Cameras to make us feel safe on our streets, subways and underpaths. A life has been taken from us in such a brutal way..and still no evidence or witnesses to help catch his Killers have come forward. Had there been CCTV Cameras, then there would have been some hope in solving this tragic case. So I am on behalf of Scoobie Santino aka Ian Newton and his family, petitioning for CCTV camera's to be placed in the subway in Greenford, where he died and other Subways/ and Pedestrian footpaths..",
