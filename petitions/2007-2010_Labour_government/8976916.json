        "background": "Community Radio has the power to change lives.  It is inclusive, it is not for the privileged few, it seeks to involve all members of its community.  Funding streams are very difficult to identify.  Ofcom will make small grants to fund core activity ... but it is left to the individual stations to try to raise income from a range of sources.  All community radio stations know that they are providing huge benefits within their communities, but in our experience, it is impossible to convince many potential funders of this fact.  For example, the Key Commitments of our station (agreed and set by Ofcom) dovetailed with the objectives of the Big Lottery, Reaching Communities Grant ... yet we were turned down out of hand.  We have the full support (and some financial contribution) of our local Council ... who are under-funded themselves.  We know that this situation is mirrored across the UK.  Unless Community Radio was intended to be a political game, the stations need adequate support and access to finance.  This WAS a very good idea for the UK ... please give us the means to make it work.",
