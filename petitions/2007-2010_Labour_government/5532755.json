            "background": "All fixed cameras have had to be painted fluorescent yellow to allow the driving public the ability to clearly identify the speed camera. Legislation should also be brought in that would require all mobile speed cameras to be clearly identified as well in a similar manner. Part of the use of speed camera's both mobile and fixed is to act as a deterrent and not a revenue generation scheme as seems to be the case on new road works.",
