            "background": "Announced in the budget on 12/3/08 were increases in Vehicle Excise Duty (road tax). These announcements made scant reference to the fact that they were RETROSPECTIVE and affect all cars dating back to 2001.\n\nOwning an older car and keeping it running is FAR more environmentally friendly than scrapping it and manufacturing a new one, no matter how much more efficient then new car is. The manufacturing process creates huge amounts of CO2.\n\nOwners of older cars do not have choice - potential purchasers of new cars do.\n\nThis will seriously damage the second hand car market and the leisure industry.\n\nCancel the retrospective taxation NOW.",
