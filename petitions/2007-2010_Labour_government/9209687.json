        "background": "Most would agree that today children are playing computer games too much.  Some are very innocent, some are educational, BUT some are very destructive.\n\nThe role playing games (RPG) are a great concern as they have the ability to addict children and change their attitudes to life.\n\nThe worst offender by far is World of Warcraft -- commonly known as WoW.  It has a great reputation of ruining childrens education.  There are many stories of children who play for 12+ hours a day and their schooling is badly ruined.\n\nChildren and education are important to all of us, and take a high priority in government.  Lets take a stand against these addictions and ban certain RPG games in the UK.",
