            "background": "Banks/building societies are not offering good value (ie 3%) mortgages to buyers unless they have something like a 40% deposit - preventing first time buyers from entering the market. Considering the recent tax-payer bail-out of financial institutions, I suggest banks should now start offering better value mortgages to first time buyers (ie 3% mortgages with LTV of 90%) so that the housing market can be reinvigorated and the economy strengthened (and first time buyers can be given some hope for a change!)",
