Although real military help is required to find Joseph Kony and bring him to justice. The International Criminal Court has a warrant against his name and he needs to be brought to justice so there will be peace in Uganda and children will not be abducted and forced into fighting a war.\n\nWe petition the British government to help the Ugandan authorities find and arrest Joseph Kony and raise this issue with the United Nations. We also petition the government to help bring peace in Uganda as well as raising awareness of this issue within the British public.",
