        "action": "abolish compulsory lessons for year 10 and 11 students in favour of more GCSE choice",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Students in year 10 and 11 are forced to take certain subjects as part of their GCSE's, for example P.S.H.C.E, religious studies and languages (in some schools). An unwanted subject can affect an otherwise excellent set of results for a student, this can be due to lack of effort, and often lack of skill in that area. There is little need for a student to take a subject which they do not see themselves needing in their future, and more trust should be placed in students and their parents to make the right choice for their personal requirements.",
