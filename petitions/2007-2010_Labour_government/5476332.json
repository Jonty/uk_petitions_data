            "background": "For years the police have had much greater rights than the civilians, and the police are more like a machine than ensured community safety.  The community can work without these police, if everyone were to play their own part to create unity.  The police, also, don't get in near as much trouble if they mistakenly or deliberately kill someone as a civilian would, which really shows their supreme power and invulnerability.  Also, I speak from not myself but many, many communities when I say that just one day I would like the police not to watch over our every action, invading privacy and using violence against us if we don't do what they desire.  Giving out free food to the community is deemed as illegal to some police, and their brutality destroys lives, hearts and souls.  Please, let it stop!",
