            "background": "British football was respected for the way it used to pride itself on how its players and teams conducted themselves with the public and the camaraderie between the footballers and their fans was one of friendship and respect. The money that is coming into the game is removing this and creating a divide where footballers are seen as the superior being due to their wealth, and the football fan is suffering in cost and continually failing national sides. There needs to be some government intervention that can limit the amount of ownership from abroad within a football club, and return football in Britain to being a game for the people. Unfortunately for football as a sport, other sports such as Rugby League have moved on in such a way that their game is improved, but the link between the players and supporters is still a very close one and the players are local to their club due to the successful youth development. We have excellent youth setups in Britain promoting the correct style of football, but we are enhancing the prospects of players from other shores to the detriment of our own home-grown talent.",
