Teenage knife crime has hit an all time high and it\u2019s leading to teenage deaths every few weeks.\n\nResearch suggests that a third of under 16s regularly carry a knife. Bliss is determined to make it stop.\n\nRecords show that in the 12 month period following a four week knife amnesty in 1993 murders fell by 26%. It's a step in the right direction. Bliss wants to encourage teenagers to give up their knives and arrange their own amnesty in schools.",
