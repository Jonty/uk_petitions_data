            "background": "With the rapid growth in the construction of offshore wind farms, there is a need to buy additional specialist ships necessary to construct each wind turbine. To support the UK ship building industry, the UK government should find a way to ensure that these ships are built in the UK by British companies, rather than being built on the opposite side of the world. Each ship costs \u00a360m to buy. Constructing these locally would help to support and sustain the communities which rely on British ship building",
