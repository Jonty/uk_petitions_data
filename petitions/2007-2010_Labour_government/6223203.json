            "background": "Homeopathic drugs contain such miniscule amounts of active ingredients, if any, that they are effectively either plain water, or placebo tablets, and as such it constitutes a fraud to market them as a drug or treatment that will have any positive effect on an ailment.\n\nIt is patently absurd to say that water solutions, or a sugar tablet that has no active content, has \u2018remembered\u2019 the active content and is therefore effective as a treatment. Therefore these products should not be on public sale or prescribed on the NHS.  \n\nThe 'treatments' prescribed by homeopaths have not been the subject of rigorous double blind testing, and are therefore nothing more than a form of mediaeval quackery, with no proof that any of them are more effective than the placebo\u2019s handed out in genuine medical trials.\n\nHomeopathic treatments play on the fears and hopes of the gullible and desperate, and should therefore be declared illegal, as a form of confidence trick.",
