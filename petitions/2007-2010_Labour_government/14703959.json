        "background": "The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) is a Ministry of Defence sponsored youth organisation in the United Kingdom. Its aim is to \"provide a disciplined organisation in a school so that pupils may develop powers of leadership by means of training to promote the qualities of responsibility, self reliance, resourcefulness, endurance and perseverance\"\n\nThe funding for the CCF is constantly being reduced, so how are they meant to cope with running certain trips, training etc. without enough funding. The CCF keeps young people busy and lets them learn new skills, but it also gives young ones an insight into the Armed Forces, how are they expected to be interested if they dont do anything because there is no funding?\n\nIm petitioning for and increase in funding so that Cadets can be fully kitted out, and enjoy all the activities to maybe lead them into the Armed Forces.",
