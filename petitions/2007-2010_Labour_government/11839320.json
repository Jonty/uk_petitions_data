            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "UK Transport systems are in dire crisis.\nMotorists are paying exorbitant amounts in taxation, almost 75% of this revenue is not spent on transport infastructure. UK roads are in an appaling state, cities are congested, parking facilities are overpriced. Motorists are penalised for using thier vehicles- congestion & road charging, punitive restrictions & unlawful parking penalties. \nPublic transport is failing to deliver a viable alternative. services are overpriced, unreliable, of poor standard. An infrastructure driven by customers needs is desperately needed.\nAn effecient & integrated transport system is possible & needed TODAY.\nFirstly motorists taxes should be used ONLY for transport infrastructure, with annual figures showing where the revenues spent. A large part of this should be spent on public transport on clean & effecient road & rail systems. Electric high-speed trains, trams & low-emission buses. This is possible & has been done in European countries with the TGV/ICE in France & Germany, Trams in many cities & Biodiesel buses. The investment required is titanic, but the cost of not doing so is far higher- cripling the UK transport & economy.",
