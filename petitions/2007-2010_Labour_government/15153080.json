            "background": "Rothesay Creamery is the home of the Award Winning Isle of Bute Mature Cheddar Cheese and the Isle of Bute Organic Cheddar Cheese.\nFirst Milk announced on Thursday 18th March 2010 that they plan to close the Rothesay Creamery resulting in the loss of 19 local jobs as well as a serious threat to dairy farming on the Isle of Bute.  \nFirst Milk claims that falling milk production on Bute together with rising production costs and the difficulty of finding a profitable customer base, have forced the decision to close the Rothesay Creamery.\nWe call upon First Milk to reconsider this decision and at the very least, to allow the creamery to remain open to allow time for a rescue package to be assembled.",
