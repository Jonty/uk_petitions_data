        "background": "I would like the government to bring out a separate driving test for anyone that wants to drive a van as they are much bigger than a car that u take your test in and more difficult to handle.\nThere are many inexperienced drivers that are driving vans on the road, this should not be allowed as on the 3rd October 2009 my 10 year old boy was walking home from the cinema with his big sister and friends when he got hit and killed with a van and i know my son is not the only one. I do not want any parent, sister, brother, aunt etc to go through what me and my family are going through.",
