A day when all the English - regardless of colour, religion or sexuality - can recognise what binds us together.\n\nEverything from Cricket to Curry could be celebrated on our national day.\n\nNorthern Ireland has had a bank holiday on St Patricks Day for decades and the Scottish Parliament recently made St Andrews Day a 'voluntary' bank holiday. England should now be given a bank holiday on St Georges Day.",
