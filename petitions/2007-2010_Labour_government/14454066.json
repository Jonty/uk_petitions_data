The breweries, retailers, pubs and nightclubs, have to be held responsible for allowing this to happen. If the Government forced these companies to increase the price of bottled alcoholic drinks to a minimum of \u00a33 and made alcohol promotions (BOGOF) illegal, then the NHS and the police service may be able to redirect there finances on more worth while causes.",
