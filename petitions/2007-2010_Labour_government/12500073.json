            "background": "Most companies harvesting contact details for marketing lists use opt-out boxes.\n\nInstead the law should enforce that ONLY opt-ins are allowed for data collection. This should apply to postal, email, SMS, fax and all past, present and future private channels of communication.\n\nStandard texts should be enforced to prevent wording designed to trick people into ticking boxes to allow communications.  Size and colour rules should be enforced to make the information uniformly recognisable and obvious, no matter who or what the company.\n\nAt the same time, rules should be put in place to enforce that where a company collects personal data in this manner, opt-out mechanisms must be provided in ALL feasible media (eg. postal forms, web page based, SMS \"STOP\" reply etc.) but at the very least in the same media as the data was harvested in the first place. In all communications, directions to these opt-outs should be mandatory.\n\nThe above should be mandatory rules, not optional guidelines.",
