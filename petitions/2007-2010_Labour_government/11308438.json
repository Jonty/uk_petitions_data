The methods employed by the authorities can involve searching hard drives and downloading \u201ckey logging\u201d malware via infected emails, and other techniques more commonly associated with criminal hackers. These powers are given in the RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act).\n\nSearching a personal computer is morally no different to conducting a physical search of premises or property, and as such should only be permitted with the authority of the courts in the same way that a search warrant must be obtained before a conventional search is conducted.",
