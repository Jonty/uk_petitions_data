        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I propose that a division is set up to enforce out of work Non Resident Parents \u2013 ie those that are purposely not working in order not to avoid paying maintenance for their children - back into work rather than expecting the taxpayer, Government or the resident parents increasing debt pay it for them!  This division can operate in a similar way to the job seekers monitoring service, where NRPs have to provide proof that they are actively searching to pay for their responsibilities.  This would also serve as the method to curfew their passports \u2013 i.e. they should not be leaving the country unless it is to find work.  At present a non resident parent can live with a high income partner, not earn any money themselves and get out of paying their dues while they live a rich lifestyle on their high income partner\u2019s salary which cannot be taken into account.",
