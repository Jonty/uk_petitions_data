        "background": "More and more UK companies are now using overseas call centres for customer service and maintenance services, whilst 'hiding' this fact behind UK or 0845/0800 dialling codes.  Not only does this remove many thousands of jobs from the UK economy, the staff in these overseas centres are often very badly trained and can do nothing more than read pre-prepared scripts.  Forcing UK companies to publish where they base their staff will give UK consumers the chance to \"vote with their feet\", support UK-based staff and send a clear sign of their preferences to the businesses in question.",
