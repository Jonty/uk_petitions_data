        "background": "The recently introduced MasterCard SecureCard scheme now asks for more information about the person using the card when they are purchasing from the internet, however the information it asks for is a 6 to 10 character password which is deemed by many (even free or non-confidential systems) as a weak password, and this is enforced. I would rather enter a strong password (a strong password is one that contains a mix of upper and lower characters, numeric characters and punctuation or \"special\" characters) of my own design than be forced to a password that only contains letters and numbers.",
