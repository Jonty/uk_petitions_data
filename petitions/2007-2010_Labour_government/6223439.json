            "background": "The current VAT collection system can be altered and a carbon added tax created which takes account of the use of fossil fuels used in the manufacture and supply of those goods.This new system would have three bands of rate, the overall collection of tax would be the same as current levels.\nLow level of only 5% would be for energy saving or efficient goods and services such as insulation materials,energy saving light bulbs etc.\nTop rate would be 25% and include large 4x4s or long haul short stay holidays etc.\nStandard rate would be 17.5% and include all other goods and services.\nWe must stop talking and making pronouncements and start to put real pressure on the inefficient industries where ever they maybe to start to change before it is too late and our generation is despised in history as the indolent procrastinators who failed our grandchildren!\nThis new system is a realistic lever with which we can increase pressure until the problem is solved.\nMr Brown we cannot bury our heads any longer,Please Please can we see some action.",
