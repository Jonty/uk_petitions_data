        "background": "Britian used to be green and a very clean country.  The government and the councils do not impliment any rules or regulations to stop people throwing rubbish or businesses fly tipping.  Our country is a complete eyesore and our councils are doing nothing about it.  Do you Gordon Brown want to live in a rubbish dump because that is how your country has become.  Please people out there, please sign this petition, this is morally correct and in 5/10 years time would you like your favourite holiday destination for eg Jamaica or Mauritis to be littered like Britain is.  Come on sign today and make a difference, it is our obligation to get Britain clean and tidy again",
