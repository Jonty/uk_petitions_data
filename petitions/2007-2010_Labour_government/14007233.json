            "background": "The Government is on the threshold of destroying one of its strongest export industries, the English language teaching sector, worth billions of pounds annually to the UK in visible and invisible exports. Tier 4 of The PBS, launched in April, brought sweeping changes to the int\u2019l education sector. The gov\u2019t\u2019s aim was to rid the UK of bogus colleges, which were not just a security threat but also a blot on the UK\u2019s unassailable reputation in education.  This work has not been completed. A further aim was to streamline the issuing of study visas. Some changes were welcome, others serve only to turn bona fide students away from the UK.  The gov\u2019t now aims to further restrict int\u2019l students from studying in the UK.  That will devastate this vibrant and highly professional industry, leading to mass redundancies in language schools, secondary schools, colleges & universities, with huge losses to the economy and Treasury. The English language is a crown Jewel \u2013 let\u2019s protect and nurture it!",
