        "background": "People on low incomes are being encouraged to take out mortgages they cannot afford, leaving them deep in debt and facing the prospect of homelessness, a report has warned.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to respond to the Citizens Advice reports which asserts that dubious advice from brokers, irresponsible lending decisions and aggressive arrears management by sub-prime lenders is driving the current increase in mortgage arrears.\n\nPlease legislate to ensure regulations and safety nets that are currently in place do not fail to protect vulnerable borrowers. Any policy to urge people on low incomes to buy their homes cannot work unless this is addressed.",
