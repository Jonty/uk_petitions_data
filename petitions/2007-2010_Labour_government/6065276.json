We in London and UK on behalf of worldwide sisters and brothers in Africa and elsewhere petition that the BBC is liberated to help people raise questions however inconvenient their system truth. It is not that thousands of us don't want to help connect knowhow and help develop a more transparent world, it is that 360 degree people debates are never openly facilitated in scalable ways. For example my curiosity as a world citizen has never been more abused than when I was a delegate to Make Poverty History. Only very narrow (non-entrepreneurially true) ways of looking at empowerment system crises were permitted.",
