            "background": "As stated in a previous petition of mine the attitude of all T.V. companies seems to be \"You can only have your regular programmes if there is no live sports programme for which we have the rights.\"  This is very annoying for non-sports fans; especially since these programmes seems to take up most of an entire evening.  \n\nAnd even though England failed to qualify for Euro 2008 no doubt it will be all over our screens next summer; I DO REALISE that the Euro tournaments take place only every four years BUT WHILE THEY'RE ON THEY'RE AS ANNOYING TO NON-FANS AS IF THEY WERE ON EVERY YEAR.  I would also make the point that of course the World Cup is also on every four years; ALTERNATING WITH THE EURO TOURNAMENTS so that in fact we have this MAJOR disruption to normal programming EVERY OTHER YEAR.",
