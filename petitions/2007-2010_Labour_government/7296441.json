        "background": "There are a number of companies that offer large savings on mobile phone bills when customers adhere to strict terms and conditions. These companies are able to do this by expecting most people to fail to meet such conditions, and thus be able to pay the customers that do. However, when too many customers are eligible for a rebate, the company soon goes in to administration and prevents customers getting money to which they should be legally entitle. These companies are unfair, unethical and should be illegal. Instead, mobile phone operators should be forced to lower extortionate charges, thus removing the need for such companies to exist in the first place.",
