            "background": "Many family breakups become acrimonious and the adversarial nature of divorce through the law courts only serves to make matters worse.  And, this process can be very costly causing further hardship for all affected parties.  Therefore the government should set up Family Mediation & Arbitration Centres specifically for the purposes of offering counselling, advice, mediation and arbitration in a completely non-adversarial way, with total impartiality and with independent appeal processes to be used when bias is suspected.  Participation in the process should be considered to be mandatory.  If one partner refuses to participate the Family Mediation & Arbitration Service may decide to remove some of their normal rights and benefits.  If both partners refuse to participate then matters may have to be dealt with through the existing adversarial channels.",
