            "background": "The last national referendum on our membership of the European Union was held in 1975 - that's 35 years ago.\n\nThat means that all people in this country under the age of 53 have never had an opportunity to vote on whether the U.K. should continue to remain a member of the European Union.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that over half the country wish us to leave the E.U. Around 90% of people wanted the government to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, illustrating the huge demand for us to be allowed a democratic vote on the 'European question'.\n\nThe signing of the Lisbon Treaty and its ratification by all E.U. countries meant that significant new powers were given to the European institutions. That makes it more than ever necessary for there to be an 'in our out' referendum on our E.U. membership as soon as possible.",
