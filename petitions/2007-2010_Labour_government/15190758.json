        "background": "We request that petrol prices be examined under a new scheme where petrol prices fluctuating due to profiteering and oil barrel hoarding by bankers, will be made impossible. Petrol prices should be capped at a maximum allowable level, so as to insure Petrol does not outstrip inflation, and does not cause misery to millions by rising by another 5 pence in the coming year. \u00a31.10.9 per litre was already unacceptable. Anything over \u00a31.19.9 is frankly, taking advantage of UK motorists. People on the continent don't pay these prices, and they NEVER would in America.\nWhen the public interest is in need of defence from unscrupulous business the government needs to act as representative of the people, and their concerns. Please cap petrol prices below \u00a31.15 per litre today.\nMonths ago we were promised the government would step in before petrol prices rose out of control, the time for action is now.",
