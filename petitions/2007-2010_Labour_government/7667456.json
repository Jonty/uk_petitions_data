        "background": "being epileptic myself i understand how hard it is when you wake up from your latest \"episode\" and you get that horrible feeling you know you cant drive for at least a year all being well and then you begin to think of all of those bus journeys, train journeys and especially those times you have to walk because its too late for a bus or train and you simply cannot afford that taxi that is why i think more should be given to epileptics to help with those problems so that they too can have the freedom of others - This case may also apply to other medical ailments but being only an epilepsy sufferer i cannot comment on any other point of view.",
