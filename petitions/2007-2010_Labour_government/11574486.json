        "background": "Dear Gordon,\n\nSome basic economic sense. By insuring, underwriting, and in effect, again rewarding the banks for their incompetence, gross mismanagement and lies of the last 10+ years you are yet again doing the general public of Great Britain a great disservice. \nIf you want to get people spending money again, I am afraid YOU are going to have to use that \u00a3200bn to pay people's mortgages off, and write off their debts - by doing that, you will free up the credit in the system again.\n\nAnd who pays the \u00a3200bn back - yes, you guessed it, you nationalise the banks and ensure that they pay it back - that way those who worked the industry are made to pay for their incompetence and continued gross arrogance.\n\nThey are laughing at you, (unelected)PM, and laughing VERY, VERY heartily and loudly, as they once again pay out nice fat bonuses and pay rises (end of 2008, start of 2009) as the rest of your unequal country suffer the pain!!!",
