I though it was incredible that we just about got rid of segregation and racism in so few years, but obviously I was wrong. How can we say that everyone is allowed to be free if there are party's trying to stop this? The BNP and other racist party's  are the ones ruining this country, not the people of whom the BNP and other racist party's are trying to propose we ban from being allowed to live in this country.",
