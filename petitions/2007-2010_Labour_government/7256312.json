        "background": "More of a Political Correction note. I am fed up with politicians, the media, Police Forces etc. etc. etc. and all those 'lobbiests?' using the term 'speed kills' SPEED DOES NOT KILL, having an accident kills. You can run over a childs head at less than 1mph and kill that child, it's the same at 100mph, so speed does not kill, but the act of an accident kills.\nEducate the public that careless driving is the cause of death on our roads, once the public get the brainwashing of this fact into thier heads then perhaps you might help in reducing the number of deaths and minor accidents that occur on our roads. So stop using the term to try and justify the location of supposed speed camera sites and that they combat excessive speed which causes accidents. Save the money we spend on cameras and modern technology to employ more police officers to enforce the law and not just create revenue for the government, local authorities and camera partnerships.",
