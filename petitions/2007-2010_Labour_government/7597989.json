            "background": "From 1 February 2008 the Career Transition Partnership, the company who are the preferred resettlement trainer to service leavers, will increase their training costs on 22 out of 55 of their resettlement courses, held at Aldershot and other centres, by an inflation busting 21% (Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator course) to 155% (Plastering course), despite the fact that the MoD supply their accommodation and equipment either free or at preferential rates.  The courses will then be too expensive for some service leavers and there is no increase in the Resettlement Training Grant from \u00a3534. E.g. The 2 day plastering course will increase from \u00a372 to \u00a3184 and the 1 week Locksmith Training Course from \u00a3644 to \u00a31062.",
