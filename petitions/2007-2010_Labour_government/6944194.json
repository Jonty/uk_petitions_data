            "background": "The sky in Britain is subject to increasing pressure in the form of air pollution from aircraft, emissions from private transport and light polution in the form of poorly designed public and private lighting schemes. This increase in polution is generating enormous amounts of carbon in the form of emmisions from vehicles and emmisions from coal/gas powered electricity generating stations that are required to produce the electricity to light up Britain. If the Sky was designated a national park it would be subject to laws restricting the amount of carbon that could be emitted into the park and also subject to the control of other forms of polution such as light. Local authorities would require stricter planning permissions and aircraft operators would be required to offest the carbon dumped into the atmoshphere through controls on volumes emitted.",
