            "background": "As a taxpaying university graduate with a Master's degree, I find it disgraceful that Mr Brown plans to give away 270,000 laptops to families on low income. Aren't we in the worst recession the country has ever seen? Why should I bother going to work when it seems I would be far better off quitting my job and getting everything provided for me. This proposal will only encourage those on benefits not to work. Computers and internet are priviledge's that must be earned.",
