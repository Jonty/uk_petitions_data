            "background": "To enforce fines of \u00a3100 or more for drunk people presenting in A & E who are incapable of looking after themselves and taking up valuable resources whilst genuinely ill people are forced to wait in corridors due to lack of cubicles and staff.  Intoxication is self inflicted and not an illness in the majority of cases.  Drunk people should not expect the emergency services to babysit them everytime they get drunk, they should take responsibility for themselves, hence being given a compulsory fine as soon as they are taken into an ambulance or through hospital doors.  These people take up valuable resources, are aggressive, non compliant, threatening, ungrateful and selfish and put other peoples lives at risk.",
