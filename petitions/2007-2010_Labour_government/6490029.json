            "background": "The fortnightly waste collections introduced in April by Rother District Council in Sussex have had the effect of an increased use of the local waste sites by householders.  This means the waste skips have to be changed more often, drivers are unable to access the sites whilst this is taking place and this leads to queuing on busy roads.  The sale of good items at one of these sites is to be closed owing to the need for more skips, these items will now be destroyed in landfill.  A great many of these good items are purchased by dealers and also the general public looking for a secondhand bargain.  This is hardly responsible recycling.  More journeys, more use of landfill.  The policy of fortnightly waste collections/recycling has been shown not to work here and undoubtedly is not working in other areas.",
