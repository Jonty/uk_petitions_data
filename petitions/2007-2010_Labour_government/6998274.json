        "background": "For hundreds of years now the North East of England has been neglected by consecutive governments. over the last 50 years consecutive governments have not only failed to develop the North East but in fact have done everything in their power to take jobs and services away from the North East. It is now time for this to stop and the only way for this to happen is for the North East of England to leave the United Kingdom. This is the only way to stop the people of the North East from being used to subsidise the North West, Scotland and London.",
