            "background": "The labour government is currently causing a massive increase in food price by giving farmers benefits to produce biofuels instead of food produce, whether it be the product or feed for animals. \n\nBiofuels have been proven to not be environmentaly friendly considering production and emmissions, Biofuels create ozone which kills people. \n\nI propose the government bans the production of biofuel in the UK and focus's on educating the public on how hydrogen really works, theres no need for hydrogen fuels stations as the hyrdrogen is produced in the powerplant, the only fuel required is water. \n\nI know this will be rejected because it will provide no blackmarket income for the labour government.",
