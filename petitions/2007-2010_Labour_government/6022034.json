        "background": "As peoples homes, cost of commute and survival continually increases as the greater percentage of their income.  While luxuries become more and more the equivalent of 'white goods' where repair is more expensive than renewal the only long term solution is to aim to reduce the cost of necessary expenses.  This will reduce the amount of money it costs to support those on welfare, while the working population will still be able to afford the extra money for luxuries and feel better for this return for supporting the tax system.  This will also act as an incentive for the unemployed to want to work.",
