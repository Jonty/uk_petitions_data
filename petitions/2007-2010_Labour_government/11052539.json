            "background": "A full enquiry into the baby p case is now needed, with the sackings of those involved in failing him.The buck has to stop somewhere and that starts with Shoesmith and the social workers who were negligent in their work, by failing this little boy.  I will not and cannot accept that after 60 visits no one picked up on anything wrong with baby p, the social services only make themselves look foolish by maintaining, they were hoodwinked by the mother. Experience would have shown them there was something wrong ask any caring mother or father. This being the second time this borough has tragically let down our children in care shows that the system they operate clearly isn't working.  The whole child care system needs revamping by means of getting advice from people with common sense and not the so called experts who live on another planet. The arrogance of Shoesmith is not what we want for the vunerable people in our society. We as a nation can do nothing now for baby p, but you can bet had we known beforehand we would have,so the very least we can do in his memory is to make sure there are no more baby p's suffering. Its time for Shoesmith and those that let baby p down to go.",
