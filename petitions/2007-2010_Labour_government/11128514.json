        "background": "With binge drinking and liver disease at an all time high and still rising in the young, we need to raise awareness and offer support. I lost my daughter Stacey Louise Rhymes to alcohol related liver disease at just 24. I have met with The Broxtowe Youth Council a team of 40 young people who speak on behalf of our youngsters and we would like to propose a Teenage Alcohol Unit at the QMC in Nottingham. This centre would offer help and support to both children and parents with alcohol issues and we would offer immediate help. If this proves to be successful we would like to see these units open throughout the UK. Our aims are to Educate, Prevent, Treat and Support.",
