            "background": "Students who register on a training course that includes some form of professional status eg Nurses, Teachers & Social Workers are required to have a CRB check at enhanced level before they start the course.  The CRB claims that students are not volunteers because the student is gaining academic credit.  The cost of the CRB check is considerable and is likely to rise following the introduction of the VBS scheme.  Students are often required to have 3 or 4 checks through out the course to be able to go to a new placement.  At \u00a337.00 a go this soon can be \u00a3148.+.  This cost is unnecessary and could be seen as a tax on learning.  CRB & VBS checks should be free for students.",
