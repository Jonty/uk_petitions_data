            "background": "This is in response, or reaction, to a petition against racism in schools; I signed that petition but I'm sure there is at least as much, if not more, sexism in schools: e.g. boys calling girls \"slags\" (if they do make themselves sexually available) or \"tight\" if they don't etc.  There is also what is known as the \"hidden curriculum\" in which girls internalise ideas about what is suitable for them, as girls who will become women, by observing the relative positions of male and female school staff.  And, of course, there was the recent report of the Head of an independent girls' school telling her pupils that, as girls, they couldn't \"have it all\"; my view of this is that women could have more if men, as a matter of course, had less and the fact that they don't seem prepared to is, almost certainly, due to the sexism experienced in schools.",
