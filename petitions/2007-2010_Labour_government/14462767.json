        "background": "Many companies make it very easy and convenient for consumers to purchase services such as satellite T.V. and broadband on the web. However, when it comes to consumers who would like to cancel they invariably force them to phone a call centre and spend a lot of time on the phone. The call centre staff are also trained to argue over and delay the cancellation resulting in an even longer telephone call. This is a one-sided situation with companies enjoying the benefits of using the web to market a product but denying the consumer the benefit of using the web to cancel the agreement.",
