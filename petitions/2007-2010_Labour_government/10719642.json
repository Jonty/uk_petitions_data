They have no license or training which needs to be stopped as people are becoming scarred and seriously at risk of disease. We studio worker's have to have license's to work and our waste has to be controlled it's only fair that equipment should be controlled. People working in bedrooms are throwning contaminated waste in with general rubbish causing a serious health risk. It is about time it was stopped or controlled. Children are now tattooing and becoming tattooed due to this.",
