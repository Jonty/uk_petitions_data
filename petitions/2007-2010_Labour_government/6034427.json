            "background": "YouTube and Life Leak both allow and carry uploaded video's of young people and Teenagers, being attacked bullied and then beaten, in some cases half to death. These are then video'ed on mobile phones and uploaded for the world to see over and over again, prolonging the victims suffereing. YouTube has a policing policy of \"the viewers do the policing\" lets remember that its the viewers who upload this stuff. For example a young teenager was beaten to unconsciousness and over 1700 people viewed the video, not one(!!!) flagged it to YouTube. Life Leak do the same thing. The MoD uses Life Leak (Panorama BBC One 30th July 2007) and I also petition them to stop. A govornment Dept should NOT be seen supporting such deplorable websites showing such violent behaviour.",
