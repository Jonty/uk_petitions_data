        "background": "Build a much needed new hospital at Pease Pottage NOW thus bringing first class medical facilities closer to the community, taking pressure off East Surrey Hospital allowing for an expansion in specialist treatment and in line with Government policy and public consultation. One of labour's manifestos at the last election was to build one hundred new hopsitals. With the closer of Crawley hospital, east surrey is overloaded and therefore the labour government should include a new hospital at Pease Pottage.",
