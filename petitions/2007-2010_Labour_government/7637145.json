        "action": "ask for the immediate resignation of the Fisheries Minister, and to reduce the fisheries quota to scientifically advised levels with immediate effect",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In a farcical scenario, that will be repeated ad nauseam in the coming years, we see yet again that a government minister has gone for short-term economic appeasement rather than scientifically-advised sustainability.\nThe International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Ices), which (apparently) advises the European Union, has stated that there is no current evidence of a sustained recovery in the Cod stocks. Naturally the EU Fisheries Council has taken this to mean it is appropriate to increase quotas.\n\nThis is likely to be the tip of the iceberg as the government starts to come to terms (read: avoids) the real challenges we have to face in dealing with mankind's impact on the global warming cycle - and our impact in other environmental areas, such as deforestation, species-extinctions and habitat-loss.",
