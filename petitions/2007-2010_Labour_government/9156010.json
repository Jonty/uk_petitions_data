            "background": "Plans on the Centre Severn website outline the development of this area in Gloucester for mixed use/employment.  At one time, it was planned to be a nature reserve, but now this area is to be built on.  The Horsebere brook runs right through this site.  The site flooded in the Summer Floods 07.  This helped to ease the flooding in Longlevens.  Building on this site will mean less infiltration of water, hence making problems even worse in Longlevens, especially Cypress Gardens.  The water has to go somewhere!  It is unfair on the residents who have not been consulted.  A nature reserve would improve the situation dramatically, also improving wildlife.  Considering the council tax was raised in Gloucester to provide extra flood protection and prevention, this plan is completely counter-intuitive.  The recent floods affected many residents dearly and we must show our concern and stop any flooding in the future.  Please sign the petition.",
