        "background": "Interns and 'volunteers' perform a vital role in the successful functioning of MP's offices and the wider parliamentary administrative system. It is a privilege to work for the UK Parliament and the British public. A parliamentary internship  is also an extremely beneficial experience in terms of career development in politics and public service. But the lack of payment for this work is fundamentally unfair. It limits the talent pool available to MP's and denies access to those people from less privileged backgrounds who want to develop a career in politics but who cannot afford to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world and sustain themselves for long periods of time without a basic level of income. This petition calls for a wage to introduced for all interns working for MP's so that these rewarding career opportunities are available to the many-not the few!",
