            "background": "During the Scottish election campaign and within the SNP's election manifesto the Rt Hon. Alex Salmond MP MSP and his party made several clear promises to the people of Scotland. These promises included; replacing the council tax in Scotland with a Local Income Tax; cutting class sizes to 18; providing first time buyers with a \u00a32,000 grant for first time homebuyers: paying off student debts as well as the creation of a Scottish Futures Trust to replace the use of PPP in building schools and hospitals. At the present moment it is clear that none of these clearly made promises have been held, and none are likely to be introduced for the people who voted for them. This level of deception wihtin politics discredits all involved in the political system. As the First Minister is the leading Minister of a parliament created by the Westminster parliament, the failings of the Scottish Government must be highlighted within the House of Commons.",
