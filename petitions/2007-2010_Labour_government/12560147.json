            "background": "Ever since the residential construction in Eastbourne\u2019s South Harbour, Ramsay Way has become a main route used by vehicles travelling in and out of the area, now encasing well over a thousand dwellings.\n\nThe 1km stretch of road has a 30mph but has NO pedestrian crossings whatsoever, even though there are 2 schools within 1 mile, numerous within 5 miles, and various nursery schools, all within reach of the residents of this area.\n\nCrossing this road is a concern for all ages, children and the elderly alike \u2013 numerous vehicles travel well in excess of 30mph on a regular occasion, leaving little hope for anyone judging their speed and distance.\n\nFurther to my 10 year old brother being hit by a vehicle on this road in May 2009, I feel the need to raise awareness of this situation and petition for everyone\u2019s support in this desperate need for safety in our local community.\n\nWe suggest road calming measures and appropriately placed pedestrian crossings are applied along the full stretch of road.",
