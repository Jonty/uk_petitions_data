            "background": "On the 11th of November 2007, 6 boys aged 12 and under were able to enter a large B&Q Store completely unchallenged by staff or security and steal a variety of potentially lethal KNIVES. \nThe boys were able to open the security tagged packaging with their teeth and dispose of it, allowing them to conceal the KNIVES on their person and leave the store. \nFortunately a member of the public alerted the Police after witnessing the boys playing with the KNIVES in a local skate park.\nThese KNIVES are readily available on the shelves in DIY stores throughout the UK with little or no security to prevent them from finding their way onto our streets and into our communities.\nWe would like strict measures to be put in place to eliminate the possibility of this in future. \nAll KNIVES should be kept behind secure glass for display, and only handled or purchased upon proof of identification showing the consumer to be over the age of 21years.",
