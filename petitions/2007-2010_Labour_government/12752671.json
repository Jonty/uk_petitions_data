            "background": "There are ten's of thousands of children currently in care in the UK. \n\nAs it stands the law does not allow same sex couples to offer caring stable homes to these children. \n\n5 times, the law has been put back and is clearly not being treated as urgent. \n\nThere are same sex couples out there, trained and ready to offer safe homes to some very vulnerable children. \n\nIts a hard fact that children are still living in dangerous enviroments which the governemnt is compounding by not changing this law!\n\nUrgent action is required to get these children to safety, please sign this petition to allow same sex couples to offer safe homes to these children and get them away from danger.",
