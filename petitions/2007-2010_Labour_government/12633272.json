            "background": "The scandal over MPs expenses has led to a catastrophic collapse of trust in Parliament and politics. A collapse of trust on this scale is damaging not only to politics, but ultimately to all of society.\nAny inquiry into the expenses system would require the current MPs to decide on or approve any remedial action - a clearly inappropriate method of dealing with the issue.\nTo restore trust in Parliament and UK politics, we call upon the Prime Minister to show true moral leadership, and call an immediate general election, to enable the people of the UK to return MPs they trust to carry out thorough reform.",
