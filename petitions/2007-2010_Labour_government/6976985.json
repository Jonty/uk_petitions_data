            "background": "The above Post Office is very busy and well used throughout the week, closing it will increase road congestion in the local area and overburden the main office in the town centre where queues are already excessive.  This policy of closure goes against the government environmental agenda, makes poor economic sense as the public will be forced into using more expensive companies not the Royal Mail, and is an assault on already fragile communities.",
