            "background": "In most countries around the world AM, FM and SSB are legal modes for use on CB radio. The frequencies used are the same as UK legal CEPT channels. There are already many hundreds of CB radio users who are using illegal equipement in the UK, which is capable of being used to transmit in these modes. It would make perfect sense for UK to de-regulate CB radio and bring it inline with other countries world wide. There is little or no reported interference problems with ANY other radio frequency users. Europe and the USA do not have massive interference issues so why should the UK? Surely this is now only a paper exercise to make these radios legal for use in the UK?\n\nPlease sign this petition in order for you to make you point known to the UK government.\n\nMany Thanks\n\nDavid",
