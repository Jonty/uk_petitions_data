            "background": "Although the Government's plans to extend the 28-day limit for detaining terror suspects without charge has come under fresh fire from a former Lord Chief Justice. Depsite Lord Woolf's insistence that ministers and the police had still not produced proof to show that a change in the law was needed- the fact that so many bombs are exploding seems to me personally to be justification enough. There are many examples where govt has failed in it's statutory duty to provide protection from the state. Whilst Britain's constitutional heritage is based on the human right to be assumed to be innocent until proven guilty, the fact that police powers to detain suspects is being extended more than 50 days does not necessarily call this into doubt ! Keep up the good work, Rt Hon Jacqui Smith ! Presumably investigators and police are sensisble enough not to use the extension unless warranted.",
