            "background": "It has been highlighted on GMTV that the number of illegal builds in Albox, Spain is rising. Most of these are people who have paid taxes etc all their life to the British government & have retired to live their dream in Spain using all their savings etc to live.  There dreams are being demolished by the Spainish government as they are knocking them down leaving these poor people not only homeless but broke.  Please sign this petition so that it can be highlighted to Mr Gordon Brown that even though these people have moved to Spain they are still are British and need help. Mr Brown needs to speak to the Spainish Government to help these people.  Thank you",
