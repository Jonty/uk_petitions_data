        "background": "we want automatic inclusion of the blue badge scheme for people with autism . \nFor example, children with autism may be able to handle an activity such as walking to the shops one day and not be able to do it the next because of factors such as anxiety, fear or stress: they may be scared of dogs and have passed one on the street, or they might become distressed by a particular noise and be unable to continue their journey.As a result, they may do things which are dangerous, such as sit down in the middle of a busy road. Having a blue badge may help to reduce these kinds of risks.",
