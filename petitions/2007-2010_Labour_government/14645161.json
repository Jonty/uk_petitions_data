            "background": "Dear Prime Minister\n\nEffective communication skills and proficiency in the spoken\n    language of patients (English) in Britain should be a mandatory\n    requirement for all  frontline health care professionals to\n    deliver patient care safely. The \u2018unlawful\u2019 killing of David\n    Gray from Cambridgeshire by a German GP (General Practitioner)\n    Daniel Ubani is yet another example of lapses in our\n    legislation failing to safeguard patient safety. The present  legislation\n    allows the GMC (General Medical Council) to grant  EEA (\n    European Economic Area) doctors registration without having to\n    demonstrate their English language proficiency, thus very\n    seriously compromising the patient care and safety in some\n    instances.  I request the Prime Minister to implement  the\n    recommendations made by the H M Coroner William Morris\n    following the inquest of Mr Gray's death to review the European\n    Union regulations which allow free movement of doctors and to\n    establish a better system of assessment by the NHS (National\n    Health Service) of overseas doctors' ability to work in the UK.\n\nThank you\n\n(Please forward this e-petition to all your contacts without fail)",
