            "background": "In 1947 British India split into two states formed along religious and ethnic lines; Pakistan for the Muslims and India for the Hindu's. Kashmir; a Muslim majority state was signed over to India by an Occupying force, a non -Muslim King.  \n\nIn three resolutions, the UN Security Council and the United Nations Commission in India and Pakistan recommended that as already agreed by Indian and Pakistani leaders, a plebiscite should be held to determine the future allegiance of the entire state. \n\nSince then Pakistan and India have fought 4 wars over Kashmir, one nearly turned nuclear. India has stationed nearly half a million security forces in Kashmir and committed widely documented human rights abuses. \n\nIndia should not be allowed to become a permanent UN member until the people of Kashmir are given their vote on their future, a vote people in Britain enjoy every 5 years. \n\nBy Britain exercising it's vote in the UNSC correctly, it could make a real difference in the world as well as making nearly 700,000 British Kashmiri's feel proud to be British.",
