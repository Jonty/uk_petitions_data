            "background": "We believe that, if the government can find the money to save top businesses going under , they can just as easily provide safe drinking water for more than half of the third world. Although the number of people living without adequate sanitation or drinking water has decreased in the past 15 years, it is still at a very high level. This, in our opinion, is just not good enough. So, we believe that if you don\u2019t help improve drinking water and sanitation amongst the third world, then that is a crime against humanity, especially considering you are one of the few people in the world who has the power to change the lives of many.",
