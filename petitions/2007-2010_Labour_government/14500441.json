            "background": "No person should be convicted of murder if the intent is clearly through compassion.  The court can allow food and water to be terminated thus killing a person by omission (Bland case), therefore it is illogical that the court cannot authorise killing in the same situation by a lethal injection thus ending life quickly, painlessly and with dignity.\n\nIt is a travesty of the justice system that a Frances Inglis has been sentenced to life imprisonment for an act that no ordinary member of the public would describe as murder.\n\nThis applies also to assisted suicide.  People of sound mind, but physically incapable, should be allowed to choose how they die and be allowed to die with dignity.",
