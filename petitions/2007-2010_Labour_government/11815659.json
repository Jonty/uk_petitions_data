        "background": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to prevent a strategic gap of 48 acres at Pincents Hill being developed. It is beautiful woodland and natural heath which rivals the adjoining AONB. It is a haven to a wonderful diversity of animals, including badgers and many threatened species. It is agricultural land that has a 37 acre unofficial disused golf course on it. The public have used this land as amenity land for over 30\nyears for nature walks (schools etc use it).  It has two public rights of way - a landmark site since the 1100's Anglo Saxon Tigel Hurst. Tilehust is ordinary it has 3 things to offer, schools,this beautiful coutryside site and its people. This area is the quiet soul of Tilehurst. The threat is 900 dwellings - Tilehurst will lose it's identity.  We need to leave something beautiful for our children to enjoy.  The Council has enough brown field sites to meet the governments housing requirements with no need to use this site. In 1985 a planning application for 250 homes the Inspectorate was declined, if the site was not sustainable for 250 dwellings it is still unsustainable.   Please don't let us lose the last open green space in Tilehurst we desperately need it.",
