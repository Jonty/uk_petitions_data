        "background": "WHEREAS\n\n1. the Prime Minister, the government which he leads and his non-Scandinavian EU partners have provided grossly inadequate loan and swap facilities to Icelandic institutions in their time of greatest need, in circumstances where a modest effort in global financial terms would have made a disproportionate difference;\n\n2. the result has been great hardship in Iceland and severe financial damage to individuals,  companies and public sector bodies within the U.K. (all of which events ought to have been foreseen by ministers and officials);\n\n3. since the results of their policy misjudgements have become obvious, the Prime Minister and his government have engaged in aggressive and intemperate public rhetoric towards a friendly people who provided the U.K. and its allies with a vital \"unsinkable aircraft carrier\" during World War II;\n\nNOW THEREFORE We the undersigned pray that the Prime Minister promptly take action to assist the government and people of Iceland in order to repair to some degree the exceptional damage caused by the U.K.'s unneighbourly parsimony to date;\n\nAND as in duty bound, etc",
