            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Much is made by supermarkets of how they are selling petrol for less than one pound a litre. However at no time have they reduced the cost of a litre of Liquid Petroleum Gas. The price has risen steadily from around 34p a litre two years ago to a ridiculous 56pence a litre - this is over 60% rise in price. LPG vehicle owners have had to suffer this as they are small in number and do not attract sympathy from other fuel users. However conversion costs are often around \u00a32000. Why convert - it is cleaner and more environmentally friendly. The govermnent used to recognise this with conversion incentives and do not now support this subsidy. All that is asked here is for equity for LPG users.I understand the same is true for LPG home users.",
