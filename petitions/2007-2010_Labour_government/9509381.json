        "background": "In Albania the albanian wolfhounds are hunted for their paws which when grounded down into a powder are used to create a feeling of outer bodyness commonly refered to as a \"high.\" Albanian Wolfhound poachers will often target puppies and cut all but one paw off (the back left as it is considered evil) and through the poor puppy back out into the wild only to be consumed by a predator whilst trying to crawl away on a solitary paw. Please help me in this campaign against cruelty.",
