        "background": "Throughout history consenting violence, otherwise known as dueling, has been an accepted medium through which disputes relating to the honour of an individual may be settled.\n\nWe petition that legislation should be presented or created that legalises dueling as an acceptable form of settling honour-related disputes. \n\nDuels should be arranged two weeks prior to the date that they commence, this will allow a 'cooling down' period. \n\nDuels should be arranged in the presence of at least two witnesses with agreed weapons or lack thereof set down in advance.\n\nThe use of a 'contract' signed by the individuals and witnesses will reduce the margin for 'error'. This contract should be drawn up by the challenging individual and signed by the consenting. There should be no need for legal representative to be present for the creation of the 'contract'.\n\nThis will reduce the need for petty law-suits and will allow a medium through which honour-related disputes can be settled without the urge for unlawful practice.",
