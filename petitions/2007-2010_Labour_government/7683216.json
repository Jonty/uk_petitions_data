We wish the Prime Minister to find a way in which to provide Transport on the 25th and 26th December. In a climate where the use of cars is discouraged, it would make sense to provide these services so that families and friends can celebrate as well as providing Doctors, Nurses and other essential workers a way to get to work without using and paying for a taxi! This would be in line with other cities in Europe that provide a reduced service on these days. There is a demand for services on these days and we believe it should be provided.",
