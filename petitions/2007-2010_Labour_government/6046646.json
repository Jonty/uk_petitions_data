            "background": "It is not uncommon for recipients of Sickness Benefit who have no savings and no other income to find they are entitled only to partial Council Tax Benefit, no concessions on transport or admissions to local facilities, reductions in dental and optical costs rather than full help, and no assistance with prescription costs at all. They don\u2019t qualify for Income Support, because apparently Sickness Benefit is \u2018enough to live on\u2019, so they don\u2019t get access to all the other things that Income Support or Jobseeker claimants do.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough living with long-term illness, without making sick people have to cut back on food in order to get the medication they need or have a tooth abscess treated. Sick people need just as much benefit as the unemployed, if not more in order to compensate for what they can\u2019t do because of illness. Immediate action should be taken to ensure that recipients of Sickness Benefit are no poorer than anyone else on benefits.",
