        "background": "I think the Government should allow local councils the option to let Licenced premises opt out of the smoking ban by paying an yearly fee. For a fee of \u00a3500 the pubs/clubs would be given a licence to allow people smoke inside, providing their ventilation reaches a certain standard and notices are placed near entrances. Not only would this system help the ailing pub industry but it will create easy, much needed extra revenue for local councils. This system could easily be enforced by councils, and pubs/clubs that break the terms of the licence will have their licence revoked and the personal licence holder would be banned from applying again for 5 years.",
