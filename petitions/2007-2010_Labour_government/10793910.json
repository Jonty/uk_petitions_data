We, the undersigned, think it is unfair that we have to pay around \u00a310 a month on sanitary protection (Tampax etc. ) when they are a necessary requirement. Condoms and other types of contraception are available to all on the NHS. We, the undersigned, think that forms of sanitary protection should also be available on the NHS.",
