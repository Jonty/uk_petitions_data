        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Newcastle western bypass requires upgrading due to the volume of traffic trying to bypass around Newcastle. It can take over 1/2 an hour to go around the bypass and sometimes even longer. Current levels of traffic are very high causing accidents and traffic holdups. This adds cost to transport companies, wastes fuel and this will only be passed on to the consumer. Time is money and they need to get to their destination on time as well as those trying to get to work. Emergency services also get held up going to an emergency. Government funding is required to improve this area.",
