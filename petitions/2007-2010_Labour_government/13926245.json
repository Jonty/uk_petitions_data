            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We request a special investigation into the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)'s  press release dated 23 June 2009 -\"OFT warns consumers about 'debt sale' scams\" [Press Release #72/09]; as its contents breach Article 6 of the Human Rights Act. The OFT has failed to contact anyone directly with regard to the selling of debt which they have labelled publicly as a 'scam' and 'criminal', without giving the people involved any right to reply. This breaches Article 6 of the Human Rights Act because it denies people the right to a tribunal which in this case should be held in a criminal court. \n\n\nWe think it is a disgrace that Ray Watson has made this type of public statement without considering the full facts and we object to people being called and labelled as 'criminals'. Ray Watson should do the decent thing and hand in his resignation. If he fails to do so, as he has refused to do before, he should be made to resign.\n\n\nWe request a special investigation into the harassment of Sellers through the debt collection practices of Lenders and Debt Collectors and specifically the practices related to telephone calls and default notices being issued after the credit agreement has been terminated.",
