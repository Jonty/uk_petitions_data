It currently is a territory rented from your own (it's borders being identicle to those of bedroom 5 in house twelve of Fife Park [a st andrews university campus]) and our inhabitants want freedom. We are a peace-loving nation, and a strongly democratic one that aims to slowly reduce the power of the monarch until republicanism can replace it. We dearly want independance, so as to begin being recognised as an independant nation in our own right. Thankyou.",
