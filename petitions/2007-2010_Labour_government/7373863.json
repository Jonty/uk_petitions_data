        "background": "After's Englands dismal performance in the week against Croatia and many other factors the time has come for the FA to be Sacked. There are so many things wrong with English football at the moment from grass roots level upto the the national game. The people that are in charge like Brian Barwick are out of touch with the modern game and the people alongside him have no knowledge either. Young players will suffer imagine your son or daughter at the age of ten being told your not good enough. We need ex players and managers to be in charge and look at how we can become a major footballing nation.",
