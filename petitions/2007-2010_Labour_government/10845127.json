            "background": "Service personnel and their families move house frequently which includes finding a new dental service every time. Finding an NHS dentist is almost impossible or they have long waiting lists and the likelyhood is that you may be moving on again by the time a place becomes available. Paying for a private dentist can be costly but sometimes we don't have a choice. In overseas postings forces-led dental treatment is provided incurring a cost which is usually not a problem considering the fact that we actually have access to a reliable dentist without having to find one. Just because we are posted within the UK should not be treated any differently to being overseas.",
