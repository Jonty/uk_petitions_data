'Positive Discrimination' is automatically negative towards someone, in this case against the majority of people in this country by precluding them on purely racial grounds. This is hardly democratic. We would also like to point out that we'd like our taxes to be spent as productively as possible. Precluding suitable candidates on racial grounds is not doing this.",
