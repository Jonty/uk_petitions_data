        "action": "compel all mortgage lenders to restrict their charges to mortgagees to jus 1.5% more than the interest rate set by the Government.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The reduction in interest rates has been welcome, but many lenders are:\n1) either not passing the discount on\nor\n2) holding their borrowers to the terms of a fixed rate contract way above current interest rates\n\nIf the Government compelled all lenders to set their rates as suggested, then every mortgage household could be better by off by thousands over the next 12 months.\nEqually, strugglers could adopt interest only payments until their personal circumstance improves.\n\nIn example:\nA \u00a3200K mortgage over 25 years at 6.5% = around \u00a31750.\nAt 3.5% this drops to \u00a31250 = saving \u00a3500 a month.\n\nThe cost to the tax payer is nominal and with Government aiding any lenders who get into difficulty, this must be a win win for the nation.",
