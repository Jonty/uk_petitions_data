        "background": "The TV licence is paid by UK public, almost entirely, to the BBC who, despite recently saying they are impartial, have been pushing a form of social engineering and political correctness for many years now, particularly in regard to history and Islam. I feel it's a breach of peoples rights to expect, by law, every citizen whos beliefs are flaunted to be part of this outrage. Do we pay a TV licence to be lied to... I think not!",
