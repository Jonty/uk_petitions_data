Amir Khan must be thanking Allah he has celebrity status on this one when people are sentanced to jail time for much less. Joey Barton, enough said about him nothing more than a thug! Pete \"druggy\" Docherty etc etc etc. How many scum bags and law breakers escape proper punishment because they appear on our TV with frequency? If these people were like the 90% of us who work bloody hard for not a lot they would all be in jail as I type. It is outrageous that there are rules for them and rules for us. What will this government do to ensure that the law treats ALL people the same when it comes to sentancing and punishment or should we all start our own cable tv access shows to get a more leniant sentace and blame our \"difficult celebrity lives\" for our inability to stay on the straight and narrow?",
