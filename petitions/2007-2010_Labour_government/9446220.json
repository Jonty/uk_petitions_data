        "background": "The effect of this would be that branch surgeries, particularly in rural areas, would not be able to dispense medicines to patients, forcing them to make longer journeys to a pharmacy. This would be particularly onerous for older patients, young families and for those without personal transport. It could also result in branch surgeries becoming less viable with the same or worse consequences",
