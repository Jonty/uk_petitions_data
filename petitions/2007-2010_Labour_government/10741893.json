            "background": "aside from the dangers hilighted recently about  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) the world's largest particle accelerator destroying everything...  who gave the money to them in the first place? what good has come from anything nuclear? \nsearch the web we have companies making electric 12.5 ton lorries  buses cars  motorbikes,\n solar power works i use it myself, surely this money would better serve mankind finetuning solar and wind power and storage batteries, and electric motors. to make them affordable. instead of \u00a336000 for an electric version of the mini.. this also cuts our oil use reducing income of countries who desire nuclear and other weapons.  surely therefore reducing our expenditure on armour to combat their threat... cern  is certainly a concern, the type of underground cavern in so many a james bond film that he has to destroy.  besides complain all i can do is to stop voting, i am ashamed that i ever voted for people that could waste so much money on things such as cern.",
