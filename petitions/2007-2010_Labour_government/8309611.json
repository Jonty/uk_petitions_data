        "background": "Brass band members have been lobbying Culture Minister Margaret Hodge over what they see as inadequate funding. \nThe musicians hope the government will provide more cash, ensuring the survival of such bands. \n\nBarnsley East and Mexborough MP, Jeff Ennis claims that for every \u00a31 given to brass bands, opera receives \u00a31,113. \n\nSource: news.bbc.co.uk\n\nPlease sign the petition if any of your family or ancestors ever worked in a colliery, if your kids' school has a band, if you ever heard a brass band live or on film/TV (so that's probably everybody then).\n\nThank you - now tell your friends.",
