            "background": "Jackie Smith is just the most recent in a very long line of politicians who believe they are more important and deserve to be treated better than those who elected them and who they should be serving.\n\nIf she can't even manage her own expense claim, how can she be trusted with the important matters affecting the citizens of this country. Telling us that she made a mistake is not acceptable - ensuring the way she spends public money on herself should be most important to her as it demonstrates the respect (or contempt?) she has for the voters.\n\nFor the rest of the population, where an individual is provided with living expenses, there will be a charge to tax and a liability for NICs on the value of that benefit. If Jackie Smith and her family are using the publicly funded Internet connection for personal use, she should be taxed accordingly \n\nThe signatories of this petition require that the tax authorities investigate MP's benefits and ensure all benefits are taxed accordingly",
