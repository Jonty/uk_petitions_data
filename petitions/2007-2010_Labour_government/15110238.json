            "background": "Most people cannot afford to buy a 'few thousand' shares. It is not acceptable that the taxpayers investment in RBS and Lloyds should be sold at cheap rates to the few people who can afford to buy them (probably bankers!).  Everybody has paid the price, so everybody should share the reward when they eventually make a profit. There is no need to guarantee all the shares are sold at once, so there is no reason why they cannot be sold gradually at full market rates.",
