            "background": "In 2007 Lord Carter published his report into reducing prison overcrowding.  The report estimated that by 2014 the prison population would reach over 100,000. His key recommendation was to build 3 titan prisons housing 2,500 inmates each, costing \u00a32.3 billion.  \n\nThe proposals have been universally condemned, not least by the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers.  Carter chose to ignore the report produced earlier in the year by Baroness Corston that detailed the appalling state of mental and physical health in women\u2019s prisons and fly in the face of evidence that smaller prisons are more effective in reducing suicide and self harm rates.   In 2008 the rate of suicide in British prisons increased by almost 30% on 2006 figures. \n\nMany expected that the Carter report would look to reduce the rate at which we send offenders to prison in the UK.  Prison is ineffective in reducing re-offending, detrimental to the mental and physical health of individuals, and shockingly expensive compared to more effective community orders. These proposals will merely warehouse Britain\u2019s social problems.",
