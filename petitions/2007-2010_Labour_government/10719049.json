            "background": "I feel the Prime Minister and Government should investigate BT and others ISP's proposed use of Phorm technology and behavioural targeting.  As an ordinary subject, i feel this is a step too far. We are already in bad times and now possibly have to put up with what amounts to snooping on our web-use,it is simply un-acceptable in most cases, unless on grounds of national security. I would urge Mr Brown to look into this, for the benefit of all who enjoy use of the internet in this country.\n\n Talking for myself and most of the people i know, i can only say, that most feel that life in Britain over the last two decades has honestly become increasingly stressful and now increasingly dangerous.Many ordinary workers, are working longer hours. Family time is commonly at a premium. \n\nThe Labour party...(new, or otherwise)...was i believe, set up for the help and benefit of the average working person, as i'm sure the Prime Minister is aware.  I feel it is time to concentrate on our country's issues foremost going forward and hope the Prime Minister and his party, can achieve some of these goals in the forseeable future.",
