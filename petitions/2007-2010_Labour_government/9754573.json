The only say we get is to vote for our party, after that, whatever happens to the country is passed over to the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\n\nIt's a good system, but the problem is that the Lords and MPs don't actually know what the people want. \n\nSo, my propostion is to let the public vote, online or by post, to decide weather a law is passed or not. Things that don't effect the public can be left out. \n\nThis would help in places where the government tries to help with education or tries to financialy help the public. Too often to the gonvernment start laws that are meant to help children, but just takes the fun out of things.",
