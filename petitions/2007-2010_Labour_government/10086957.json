            "background": "There is a lot of advice available, but no real solution to the financial risk that must be borne by those of us looking to start a business or commercialise an invention.\n\nFinancial commitments and priorities such as a mortgage or saving for retirement prevent many viable businesses propositions from ever seeing the light of day. This leads to much of the work carried out by government enterprise and innovation promotional campaigns never bearing fruit.\n\nMicro-investment platforms that allow risks and returns to be spread across a number of resource and capital investors  in a controlled manner seem to offer a valid solution to this problem.\n\nWe would like to ask the government to explore available solutions in more detail with a view to making them available alongside the other free advisory and match funded grant assistance available to entrepreneurs and innovators.",
