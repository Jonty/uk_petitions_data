The country is full of different religions, why should we have a Christian one shoved down our throats by TV and shops, it was after all originally Pagan! So why not change the name to suit it for everyone, after all the Americans have.\n\nI wish the government to pass legislation so that Religious Commercial Advertising and Public Displays are banned or make it universal for everyone.",
