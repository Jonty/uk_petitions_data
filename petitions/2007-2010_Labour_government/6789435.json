        "background": "My Petition requests that the Royal Mail be allowed to cater differently for public and business deliveries.  This will allow the Royal mail to price correctly and independently for both public and business mail.\n\nBusiness would get and pay for the service it requires and would gain a raft of tailored services to suit it's needs.  The public meanwhile would pay a minimum charge for a more basic, reliable and appropriate service.  Royal Mail is dying slowly as everyone can see, so please help to give mail delivery in this country a shove towards a new era for the sake of the public, Royal Mail employees and British business.",
