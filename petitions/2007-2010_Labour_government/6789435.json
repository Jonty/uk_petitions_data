This will allow the Royal mail to price correctly and independently for both public and business mail.\n\nBusiness would get and pay for the service it requires and would gain a raft of tailored services to suit it's needs.  The public meanwhile would pay a minimum charge for a more basic, reliable and appropriate service.  Royal Mail is dying slowly as everyone can see, so please help to give mail delivery in this country a shove towards a new era for the sake of the public, Royal Mail employees and British business.",
