            "background": "The japanese have just announced that after decades of adhering to the international ban on whaling of humpbacks, that they are to continue now that they are no longer an endangered species.  They do this supposedly in the name of research despite many other nations researching these amazing creatures without any slaughtering taking place.  They were driven to the brink of extinction before and if nothing is done to stop the Japanese, they will be again.  Environmental change does not only include the reduction of harmful emissions but is vital to preserve our planets finest gems, including Humpback Whales.  Commercial whaling has no place in todays world and must be stopped.",
