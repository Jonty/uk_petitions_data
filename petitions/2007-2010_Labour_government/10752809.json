            "background": "Electronic Identification will ruin the sheep sector. It will be time consuming and very expensive. It doesn\u2019t work in wet conditions, which is no good. It is predicted that a large proportion sheep producers will give up because of this regulation. At a time when food is becoming more expensive isn\u2019t it better to support British farmers. If this regulation is bought in then you will probably have to import lamb, which will cost more because of the pound being so weak. Also the age of the British farmer is getting older and some farmers are to old to start to learn to use electronic identification. Can you help the British farming industry buy saying NO to electronic identification.",
