Children should be well rithin their rights to have a say in how their country is run.\n\nwhen women were denied the vote it was considered sexist. Why should the young also be discriminated against in this way\n\nDemocracy means a country run by the people, if children are not helping to run the country does that imply that they are not considered people.\n\nHelp end the unfairness. Make sure that everyone has an equal right. Make Britain a democracy.",
