The people in the pictures were holding banners saying Europe is going to suffer as America did 9/11. How can we allow such people who threaten our countries to live in them? The country has gone soft. The government is spineless allowing such rallies to take place on British soil. Deport not just the organisers, but everyone who joins the rallies because you never know, the next bomb they plant could take your own family out.",
