            "background": "It frustates me to find out that only the really poor households in the uk qualify for free school dinners for their children. Why is this not open to all children. My husband and I both work but we cant afford to pay out \u00a340.00 a month for school dinners. And thats just for one child. If the government and other agencies are now trying to tackle obesity in the next generations; why are they not offering healthy free school dinners to all pupils. Is this class discrimination?\n\nPlease sign this petition and pass on to all you know. thanks",
