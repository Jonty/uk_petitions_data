            "background": "It is not acceptable to have an army of unemployed people whilst we also have an equal number of elderly in need of care and a community in need of attention. Benefits are a temporary solution and not a lifestyle choice. JSA should be paid for 12 weeks before the recipient must work 40 hours per week in the community to receive it. The idea being that it would encourage the claimant to find work. Incapacity Benefit is also abused. Genuinely disabled people on the whole want to work so give them the opportunity. Incapacity Benefit should be paid to people on the proviso that they attend a tailored rehabilitation programme for 40 hours per week. That way the genuine claimant's would get better and the fraudulent claimant's would soon stop claiming.",
