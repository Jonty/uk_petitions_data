        "background": "Recently, the decision to save the historic buildings at the former National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) was overuled and they are now scheduled for demolition. \n\nAnd what will they be replaced with? A mega depot.\n\nThe site has a rich aerospace history, with planes such as Concorde being tested there. Somehow I doubt that a massive warehouse will worm its way into the fabric of Britain in quite the same way as Concorde did. I therefore urge the Prime Ministrer to overule this decision before some of Britains history is lost forever, only to be replaced by a shed.\n\nhttp://www.gethampshire.co.uk/news/s/2024903_pyestock_mega_depot",
