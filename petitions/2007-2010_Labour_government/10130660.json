A previous petition stated that this airport does not come  section 80 for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and would need to be dealt with locally.  I would therefore ask the prime minister to add this airport to the Aviation act to protect the people who live along this flight path from probable environmental/health damage.",
