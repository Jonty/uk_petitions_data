        "background": "Laser hair removal is an absolutely necessary step for all people born transsexual/transgendered who wish to live their life as a female.\nCurrently this treatment is only available in the private sector and usually costs around \u00a33000 for the entire body. We the undersigned believe this to be completely unfair as the vast majority of people born with this condition do not have the financial resources for this treatment. We pay huge amounts of tax for free treatment on the NHS, however the male-to-female transgendered community is being discriminated against because the treatment we require most is not available on the NHS.",
