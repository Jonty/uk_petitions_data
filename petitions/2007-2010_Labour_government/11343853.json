        "background": "Children and Adults suffering from phobias which cause moderate to severe anxiety disorders and who suffer from anxiety disorders in general get left in the dark. We all have a right to an education but yet we aren't given the help we need instead we are forced to leave education or are threatened if we don't go in but mentally we can't. This petition is to raise awareness of phobias and anxiety disorders so that we get the help we deserve when in work and school, also for those with severe anxiety to be allowed to have home education provided by there school until they are well enough to return to education. To provide doctors with more information on all phobias and anxiety disorders as well as allowing free referrals to specialists in the anxiety department to allow sufficient recovery for those suffering. We deserve to live just as much as any other person, lets get us recognised to make life easier for us.",
