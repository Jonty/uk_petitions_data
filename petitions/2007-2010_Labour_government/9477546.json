            "background": "This scheme has been designed for elderly people over the age of 60. However, it is worth remembering that most elderly people recieve a weekly pension, while students do not. Also, since bus fairs are so expensive, introducing free bus passes for full time students would encourage greater use of public transport, which would reduce the problem of traffic congestion and co2 emissions.",
