This sort of behaviour from a member of the public would not be tolerated so why should MPs get away with it?\n\nThe law applies and binds everyone in the UK, if someone commits benefit fraud or a similar offence they are met with the full extent of the law.  MPs who have abused the trust of the public and misused taxpayers money intentionally should now be held accountable for the offences they will have commited in doing so.",
