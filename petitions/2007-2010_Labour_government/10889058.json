            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines has been refused before in 1997 and 2001. It was not considered to be in the best interests of the consumer.  Since then nothing has changed. The 'Open Skies' agreement has proved to be unsuccessful due to the lack of capacity and prohibitive costs of slots at the major transatlantic airports namely London Heathrow and New York JFK. Economic climate is no excuse either, as it would make it even more difficult for smaller airlines to compete. Such an alliance could have an unfair advantage in is ability to pressure the Airport Operators for unfair advantage over smaller airlines. Faster passenger security clearance, more convenient gates etc. The Alliance would also be dominant on some of the busiest and most profitable transatlantic routes enabling fare fixing which is certainly not in the best interests of the consumer. It could result eventually in forcing smaller airlines out of business. We therefore petition the Prime Minister to put maximum pressure on all relevant bodies to prevent the alliance between British Airways and American Airlines being approved.",
