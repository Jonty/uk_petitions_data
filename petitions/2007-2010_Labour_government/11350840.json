        "background": "Open prisons are not working. They are more like holiday camps than prisons - even the inmates say so. Also, there is no security - the prison service say that they only put people there \"who present no risk to the public, and are unlikely to try and escape\". However, every year hundreds of criminals walk out of open prisons, including convicted rapists and even murderers.",
