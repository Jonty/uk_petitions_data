            "background": "This is a petition with the purpose of suggesting that Eric Clapton be knighted. The basis for this is not only his long career as an entertainer, spanning 5 decades but also his large amount of charity work. \n\nHe has founded the Crossroads Rehabilitation Centre in Antigua- A dedicated centre to helping those with addictions. This has been running for 10 years this year.\n\nOther charities that Mr Clapton has done work for include Amnesty International, Unicef and several relief charities set up after Hurricane Katrina to name but a few.\n\nFor these tireless efforts, and his role in bringing blues to new audiences for 50 years, I vote that Mr Clapton be knighted.",
