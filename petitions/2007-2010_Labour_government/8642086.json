The \u2018performances\u2019 which are the subject of this debate consist of the said gentleman merely singing to himself as he goes about his work \u2013 making sandwiches and serving his customers.\n\nThe essence of this petition is to bring to the attention of the Prime Minister this further example of how modern legislation and bureaucracy has been allowed to prevail over common sense and reasonable judgment.\n\nWe, the undersigned feel strongly that the Prime Minister should intervene and instigate a review of the 2003 Act and begin proceedings to repeal the terms of this ill-thought out legislation.",
