        "background": "I distribute leaflets promoting my company and have been bitten 6 times in 2 years, I have phoned the police to see what can be done and the police just brushed it off saying the dog has every right to bite you!!....I propose though, What if a child put their finger through a letterbox just to look in at the doggy and they had their fingers ripped off by the dog in question??? I know the posties have the same trouble with this also. There should be a law that states if you have a dog you MUST have a cage on the letterbox or an outside post box..If not and your dog bites it gets put to sleep end of subject!!",
