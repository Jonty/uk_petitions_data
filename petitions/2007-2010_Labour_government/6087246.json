        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently displayed effectively in areas of Germany, new lanes would be used far more by the general public, as a bike is so much cheaper than the running of a car, which would appeal particularly to the enormous student population. This could dramatically reduce the number of road accidents caused by young drivers. Road users would not be disturbed by cyclists, as they would be at pavement level, out of their way, but pedestrians would still feel safe. Numbers of people travelling alone in cars, creating congestion, should decline, as they would prefer the quicker, cheaper bike route. In addition, we would all be getting exercise, which would go a short way to decreasing obesity in our ever growing country! Overall, this would potentially reduce the country's vehicle emissions, therefore reducing our contribution to global warming and the devastating world we are progressively creating. We are already seeing effects and the situation becomes worse every year. Action must be taken now.",
