SL does nothing to improve private sector housing and is just a means for local government to raise money with another tax.  In Manchester 3 areas have been granted selective licensing which requires landlords to register at a cost of \u00a3500 per property. This equates to an estimated \u00a310m income for what is basically a paper excercise.. It's a sham.",
