We urge you to support strong emissions reductions, fund adaptation projects for the world's poorest countries, slow deforestation, invest in clean renewable energy, and empower your citizens to address climate change. We can no longer afford to stand idle. In order to avoid dangerous climate change, your government must take concrete action and you must start now.\n\nI call upon you to exercise vision, integrity and determination during these negotiations, and to ensure that the wheels are set in motion for a strong global response to climate change.",
