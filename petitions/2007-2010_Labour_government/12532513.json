This is to help out the over stretched JCP who are undermanned during this economic down turn.  Between January 2008 and September 2008 as part of the Massacre of Civil Service jobs, each week a JCP office was being closed in the UK, now that we are in a recession and unemployment is at 2 million, the Government need JCP staff. \n\nManchester DBC deal with Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA) and are a vital part of the support work that help the most needy and vulnerable in our society.\n\nManchester DBC should stay open and the Government should create the extra staff needed from JCP from people who already need a job and NOT steal staff who help the disabled and pensioners.",
