        "background": "The flat-rate payment given per serviceman currently covers anyone serving in what is called a hazardous operational area, like Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nMany personnel, however, are being denied this tax break due to the nature of their job and the location from which that job is based - in surrounding Gulf States.\n\nThese personnel, from all sections of the Armed Forces, are providing vital support to their colleagues in both Iraq and Afghanistan, doing lengthy and repetitive tours and facing risks just the same, yet they receive less recognition for their part.\n\nThe permanent tax-free operational bonus should therefore be opened up and backdated to all who served tours under the banners of Operation TELIC and Operation HERRICK, and be payable at the same qualifying rate of 10 days separated service in line with the Longer Separation Allowance.",
