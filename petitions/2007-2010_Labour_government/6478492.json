        "background": "Alisher Usmanov is attempting to mount a hostile takeover of Arsenal Football Club with David Dein as a figurehead chairman.\nThere are numerous question marks over Usmanovs character and past. His answer to those accusations is to have a team of lawyers threaten various online blogs and webservers with legal action, for printing those accusations or linking to them. \nHe has not attempted to take the main accuser himself to court, it seems he would prefer to act against freedom of speach.\nNeither he nor David Dein are acting in the best interests of Arsenal FC or football in this country.",
