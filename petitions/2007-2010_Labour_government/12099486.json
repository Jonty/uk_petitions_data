        "background": "For to long the English and Welsh have been deprived from the strong taste sensation of Cheese and onion Taytos and the sugar rush of Club orange.\n\nWhilst our Friends in Scotland and of course Northern Ireland have been able to indulge in these fine products, If Mr Brown who I'm sure has had a bag of two of Taytos himself could ensure a supply was set up, it would not only satisfy the masses in England and Wales but also boost the economy in Armagh and the surrounding areas which grow the potatoes for Taytos and not forgetting the sugar laced drink from south of the border.\nCome on Mr brown you know this will help get us out of the recession.",
