            "background": "There is a current and worrying trend of creating niche crimes. It is common sense that stabbing someone with a sharp object is very bad as is hitting someone with a heavy blunt object.\n\nMore and more specific items are being banned with no real effect.\n\nIf an individual wishes to kill or seriously injure another individual, they will be committing a serious offence by doing so. Why then ban a knife, baseball bat or glass ashtray? The act of wounding or killing someone should be enough.\n\nI have complete sympathy for the families of the victims of crime but banning an inanimate object highlights to me the ineffective way the more serious crimes are being dealt with.\n\nI think full reform is overkill but rather, the police and government should consider if one currently defined crime already covers the situation before introducing yet another crime.\n\nIE: a person is murdered, should the tool used be such a consideration or the motive and cause?\n\nThe trend of throwing enough mud until some sticks is lazy and the myriad of minor laws is getting more and more confusing.",
