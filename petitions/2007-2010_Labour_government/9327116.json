Why not set up the government more like a coalition so they work together to get the best for our country. We have one party criticising another, when the more constructive thing to do would to be advise. Is it really that hard? This isn't labour's country for the conservatives to criticise or vice versa, it's OUR country, and more action rather than talking needs to be done!",
