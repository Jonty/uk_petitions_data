            "background": "With fuel prices and bills increasing, cities imposing congestion charging and government trying to get people out of their cars it is irresponsible to grant a franchise to a transport company who do not actively encourage 9 2 5 commuters to use public transport by giving reasonable prices. They positively discriminate against the working majority by offering cheaper fares after certain hours. The Mayor of London lifted the time ban, as pensioners with free travel are now amongst the 9 2 5 working majority & it was deemed discriminatory not allow free travel at certain times, so why are the working majority still being discriminated against.",
