            "background": "Currently many councils outsource the collection of council debt to bailiff agencies who are employed on a commission basis. As a result, illegal practices within the bailiff industry are reportedly rife. Common reported practices include:\n\nNot making the visits they charge for.\nOvercharging fees.\nAdding illegal fees.\nUsing uncertified bailiffs.\nRefusing payment arrangements.\nRefusing details that the debtor is entitled to obtain.\nMaking false statements.\nUsing bullying tactics on vunerable people.\n\nI have been a victim of the above prctices and despite policies in place that hold the council accountable for the bailiffs practices, it is often hard to prove or the councils do not provide adequate assistance. This leaves the councils in a very vunerable position legally.\n\nIn order to protect both the councils interests and the interests of the debtor concerned, councils should employ in-house bailiffs who work for a salary.",
