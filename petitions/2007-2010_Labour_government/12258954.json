            "background": "Any adult that seeks medical attention for issues relating to smoking, alcohol or obesity, must be made to pay a proportion of their care dependant on the level of their own contributory factors.  For example; if someone smokes now and has smoked for less than 10 years they should be made to pay a higher proportion that a smoker that has smoked for 50 years - because we now have significantly more knowledge that should stop any sane person from taking up the habit.  Alcohol and weight gain should not have any staggered penalties as we have always know that drinking and eating to excess is medically dangerous, just because \"everybody\" does it does not mean everybody should.\n\nThere used to be a saying \"if Johnny jumped off a bridge would you jump off a bridge!\".  We should all be held accountable for our actions and those who are should not be held liable financially for those who are not.\n\nWith a bit of personal responsibility the nation as a whole can be better.",
