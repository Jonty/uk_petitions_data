Instead, this totalitarian act will not only further eradicate our civil liberties but bankrupt the country as well. The government simply cannot afford this scheme in the present climate, Over \u00a35 billion and rising to churn out this white elephant. Jacqui Smith stated on the 7th November this year that she thinks the people 'can't wait for ID cards'! Who is she speaking to?\n\nPlease sign this petition, to keep the pressure on the government to drop this scheme for good.",
