            "background": "The tethering of  horses causes the animals distress, getting caught in chains, often tethered beside busy roads. Horses get injured.  They often do not have access to water.  It is an unnatural environment for them and restricts their movement. No animal should be chained up and have to live a life like that. They cannot shelter out of the wind, rain or snow.  This should have been made illegal when the animal welfare bill came in. Horses should have natural freedom to graze and interact with other horses. Give them their freedom, get them unchained by signing this petition.",
