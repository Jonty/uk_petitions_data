            "background": "Creating additional legislation will be completely ineffective in tackling the tiny minority of dog owners whose animals are a risk.  This will target and be misused as an unnecessary control on the majority.  It will not reduce the number of injuries from dogs which are extraordinarily low given the number of dogs in ownership in the UK.\nThe \"Dog Quango\" that will inevitably follow will be a danger to all dog owners as they will seek to justify their own (unnecessary) existence through ridiculous victimisation of ordinary citizens.",
