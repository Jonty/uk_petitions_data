            "background": "It seems that the current trend of talk a lot and do little has spread through to the renewable energy debacle.\nI ask the Prime Minister to actively make a real change for real people to not only cut their energy costs, but to also promote the use of renewable energy.\nThis could be done by providing the funds necessary to the local councils across the country to install solar panels on the roofs of properties and provide substantial grants for those people that own their own home.\nFor far to long has the general public had to endure the spiralling costs of the energy companies with little or no justification from the energy watchdog.\nMost families and pensioners are struggling to the point where they have to choose between eating or being warm.\nThis is highly immoral, unjust and akin to living in a 3rd world country.\nEven in today's climate we should be able to live comfortably and not have to worry about how to heat our homes.",
