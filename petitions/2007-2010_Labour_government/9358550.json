            "background": "I petition that Joyce and Sybil Burden, the sisters who are 82 and 90 years old, who have been living together for over 30 years, should be exempt of inheritance tax. If they were friends they could have a civil partnership, but as they are sisters, the one who remains after the other dies is going to suffer hugely due to this terrible descion. \n\nIf relatives live together for over a certain length of time they should have the same rights as married couples.",
