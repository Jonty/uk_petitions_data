            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Recently the Halifax had announced its changing the overdraft scheme for its customers.  Under the new plans instead of charging a set APR rate on the overdraft it will charge Customers between \u00a31 and \u00a32 Daily for use of overdrafts they have already agreed with the lender.  \n\nAn example of such is if Person X overdraws into his/her arranged overdraft by just \u00a31 they could be charged \u00a3365 per year for it.    This is simply unfair on all its customers from a Bank we own the majority of during a recession.   \n\nWe the undersigned believe this to be an unfair and ludicrous charging scheme. If allowed to continue this new charging system would make profit to the Halifax at the expense of the hardest working people who at the current time are struggling to survive during the hardest times this Nation has seen.",
