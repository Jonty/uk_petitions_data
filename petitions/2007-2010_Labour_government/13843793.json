        "background": "We do not believe Professor Nutt's recent statement have gone beyond the scientific evidence into these matters, we believe the government's policies on drug classification are not justified on the grounds of scientific research, and we believe if there is any public confusion between scientific advice and policy it is due to this and previous governments' policies rather than the evidence-based research the ACMD has and continues to undertake.\n\nConsequently we ask for Professor Nutt to be reinstated as chairman of the ACMD.",
