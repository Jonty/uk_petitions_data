I myself do not get ema as our income is more that \u00a330,000 however there are 3 under 18's in this household and its difficult to cope with the money. \nIf say a household with one child earns over \u00a330,000 it will be expected for that child to be able to cope with money difficulties as there is only one, however if there are 3 or 4 children in the household, each child in futher education should qualify for ema.",
