            "background": "The West Lothian Question represents a  constitutional crisis brought about by the devolution of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland's paliamentary processes; in which regional issues are voted upon and decided by representatives of only one particular region. eg. issues affecting Welsh constituents would normally only be decided upon within the Welsh Assembly.
