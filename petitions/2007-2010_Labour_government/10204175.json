        "background": "I, no doubt like many others have just found myself in the position of missing an NHS appointment because when they issued the appointment to replace the appointment they had cancelled, they didn't state that the new appointment would be at an entirely different hospital some 40 or so miles away from my house.\nI propose that the NHS should be forced to use clear english, and if the venue for an appointment is moved they should CLEARLY state so when issuing such letters. as it stands now, it's my fault that i haven't attended the correct hospital, even though they didn't clearly state the appointment had moved. This will not only cause problems for folk such as myself on a low income, but will undoubtably be used to sway the NHS statistics that the government uses to claim it's doing such a good job.",
