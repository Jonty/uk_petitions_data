            "background": "We live adjacent to a Public House and are sick and tired of the behaviour of the patrons sitting at the rear of our property.Swearing and shouting in particular.Especially when we have 2 children who play in our rear garden.We have contacted the Police several times during the day and late at night and been told that complaints have to be dealt with by the Environmental Health Department as it is not a Policing matter.Has anyone tried to contact an Environmental Health Officer at 11.00pm or on a weekend? when the local Council offices are obviously closed.And if you do manage to get any response from the Environmental Health Department you usually get the same old response of \"We have had a word with the manager and he is going to keep his eye on things\"which usually amounts to nothing being done at all.Bring back the good old days when any unlawful behaviour was dealt with by the Police who would make sure that the problem was resolved straight away and who are conveniently available out of the normal Council Office hours.",
