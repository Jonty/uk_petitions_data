            "background": "Wimbledon Football Club had a proud history (and some cracking mullets in the 80's), until it was sickeningly stolen and deposited in a shanty town which at best resembles a giant garden centre. This ridiculous charade is deflating the reputation of British sport, as though it was an actual football itself!\n\nMilton Keynes Dons must therefore be handed back to the people of Merton, and renamed back to Wimbledon. We would also like to see a re-release of the song 'Three Lions', with the much relevant words of 'Football's Coming Home', to mark the transfer.",
