            "background": "PMQs is fast becoming a complete waste of time and money. its just a points scoring exercise for all parties. no legitimate questions are put and when there is a reasonably intelligent question asked, it isn't answered, its deflected so that the PM can get points across that he wishes to make. its become a party political broadcast on behalf of the government.it has become a nonsense. it is a brainwashing exercise. its no wonder that the reasonably intelligent youths are so lacking in interest in politics when they see this charade each week. lets have real questions with real, honest answers. then the voting public can get a real idea of who they think is right and who they want to govern this country . politicians are seen as rotten to the core by most people. when they watch or listen to this debacle each week, its no wonder they cannot be bothered to engage with those who run the country. PMQs is an opportunity, for all politicians, to let the people see and hear answers to the important questions of the day. lets make it real.  please.",
