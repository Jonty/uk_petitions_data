            "background": "I would like the government to produce an advert similar to the one currently shown on TV aimed at benefit cheats but aim it at the millionaire and billionaire corporate sector informing them of the consequences of using offshore tax havens to avoid and evade tax and tell them they are being watched and will be caught. The advert should also portray the message that their actions are morally reprehensible and unwelcome in decent society.",
