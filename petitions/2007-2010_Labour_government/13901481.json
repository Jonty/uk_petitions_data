Fenland District Council, the designated leisure provider, appears to have no interest or desire in providing similar facilities in its other Market Town, Chatteris. The residents of Chatteris contribute towards the running costs of the other Fenland leisure centres, a situation which we believe is unfair and iniquitous.",
