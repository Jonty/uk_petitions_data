            "background": "The Euston Arch was demolished in 1962 when Euston Station was redeveloped.  This was an appalling example of the lack of respect given to Victorian Engineering and the proposed redevelopment of Euston now gives us the opportunity to rebuild the arch.  Around 60% of the arch still exists and could be reused in the rebuilding.  The new arch will provide a fantastic gateway to the new Euston, and revitalise the local area.  The redevelopment of St Pancras station has already shown how a world class station can combine the old and new. Euston can do the same. The Euston Arch would be a wonderful gateway to the new Euston.",
