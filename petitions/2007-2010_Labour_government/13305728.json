        "action": "apply civil partnership status to all unions, heterosexual, homosexual or asexual, and remove any recognition by the state of \"marriage\" as being something other than civil partnerships.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently the state allows civil marriages to heterosexual couples, but does not allow them to homosexual couples. The only conceivable reasoning for this must stem from the idea that marriage is a religious institution and certain religious ideals do not allow homosexual unions. If it is a religious institution, then for the state must either deny recognition to secular marriages and those based in all but one faith (assuming the state has a specified religion), or introduce a separate concept for the state to recognise. This would be \"civil partnerships\" for all couples, not just those not eligible for marriage under the current system.\n\nThis would remove the objections of religious bodies to equal status for homosexual unions, and create a clear difference between the current civil meaning of marriage and the significances to individuals and religious organisations. It would be the only way to allow equality for homosexual unions in the eyes of the state, without upsetting religious organisations.",
