            "background": "Big schools are rarely able to be managed effectively,  and so creating positive ethos, community spirit and a suitable learning/development environment for young adults, is virtually impossible.  Sheer numbers and sizes of buildings mean a great deal of time is wasted - for example - the movement between lessons.  Discipline is more difficult as many teachers and pupils remain unknown throughout the school.  A pupil can burst into a classroom or swearing at teachers in corridors etc without being accurately identifiable.  We can effectively tailor learning to individuals when those individuals are known throughout the school and recognised as a person rather than someone in 2nd yr!\nSMT have more chance of supporting staff in a smaller school where again the sense of team spirit and someone taking the time to \"know\" you makes all the difference.  I have worked in several schools of varying sizes and have children of my own. All feedback I get from parents, teachers, pupils, etc indicates that large schools simply do NOT work.",
