            "background": "There seems to be a large minority signing a petition on this site to repeal the 2004 hunting act, this should never happen, what makes people think it is alright to kill innocent animals in the name of sport, especially in such a barbaric way, the hunting fraternity keep bleating on about how they have to control foxes, this is pure rubbish, more foxes are killed on the road each day than are killed by the hunt in a year, foxes will always control their own numbers in this way, whats the difference between hunters hunting foxes and dog fighting in a cellar, absolutely  nothing. there are many types of horse mounted sport hunt fans can change to including polo and jumping for example, we live in an era when killing is far to rife whether it be animal or human it is about time we stopped it all and started behaving like real humans.",
