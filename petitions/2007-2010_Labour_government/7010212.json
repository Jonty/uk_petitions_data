            "background": "We run a small commercial garage on the Isle of Skye and are having tremendous problems finding HGV mechanics to join our business. VOSA rightly demand very high standards for HGV testing, which we have to work to, but we just can't get people with the appropriate skills and attitude to do the job. We already have two apprentices working for us and can't afford another one as time off for attending college is difficult to manage as it is. We tried to hire a mechanic from Romania but were unsuccessful, as the Borders and Immigration agency didn't consider an HGV mechanics job to be sufficiently skilled to warrant a work permit?\nSo on the one hand VOSA demand high standards but on the other hand B.I.A. say the job isn't skilled? \nThis discrepancy between what is required by one department and what's allowed by another is sheer loonacy.\n(We are not looking for cheap labour from abroad, but surely if people from overseas have the skills needed  why is this avenue blocked ?).\nSmall  businesses employ 52% of people in this country and it's high time they were given the help they so richly deserve.",
