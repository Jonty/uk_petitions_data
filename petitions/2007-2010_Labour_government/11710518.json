Not content with just forcing the views of David Pleat onto an unwitting public, ITV are now intent on destroying the FA Cup, the most important trophy of our national game. The fact that ITV decided to go to an advert break DURING the Everton vs Liverpool replay causing the millions of people watching to miss the winning goal shows their utter lack of respect for the beautiful game. We can not stand by and let ITV ruin football through incompetence and malice.",
