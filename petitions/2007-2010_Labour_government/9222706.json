            "background": "In a modern era of MultiLateralism it is important to create a modern Quango for the foreign Minister. \nIts purpose is to provide Geo regional political,social and economic assessments of every region in the world today. \nThis Quango shall be authoritative in its remit and compliment the foreign policy of the Government of the day. I call it the modernisation of the Foreign Office. \nFurthermore in the context of progressive multilateralism through the United Nations and the considerations of re structuring development aid budgets as well as Humanitarian missions, it is only appropriate that we have a modern quango to compliment and advise the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister of the day. \nI think this new approach to multilateralism is the best manner forward.\nThis quango shall be a compliment to the structure of modern governance as too the business of Parliament. This quango shall be independent and autonomous and shall state facts as they are. It is a refreshing approach because information presented to Parliament.\nI think this is what Parliament and this nation state needs today as well as to the progressiveness of multilateralism.",
