This extortionate rate of tax is said to be a \"green\" tax, placed on the British public to reduce the usage of our cars, therefore reduceing CO2 emmisions. However this is not the case, the government give us no viable alternative to using our vehicles. Public transport outside of London is poor in service and expensive in cost, often more expensive than using your car. So how can this possibly be creating a greener country?",
