            "background": "Why have Local Councils become so involved in areas which can be best served by Charities and other interested bodies.  Councils were created to look after basic needs such as drains, sewers, bin clearing, street lighting, schools. They are there to look after children who have no one else - they should not be looking after every child in the country. They interfere in all areas of life and the Outreach programmes and the like are expanding exponenially with no apparent limit.  The result is we are paying huge amounts of Council Tax which is not needed in a sensible world. No one votes for all this interference except the people who benefit from it.  We could probably cut rates by 50% if organised properly.I would like to see this whole area subjected to a lot more scrutiny by opposition parties.",
