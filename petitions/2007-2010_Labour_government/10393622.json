This is especially the case, given that at the time of ratification a court hearing over the treaty was still in progress, and that following the Irish vote against the Treaty there was no need for haste in this matter.  Even many who are in favour of the EU Treaty have expressed their wish that they be consulted via the promised referendum so that they may voice that opinion.",
