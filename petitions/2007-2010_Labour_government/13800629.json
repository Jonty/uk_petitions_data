        "background": "Luton Borough Council has recently approved plans (without proper public consultation) to build a new Olympic Swimming Pool/Sports conmplex on Stopsley Common in Luton. They are also planning to build a road bypass through the Common in the near future.\n\nThis will adversley affect the landscape, residents, farmers and the local ecosystem. It would also mean less playing fields available for events such as Football and Rugby tournaments, which seems extremely counter-productive when considering the purpose of the new complex.\n\nThere are much more suitable sites for such a complex to be built in Luton, such as the brown site land, Power Court. \n\nThis would provide links to the M1, Luton Station, Luton Airport Parkway station and Luton Airport itself, which many feel would be much more suitable for hosting the Olympic events.\n\nWith regards to the bypass, there is no real need for such a thing to be built, and many feel money would be better spent on improving the existing road infrastructure elsewhere in the town rather than building a new road.",
