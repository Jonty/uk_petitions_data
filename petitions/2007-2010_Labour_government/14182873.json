            "background": "We are now in the 21st century, but are still running the country based on a political system that is out of date.  The current system has many flaws:\n\nOur political parties behave like bankers aiming for their next bonus, sacrificing a long term strategy that is good for the country for whatever will win the next election.\n\nThe Prime Minister picks a cabinet of people who are generally unqualified to do the jobs they are given.  When things go bad, the cabinet gets reshuffled and more unqualified people are put in their place.  It wouldn\u2019t work in the commercial world, so why do we accept it for the running of our country.\n\nWe need a new system.  People should be in jobs that they are qualified for and have experience in.  They should be interviewed publically and the public should choose the best person for the job.  We have the technology to make this happen.  We don\u2019t want a cabinet made up of the PMs mates.\n \nSo, if you think we need to stop having career politicians and start having an intelligent, qualified and experienced bunch of people running the country, then please sign this petition.\n\nThis is just the basis of an idea.  Please feel free to add to it.",
