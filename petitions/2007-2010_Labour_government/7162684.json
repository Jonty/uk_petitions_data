            "background": "While accepting the short comings of the police during the ill-fated incident at Stockwell and whilst, I commiserate with the families of Charles De Menezes. I am of the opinion that Sir Ian Blair should be left alone to do his job. Under the CIRCUMSTANCES the police were acting in the interest of the public. It was a difficult situation. Mistakes were made. I disagree with the way the public,politicians and most particularly the PRESS (indirectly) are clamouring for Sir Ian\u2019s resignation. I believe, we, as human beings are allowed to make mistakes; Sir Ian has made a few, but in very difficult circumstances.  Can you remember the incident where two suspiciously looking Asian men were thrown off the plane? Now let\u2019s imagine that the \u201cmembers of the public\u201d were police officers. That means two innocent men might have lost there lives on that day, RIGHT. Well, let\u2019s look inwards and give the man a chance. The UK has one of the best forces in the world (even though I\u2019m not their biggest fan), but on this occasion I believe I\u2019m standing on the right side.\nUK, don\u2019t always show that you like to bring people down. Let\u2019s lift people up for a change.\nGIVE SIR IAN BLAIR A CHANCE.",
