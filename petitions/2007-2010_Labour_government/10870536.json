Surley wether you kill somebody when driving when your drunk is a matter of luck. \n\nThis change would mean if someone got a fine for driving drunk killing no one someone who kills someone (and for all we know could be driving safer) gets the same.\n\nThe British goverment need to make this more fair and have it in their power to, as killing someone is a matter of luck.\n\nThankyou",
