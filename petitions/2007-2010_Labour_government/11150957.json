        "background": "Most universities run courses in geology.  Many run courses in certain fields of geology such as minerology.  However, there are no courses simply studying volcanology.  The only way a budding volcanologist can enter the field is by taking another geological course, which has, at most, a few modules of volcanology.  That means that possibly two years of a three year course is wasted.\nVolcanology is a massively important science.  Volcanoes are a natural hazard and by training volcanologists, we can help to predict eruptions and save many lives.\nWhile volcanoes are not a threat to the UK, many parts of the world live in fear of names like Krakatoa, Kilimanjaro, Eldfell, St Helens, Etna, Vesuvius, Yellowstone or Fuji just to name a few.  Volcano eruptions can also cause tsunamis of scale similar to that on boxing day just a few years ago.  With the supervolcano at yellowstone becoming more active (the extinction of the dinosaurs coincided with the last eruption of a supervolcano), it is imperitive that we understand them.",
