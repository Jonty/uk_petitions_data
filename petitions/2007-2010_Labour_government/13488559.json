            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I propose the removal VAT on equipment such as Solar Panels (Photo voltaic, etc..) and small wind turbine generators and their associated power conversion equipment.  The price would make the equipment more attractive to the mass market.  The reduction in cost would make the return on investment far quicker too.  Currently there are grants available, but these, I feel are restrictive and complicated - this would simplify the process and make a wider range of products (and services) available.",
