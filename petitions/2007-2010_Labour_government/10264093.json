This collection has been closed for two years and needs re-opening to public access, educational and scholarly use \u2013 not broken up or put into storage as is curently being proposed. The Type Museum\u2019s  collections need exhibiting, curatorial & conservation development and educational workshops - not storage. This legacy is vital for the quality of education of future generations of communicators in which Britain has frequently led the world.\nWe appeal for resources to restore and safeguard educational access to these collections.",
