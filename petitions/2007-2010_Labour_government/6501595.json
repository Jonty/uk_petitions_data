            "background": "Do you know that cancer patients have to pay for their prescriptions unless they are diagnosed as being terminally ill. Many cancer patients, like myself, have to stay on medication for a long time and it is wrong that we have to pay when other less needy people, i.e. drug addicts get their methadone etc free. As a cancer patient you are more prone to infections and frequently need extra medication that all has to be paid for.\nI want a million people to sign this petition, please help.",
