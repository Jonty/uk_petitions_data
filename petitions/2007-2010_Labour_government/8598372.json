            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "An idea has been put, suggesting that smokers should have to apply for permits in order to purchase cigarettes for their own personal use. This will cost smokers \u00a310 a year and involve filling in a complex form.\nThis idea takes away peoples right to smoke if they wish and give control to government or who ever to decide if that person can have a permit to purchase their cigarette's.  \nIf smokers should have to have a permit to smoke, then people who drink alcohol should also. They cause more problems than any smoker due to being drunk and disorderly etc.Alcoholics also cost the NHS a lot of money every year due to Liver damage. It could then be said that you need a permit to do almost anything, should the powers that be decide that is the case.\nIs this not a free country? It has started to feel otherwise.",
