        "background": "launch a public enquiry into Greyhound Welfare, and firmly reject the recommendations made in Lord Donoughues report on the greyhound industry. \n\nThe report states the Track Owners and Bookmakers \"Commercial Profit\" should take higher priority than the \u201cGreyhounds Welfare\u201c this view is simply not acceptable to the majority of the stakeholders in the industry or the wider general public. \n\nThe report also describes the possible fraudulent use of sports funds by the Track Owners through the Grants System which sees the current governing body in effect allocating itself huge sums of the sports money to further increase the asset value of their own business models without any checking or verification of exactly how all the money is spent. \n\nThe report does little to alleviate the suffering of the greyhound, and only serves to further support the commercial interests of Track Owners and Bookmakers, and further enhance their continued domination of greyhound racing in pursuit of obscene profits. \n\nThis review was requested by a Lord who was employed by the Track Owners, and undertaken by a Lord with a small group with strong bookmakers connections\u2026..hardly independent.",
