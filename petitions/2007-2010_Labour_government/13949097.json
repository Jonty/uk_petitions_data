Let the government know that we the angler in our millions, wish the government to look at protecting a sport that has been part of our heritage for centuries. Not only is it our heritage, but it is possibly the only sport that pays and helps protect the environment in which is done with the purchase of an environment agency fishing licence. Also it is only one of a few sports that can be enjoyed any person regardless of age, race, wealth and to a large extent disability. Written by J. Greenwell. Re typed by Matthew. Haythornthwaite",
