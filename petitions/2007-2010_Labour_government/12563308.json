            "background": "With many new GCE examinations coming in this year (2009), many new exam boards are turning to more difficult methods to test candidates. While it is important to test students, when exams are too difficult, it places them under a great deal of stress, and knocks their confidence within their abilities. For example, the AQA history examination expects students to be able to detail twelve points, while using a high standard of english, including evidence, and introducing different interpretations, all in around fifteen minutes. In a high taxing subject, such as History, where there is a huge amount of information must be detailed, this is far too much pressure on the students. As such, we request the Prime Minister to review the examination techniques, to help students feel at ease, and improve his popularity with potential voters",
