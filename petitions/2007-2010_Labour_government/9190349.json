            "background": "I believe that the National Anthem at the moment is boring and uninspiring. When people sing it there is no enthusiasm in their voices.\n We need to change it to a classic English song that everyone loves. This will show the world that England is the most innovative country and we can change where it is needed. I believe it is needed here.\n\nThe National Anthem needs to be changed and we can do it by choosing one of these:\n\n- Wonderwall (Oasis)\n\n- Jerusalem (composed by Charles Hubert Hastings Parry)\n\n- Yellow (Coldplay) \n\n- Song 2 (Blur - prehaps a bit too loud)\n\nThese songs are only suggestions. Even if you don't like the songs suggested, you can still sign the petition. As long as you believe there is change needed in the national anthem - then sign please.",
