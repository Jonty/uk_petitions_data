            "background": "For too long the people of Frodsham and Helsby have had to put up with increasing noise from the M56.  Last year the government published noise maps for selected parts of the country which included the M56.  However there does not appear to be the commitment, at least at this stage, to commit to action.  The noise mapping exercise was centred on major roads, airports, railway lines etc.\n \nCheshire West & Chester Council (CW&C) must start to pressure the Highways Agency / Dept of Transport for action.   A combination of changes in road surface and installation of some sort of accoustic boundary could make a real difference.",
