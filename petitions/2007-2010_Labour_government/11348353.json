        "background": "Manual Scavenging is an occupation undertaken by Dalits, who, despite the outlawing of the practice of \u2018untouchability\u2019, continue to face discrimination and violence in every aspect of their lives because of their caste status. \n\nIt is estimated that around 1.3 million Dalits in India, mostly women, are forced to make their living through manual scavenging - a term used to describe the job of removing human excrement from dry toilets and sewers using basic tools such as thin boards, buckets and baskets, lined with sacking, carried on the head. \n\nWe call for the UK government to express its concern to the Government of India on this issue, and on the lack of progress despite legislation intended to eradicate this practice.\n\nFurther we call for the UK government\u2019s Department for International Development to use its programmes and funding in India  to actively  support the implementation of eradication and rehabilitation programmes to end this human rights violation.\n\nSuccessful rehabilitation must include access to education, health care and alternative forms of employment.",
