            "background": "The M.O.D. is to release a \u00a3 multi-million advertising campaign to educate soldiers on the dangers of reckless driving, following a number of fatal *car* accidents  involving soldiers. The advertising campaign features a soldier riding a *motorcycle* who loses control with fatal consecquences. Our belief is that this promotes a misleading image of motorcyclists, presenting them as reckless and dangerous drivers. We therefore ask the M.O.D to revise its campaign in the interest of fairness.",
