Instead, Terry Wogan is completely qualified for the Very Important Post of President of the Very Important European Council. He's done Eurovision, and he sang 'The Floral Dance'. When he bought up every copy and sent it to the Afghan war, it caused a fifth of the Taliban to surrender immediately. He alone should be our President!",
