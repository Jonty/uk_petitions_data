It is a crime to incite hatred and these people are vitriolic, they can't share enough of their hatred of Mrs.Thatcher.  There are laws that stop racial hatred, hatred based on sexual orientation etc etc and this old lady in the twilight of her years is helpless against these bitter people.  The play should be stopped it is pure malice.",
