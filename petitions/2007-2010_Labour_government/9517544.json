            "background": "It has recently been considered acceptable for the creation of 'saviour siblings' - a baby brother or sister from which umbilical cord blood and DNA is taken at birth in the hope it may be beneficial in the treatment of the older sibling.\n\nCreating 'saviour siblings' is taking science too far - how is it ever ethically justifiable to create a human life not through want but through a considered necessity? How will the child feel growing up knowing it was only given the ultimate gift of life purely to save another and not because its parents actually wanted the child in its own right? This is an amendment that must be revoked and it must never be allowed for the proposed scenario of humans being created for no other reason than for the medical benefit of others. We do not have the right to play with nature to this extent and must realise that we are not a 'super-species'.\n\nWe already cause enough destruction to the world and its existing species without trying to make ourselves even more immortal.",
