            "background": "There are robust laws in place to ensure highways agencies, railway bodies and local authorities keep public places and roadside and railway verges clean but wherever one looks, particularly in the South East of England there is litter everywhere. Too many people drop it and not enough people pick it up. The PM should ensure that litter is banished from the face of this country once and for all particularly as the UK will be hosting the Olympics in 2012 and the world will see what a dump Britain has become if nothing is done. Let us see more fines both for the individuals who drop litter and for the authorities that don't pick it up.",
