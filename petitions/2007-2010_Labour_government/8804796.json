            "background": "The government recently stated they will will 'not leave the [England & Wales Cricket Board] in the lurch' over the Zimbabwe cricket tour but by taking a passive role they are doing just this.\n\nThe Australian government refused to allow their cricket team to tour Zimbabwe on moral grounds. The sports governing body decided not to impose sanctions on the Australian Cricket Board because this was a government decision outside the board's hands, they stated that they would still impose sanctions for non-government imposed bans.\n\nThe government MUST act to avoid the ECB being sanctioned and having to pay the Mugabe regime compensation.\n\nThis need not open the floodgates to banning all Zimbabwe sportsmen. The Zimbabwe Cricket situation is distinct because the Zimbabwean Board is run by and directly linked to the Mugabe government. This is not case with other sports or individual athletes. \n\nThe government needs to act now or they will be forcing the ECB to pay the Zimbabwe government over \u00a3200,000.",
