            "background": "While piracy is a real problem that needs stopping, it should not be up to tax payers to front the money to stop it. The money should be sought from the industry that piracy is affecting. I'm asking the priminister to stop this happening, and to ensure that tax payers money is not used for anything which will not directly benefit the tax payer. I dont think the goverment should be allowed to gamble with tax payers money in the banking system, and by using tax payers money in anti piracy campains the goverment is gabling tax payers money.",
