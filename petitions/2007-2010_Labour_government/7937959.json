            "background": "Applying full fees to part-time Pharmacists (including those on maternity leave, retired pharmacists)and increasing it by nearly 40% in one year.  Pharmacists are leaving the society due to this therefore registered pharmacists will have to cover lost revenue in the future, therefore more will leave .........\nThe old system of a reduced rate for part-time pharmacists is a fairer system and increases not above inflation would be more acceptable.\nIf pharmacists don't/can't pay and get struck off - who will be able to dispense prescription drugs ??",
