A Secretary of State is literally a Minister acting on behalf of all the people of the UK state \u2013 as in the case of the Foreign Secretary (official title being \u2018'Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'). \n\nSo how can devolved Ministries such as Health, Education, Transport and Culture, honestly be described as having Secretary of State responsibilities when those responsibilities apply to England and England alone?\n\nWe think this needs to be rectified \u2013 and that under the terms of the Government\u2019s contract of trust with the people, Ministers of devolved Ministries are currently misleading the public who elect them on both the scope and the magnitude of their positions by continuing to use the term \u2018Secretary of State\u2019. We therefore think the amended job title for Ministers of devolved responsibilities would more truthfully reflect their area of relevance \u2013 for example, \u2018Secretary for Health in England\u2019. \n\nNote: If the job responsibility for a particular Minister also includes Wales then \u2018and Wales\u2019 can simply be inserted after \u2018England\u2019",
