            "background": "I was made redundant in July 09 due to employer going into administration. I now find that the system is designed to penalise couples who live together where one member of the couple works between 24 and 30 hours a week if the other person is unemployed.  Since my wife only works 27.5 hours a week and is due to give birth in 2 weeks this means we are penalised in both directions for a whole host of benefits which means that our child will be disadvantaged at birth thanks to this. It's high time that these 2 hourly limits were harmonised as currently the 6 hour discrepancy is costing people very dearly.  The alternative for couples in our situation is to seperate, leading to more children being raised in broken homes.",
