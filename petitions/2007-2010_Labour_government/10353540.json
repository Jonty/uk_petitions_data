            "background": "Today many people in The UK are commiting acts of robbery against HM Inland Revenue due to the moral and legal ambiguity of the escorting industry. \n\nWhile few legitimate agencies actually do just sell human company for social reasons, the nation suffer because these companies capitalise on peoples selfish paranoia of committing a social taboo of being seen single at a business or social function.\n\nThe nation pay in the form of hundreds - upon - thousands of  \u2018 agencies \u2019 and individuals prostituting and human trafficking themselves and others across the country and even abroad all in the name of \n\u2018escorting\u2019 and selling \u2018non sexual liaisons\u2019 to paying \u2018clients\u2019. \n\nWe have strict laws against human trafficking and prostitution and this industry is used 95% of the time to cheat this law. In effect: The Government is being robbed, the people are being exploited and prostitution is rife.\n\nWe the signed petitioners urge the Prime Minister to outlaw any form of paying for human companionship so as to safe guard public health and morals and deliver a paralyzing blow to organised crime.\n\n*Petition created and submitted in memory of our beloved dog Sam 1993-2008",
