            "background": "The arguement against this is that, allowing patients to pay for extra treatment would lead to a two tier system.  This is as rediculous as making pupils leave state schools if they take extra paid-for tuition or even buying a PC or encyclopaedia. Such patients are not asking for any preferential treatment nor anything more from the NHS than that to which they would otherwise be entitled.",
