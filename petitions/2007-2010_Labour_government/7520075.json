It is no longer the appropriate model for a world where most jobs require educated men and women\" [Tony Blair, June 1996]\n\nGrammar schools provide an anarchronistic system of education which does not raise standards overall. \n\nStandards have risen, not fallen, since comprehensive education was introduced.\n\nThe 'escape from poverty' defence of selection has been greatly over-stated.\n\nAdditional provision of selective education threatens equal and inclusive advancement...an aim for any civilised society.",
