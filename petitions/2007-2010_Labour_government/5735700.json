            "background": "England has been removed from the EU map, we have Regional Assemblies instead.We want to remain England! The other three countries in the Union have retained their identity, we the English have to be British.Oviously the Scots Blair, Brown and all the other Scottish ministers in Parliament, plus Menzies Campbell the Liberal Leader, a Scot, and the Conservative Leader, of Scottish parents, have a pact, they have beaten the old enemy. Ther have done this by stealth.How will the above go down in history, as those who destroyed England!Somewhat different from those English names on our War Memorials.I think you get rid of England and ST.George at your peril.Restore England to the map,and allow we English to call ourselves, as we used to British/English, the Scots British/Scottish etc.We want to be known as ENGLISH!!",
