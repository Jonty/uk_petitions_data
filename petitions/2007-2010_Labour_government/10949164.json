THE INDIAN ELITE HAVE PLENTY OF CASH AND IGNORE THE UNTOUCHABLES STILL. IT IS A CRYING SHAME FOR BRITAIN TO BE GIVING FINANCIAL AID INSTEAD OF HELPING ITS OWN POPULATION PULL OUT OF A RECESSION. THIS MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT ON AUGMENTING THE PENSIONS OF OLD AGE PEOPLE WHO NOW LIVE WITH WORRIES ABOUT HEATING THEIR HOMES AND HOW TO KEEP FROM STARVING THEMSELVES. CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME!",
