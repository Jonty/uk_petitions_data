Many responsible dog owners are being penalised from enjoying the UK beaches with our dogs because of a minority of people who allow their dogs to foul them. Responsible dog owners control their animals and clean up after them. Dog faeces is easier to clean up from sand than many other areas. Should we ban children from beaches?  After all many parents leave rubbish including dirty nappies?",
