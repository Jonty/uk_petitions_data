            "background": "French president Nicolas Sarkozy has recently ordered a two per cent limit on an increase in electricity prices and five per cent for gas.\n\nThe ability to limit these rises imposed by greedy corporations should be made part of British Law.\n\nWe are talking about the old dying and those on low incomes choosing whether to eat or keep themselves warm.\n\nGas and Electric are necessities and should be affordable to everyone.\n\nPublic money should not be used to offer one off payments to help the most needy. It is the corporations themselves that should be made accountable, let them make less profit instead of making the people of this country struggle to pay their rip off prices.\n\nEnough is Enough!!!\n\nPlease sign this petition.",
