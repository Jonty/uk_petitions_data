        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Taxing someone's cash and giving it to someone who didn't earn it, e.g. the LCR, is immoral. Corporations should not be subsidised - why subsidise something that is unprofitable? There is irrefutable proof that even after all these subsidies, and travel time reduced, passengers STILL choose planes, not trains. That the Eurotunnel Group still cannot muster any profits is their fault, not the taxpayers' guilt. Such generous subsidies are the reason for why Britain's debt is now 44% of GDP - 500 bn GBP.",
