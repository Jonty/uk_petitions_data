            "background": "This is in response to a petition asking for benefits to be restricted; and for the tax allowance to be raised to \u00a315,000/top rate 20%.  How would ALL services (including education and the N.H.S.; not just benefits) be funded if these tax proposals were put into effect?  I realise no one likes paying taxes but taxation, graduated according to income, is the least unfair way to fund government expenditure (I won't say it's the fairest way; how can it be when the top rate - even for people paid hundreds of thousands PER WEEK! - is only 40%).\n\nAs far as restricting benefits is concerned I would make the point (as I have in at least one previous petition) that NO ONE can say he/she will NEVER need to claim benefits.  There could be all sorts of reasons for an individual to need them; for any length of time.  How is anyone to exist if they can't get a job, or are too ill/disabled to work, and their benefits are stopped because it is considered that they have claimed them for too long?  (How long is \"too long\" anyway?)",
