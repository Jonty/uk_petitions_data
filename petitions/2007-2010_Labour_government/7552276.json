            "background": "Bangura was trafficked from Sierra Leone at the age of 15 and upon arrival in the United Kingdom was subject to a sexual attack, before seeking refuge as an unaccompanied minor.\n\nSince that time Bangura has worked hard to build a social and domestic life, create a stable environment for his family and contribute hugely to society through not only his football, but also his voluntary community work.\n\nBangura fears a return to his homeland, where personal circumstances dictate his life may be under threat from the Soko tribe, whom his late father was once head of.\n\nBangura knows of no immediate family in Sierra Leone and would be forced to leave behind his girlfriend and nine-day old son Samal.",
