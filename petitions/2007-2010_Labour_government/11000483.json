However, there are signs that various groups are using the Ross/Brand row to push their own agendas in relation to BBC programming (e.g. the Conservative party and their statements about comments made on Mock the Week). It is very important that these attempts are resisted and the BBC continues to take risks and make edgy and innovative programming.",
