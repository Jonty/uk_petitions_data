            "background": "At present the employment act comes into effect after 12 months spent in employment with the same company/same employer. This petition is to reduce the amount of time spent in employment to 6 months to lower the amount of discrimination by employers against reasonably long termed employees.\n\nMy employment was recently terminated after I'd been at the company for 10 and a half months. As I was not employed for the full 12 months I was unable to appeal the decision, or the way I was treated within the company.\n\nI feel this is wrong and gives employers an opportunity to discriminate against hard-working people, terminating their employment with little reason or no notice. Reducing the time spent in employment to 6 months gives a reasonable duration for which the employer can decide whether or not it is suitable to keep that person in employment, before they are given the right to appeal any decisions or summon an Employment Tribunal.",
