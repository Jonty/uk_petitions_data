            "background": "Learner driver training should be increased to the standard required for motorcycles or better and improve rural road infrastructure to reduce deaths on the roads. The current proposal is a fast fix and will be seen to be doing something rather than helping new drivers to drive safely and progressively on the road. It will also allow government and local agencies to install even more speed cameras to levy speed fines whilst criminalising the driver. This is another proposal by the civil service and politicians who spend most of their time in an area where the average speed rarely gets above 11mph and who have an excellent public transport system. Considering the governments own figures that a low percentage of accidents are directly attributable to speed and down to other factors then why this reduction?  Accidents are down to poor skills, awareness, over confidence, fatigue and bad judgement. For those in rural areas this is an impingement on travel as it  already takes a long time to complete a journey and will further the time taken, this will increase the fatigue caused and could lead to accidents. Better training and better roads is the answer.",
