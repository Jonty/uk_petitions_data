            "background": "As a previous part-time worker, now solely on Jobseekers Allowance, I found it annoying to declare my earnings to the DWP, only to have them take everything barring \u00a35 per week off me.  This gives people no incentive to look for work, since they know they are only going to be \u00a310 a week better off if they do the right thing and declare their income.\n\nI petition the Prime Minister to seek a change to the rules of part-time work and JSA to allow claimants to keep more of their earnings, so they get the taste for having an income of their own without losing their safety net.",
