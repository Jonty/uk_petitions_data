            "background": "Anti-terror legislation was introduced in order to provide the powers nessecary for the prevention of terrorism. However, due to a lack of statutory limitation on it's scope, it is regularly mis-applied to situations not involving either terror or a terrorist threat.\n\nSituations where people are detained or assets frozen unter anti-terror laws in circumstances unrelated to terrorism are unjust, especially so in consideration of the fact that the laws were introduced only in light of a significant \"terrorist threat\". Yet in spite of government assurances that anti-terror laws would not be applied in situations unrelated to acts (or potential acts) of terrorism, they continue to be so mis-applied and abused.\n\nWe petition the government to ensure that anti-terror powers are regulated by statute in such a way as to ensure their application only to situations involved in the prevention of, or the protection from, terrorism.",
