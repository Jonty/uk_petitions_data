            "background": "David Carter was working as a security guard at Tesco, Seacroft, Leeds in August 2009. One night a drunken yob kept trying to get into the store whilst shouting racist abuse at David who refused to let him in as he was too intoxicated. To cut a long story short, the yob threatened to stab David whilst calling him a ni**er. David punched him once to remove the threat. On Friday 12th March 2010, David was SENTENCED TO 9 MONTHS IN PRISON. This in spite of having a 14yr old son, a wife (who only works part-time) a mortgage & other financial commitments with no way to pay them once the main breadwinner was taken away.Despite ringing the police FIVE times straight after the incident NO police came. Despite there being witnesses to the drunk mans behaviour and threats NO police ever interviewed them. Full details can be found on the P.A.Y (people against yobs) group on Facebook",
