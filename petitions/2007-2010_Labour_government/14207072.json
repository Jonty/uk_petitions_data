            "background": "HMS ROEBUCK is one of the Armed Forces units currently being considered for scrapping in order to fund the war in Afghanistan. Removing ROEBUCK from service would remove the Royal Navy's only Coastal Survey Vessel and the only unit truely capable of carrying out Rapid Environmental Assesments - a capability vital to Amphibious Operations. The desicion to scrap her is based entirely on finanicial considerations, and not the tactical implications. Far from scrapping ROEBUCK, money should be being spent now to extend her life beyond the previous 2013 end-date.",
