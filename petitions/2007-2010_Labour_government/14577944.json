Mankind must retain the capacity of choice, thus allowing them to either accept or reject God. Since that capacity is God-given.\n\nIt is wrong for the state to impose a spiritual view on its people just because the state deems it to be correct. Religious belief is a personal relation that he or she has with God. If a person disagrees with drinking alcohol, the state should not force a person to take a drink. Likewise, the state should not try to impose gay marriage on people holy place of worship. \n\nIs Government suggesting that all religious place of worship should abandon their fundamental spiritual believes?",
