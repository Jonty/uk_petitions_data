            "background": "We feel that the government should strongly consider following the example of the French government in passing legislation prohibiting websites which promote anorexia and/or bulimia as a lifestyle choice, and imposing fines or jail sentences on website owners. We believe it should be a criminal offence to encourage young people that their eating disorder is not an illness but an acceptable way of life. Although the media cannot be held fully responsible for most cases of eating disorders, we also believe that the treatment of these conditions in the press, television and other media forms should be censored so as not to promote them in anyway, and should be covered by legislation to that effect. The influence the fashion industry and related media with regards to eating disorders, has been well publicised. However, we feel strongly that the government of this country should seriously consider the impact that the media, websites in particular, can have on sufferers, or potential sufferers, of eating disorders.",
