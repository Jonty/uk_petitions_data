        "action": "introduce legislation to prohibit private health insurers from excluding pre-existing conditions",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Private health insurers can and do decline to cover pre-existing conditions. In other words, if I have a chronic or long-term medical condition at the time I buy health insurance, the insurer will not cover any costs associated with the condition.\n\nThis means that private health insurers 'cherry-pick' only clients in good health thereby accruing near-windfall profits at the expense of the NHS which is left to deal with chronic and long-term cases.\n\nIntroduce legislation to limit the length of time (e.g. first three months of cover) that a private health insurer can refuse to cover a pre-existing condition.",
