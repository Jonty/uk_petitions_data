        "background": "Given the closure of A  & E departments,\nand problems training, recruiting and retaining public sector staff, the petitioner is calling on the British govt. to launch an initiative to co - ordinate emergency services so being stabbed doesn't necessarily mean death.\n\nA 7 minute - ambulance : casualty ETA target is set, but this goal omits to highlight the time from crime scene to hospital. Please address this. \n\nPolicing a nation of open spaces, parks and streets is infinitely difficult. Of course, peaceful, law - abiding people have nothing to fear, other than miscarriages of justice, criminals and the crime itself, but we the undersigned are calling for investment into continguency management - Be prepared !",
