One of the shocking things about the sale of fair trade chocolate is that most sellers of confectionary do not stock any fair trade lines, restricting the accessibility of Fair Trade chocolate to the consumer. Given the choice a lot more people would buy FT instead of chocolate that trades from politicianry. It could be a small step which would make a big change.",
