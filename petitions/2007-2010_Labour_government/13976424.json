These should be commandeered and used for low-cost, low rise eco housing around a central building on the site which can also provide accommodation and central services. For more information see ROOFTREE page and ROOFTREE group on Facebook. Only government can make this happen. Change the planning and building regs, and get an army of unemployed construction workers building homes for people!",
