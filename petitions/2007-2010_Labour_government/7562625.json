        "background": "Maybe this already happens but if it doesn't I feel, very strongly, that it should.  Fertility treatment differs from other medical treatments in that its aim is to create another person who has no choice over who his/her parents are.  Of course this applies to ALL children but unfortunately there is no way to investigate the suitability of parents who conceive naturally and without difficulty.  My main concern is their ability to give the 4 emotional supports I feel all children need (and which I did NOT receive so I know the damaging effects of not receiving them): love, emotional security, confidence and high self-esteem.  The right to a loving and secure childhood should always supersede the \"right\" to parenthood.",
