Will not address any of the perceived problems. And it will not in any way be police-able. There are already laws against Anti-Sociable behaviour and we believe that section 4b) 'An exception applying to non-professional mariners on ships less than 22 metres in length and not more than a maximum speed of 17 knots.' Should be applied instead.",
