            "background": "After 4 years an Australian Qualified Teacher is no longer able to teach in the UK unless they achieve qualified teachers status (QTS). As of September of this year the UK governemnt will be very firm on this 4 year rule which they have timidly ingnored for many years. All European Union trained teachers now automatically gain QTS. The only problem is that their English is very limited for them to come and work effectively in UK schools. Not only Australian but New Zealand, American and South African teachers will be leaving in droves come September 2008.",
