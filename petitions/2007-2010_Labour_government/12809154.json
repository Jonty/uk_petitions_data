We find it hard to pay \u00a330 plus for shoes, trainers, sandals at a certain shoe shop etc every time our child needs new shoes. Having searched for wider fitting shoes for children online we were surprised to find this is a common problem.  It would also be helpful if it was compulsary for all shoe shops to have to offer a proper measuring service... help protect our childrens feet now from illfitting shoes to prevent problems in the future",
