        "background": "At least 155 disabled Lincolnshire residents and their families could be left without specialist support, because of cutbacks by Lincolnshire County Council.\n\nFor over 12 years, the Council has provided an annual grant of around \u00a317,000 to part fund a community adviser supporting local children and adults who have spina bifida or hydrocephalus, and their families.\n\nASBAH (the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus) funds the rest through voluntary contributions.\n\nThe charity has worked closely with Lincolnshire residents for the last seven years. However, last month the council informed ASBAH that it will be withdrawing its support from March 2010.\n\nDespite the County Council having an obligation to provide support to its local communities where there is an obvious need, the Authority has decided to cut grants to the voluntary organisations that enable them to fulfil these obligations.\n\nThe above information is taken from a press release issued by ASBAH.",
