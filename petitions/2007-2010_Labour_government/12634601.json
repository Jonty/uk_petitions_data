        "background": "It is well known that the human mind is incapable of clear, rational thought without the aid of sleep.  Indeed, recent studies demonstrate a marked health risk associated with sleep deprivation.  Furthermore, there exists a clear correlation between workers' productivity and a period of afternoon rest, known colloquially as as the 'afternoon nap'.  We petition the prime minister to legally enshrine the workers' right to a nice afternoon nap and, ideally,  the abandonment of monday mornings as designated periods of the working week.",
