            "background": "We call on the government to ensure that all children receive a high standard of education in a safe, modern education system that teaches facts rather than religious doctrine and bigotry.\n\nSchools should not abuse their position of trust to indoctrinate children. They should teach facts, encourage logical free-thinking and promote social integration, equality and human rights. They should not promote blind faith in a particular religion, endorse religious texts full of inaccuracies and contradictions or condone religious bigotry.\n\nPublic money should not be spent promoting religion and all schools should follow the same rules, with no exemptions.\n\nFaith schools results are distorted by their selective admissions policies, which leave other schools to cope with the most disruptive pupils.\n\nChild abuse is inherent within many religious organisations and such organisations cannot be trusted to put the safety and rights of children above their own preservation.\n\nLessons should be learned from Northern Ireland, where segregation and faith schools contributed to generations of religious hatred and where the integration of children helped to secure a lasting peace.",
