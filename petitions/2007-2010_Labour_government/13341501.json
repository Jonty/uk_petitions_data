        "action": "prevent the RSPB from chopping down 1000s of acres of forests in the UK.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In a time where climate change is a significant isssue, and must be dealt with commitment to reduce CO2 emmissions. How can the RSPB possibly think that clearing many acres of forest would benefit the environment. It's simply outrageous. In fact, doing so would increase UK's overall CO2 emmissions, putting us under heavy pressure to meet the c02 target cuts, which will be agreed in Copenhagen. \n\nEven if these forests are not the native ones, and even if SOME birds don't thrive, you must rememer that Britain used to be completely forested several hundred years ago, and that many animals, such as red squirrels, badgers and foxes thrived in those forests. When the forests were chopped down to build wooden war-ships, the diversity of wildlife in the UK dropped substantially. Removing these non - native forests could eradicate some of the UK's iconic species. Also, these special forests may not be there for future generations to enjoy, if the RSPB have their way.  \n\nWe desperately need to replant forests all over the world, not cut them down.\nIf you are committed to combatting climate change, and saving the world from a global catastrophe, make your voice heard by signing this petition.",
