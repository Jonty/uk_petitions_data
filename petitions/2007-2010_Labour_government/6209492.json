            "background": "The proposed idea is to install electronic systems either in polling stations or in households in order for referendums to happen frequently on major events (such as wars, EU agreements etc.) The system would be designed so the user can say yes or no following online instructions. In doing so the people would be able to represent themselves more freely and more democratically.",
