        "background": "With the advent of the minimum wage and working time directive, together with a host of other health and safety directives, workers now have basic rights to a minimum salary and working conditions. As such, the right to strike is no longer required. It should be revoked. Workers should have the right to \"resign\". If they are not happy with the salary or working conditions they get, they can simply resign and leave and have no right to return. They can go and get another job, paying more or providing better working conditions. Working conditions and salaries would be aligned to supply and demand and provides flexibility in a global environment. Look at the ramifications. Underground drivers would never strike - who would pay them more? BA pilots would never strike - who would pay them more? Teachers would not strike who would give them 13 weeks holiday a year and teacher training days. Those at the lower salary scale would be protected by the minimum wage and the benefits system.",
