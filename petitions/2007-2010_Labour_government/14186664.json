            "background": "Retailers are advertising large screen TVs and giving detailed specifications, but often fail to disclose the expected power consumption (watts).\n\nWithout wattage information to compare between models, customers are not able to consider the energy efficiency of the device, and make an informed choice. This would help homeowners plan for future energy consumption - something this government claims to support.\n\nThe problem is particularly noticeable for online retailers who take up a whole page with  specifications, but often fail to inform the consumer how much it will cost in power (watts consumed).\n\nGiven the governments commitment to reducing energy, disclosing expected device consumption should be mandatory.\n\nTo see what other countries are doing in this respect try websearching for: california+television+energy+limit\n\nWe the undersigned would like the government to make providing expected power consumption information be a mandatory part of the sales process for large screen televisions.",
