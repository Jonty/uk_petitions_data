            "background": "The new Home Office policy states that all rejected Iraqi asylum seekers who have been remaining in Britain and receiving state support since it has been unsafe for them to return to Iraq must now sign up to a return programme within three weeks or face being made homeless and deprived of all support. Contrary to the Home Secretary's statement, most areas of Iraq are still not safe for asylum seekers to return to, according to the UN High Commission for Refugees. We call on the Prime Minister to put an end to this forcible returning of people to a highly dangerous area by threatening them with homelessness and destitution.",
