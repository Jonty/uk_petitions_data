            "background": "I propose that the government put in place a program whereby certain benefits are only available once a claimant has provided 1 years Tax payment to the government.\n\nThis would remove the issue of \"Drop out and Sign on\" culture which blights the schools and neighbourhoods of our poorest communities.  \n\nBy removing the instant provision of benefits, it would force potential claimants to get jobs rather than rely on hand outs making them less likely to become benefit dependant.  Likewise with immigrants it would mean that the perceived unjustness at the benefits on offer would be addressed, ensuring that immigrants that arrive are genuinely looking to contribute to our society.\n\nIn a time of difficult budget constraints this would provide a break on spiraling wellfare spending.  It is time to get to grips with the massive public benefit spending and ensure that it is a last resort of the needy and not a first resort of the lazy.",
