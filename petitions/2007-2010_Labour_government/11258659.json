            "background": "Balmedie Beach is one of the top natural treasures in Scotland and it would be an injustice for the Scottish government to turn their back on their people, country and natural history to allow an international tycoon to build a hotel complex with 950-time share properties as well as landscaping the dunes for a golf course.  Balmedie Beach is already a tourist attraction and nature reserve that must be reserved for the future of Scotlands' natural beauty and for the people.",
