        "background": "i think the government should offer grants or pay job seekers allowance at a rate which reflects the current wage rate a person is on when he/she becomes redundant.  Even if people were offered a government loan to soley pay mortgages for a year which can be repayable from future wages at a reasonable rate.  maybe this would prevent decent hard working people from losing thier homes and give them the oppurtunity to find work without burying them selves in more debt.",
