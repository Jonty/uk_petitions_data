Unfortunately there are many unwanted dogs and I believe if compulsory insurance is introduced there will be many dog owners who feel they cannot afford this extra cost. \n\nInsurance companies will be laughing!! \n\nHow will it be monitored? \n\nOnce again the good responsible pet owners are being punished.",
