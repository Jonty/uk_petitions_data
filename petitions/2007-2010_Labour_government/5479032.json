        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is estimated that up to 25% of local authority Council Tax is being swallowed up by the ever increasing burden of Public Sector Final Salary Pensions coupled with the injustice that Public Sector Workers can retire at 60 while the rest of society is restrained by the retirement age of 65 (for men).\nThis injustice sees individual households that are above any Government intervention thresholds having to contribute to the pensions of Council Employees whilst being unable to afford to contribute to a pension for themselves.\nNot only is this a total injustice it is also unsustainable with the percentage of the workforce being employed by local or national government increasing year on year.\nThe new Prime Minister promises equality for all and the removal of injustice. Workers employed by government get the best conditions, the highest level of protection from the law, and ultimately the earliest and best pension provision. Those of us in the private sector, especially those who are self employed are truly second class citizens.",
