        "action": "consider liberalizing the current restrictions on firearms ownership.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current laws governing firearms ownership in the UK are overly restrictive. Both the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and the Firearms (Amendment)(No2) Act 1997 were passed at times of significant outcry against firearms ownership. Indeed, the Home Affairs Select Committee concluded that a ban on handguns in the wake of the Dunblane massacre would be \"panic legislation\". There is no doubt that both the Dunblane and Hungerford massacres raise significant concerns about the availability of firearms to those incapable of using them responsibly. However, the Government must face up to the fact that the  majority of firearms crime is carried out with illegally held firearms, and that restricting the rights of law-abiding people can have little impact on this. Our proposals are as follows:\n  1.That the conditions for awarding a firearms certificate be reduced to confirmation of mental health and no criminal associations/convictions.\n  2.That the ban on ownership of pistols be lifted, as it is detrimental to practitioners of a legitimate Olympic sport.\n  3.That the ownership of firearms for the defence of one's family and oneself be legalized.",
