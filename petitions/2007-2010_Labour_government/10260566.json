            "background": "The boy's school says he has violated the children's rights and has complained to the Swedish Parliament. \n\nThe school, in Lund, southern Sweden, argues that if invitations are handed out on school premises then it must ensure there is no discrimination. \n\nThis rule should not be applied to British schools. Kids should determine who goes to their parties. Plus not everyone in a class are friends with each other. If this silly rule was applied, parents have to spend more money on parties and will be more stressful as there will be more tears and tantrums due to the fact the children know there are some children that should not be there. The govt, LEAs and schools should take note. Children should invite who they want to attend their party.",
