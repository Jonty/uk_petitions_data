            "background": "The deacy of our armed forces is apparent and from what I gather is leading to skilled and experienced people leaving and finding alternatives to serving their country, things have got so bad with Supply, Housing,Pay,Single accomodation,Food, Welfare and Morale that it has to stop now. Militarily we are becoming a third world country that still has first world commitments I myself was once proud to serve, but I only feel pity for those now serving with such a millstone around their necks",
