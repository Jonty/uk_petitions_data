            "background": "Make it so that all schools are aware of Asperger's Syndrome, Autism and other hidden disabilities, and are able to help the students. Have more people qualified to notice these disabilities from a young age, so that help can be given from the start. Don't leave it until they are teenagers to diagnose, it's so difficult to be undiagnosed and in secondary school. Autistic Spectrum Disorder's need to be noticed! Help raise awareness! Just because a person looks okay doesn't give you the right to make them do things outside of their abilities. Asking a child with Asperger's to engage in normal social activity is like asking the impossible. Undiagnosed children and teens in schools get treated the same as everyone else, and that's often not what would be best for them. If they do have a diagnosis, school's need to make sure they do everything they can to support them. So many children and teens go undiagnosed through school and into adulthood. I am a 17 year old with Asperger's Syndrome and I know what it was like to go through school undiagnosed. Please don't let this keep happening.",
