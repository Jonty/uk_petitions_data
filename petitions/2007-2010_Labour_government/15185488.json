            "background": "Dr. Shaukat Aman Ulla, known as Arslan is an out Atheist and ex-Muslim; currently living in the UK in safety.\n\nIn Pakistan, his home country, Atheism is impossible to uphold, one is born and dies a Muslim believer by law. To leave the Muslim faith by actions or words is punishable by death.\n\nHis visa has unfortunately ran out. He has had his asylum interview in London, they accepted that he is an out Atheist and that it is dangerous for an ex-Muslim to live in Pakistan, but his asylum application was rejected as they said he can just 'practice his Atheism quietly'!! Which is ridiculous, who 'practices Atheism' anyway?\n\nHe is known in Leeds as an ex-Muslim Atheist, his life is endangered if he is returned to Pakistan whether he behaves 'quietly' or not.\n\nHope is not lost, he has been granted an appeal on 8th April and has been told he has more than 50% chance of success!\n\nPlease join the petition to support him, which he can take with him to the appeal.",
