The UK recently recognised Kosovo's declaration of independence and Russia's recognition of South Ossetia is no different.\n\nWith US military on the ground, Georgia, troops started bombing South Ossetian civilians, most of whom are Russian passport holders. While we can only speculate about US involvement and motives and her relations to the US-educated Georgian president, we do not need to speculate on who started this conflict. The UK government is blaming Russia and condemning the Russian government for being aggressors. The US/UK invasion of Iraq seems forgotten.",
