            "background": "Why should women put their lives into the Governments hands? Just because of 'the costs'. \n\nWomen are being diagnosed with cervical cancer to late. In the modern world women or girls are sexually active from a very young age. Are they not at risk? Cancer itself is a widely developed disease that seems to be popularising. Is it not safer to be sure and theoretically cheaper for the Government to allow for costs for the tests, instead of the treatment? Remember the saying \u2018Prevention is better than cure\u2019. \n\nIts also amazing how a Scottish woman has a mature cervic at the age of 20, yet the rest of the females in the UK are five years behind? How is this justified?",
