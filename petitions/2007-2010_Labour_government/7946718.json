            "background": "This petition is not the only one here, but as we've come to expect, no one in government is listening.  Why are countries with huge economies being given aid from the uk?  For example, India is being 'granted' a 825million pound aid package.  Why?  Their economy is booming.  On the flip side, councils in this country are complaining that they are not funded enough, plus hospitals have crisis, plus we have a *lot* of problems in this country.  How many teachers/nurses/police/firefighters/better conditions for servicemen etc would this money buy??\n\nSomeone in government please *listen to the people*",
