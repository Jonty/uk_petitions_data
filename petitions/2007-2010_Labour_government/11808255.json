            "background": "Together let us bring to the attention of the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary the 2009/2010 budget deficit for the County's Police Force of over \u00a34m. This is wholly down to the Police Authority vote of a 2.9% rise in Council Tax contributions. The equivalent of 60 officers' posts, plus 50 civilian staff and also 28 Police Community Support Officers will have to go, affecting front line Policing. \nIn an economic downturn crime rises especially burglaries and public order offences. This is no time for cuts in Police. A rise of 6.4% (\u00a31 month/Band D council tax) is required to avoid the deficit. \u00a31.3m of efficiency savings will still be made. \nThe price of a burger a month to protect your family and secure public order is surely a small price to pay. The Home Secretary can overturn this decision and prove that the elected Government of this great Country is 'Tough on Crime and Tough on the Causes of Crime' Please show your support to help protect our community in these troubled times.",
