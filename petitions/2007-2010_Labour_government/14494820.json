            "background": "Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust scored just 4.8 out of 100 for patient safety in the report by Dr Foster. It puts the hospital in the bottom 12 of more than 150 trusts in England and particularly points to the hospital\u2019s death rate, which is the 3rd highest in the country. ASHTON MP David Heyes together with Tameside\u2019s other MPs Andrew Gwynne & James Purnell, are now calling for an urgent meeting with government health secretary Andy Burnham to demand closer scrutiny of the hospital. Mr Heyes, whose constituency includes the Ashton hospital, said: \u201cIn my view, when things go wrong at a hospital the managers should be held to account.\" Tameside\u2019s coroner John Pollard, who in 2006 branded the hospital \u2018despicable and chaotic\u2019 said he would like to help the hospital improve & supported the MP\u2019s actions. He added: \u201cThere are enormous improvements that have taken place, but clearly according to Dr Foster there is still work to be done. I am saddened to hear the findings and I would endorse the views taken by the MPs and support the actions they are proposing.\u201d\n\nGordon Brown, it is time for you to step in and take action, now!",
