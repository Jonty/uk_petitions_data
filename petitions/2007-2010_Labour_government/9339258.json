        "background": "PUFFIN crossings which have recently been introduced across the country have confused many people, and still do. when waiting to cross it is natural to look across the road to the other side, so a slight turn of the head can monitor traffic in both directions. the new layout at PUFFIN crossings mean people stand waiting as they havent seen the green man, which is often obsured by other pedestrians. if another green/red man signal was postioned as on the pelican crossings everyone would be able to see, the partially sighted could see the existing low one and everyone else could look across to the one on the other side of the road",
