This is opposed by the Church\u2019s congregation, the local Council and many thousands of the city\u2019s people. \n\nSt Peter\u2019s dominates the entrance to the city and has iconic status, as Brighton\u2019s premier church. It was designed by Charles Barry, the architect of the Houses of Parliament, and built in 1824. It is one of the first and finest examples of Gothic revival in England. In 1873 it became Brighton\u2019s Parish Church. It houses the city\u2019s war memorials and it is this church to which people turn at times of national crisis\n\nThe Friends of St Peter\u2019s Church have called on the Bishop of Chichester to work with the Council and congregation to save St Peter\u2019s for continued use as an important place of worship; a place of welcome for those who visit or seek sanctuary in our city; and a valuable resource for the wider community. \n\nTo this end, we petition the support of the Prime Minister.",
