            "background": "There have been several petitions to stop the building of a Tesco Express store on Unthank Road in Norwich.\n\nBut what about the people who DO want this store to be open?  Until now they have been unheard.\n\nA new Tesco would bring more life into the community, providing more employment prospects and more customers to the area.  It has been said that local businesses in the area will suffer from the opening of a tesco store, but we fail to see why this is!!!!  The only stores that is likelyy to suffer are the TWO CO-OP stores, who are hardly a local business!  The various other businesses will get increased customers from the opening of a tesco store.\n\nResidents in the area can benefit from cheap products in the local area!\n\nAlso the eyesore that is the old Shell garage WILL be gone.",
