            "background": "The functions of High Street banks and Investment banks have merged over the past few decades and the high risk taking of the Investment banks was a direct cause of the banking crisis. In the 1930's FDR signed the Glass-Steagall Act, 1933 some of which sought to curtail speculation by the banks by preventing any one institution from acting as a High Street bank, an Investment bank and an Insurance company. The act remained in force until repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 1999. The big banks have been motivated to merge commercial and investment banking by the huge bonuses paid and to say that the City of London would be damaged by forcing the banks to split is utter fallacy as the US economy grew throughout the latter half of the 20th century and it was only when the brakes were taken off by the passing of the GLB act that rampart speculation returned. Let one type of bank deliver high street functions and the other deliver investment. Let us not allow greedy people to speculate with our futures. If the UK does this unilaterally and these so called skilled individuals move to NY or Tokyo where they can get better bonuses, so be it - we may just be able to get by without them.",
