        "background": "We believe that Conservative MP Derek Conway has committed Fraud. We believe he has embezzled taxpayer's money which could be used more appropriately for the benefit of the tax payer.\nWe are confident that his son's Frederick and Henry are aware of their father's mis-appropriations.\nIf a member of the public had embezzled an amount of money (In the order of \u00a360,000) from the tax-payer, they would be tried and probably imprisoned.\nThis investigation and/or trial of MP Derek Conway would also act as a deterrent against other MP's misusing their expense accounts, and give some cause to re-assess their expense claims.",
