            "background": "The proposed congestion charging system in Manchester plans to charge motorcycles in the same way as cars.\n\nMotorcycles do not cause congestion on the road, in fact they have the opposite effect and actually reduce congestion by virtue of the fact that they can legally filter through traffic. As such, there is no reason why the 'congestion' charges should apply to motorbikes.\n\nThe London congestion charge does not apply to motorcycles and therefore it should not apply in any other part of the country.\n\nMotorcycles are also a more economical and enviromentally friendly form of transport, and should be positively encouraged by the government.",
