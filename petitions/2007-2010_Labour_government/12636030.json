Their wholesale abuse of public funds has discredited the entire political system, to the benefit only of extremists. We need a new Parliament and new representatives and we need them now. Please, Prime Minister, for the sake of this Democracy, seek an immediate audience with Queen to request a dissolution of this Rotten Parliament.",
