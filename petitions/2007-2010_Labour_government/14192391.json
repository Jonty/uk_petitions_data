            "background": "Its a struggle going back into work especially if you are paid a month in hand. U cant pay your household bills rent or even afford to eat and in some cases people end up back on benefits because there life depends on it.\n\nAll that i am proposing is that we should be able to get crisis loans or even food vouchers, that we pay back at a monthly rate until we are on our feet and our wage is coming in, so we can stay in employment.\n\nCos at the moment u cannot get a crisis loan unless u are in reciept of Job Seeker Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance or income support. I believe this could benefit the whole economy and less people would be sitting on bemefits.",
