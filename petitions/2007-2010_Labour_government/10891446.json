        "background": "Savers have protection for \u00a350K,banks have been bailed out with \u00a3500 billion. Yet the people with mortgages have little protection- \u00a3542 a month maximum interest covered according the DWP  Rented properties paid for through housing benefits - The latest fiasco is Ealing council paying a monthy rent of \u00a312458 month on a property which was five times the the rent for a similar property for the area.\nYet people with mortgages have lost their homes and any equity - on repossession - even if they had saved up to to pay a deposit -  due to financial difficulties and falling house prices. Many hundreds of thousands may go down the same route.  What is the govt going to do for homeowners at risk of losing their homes...they need help and fast.. Raise the amount of interest covered by DWP to pay the interest only amount on the whole of the loan. Make lenders add arrears to the loan - to be repaid when the property is sold. The govt has to help people with homes at risk of repossession NOW.",
