        "background": "We, the British Public, have had enough of the New Labour Government destroying the values and standards of our way of life, especially in Parliament. Polititians are now regarded with suspicion and distrust, even hatred, mainly due to the many recorded instances of sleaze, gluttony and a lack of honour and commitment displayed by many of its members. The Prime Ministers astonishing decision to re-employ double-disgraced Peter Mandelson is an affront to the British Public and will make our once proud Country a laughing stock around the world.",
