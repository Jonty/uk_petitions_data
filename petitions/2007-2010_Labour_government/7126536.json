            "background": "Fireworks are an freely available explosive and are missiles capable of blowing fingers, feet, eyes, ears off. They are also a potential terrorist weapon which is freely available. It is only a matter of time before a disaster happens. The law should be changed to force licensing of authorised display organisers only, the same rules that apply to purchasing TNT or guns should apply. Australia has long since only allowed the sale of sparklers and no one has ever missed purchasing fireworks for home displays because each town and city holds their OWN community display. This WILL prevent injury and possible terrorist usage! Fireworks ARE incendiary devices and should NOT be freely available to the general public. There is no legitimate reason a private household should be in possession of TNT nor should they be in possession of fireworks.",
