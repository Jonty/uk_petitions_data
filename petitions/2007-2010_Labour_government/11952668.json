            "background": "National Express took over the East Coast franchise in December 2007 and since then the franchise has become a disgrace. \nNational Express removed all restaurent services onboard trains. They claim they are losing lots of money from these services but many passengers are complaining as they will now have to put up with a trolley services selling light refreshments.\nNational Express have also raised their peak hour prices. This means more of us have to suffer from paying more money in this economic downturn for a seat on a train.",
