        "background": "The UK should never sign up to the Schengen Agreement and should not ever allow the free movement of people from European member states to enter the UK without a UK passport or a visa. The current climate of unemployment in the UK should be reason enough to see that such an act would render us helpless to defend the working age citizens of Britain from indefinite unemployment. I am seeking a promise that the citizens of Britain will never be forced into accepting such changes by a government.",
