A recent example of this is an enquiry to the child support agency resulted in me having to phone and talk to several departments.  Each department has no idea what the other does and can not help you with simple advice.\n\nWith vast savings required streamlining business processes and cut out unnecessary bureaucracy should be essential.  There is no need for several departments to deal with the same cases.  A whole scale change is required in how the CSA is operated and managed to drive out savings.",
