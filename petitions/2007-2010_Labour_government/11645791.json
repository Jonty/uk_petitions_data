            "background": "The housing market in the uk has come to a vitual stand still over the last 12 months. \n\nFirst time buyers are having to put down on average 18% deposit, the largest deposit in over 30 years due to the banks reluctance to lend a high loan to property Value.\n\nA lot of young people desire to own their own home shown by the recent increase in first time buyer enquiries at estate agents.\n\nIf either Bradford & Bingley or Northern Rock were to loan at 95% loan to value then this would bring stability to the housing market, this in turn would allow house builders and all associated trades to continue in business.\n\nI urge Gordon Brown to make these two nationised bank to lead by example and become the specialist first time buyer mortgage provider.",
