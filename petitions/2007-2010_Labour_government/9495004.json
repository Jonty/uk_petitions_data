So many people diagnosed have been disgustingly abandoned as it doesn't go under mental health or learning disability - this is revolting and many people with this condition are suffering in silence!",

I feel I and others should have had automatic expert help around proper intergration into society on a normal level, around understanding relationships, sexual ones, body language, social skills - counselling just isn't sufficient!It is not humanly right that people with this condition are just left,so more should be done about this invisible disability as it is not physical.",
