        "background": "Every time i go to asda with my baby boy or anywhere else for that matter all the mother and baby spaces are taken up. But not by people with children. This means i like many mothers out there are unable to get our children safely out of the car. However the spaces are taken up by people who do not have children and disabled people who think that by putting out their badges it gives them the right to park their. Also taking up spaces are people who think it is acceptable to park their with teenagers. Yet everywhere i see mother and baby spaces their is always a sign saying a fixed penalty shall be given to those who do not obied by this. However when i asked one of the businesses involved with this they said because it is not the law they can't enforce it and therefore the sign is just more of a display then actual truth.I think it is disgraceful how people ignore the fact that it is purely for mother and baby and would like to make the point that if us parents were to park in disabled bays and were not disabled we would come back to find a ticket on our windowshield.",
