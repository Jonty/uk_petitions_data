            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "with the ever increasing price of petrol, even though the price of crude oil is stable it is time for action - an excessive and punishing amount is fuel duty \nCutting tax will benefit the economy by providing stability to both car and commercial drivers price rises in shops would be kept to a minimum, oil fuelled generators would also be able to maintain costs stabilising increased costs from heating companies - as the government receive a windfall every time the price of oil increases via fuel duty, and receives far in excess now than previously, we pay more than our fair share already\n\nwe demand\nthat Fuel duty is reduced in line with fuel price increases, duty should be reduced to reflect the cost.  \nwe further demand\na windfall tax on excessive profits,to fuel companies which currently make an exorbitant profit by not reducing costs in line with falls in crude oil prices and by not passing savings on - any shortfall to the treasury could then be repaid by this windfall tax\n1) this would benefit the whole county.\n2) have a negative impact on inflation\n3) mean cheaper bills for all - especially the needy\n4) No reduction of the income generated to the treasury",
