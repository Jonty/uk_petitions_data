        "background": "British family law, and it's support workers - Cafcasss and the majority of Family Court Judges are biased towards placing children soley with the female parent following divorce. This leads to fathers having to take expensive legal action in order to negotiate access when there is a bitter ex wife involved. Law should be changed to make it impossible for Ex Wives to lie, manipulate and exploit the law for their own benefit and - as is done in America- make parental alienation a criminal offence. CAFCASS workers claim to be unbiased but in many cases follow an unwritten protocol to place children with the female parent. This must STOP amd they must be made accountable and be able to be challenged.",
