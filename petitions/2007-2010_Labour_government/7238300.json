            "background": "In England and Wales, canoeists, kayakers and swimmers have no recognised legal right to enjoy rivers or lakes. Prior to the 1940's informal access was rarely challenged. Subsequently some riparian owners have declared that there is no public right to water. This has no basis other than loose case law relating to trespass which is not relevant if there is a right!\n\nCurrent government advice is to rely on access agreements, but we can see they're not working and potentially not necessary! So it's time for a change.",
