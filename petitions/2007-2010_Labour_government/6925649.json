        "background": "Sleaford has suffered for a long time now with illegal parking. There are, and have been for many years, parking restrictions in place just like any other UK town. Sleaford seems to suffer from excessive traffic and this is partly caused by other road users blocking up the town with inconsiderate parking. The town has many businesses that rely on deliveries to be made, and these are inhibited by cars parking in loading bays. The town\u2019s buses find it equally as hard quite a lot of the time to pull up to the kerb at bus stops, as cars are parked on the stops. The local council has recently built a brand new car park to alleviate the problem, but very few people use it and continue to park illegally. Most residents and businesses of the town would like to see a traffic warden or parking officer regularly in the town enforcing the parking.",
