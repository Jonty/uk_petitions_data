            "background": "This petition states that the Act somehow disadvantages white British people; heaven forfend!  It is, in fact, one of a raft of anti-discrimination Acts which have been created over the last few decades; in many cases not before time.  The Race Act (actually the Race RELATIONS Act) aims to counter discrimination against racial minorities who ARE discriminated against as white British people are NOT.  In fact this Act, and all anti-discrimination Acts, should be considerably strengthened.",
