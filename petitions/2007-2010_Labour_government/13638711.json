        "background": "There are couples out there who have gotten married under the age of 21 who genuinely do love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together. Raising the settlement visa age to 21 does NOT prevent forced marriaged! Instead, it makes thousands of couples forced apart and suffer. So change the minimum age requirement for the settlement visa back to 18. Raise the marriage age to 21. My son has been forced apart from his father and I have been forced apart from my husband. Everyone should have a right to have a family.",
