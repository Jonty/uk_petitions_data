        "background": "It has been proven time and again that speed camres don't work and they course more harm than good. So why does the goverment insist on fitting more and more when we have been told that over a year ago no more will be fitted to our roads??\n\nEnough is enough! Can the goverment stop trying to rob the motorist on the motorways and using the excuse that making the motorway wider is reason to fit average speed scams to make the money back and cover their expenses for doing so.",
