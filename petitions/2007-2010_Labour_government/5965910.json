        "background": "It can be said (in my opinion) that the majority of the public do not disagree with speed cameras in places where they have been a great help in reducing road traffic accidents and made the area safer for traffic and pedestrians alike. But there are now far too many cameras on open country roads and dual carriageways that are there purely to raise yet more money from the already heavily penalised road user.",
