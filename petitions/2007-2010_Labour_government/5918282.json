Governments past and present, have been slow with environment policy changes. Instead they have put the economy first and have allowed us to severely over use our cars which polute the environment with CO2. The Government has also continued to allow more and more house building take place in the wrong areas. Now it wants to build even more new homes? IT REALY MUST STOP. OTHERWISE NONE OF US WILL BE LEFT LIVING",
