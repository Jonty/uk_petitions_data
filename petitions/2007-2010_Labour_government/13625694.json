The talk is very confusing, and to me pretty silly. There is much fretting over the little and many cuts that have to be made over countless years. \nWhy don\u2019t the government just ask for a one-off payment of say \u00a320 from everyone and have done with it. No slow laborious upheaval and restoration of the country, just a sensible, straight to the point answer\u2019\nSo chip in \u00a320 to clean up the mess \u2013 disaster averted!",
