        "background": "The idea that tax payers' money, given to bail-out the banks and therefore stabilise the economy, should be used to pay staff bonuses is immoral and wholly disheartening.\nWhilst many companies not eligible for government bail-outs face bankruptcy, banks have the arrogance to spend the tax payers' money on staff bonuses. Moreover, it is entirely unclear what the banks' staff have done to merit these bonuses.",
