            "background": "In the current economic crisis, the government is considering massive funding to protect jobs, our industry and economy.  This is a golden opportunity to support technologies, and activity, that will help save our planet \u2013 particularly around energy use \u2013 moving towards a \u201czero carbon Britain\u201d.  It is vital that funding is targeted on areas which will actually help the quality of our lives \u2013 and to sustain our global environment \u2013 rather than just trying to keep up consumption.\n\nGermany shows what could be achieved - having created 250,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector. In the UK, we have created a mere 2 to 3 thousand \u2013 even though we are pioneering research in some of the technologies \u2013 e.g. wave power, and we have industrial skills that could be readily applied (e.g. aerospace to wind power)\n\nThis is a golden opportunity to make Britain a world leader in renewable technologies, ensuring our future prosperity, as well as the future of our planet.",
