        "background": "The greedy bankers have got this country (& others) into a terrible state.  Industry is suffering, people losing their jobs and most of the population are suffering great financial hardship.\n\nI am concerned that the Chancellor will tax the people even more to bring in more money to bail out the banks (again) and also to fund the bankers' bonuses .\n\nI suggest that the Chancellor makes a swift move to bring in legilation to create a new \"FINANCIAL SERVICES BONUS\" law , the effect of which is to tax such bonuses at 99% (the 1% allows them to keep, say, the first \u00a3100 of a bonus per financial year), thereby returning tax-payers hard earned money back to the treasury.",
