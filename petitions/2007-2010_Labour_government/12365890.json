            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Ludford Church of England Primary School is a small school in rural Lincolnshire which provides an excellent education for its pupils.  It is not a failing school and has good Ofsted reports.  Most of the children who attend this school walk there on a daily basis and do not want to be educated in a larger out of village school.  The school is also a haven for children with special needs whose education will suffer if they are subjected to larger class sizes and less one on one tutor attention.  The closure of this school will damage the community of Ludford irreparably.  Lincolnshire County Council is ignoring legislation which implicitly states the procedures they must follow in order to close any school and are fast tracking the closure.  Please sign our petition.",
