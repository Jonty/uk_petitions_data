            "background": "The Driving Standards Agency is trying to enact draconian new EU legislation which requires new uprated motorcycle test centres. The new rules are due to come in at the end of April but only 33 of these centres are so far operational so large areas of teh country will be ill served and bikers will have to travel long distances to reach them. At a time when motorcyles should be encouraged to save fuel and road space we should not be putting obstacles in the way of people learning to ride them. This petition is presented by The Motorcycle Action Group.",
