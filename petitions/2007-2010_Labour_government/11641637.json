        "background": "Britain's electoral system is flawed and outdated, and needs reinvigorating. Votes are cast away ignorantly, and because of a \"First passed the post\" electoral system, individual votes are not equal. Political parties can form governments with as little as 25% of the vote at a general election. Is this really democratic? Every citizen should cast a vote knowing that their vote is equal with every other citizen, and that their voice will be heard. The current system favours the old parties, that cycle in and out of government never fulfilling their pre-election promises. We need a system that encourages people to vote, were their vote matters, and were the people really do decide on the make up of Parliament and the government. Right now individuals don't have a say in what happens, and this is completely wrong. We need to reform our country, and proportional representation of the popular vote in Parliament would be a massive step forward.",
