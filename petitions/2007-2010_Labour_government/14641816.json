            "background": "We the ever increasing wave of illegal immigrants claiming asylum many of which are Bogus I suggest that Britain  should not be in the EU,trade with it but not be a party to it.As this will take time we need to opt out of The European Human Rights Act so as to be able to turn all asylum seekers back . We already have more than enough and so they need to go back.Those that stay must swear their allegance to our Crown. My petition is not based on racism or discrimination but that of the law of economics and thus when is enough is enough. Industry is ever modernising with electronics and even moving their bases abroad and that means loss of British jobs.Those lost through this recession will NOT return in bulk numbers and therefore any increase in our population is unsustainable.If not Britain could be another third world sooner than you think.",
