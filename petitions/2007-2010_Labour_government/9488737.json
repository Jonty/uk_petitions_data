        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Police Cautions are given by Police to deter \"First-time offenders\" from committing future transgressions.  They are an alternative to conviction and, therefore, are not meant to create a criminal record.  Prior to 2006, Cautions were often, but not always, deleted from Police Force records after 5 years.  Police Cautions are now held on record until the subject reaches 100 years of age - essentially indefinitely.  Given that Cautions are a grey area with regards to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (1974), they have caused problems for many people applying for jobs which are exempt from the above Act e.g. work in healthcare, schools, security etc.  The current system of \"down-stepping\" a Caution after 5 years is effectively pointless for most people, as a Caution will still show up on a CRB check and thus stop them getting the work they want.  With this in mind, we feel that the only solution to this problem is that the old system of deleting Cautions be reintroduced and be properly implemented.",
