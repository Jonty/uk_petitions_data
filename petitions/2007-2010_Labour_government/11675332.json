This being part of the British Commonwealth, why are these rules not applied here where we have much less room.  Why are we the dumping ground for all and sundry.\nWe now have families here from other countries being kept by us whilst their husbands are working back in their original country and the families are sending their benefits back home to their home country.  It stinks.",
