        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I feel that this country is way behind on enviromental issues compared to the rest of the world.  take Germany- each household is forced to recycle just about everything. I look at Australia where water is the most important commodity and how they all conserve and recycle their water. And all have Bins specifically for recycling each different product. Then i look at Our  country and i find that i cant even recycle a Yogurt pot that has a recycle label on it. Why? because my area dosnt accept them - even at the recycling center. I want the Goverment to make it LAW that every household recycles as much as feasibly possible. I want councils to be able to have the means of collecting ALL recycled items not just card and bottles. I want councils to be able to have the power to peanalise people for not recycling (higher taxes) and to reward the people that do (incentives like tax breaks) Also i want to see more Subsidised eco goods such as water butts and garden waste composters on the market. I want to see the Goverment actively educating society about saving as i feel most of the population would be happy to help do their bit IF the Goverment was willing to help and advise.",
