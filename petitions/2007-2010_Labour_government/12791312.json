        "background": "This petition was inspired by the fact that two members of a party known to be overtly and virulently racist won seats in the  recent European elections.  Since they have an avowed policy of racism how can they claim to represent their Minority Ethnic constituents?  Their election means that people in that category have effectively been disenfranchised. \n\nThis petition is not intended to imply that the only issue with which I am concerned is racism.   I am equally concerned with sexism, homophobia, ageism and, in fact, all forms of discrimination.",
