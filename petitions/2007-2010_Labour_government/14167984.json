The one man who can shed more light on the subject than any other alive is Mr Hans Blix, the UN weapons inspector during the period in question.  Mr Blix has indicated a willingness to testify but the Chilcott Inquiry have failed to call him - why - is the Chilcott Inquiry under instructions from government, and has already been given their final statement and recommendations, much like the Hutton Inquiry was given its' before it started.  In the absence of any indication from the Inquiry,the people MUST be given an opportunity to indicate if they want Mr Blix to testify.",
