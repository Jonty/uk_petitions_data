            "background": "A small group set up in 2008 known as move - a - cow, would be very happy to accept funding from the government to eradicate the problem of taking cows and other live stock upstairs, only to find that you cannot get it back down again. The funding would enable a device to be manufacture to safely lift the live stock downstairs with ease and minimal distress. Currently 3 cows are living on my landing due to an alcohol related mistake and with this new machine I will be able to lift them down safely and finally be rid.\n\nFunding would only be minimal and any extra could go towards creating a device which allows a dog to look up, although this is still in the early stages and may not be possible.",
