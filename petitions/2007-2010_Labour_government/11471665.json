            "background": "Petition to bring in a change of law which allows cat owners to be prosecuted under criminal law, if their animals cause harassment. The law would be aimed at forcing cat owners to care for their pets responsibly and provide proper veterinary vaccinations and treatment, along with a designated place for the animals to use for their toilet needs. This area of law regarding cats and owner responsibility has been grey for too long. Please sign my petition to help prevent child blindness by irresponsible cat owners.",
