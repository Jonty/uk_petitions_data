These days you can be arrested for tackling an intruder in your own home.\n\nThe law is no longer on the side of the public instead its in favour of the criminals. \n\nIf a criminal is \u2018unlucky\u2019 enough to be sent to prison they have a better life style than many people who have to work for a living, Sky TV, pool tables, etc.  \n\nWhat\u2019s the point of having punishment if criminals see it as a joke and just go back to offending when they are released. We want the government to be tough on crime and for punishment to be punishment that make persistent offenders think twice about committing more crime.",
