Why increase the fees for practical and theory tests if you won't give candidates more service. In fact you get less service.\n\nTheir ridiculously high prices just fuel the argument that they need to fail loads of people to make more money. In fact the DSA said we take the extra money from car practical tests to help us pay to build motorcycle test centres.",
