I wonder what would make a request. I take it we are using the same language? Isn't it really the case that my petition is actually deemed politically incorrect as it might upset those who have a faith...never mind about those with no faith\u2026..It is patently obvious by any intelligent person that the belief in a God who is in tune with our thoughts is childish in the extreme- never mind that this same God is only able to construct a person from dust given he created the World from nothing!! That children\u2019s minds are filled with such nonsense is quite disgraceful in this enlightened age.",
