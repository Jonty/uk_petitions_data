            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Employment tribunals have the power to strike out claims or responses without hearing a single piece of evidence on oath. Statements of claim and response forms do not appear to contain any statement of truth. It therefore seems to me that an unscrupulous party to the proceedings can deliberately make false statements of their case, can elaborate on those false statements when requesting a strike out of the claim and if they succeed in misleading the tribunal they will suffer no consequences. This is because they will have prevented any formal evidence from being given and cross examined. The aggrieved party cannot claim there was a contempt of court or pursue a claim for perjury when there was no formal evidence or statement of truth. Please address this situation to prevent dishonest people from abusing the process",
