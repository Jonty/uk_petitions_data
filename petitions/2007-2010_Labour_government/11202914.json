            "background": "During this economic crisis in Britain and other countries, I would like to hear a categorical statement made by the PM Gordon Brown in the House indicating that there will not be, or that there are no intentions regarding Great Britain adopting the Euro currency whilst under this present government's remaining duration in power or for the foreseeable future. The effect on savings and pensions in Britain would be disastrous if it went ahead without consultation and the present low exchange rates.\nA referendum would also be appreciated if plans were afoot.",
