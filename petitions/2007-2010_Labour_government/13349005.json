However, we are not just protesting the mindless slaughter of Marcus. We are protesting the conduct and governance of Andrea Chapman, the Headmistress who wishes to run her school like a farm and business. A school is a place of education, not a place of slaughter. The pupils of Lydd Primary School have already suffered enough mental anguish. Save the future animals of Lydd Primary School, protect the mental well being of students - Remove Andrea Chapman!",
