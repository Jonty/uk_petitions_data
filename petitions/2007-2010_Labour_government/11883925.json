            "background": "We the undersigned propose that the Government should not be pumping billions in taxpayers money directly into the banks to be lost within a large void that doesn't benefit anyone but the banks. \nWe propose that the government give this money back to the people by way of mortgage payments to those struggling to cope. This would give the money back to the banks indirectly and gives the taxpayers valued assistance and money to spend, which in turn will bolster the economy allowing small and large businesses alike to stay afloat. \nPeople will avoid having their homes reposessed and the economy will grow in confidence. \nFor instance \u00a3100,000 given back to 20 million people would aleviate the credit crisis, and oil the cogs of the finance industry.",
