            "background": "Great Britain has the strongest track cycling team in the world and the decision last week of the Government and Sport England to cease any further funding for \u201crecreational\u201d activities such as cycling, will not only condemn a generation to a future of obesity, but also undermine the future success of cycling in all its forms in Britain.  This decision runs counter to the Government's strategy to reduce obesity and improve public health.  It also denies the growth of the grass roots of sports, from where future champions will come, future champions on the track, road, mountain biking and BMX.",
