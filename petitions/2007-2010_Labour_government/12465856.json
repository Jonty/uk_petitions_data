        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The legality of the invasion of Iraq was no better than that of the Nazi invasion of Poland. As a result of the hubris of George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and Tony Blair a sovereign country which was not in conflict with any other country was invaded to serve the agenda primarily of the USA.  This overturned an established and agreed international doctrine of not attacking other countries except in self defence. Moreover the invasion was incompetent as well as illegal, in as much as it was carried out without proper prior intelligence gathering.  Also, the invasion was carried out with insufficient ground forces, so subsequent protection of civilians and property was impossible. Finally no proper plan had been thought out or prepared for post invasion running of the country. Therefore, ensure that the British Prime Minister and Defence Minister at the time of the invasion of Iraq are prosecuted by the UK, or that they are prosecuted by the International War Crimes body,for their criminal activity in encouraging and then authorising the invasion of Iraq",
