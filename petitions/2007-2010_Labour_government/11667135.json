            "background": "The government has just made available several \u00a3Billion to the car industry, however unless stockpiled cars are sold and production restarted it is not obvious how this injection of public money will help the country short term.\n\nIf you assume that the average car price is \u00a310,000 then \u00a32B would buy 200,000 cars (removes the stockpile and requires production to continue.) Would not the \u00a32B of public money be better spent in this way; giving cars to British taxpayers.\nUse the current lottery system to decide who gets a car, even charge a \u00a31 ticket...this has the added advantage of bringing in money to offset the \u00a32 B cost. (Maybe \u00a310M a week...or \u00a3500,000,000 a year. Cars can be distributed through the current dealerships  To appease the green lobby....anyone receiving a public funded car MUST give up their current car if it is older and less efficient of fuel and emissions. This would help the environment by removing high carbon polluting cars and reduce oil consumption. If their current car is new and efficient it could be sold into the second hand market, so further reducing older polluting cars.",
