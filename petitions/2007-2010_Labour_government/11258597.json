            "background": "We, the undersigned wish the prime minister to re-introduce a finishing time for television. We believe that no good can come of showing television late into the night as it encourages us to stay up late watching repeats. Employees and students would be more productive if encouraged to retire for the evening at an earlier time and get more sleep. \n\nWe also wish for the national anthem to be played at the end of the nightly television. This would help to restore national identity and signal the end of the nightly television in an appropriate way. \n\nWe believe that this does not have to significantly affect broadcasters; advertising revenues late at night are low and therefore there is little to be lost by cancelling all night broadcasting. \n\nWe do not oppose the broadcast of late night sporting fixtures that are licensed on a one off basis or other late night broadcasts which will benefit the public in some other way.",
