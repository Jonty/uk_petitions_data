            "background": "This petition is being created during the period of extreme winter conditions at the beginning of January.  A few days ago I logged on to my council's web-site and saw mention of a link to their plans for dealing with this situation: it said they would be gritting pavements in main shopping areas but not side streets; what use is that if you can't get to the main shopping area because the pavement in your street is dangerously icy and you live a long way down it away from the local high street?  Putting my petition into effect just might concentrate minds and make the pavements safer; it would also help the economy by enabling more people to get to the shops.",
