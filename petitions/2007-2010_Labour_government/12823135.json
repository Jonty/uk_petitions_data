            "background": "To ensure that injured workers are protected where their employer is uninsured or the insurer is untraced. \n\nFollowing the repeal of Reg 4(4) of the Employers Liability Compulsory Insurance, it is crucial that employees are safeguarded and do not fall victim to 'poor bureaucracy'. \n\nSince 01/01/1972 it has been a statutory obligation on employers to have and maintain EL insurance. \n\nThe Government has been 'footing the bill' for many of these claims, i.e, through PWCA 1979 payments. We submit that it should be the insurance industry who meets this burden, and therefore we submit there should be an insurance of last resort, contributed to by the insurance company, to meet these claims. The insurance company have taken premiums from a captive market since 1972, it is only right that they should be required to pay out the full and right compensation. \n\nWe therefore support the established on an ELIB, supported by an insurance of last resort, similar to that of the Motor Insurers Bureau, to ensure that those who are victims of workplace accidents/diseases are given access to the right compensation.",
