            "background": "Proposed introduction of hourly parking fees at Richmond Park and Bushy Park\n \nThe Royal Parks in London provide vital recreational and leisure space in an increasingly congested city. These parks literally provide a 'clean lung' for families to enjoy.\n \nWe must not deter families, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds, from access to this valuable yet currently free facility. These families are not going to park somewhere beyond the boundaries of the parks to trek, picnic laden, carting children's games equipment for half an hour to reach the parks' centres. \n \nThe community which Royal Parks should seek to serve should be encouraged to spend hours as family units relaxing in the parks, playing and exercising and not be charged and time rationed. Would the government prefer couch potatoes or even worse increased teenage gang violence from kids with nothing better to do than loiter around their estate? \n \nRoyal Parks proposed introduction of parking fees is unjustifiable - a tax which hits those least able to pay and inhibits the improved community access which should be their mandate.\n \nPlease ensure that the proposed plan to introduce parking fees is immediately dropped.",
