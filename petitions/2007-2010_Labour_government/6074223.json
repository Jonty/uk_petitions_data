            "background": "I have noticed over the past 24 years since I passed my driving test that more and more people jump the red lights. \n\nA few days ago I was waiting at the lights on a roundabout when they turned green - the man driving the white flat- back truck laden with gas bottles didn't seem to notice, he just ran the red light and nearly hit me and the other cars beside me - he didn't even slow down or look.\n\nI also have small children, and I know that even they have nearly been hit by distracted drivers (on their mobiles) or drivers that are in a rush to get somewhere a few minutes earlier.\n\nI think that we need some kind of speed camera at every crossing to ensure the safety of everyone. After all, aren't these the places where people are supposed to 'stop' and not just slow down.",
