            "background": "Lets face it, de-regulation of buses HAS NOT WORKED. In some cities, one company has a monopoly and charges astronomical fares and cuts services on a whim. In other cities, there are so many different operators the streets are bus-jams, and tickets are not interchangeable between operators, so if you need to change buses and bus company, you must buy another ticket. \n\nTrain privatisation has not worked either, with constant above-inflation fare increases and constant delays and cancellations. \n\nThey should both be renationalized and brought under one body, so that the two modes of transport can have fully integrated schedules and fares, which does not happen under privatisation. Re-nationalisation would also be cheaper as money to fund un-profitable but necessary services would come from money made on profitable services, rather than from taxpayers. Services would be cheaper to run as you will not have to pay shareholders.",
