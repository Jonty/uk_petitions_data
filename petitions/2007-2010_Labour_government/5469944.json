            "background": "The Towns of Portaferry and Strangford are 0.6 miles apart as the crow flies.  To travel the distance between Strangford and Portaferry by road is approximately 46 Miles and takes about an hour and a half by car. The RoadsService in NI currently provides a Car and Passenger Ferry service between the two, but it is notoriously unreliable, meaning that you frequently are subjected to the long drive around Strangford Lough.  A road bridge, if placed sensitively with respect to the Environment, would allow the residents of the Peninsula, and the rest of Co. Down,to have greater freedom of travel, at times when it suits them.\nPlease support this Petition",
