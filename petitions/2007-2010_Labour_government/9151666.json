            "background": "With effect from April 2008, the 10p & 22p tax will be replaced a flat rate 20p tax. Anyone earning more than \u00a318,500 will not be affected but anyone earning less than this i.e. pensioners, low paid etc will end up paying more and this cannot be right. The Government believed that tax credits would fill this void but not everyone is eligible, so we urge The Prime Minster (Chancellor at the time this change was put forward) & the current Chancellor to revert back to the old system or reintroduce the 10p tax so that pensioners and the low paid do not subsidise the rich.",
