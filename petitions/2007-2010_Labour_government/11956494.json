We have had bad and terrible  experiences of calling Home Office information centres concerning our applications made for more than 5 years. We do not get information from them as regards the application. Home office continued to delay making final decision suggests that we have been forgotten. The continue delay is making life unbearable for us, we have lost our jobs because our families have no status to present to our employers.
