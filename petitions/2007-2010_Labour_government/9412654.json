            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many people dont realize that the elderly pay on average \u00a384 pounds a month on community meals or ( meals on wheels)with no help with the cost.\n\nWho else spends 84 pounds a month on TAKE AWAY FOOD.\n\nThey are assessed by Council Officials who deem them incapable of cooking for them selves, and in doing so put a financial burden on the elderly person of 84 or more pounds a month.\n\nHaving to pay this amount of money per month i wonder what they have to do without just to afford this meal per day.I am proposing that Government and Local Councils provide this service free to pensioners.\n\nMost Councils provide the elderly with Frozen Processed Meals which of course are in contradiction to the officials who deem them not capable of COOKING FOR THEM SELVES.Add to this the extra cost of storing the meals in a freezer, the use of gas or electricity to cook the meal, plus for those who need homecare to come and heat the meal.\n\nFreshly prepared meals are best provision to the elderly delivered by meals on wheels staff,  someone checking in on them on A DAILY BASIS as opposed to a delivery of frozen meals ONCE EVERY 2 WEEKS.\n\nIts not just about the cost its about the quality of life.",
