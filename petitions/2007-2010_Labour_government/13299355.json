        "background": "Is it right to allow my child (a British citizen) to be taken from myself (a British citizen), the Mother who has had sole custody since her birth. The high courts are deporting myself and my Daughter within 2 weeks, through this law of the Hague Convention, where there are limited defences, back to the kingdom of Spain, where we have no where to live and no support system. I feel my case was rejected and unheard from the beginning, mainly because i had little time and because i am using legal aid. I have tried everything i can but no one is willing to help. Please help me all i wanted was a fair case with time to defend myself and protect my Daughter. Please help me by signing my petition.",
