        "action": "Allow Council Tenants to use their accumulated right - to - buy  discount to buy any property on the open market.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe that the notion, suggested by an MP recently, to allow Council Tenants to use their right-to-buy discounts for buying any property on the open market is the way forward. Tenants should be able to use their discount to either pay a substantial deposit on an outright buy, or drastically reduce the amount needed to buy a shared ownership property. This would allow tenants a great first step on the property ladder without the restriction of having to buy the house they currently occupy. This would help to eleviate the current housing market slump, and allow Councils to keep and use their properties for the very people who it is intended to help - the low paid and disadvantaged.",
