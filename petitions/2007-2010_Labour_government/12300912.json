The new mersey crossing is to introduce tolls on new bridge and our current bridge.  families and a variety of vital amenities (e.g. hospitals) are spread either side of this bridge.  more than 40% (fig from mersey gateway partnership) of bridge users DO NOT STOP IN HALTON.  As residents and local businesses, we ask the PM to look at keeping the current Silver Jubilee Bridge free for residents and local businesses of Halton.  Don't build a financial barrier in our borough!",
