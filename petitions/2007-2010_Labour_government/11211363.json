The prison term we request is the same as the victim life in prison. never let the people who hurt babies and children be able to come near another child ever again. \n \nWe ask you to keep our streets and homes safe for our children. \nChange the law once a phaedophile. has committed a crime they are never released so they can re-offend.\nlook at the prison sentence of abusers and make them much longer so hopefully it will deter them from committing a crime against an innocent baby or child.",
