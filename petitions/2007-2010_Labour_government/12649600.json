            "background": "Please make it illegal to tether horses on the side of the roads.  Many horses are injured, get tangled in ropes, some have died. One pony was tethered and the rope got tangled round its leg and cut through to the bone. No one checked it and days later it was reported to the RSPCA and was removed for treatment.  They often live without shelter or water until one of their so called 'carers' come to see to them.  They endure the hot weather,wind and rain,  infestation of flies, with no shade to get out of the sun.  Horses should be able to run free and rid them of this terrible existence they suffer. No animal should have to live its life tied up 24/7. If you care, please sign this petition.",
