            "background": "Company Magazine are campaigning with Sian James MP for the banning of unmanned tanning salons using coin-operated sunbeds. The number of skin cancer cases are soaring and now every day a woman in her twenties is diagnosed with the most dangerous form of skin cancer, melanoma. Coin-operated sunbeds come with little guidance and too many young women are getting severely burnt after they spend too much time on the sunbeds because of the lack of advice and instruction in these unmanned salons. Scotland has acted and now we want women in England and Wales to be protected too.",
