        "background": "We are currently being told that the 11 Fire Appliances we park on the Elsecar Heritage Railway land are to be removed in the New Year, due to expansion of the activities. However, the group that hold the Fire Appliances help the Railway members by extinguishing Fires when the Railway Steam Trains alight them, we feel this is an unnaceptable request and the undersigned also believe that the Appliances should remain on site.",
