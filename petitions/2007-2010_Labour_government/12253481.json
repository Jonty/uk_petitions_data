            "background": "British soldiers at a military base in Iraq have a major concern about leaving the country at the end of the month - the fate of their camp mascot.\n\nThe soldiers are worried he will be put down by local Iraqis or killed by other dogs when they return home to Britain.\n\nSandbag protects the men of B Squadron of the Queen's Royal Hussars from stray dogs around their base at the southern port of Umm Qasr.\n\nA soldier said: \"He's very loyal to the troops - if you get mobbed by other dogs, he will literally fight every single one of them. He's a Tyson among the pups.\"\n\nThe soldiers want to bring him back to Britain but discovered it would cost several thousand pounds to put him in quarantine.\n\nSee full story here: http://snipurl.com/fanwd\n\n\nPlease, Prime Minister, waive the quarantine fee, or put up the money, to bring this loyal dog who has been such a comfort to our brave troops, home to Britain.  \n\nIt's the very least we can do to thank them.",
