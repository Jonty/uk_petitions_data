Although I respect the Welsh, and I do believe we should be aiming towards a \"British\" identity, I do not think that this is the best way of promoting this. \nOur flag is symbolic of our national history, and I believe that it is something that we should not make alterations too, unless there is significant change in the state of the Union. As it stands, Scotland and England are still the United Kingdoms, while Wales is a principality.",
