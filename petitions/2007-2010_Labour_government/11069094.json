            "background": "As China becomes more paranoid about the position of Tibet and the Dalai Lama it is important that the free countries of the world exercise that freedom; by fully recognising the work by the Dalai Lama Britain would be making a stand for something worthwhile. China is expansionist and needs, like Russia, to be warned that the 21st centuary is not the time to follow such ideas. This petition represents the absolute minimum that we should be doing at this time.",
