        "background": "Recently, there have been more than 10 crashes along Whitehouse Lane, as drivers have been going at a high, dangerous speed along it. \n\nSome of these crashes have been into fields containing horses, which could either be hit by the car or escape onto the main road.\n\nLuckily, there has been no injuries, however, people and horses walk down this road and there is a chance that they may be hit by a car.\n\n\nI propose that we introduce a speed limit of 30mph for the whole road and speed bumps for just before the turns, where the most accidents occur.",
