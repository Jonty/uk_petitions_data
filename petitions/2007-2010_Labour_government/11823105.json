            "background": "Many factors are causing slowdown in car sales. Innovations in car have been towards comfort, safety and bettering manufacturing techniques but lacked consistent development towards reducing effects on environment. Though there are some benefits compared with older cars. This small difference collectively is large enough to make significant difference. For these reasons, why do you not consider reducing the price of new cars or even selling them at cost price to replace older cars? People who are otherwise unable to afford new cars can swap their old cars for new ones which in most cases will save carbon emission. It can be a stimulus for the industry to become more environmentally friendly. Increase cash-flow for them during this slowdown & benefitting environmentally. Finance can be collected through car tax. The eligibility for benefitting from this can be, for example, any family that owns cars older than 7 years that has higher CO2 emission and own for more than 6 \u2013 12 months. Restrictions could be, say limit of 2 cars per household, smaller cars etc. Details can be worked out with expert feedback. This concept can be expanded into any other industry.",
