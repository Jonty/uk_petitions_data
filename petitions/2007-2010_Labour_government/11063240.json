        "background": "Mark McKelvie, Trinity medic extraordinaire, recently swept aside all opposition to win an episode of the Weakest Link.  However, he has become emotionally detached from his fans and refuses to confide in the details of his triumph with them.\n\nMost petitions on this website involve crazed notions of xenophobia, microwave radiation torture or Jeremy Clarkson, but we ask only for the simple pleasure of hearing our hero admit that he won the Weakest Link.",
