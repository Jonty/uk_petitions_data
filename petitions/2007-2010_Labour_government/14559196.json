            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Highways Agency have proposed to ease congestion on the A1 in the North East of England by narrowing lanes to create three in the space used currently by two, and imposing a 50mph blanket speed limit. \n\nThis solution may have a limited benefit at peak times, but narrow lanes are likely to lead to increased risk of accidents, and at all other times the imposition of a 50mph limit for the sole reason that lane widths have been reduced to save on the cost of a long-overdue widening to three lanes will cause frustration to those using the road and will ultimately lead to further problems of accidents and poor driving.\n\nBetter enforcement of existing traffic law would provide considerable benefits, for example enforcing correct lane discipline and the existing sign-posted ban on slow moving vehicles at certain times.",
