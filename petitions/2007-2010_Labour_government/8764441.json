            "background": "That the Government makes it Mandatory, through legislation within the up-coming Energy White Paper, for all Energy Suppliers to offer their cheapest tariffs to Vulnerable Groups as part of an Energy Assistance Package \u2013 Social Tariffs\u2019.\n\nThat the Government determines the necessary eligibility for the Energy Assistance Package - Social Tariffs\u2019, based on Detailed Evaluation to identify those groups of consumers most susceptible to Fuel Poverty - Vulnerable households are those containing someone aged 60 or over or with a Disability or Long Term Illness.\n\nOnce determined, the eligibility criteria should be adopted by all Energy Suppliers and regularly re-assessed to ensure consumers most in need are included.\n\nThe households in poverty tend to pay more to the Energy Companies for their energy. There is little incentive for Energy Companies to develop needs-led \u2018Social Tariffs\u2019. The Government must force the Energy Companies to offer genuine Fair Pricing for their poorest consumers.",
