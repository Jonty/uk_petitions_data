            "background": "This petition has been set up because More and more Christians in this nation are under attack and are being threatened in their jobs, in their churches and neighborhoods . \nWe feel more and more pressure on us as believers to be silenced. By Islamic, secular and humanistic rights groups.\nThis nation was established with Christian roots and it is our heritage if you choose to look back in history, \nOur Christian heritage has brought change to this nation, hospitals, and schools, anti slavery and community to name but a few.  In addition, we are ignoring and forgetting all of this and much more has been forgotten and it is persecute Christians to keep the political correctness. \nWe can and are offending Christians and God but nothing is said about that.  We Christians cannot speak biblical truths what we believe because they say it offends people and we are losing our jobs when we do and threatened with the Law.   The sad thing is we think persecution only happens in other nations but Christians are being persecuted here in this nation.",
