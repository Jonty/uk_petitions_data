            "background": "Labour are running a farce of a government, the country is getting lead down the garden path by a Prime Minister who nobody wanted and were too weak to stand against him. The data breaches, the high taxes, the inability to understand the implications of the 10p tax band etc, do I need to go on? This government needs to call an election, and let the people decide on who they want to run the country not who the Labour membership want! At least under Tony Blair, we had a Prime Minister who could govern! We need accountability, something which Gordon doesn\u2019t have, and neither will he. This is why I want him to resign his post as Prime Minister.",
