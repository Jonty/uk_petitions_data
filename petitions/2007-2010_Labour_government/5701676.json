Following the huge amount of interest in other creatures found floating down the Thames (namely that unfortunate whale in 2006) this could prove to be a great attraction for visitors and residents alike. At least this one won't die. This request, if granted, would also enhance a sense of cultural and artistic 'entente cordiale' with our French neighbours.",
