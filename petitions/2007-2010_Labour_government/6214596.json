            "background": "The slow erosion of law and order over the last few decades, directly due, for whatever reason, to the Police often refusing to act on civil disturbances before they get out of hand. Yobs and drunks have taken the streets and citizens are too scared to venture out on the streets any more. PM Please ensure law and order is a priority once again. We dont need any more laws, we just need those we have to be enforced. The Police should not be allowed to cherry pick what law breaking they attend or not. Once we have law & order restored crime of all sorts will be reduced, and the yobs borne of a *NO FEAR* culture will learn much needed respect.",
