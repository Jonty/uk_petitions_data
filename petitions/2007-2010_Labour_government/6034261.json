In some areas pavements might be wide enough for a separate cycle lane; but most pavements are not wide enough for this so, again, what about the pedestrians? where would WE go?  I'm fed up with pedestrians' welfare being considered last: waiting ages for it to be safe crossing the road (and often there's only a few seconds before the lights change) especially at cross-roads, roads - but NOT pavements - being cleared of ice in the winter (I realise an accident caused by icy roads would be more serious than one caused by someone slipping on the pavement but why can't they do BOTH while they're at it?  In such conditions I walk at a snail's pace because I'm so afraid of slipping and breaking bones), etc.  Pedestrians cause no harm to anyone - even cyclists can cause injury if there is a collision - and this should be recognised.",
