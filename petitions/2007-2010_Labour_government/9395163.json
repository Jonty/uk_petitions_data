I must have had a moment's madness, no wonder people don't like politicians or politics.   I call upon the P.M to scrap all MPs allowances and pay them the proper going rate for their job. Their salary should be linked to any other civil servant of the same grade.\nBlue collar workers do not get travel  and/or housing allowances yet they still have to travel to their place of employment and homes.",
