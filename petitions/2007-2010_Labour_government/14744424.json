            "background": "Racing Pigeon Fanciers have a legal obligation to vaccinate their birds against paramyxovirus (Newcastle Disease). This is a requirement throughout the EU intended to protect poultry flocks from Newcastle Disease being spread by racing pigeons. Vaccine for this purpose is readily available from chemists etc in England Wales and\nScotland as well as the Republic of Ireland. However in Northern Ireland there is an obsolete regulation dating from 1977 requiring an \"Import Licence\".\nThis means that Pigeon Fanciers either fail to carry out their duty to vaccinate (and put the poultry industry at risk) or act illegally by bringing in vaccine from the mainland UK or Republic of Ireland.This is an absurdity\nwhich is counter-productive and the obsolete regulation should be repealed to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and EU",
