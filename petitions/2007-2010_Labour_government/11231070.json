            "background": "The possible removal of the Harrier V/STOL aircraft from RAF and Royal Navy service is being discussed in the press, with the RAF reported to be thinking of using the Eurofighter Typhoon to replace the Harrier. We believe that such a move would be wrong as the Harrier is:\n\n1. A combat proven, and more cost-effective, close air support platform than Typhoon\n\n2. Proven to be flexible and adaptable to meet unforseen threats\n\n3. An essential component of a balanced air force and navy\n\nSecuring the future of the Harrier force until the new F-35B enters service is the only way to retain these benefits.",
