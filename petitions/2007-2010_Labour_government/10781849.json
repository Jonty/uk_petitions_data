This can be a great source of frustration to those people who feel they have been deliberatly misunderstood. One petition suggesting that the government get out from behind their desks to ask people about democracy responded that the government had produced a green and a white paper on the issue. \nIn the same way as the \"they work for you\" allows rating of responses to parliamentary questions petitioners should be able to rate the helpfulness of the responses they recieve. This will show that the government is genuinely committed to a two way conversation and improve the reponses petitioners recieve.",
