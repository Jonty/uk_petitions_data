            "background": "After the baby p case being brought to the nations attention and hearing his abusers will only receive a maximum 14 years imprisonment, I believe captial punishment should be brought back. It works in the USA and though doesn't prevent the crimes from happening doesn't cost the taxpaper as much in the high costs of prison stays. It also will keep high category offenders from ever being allowed out into public again, thus keeping the streets of britain slightly safer.",
