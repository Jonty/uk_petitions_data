        "background": "I keep seeing an advert saying that the cars of people who fail to tax them will be crushed.  Although I appreciate the loss to the Treasury of not taxing cars I would maintain, VERY strongly, that this pales into insignificance beside the potential harm - up to and including AVOIDABLE DEATH! - of driving while over the drink-drive limit (or the drug-drive limit if one exists), or using a mobile phone (even a hands-free one), or - ESPECIALLY! - texting.  Or ANY activity other than total concentration on the road.  Why are THESE acts not punished by the perpetrators having their cars crushed?  Why is avoidance of road tax the ONLY offence seen as meriting this punishment?",
