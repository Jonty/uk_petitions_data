            "background": "Capitalism is about profit.\nSo what?\nBusiness gets a profit.\nBut profit does not make a happy society.\nWe ask the PM to do the sensible thing now, and end once and for all the money driven society, and replace it with one based upon mutual happiness, where that is the target.\nMoney isn't the root of all evil, the LOVE of it is, so in these times, let business judge its targets by making people happy.\nA better world would result.\nThis is not beyond the PM's remit, the whole ethos of business can be changed.\nThe reason we are more unhappy yet wealthier, is that happiness comes simply from getting what you want.\nNow there is more than ever in the world, we want more than ever. Despite having more, there is infinitely more to want. Adverts encourage this, as does the media.\nThis IS the root of societies ills, more profit will mean more unhappiness as more companies rise up, provide more, and create more want, and ever increasing spiral.\nthat's the diagnosis, now the cure.\nChange the culture.\nIf this is beyond the remit of the PM, what is he here for? To change the culture of course!!",
