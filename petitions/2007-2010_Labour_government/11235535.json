        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Severn Barrage could be harnessed as a social enterprise for Britain to create 40,000 jobs; contribute 10% of UK's 40% renewables & CO2 targets, eradicate fuel poverty permanently & provide the government with an extra \u00a32Billion a year to spend.\nCurrently, almost \u00a34billion is spent per year fighting a losing battle with fuel poverty as energy costs keep rising faster than standards of living. The Severn Barrage will cost about \u00a315 Billion to build, will last 100 years & generate enough electricity to power over 4% of the UK - that\u2019s enough for roughly 5 million homes & more than enough to help the country\u2019s fuel poor.\nThe government should accelerate plans to build the Severn Barrage using public money. And, once the Barrage is completed, instead of giving cash grants to the fuel poor, the government should give them free fuel from the Barrage instead. \nOnce the Barrage is complete, the country would save almost \u00a34billion per year at today\u2019s energy prices &, as only \u00a32billion of that money would be needed each year in repayments of a \u00a315billion loan needed to build the Barrage, the government could effectively end fuel poverty & save \u00a32billion each and every year.",
