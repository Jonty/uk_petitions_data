            "background": "It is a waste treatment technology that involves the combustion of organic materials and/or substances. Incineration of waste materials converts the waste into incinerator bottom ash, flue gases, particulates, and heat, which can in turn be used to generate electric power. The flue gases are cleaned for pollutants before they are dispersed in the atmosphere.\nIncinerators reduce the volume of the original waste by 95-96 %, depending upon composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling. This means that while incineration does not completely replace land-filling, it reduces the necessary volume for disposal significantly.",
