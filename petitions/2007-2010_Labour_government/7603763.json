            "background": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nobel Prize winning and leading researchers into man-made climate change has said that developed countries must cut 25% to 40% of their carbon emission by 2020 to avoid dangerous climate change.\n\nThe EU pushed to try and get this agreed in the recent Bali climate talks, but the USA flatly rejected this. All that could be agreed upon was that \"deep cuts in global emissions\" will be required.\n\nAs one of the worlds largest carbon producers and arguably the country with most political influence, surely the USA has the responsibility to do its bit to try and stop the destruction of our planet.\nAnd as Americas greatest ally (as well as a backer of the IPCC's targets), surely its our responsibility to do what we can to persuade them do the right thing.",
