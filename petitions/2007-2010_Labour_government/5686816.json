            "background": "I beleive a considerable amount of energy could be saved if the temperature at which domestic kitchen kettles switched off was lower. Hot water for cups of tea/coffee, washing up, hot water bottles, and other uses does not require boiling water. I appreciate the technology may be difficult to acheive as it may require water to boil to activate the off switch. Perhaps some expert can confirm the energy needed to raise the temp of water too boiling point. I think i am right in thinking that to raise above boiling requires a significant extra energy.",
