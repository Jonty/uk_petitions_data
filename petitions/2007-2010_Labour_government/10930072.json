The voluntary consent of the human subject is essential.\nThis means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved, as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. \n\nThe passage of such legislation would violate this country's adherence to the code. And we are opposed to it, as we believe you too should be.",
