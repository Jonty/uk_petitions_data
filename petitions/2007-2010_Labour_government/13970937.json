            "background": "Paul Clarke, of Reigate, faces a minimum of five years in prison for a \"strict liability\" offence of possession of a firearm.  More details can be found at http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/news/Ex-soldier-faces-jail-handing-gun/article-1509082-detail/article.html.\n\nMr. Clarke, upon discovering the firearm, phoned a local police station to report the discovery and arrange for it to be handed in.  Upon his arrival at Reigate police station, he was promptly arrested and charged.\n\nWe, the undersigned, wish to see the release of a blameless individual who was just doing what any civil-minded citizen would do upon finding a dangerous piece of weaponry near his home.  We would also like to see some mechanism built into such \"strict liability\" legislation which allows for the application of common sense in such cases rather than blind adherence to a law which can only damage the public's perception of our system of justice.",
