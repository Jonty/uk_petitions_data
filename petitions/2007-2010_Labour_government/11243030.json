            "background": "The manner in which electronic equipment has encroached into pupil's lives seem to have been tolerated and now become excessively endemic. It is my suggestion that if the equipment was banned and a zero tolerance policy was applied as was adhered to in the 90s then competition amongst pupils could be quashed and lessons would not be so easily interrupted.",
