A campaign group - the Hampton Court Rescue Campaign - has been established to oppose the proposals.\n\nWe would like the government to have the development called in and decided at a public inquiry, with the most sensitive part of the site - the Jolly Boatman - acquired in the national     interest using Lottery and other funds.",
