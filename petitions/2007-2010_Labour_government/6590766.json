            "background": "It has become apparent that the recently established and the (controversially) governments profit making department of British Waterways - BWML is dictating mooring charges, even though they maintain their prices are \u201cmarket led\u201d. Their monopoly on moorings on inland waterways is totally unhealthy. Join this petition to express disgust at this company, not having a complaints procedure, having dubious management, being totally unorganised & undisciplined, and most of all having a kind of dictatorship over its customers, knowing they are trapped because of a lack of proper moorings around the country. This has got to change & above all become a totally democratic system of management, caring for the needs of our historic waterways, their residents & their users alike. It is the only way our waterways will survive.",
