            "background": "I request that the British government commence military action against Robert Mugabe and his henchmen immediately. As currently thousands of non Mugabe supporters are either starving, being beaten, or forced from their homes in order for Mugabe's party to take over everything. The situation is absolutely discusting. Mugabe listens to nobody and without force will still be treating the citizens of Zimbabwe like animals for the forseable future.",
