            "background": "On Monday, July 02, 2007 Dave Blundell announced that he had decided to quit playing local football - citing the reason as someone telling him he was old, fat and past it.\n\nWhen Dave Blundell wants to play football, which is most of the time, he is one of the most influential players in the team with a combination of simple passing and fantastic penetrating through balls. Anybody with a knowledge of football who has seen Dave play will realise that he is far from past it and we totally oppose his decision to call time on his career when some of his best days could be ahead of him.",
