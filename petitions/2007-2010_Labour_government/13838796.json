            "background": "This government (and its predecessors) has a shameful track record of making decisions which fly in the face of knowledge and reason. This country consequently needs academics and scientists who are not afraid to provide informed and impartial advice to government ministers. \n\nThe sacking of Professor David Nutt for telling a truth which ministers found unpalatable is unacceptable. This ill-advised dismissal further erodes what little remaining confidence this country may have in its government.\n\nCitizens of this nation are encouraged to vote in favour reinstating Professor David Nutt as head of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.",
