        "background": "Many teachers are concerned about the increasing use of cover supervisors in classrooms across the country. \n\nWe are deeply concerned about this de-professionalisation of teaching, and believe strongly that only qualified teachers should take classes. \n\nCover supervisors and support staff (even admin staff in rare cases) have been 'teaching' our children, and this cannot continue. We care too much about teaching to allow this to go on.",
