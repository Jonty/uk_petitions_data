        "background": "Require the need for Employment attached social housing. That her majesties Government undertake a policy with councils and housing associations, to supply social housing for British residents to migrate to other areas of the UK that require an employer to advertise outside their area. The agreement between councils, housing associations should require them to provide immediate housing for any person who can prove that there employment has lasted or will last longer than three months. At present local authorities are providing social housing for European immigrants/migrants yet this is not applied to a UK born residents and their families.\nThe present waiting list for social housing in the UK for British born residents is 5 to 10 Years. This is why most Employers will not employ future employees from other areas of the UK. But rather Employ European Migrants/immigrants as social housing can be attached to them",
