This could contribute to an increase of problems using computer equipment such as MSD, RSI, WRULD.\n\nIt would be better if the HSE DSE VDU workstation checklist was constructed from the perspective of the person being central, such as:\n1) Person, \n2) Person, sitting on a chair, \n3) Person, at a desk, \n4) Person, using a Video Display Unit (VDU), \n5) Person, using a computer keyboard, \n6) Person, using a computer mouse (or other input devise) \n7) Person, using computer software, \n8) Person, within an office environment.",
