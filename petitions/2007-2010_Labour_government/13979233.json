            "background": "126 professional and highly qualified women have been sentenced to death by the Iraqi government. It is expected that the executions will be carried out before the Muslim feast of pilgrimage (in 2 weeks time). Their only crime appear to being a senior civil servant  under the previous regime. Amongst those to be executed the ex Head Nuclear Energy Centre and the ex minister of Work and Social Affairs. \nBritain has a moral responsibility towards the Iraqi people and the prime minister should act to stop what can only be described as a massacre \nRepeated appeals against the death penalty in Iraq has been issued by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch especially in view of the Iraqi judiciary system being dysfunctional. These women are more than likely had faced unfair trials after which the death sentence was issued. These women appear to be targeted by the current Iraqi government just because they served under the previous regime. This is not acceptable. If they are accused of any crime, they should face a fair trial in the presence of  credible Human Rights  observers or they should be released immediately.",
