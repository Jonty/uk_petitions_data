        "background": "I want the Government to give funding to Councils which will allow Primary Schools to create a St George's day parade in their City or Town. The parade could have floats, dancing and focus around the history of England and its cultures. Involving school children will not only teach them about this countries history and culture but also give a sense of belonging that is so prevalent in other countries and I believe is currently missing from England and the cause of many issues we have. By involving children I believe it will also reclaim Englishness from the nationalistic movements.",
