        "background": "The advisory fuel rates (guidelines on fuel only mileage rates for company cars) were first published in January 2002. It has been possible to use them since then to negotiate dispensations for mileage payments for business travel in company cars.\n\nThey are intended to reflect actual average fuel costs at the time they are set. The aim is to save time for both employers and HMRC by setting out some figures that can be used in the majority of cases. They give employers more certainty about what the mileage rates that they choose to apply mean for tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs).\n\nThe rates only apply where employers:\n\n    * reimburse employees for business travel in their company cars, or\n    * require employees to repay the cost of fuel used for private travel.\n\nThe rates have never been increase yet fuel prices have risen by taxation and cost have risen from around 76p/l to the current 114p/l i.e. around 50% yet the rate has not chaged. Similary purchase and running costs have increased.",
