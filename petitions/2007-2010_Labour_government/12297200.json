            "background": "The world is slipping back into the dark ages where ships loaded with valuables can no longer safely travel the worlds Oceans. In this modern world of Globalisation, I have found the extra insurance is becoming impossible to obtain and this must soon start to fuel backdoor inflation as world shipping costs increase. Surely, living in a world free of piracy must be a priority. It is obvious that countries such as Somalia do not have the necessary infra structure or policical will to eradicate this problem and it requires global co-operation from many nations. I am no expert on the subject but I suspect (as was the case a few hundred years ago) that most of the probems are caused by a very small minority of determined extremists that as soon as the will existed, the British Royal Navy eradicated.",
