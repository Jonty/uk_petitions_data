        "background": "Recently the National Archives released a range of efficiency proposals that will alter part of its operations. One of these is to close the reading rooms on Mondays. It is considered that this idea is a very poorly thought out as it will affect many users such as academics and part and full time students who have commitments on other days and require Monday opening for their research. (Other commitments include jobs that support part-time study, lectures and conferences)  As such this change could imperil both the quality of academic research in this country and students' careers. It is requested that the government block this proposal.",
