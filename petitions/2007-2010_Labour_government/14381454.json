            "background": "The main issue that we should be concerned about with the Burkha is the complete lack of indentity, not only does this act as a barrier to integration it also posses a security threat. These people cannot be identified by the police,by shop keepers or by the general public at a first glance. for instance if you saw an incident where a Burkha wearer committed an offense you will have no way of identifying that person. The truth of the matter is that it would not be tolerated for myself to walk into a supermarket with a mask covering my identity, as quite rightly I should be able to be identified at all times, especially inthe current climate. What would happen if everyone wore a burkha? there would be no need for cctv, driver licenses, passports.The burkha needs to be banned in public places so that everyone can be identified and interact as a community. People can wear whatever they want in the privacy of their own homes but we should impose a law to state that peoples faces should be identified at all times. This is also not anattack on muslims it should apply to all people regardless or religion, it just so happens that the covering of one's identity is a trend found mostly in islam.",
