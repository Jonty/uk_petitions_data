They meet annually and disclose nothing of what has been discussed.\n\nIt has been suggested that powerful figures in Britain have attended this conference.\n\nThe Prime Minister should make a public commitment to never attend this group. If he has in the past, this is the perfect time to admit it to the public and open up as to what was discussed.\n\nThis would go a long way to re-assuring citizens that the Prime Minister has a sincere desire to be honest and up-front in the face of secret organisations operating in this world.",
