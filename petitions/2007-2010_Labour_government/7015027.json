        "action": "instruct the Foreign Secretary to contact the governments of all countries whose traditions mean that parents prefer boys and take draconian action against girls; or where girls/women are punished for behaviour that would be accepted in boys/men.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For instance in India girls are considered undesirable, and many are abandoned at birth, because of the \"dowry\" system and because parents want children who will carry on their name.  But presumably neither the \"dowry\" system, nor only boys carrying on the family name, is set in stone and if these traditions were abandoned there would be no cultural reason to prefer boys/reject girls.  In China, too, boys are preferred (exacerbated by the one-child law); also due to traditions for which there is no logical reason.  It also seems that ONLY WOMEN are victims of so-called \"honour\" killings; I'm not saying it would be acceptable for women to be killed if men were too but, as a woman myself (and a feminist), it angers me that it always seems to be MEN dictating what WOMEN should do and WOMEN who are punished for not complying with these diktats.",
