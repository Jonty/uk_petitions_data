        "action": "Stop the eviction of traveller families from Dale Farm in Essex",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A hundred families at Dale Farm, Billericay, are facing eviction from their homes and from land that they own. Children will be parted from friends and relatives,  extended families torn apart, chalets wrecked and mobile-homes taken away and pounded.\nNo alternative accommodation is being offered.\n The multiple court cases and the cost of the bailiffs will mount up to a bill of at least three million pounds for the taxpayers of Basildon, money which could be better spent on public services rather than uprooting established families from their homes and\ncommunity. \n These families need to stay at Dale Farm to provide a secure future for their children, to ensure their ongoing education and to access suitable medical  care.\n All these things will be unavailable to them if they are forced back onto the road.\n Please help overturn Basildon council's decision.  It is nothing short of racial discrimination of the worst kind, and is a clear breach of human rights.",
