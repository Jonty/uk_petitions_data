            "background": "Fibromyalgia likely affects between 1.2 and 2.7 million people in the UK at least (based on internationally recognised prevalence statistics of 2-4.5% of the population) and myofascial pain likely affects even more people, but doctors receive little or no student training or later education in either condition. This leaves many people suffering unneccessarily, with diagnosis often taking years and little appropriate treatment given after diagnosis.\n\nEvery doctor is likely to see patients with Fibromyalgia and/or myofascial pain during their career and they need to be educated so that they can deal with these patients appropriately.",
