            "background": "The case of baby P highlighted the fact that despite previous reports into children on the 'at risk' register are killed unlawfully child protection officers at all levels still fail to provide children with their basic Human Rights.If following a case such as baby P every child health official regardless of position was put before the courts on a charge of Manslaughter then all child health officials would do their job correctly and put the child first and this would eradicate future child deaths. This legislation must be applied to all children under 5 years old and would recieve the support of all MP's irrespective of party political affilaitions. Baby P must never happen again.",
