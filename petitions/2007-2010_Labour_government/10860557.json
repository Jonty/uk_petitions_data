            "background": "This will give that government a hold over every industry because if the governmental company lowers its prices then all the others will have to as well to stay in competiton. There will be little other governmental involvement, in other words the company will be exactly the same as the other companies apart from the only share holder will be the state, apart from occasionally the prices being lowered. \nProfits should go into funding for political parties so that they dont have to rely on big buisness's for funding. They will then have no obligation to these buisness's.\nOther profits may then go towards enhancing the company or join the tax pot to help pay for things such as the NHS. These companies make huge profits every year, surely these could be better spent than on massive bonuses expensive cars.",
