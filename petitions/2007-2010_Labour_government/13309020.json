            "background": "Brian Haw on the 2nd June 2001 began a peace protest on Parliament Square.  This has continued without break since that date and the initial protest against sanctions of the UK & Government of the USA against Saddam Hussain.  This did not harm Saddam but resulted in the deaths of many thousands of women and children in Iraq as medicines and medical equipment was blocked entry to Iraq by these sanctions.  His peace protest has continued encompassing the many conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere since 2001.  He has survived many attempts to eject his Peace Camp, including an Act of Parliament which was specifically aimed at his removal from Parliament Square, which also placed many restrictions on demonstrations in the Square and its confines.  Brian contested the Act in court and obtained a decision that his Peace Camp was there before the Act and therefore should continue.  His steadfastness and determination to uphold the protest for Peace deserves recognition and we urge that this recognition be his entry into The House of Lords.",
