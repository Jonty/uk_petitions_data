            "background": "Every night huge amounts of energy is wasted in lighting shops, depots and offices for no useful purpose.\n\nThis waste of energy is damaging to the environment and represents a significant financial cost. If there were a night time blackout for lighting emissions (say between the hours of 1am and sunrise) this would save huge amounts of energy and resources.\n \nClearly there will be examples where lighting is required through the night, but where a health & safety or security need is not demonstrated then a \u2018black-out\u2019 practice should be adopted",
