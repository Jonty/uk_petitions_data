            "background": "With relevance to age related costs on activities, transport or services such as personal grooming or restaurants. With the introduction of a clear and concise age limit that works to the benefit of the people and not to the benefit of profit margins of the government or private establishments.\nThe suggested age is 21years old, as this is the age wherein a person can be sentenced as an adult and incarcerated in an adult prison.\nWe feel this is just as it is the age at which maturity can be ensured in the mass populous, and consequences of any actions undertaken by a person would be fully comprehended by the individual, ergo with maturity being the primary guiding factor argued we could ensure a fair system not just for the businesses or governmental agency enforcing the charges but to the people.",
