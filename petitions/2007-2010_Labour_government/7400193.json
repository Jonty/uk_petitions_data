            "background": "We, the undersigned, ask the Prime Minister to tackle the shortage of police officers on our streets by bringing back the famous blue box.\nThe Prime Minister can clearly see the success of the inner London experiment at Earls Court, where the last remaining London Police Box has been an unmitigated triumph with tourists and residents alike.\nIt not only looks good - but creates a \nconstant police presence and a\nfeeling of wellbeing and community security - so sadly lacking on modern streets.\nWe ask the Prime Minister to ensure the Home Office resurrect their plans from the 1990's to re-launch the Police Box with communication and surveillance equipment fit for policing today.\nWith the added technology of CCTV and interactive information systems, the 21st Century Earls Court box should be on our streets country-wide.",
