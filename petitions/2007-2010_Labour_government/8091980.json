            "background": "The emphasis on environmental issues will ensure that public transport becomes ever more important in our lives. In order to promote public transport, it is essential that people feel safe to travel on it. As it stands, there is no visible law enforcement on public transport, apart from trains. The laws and rules of public transport are ignored and the passengers and drivers intimidated. The scope of the BTP should be extended, and their funding and powers increased accordingly.",
