        "action": "to disband the CAFCASS service and restructure the current child access arrangements to take into account the research evidence regarding the importance of children's access to non resident parents.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is our opinion that the CAFCASS service provides little benefit to the resolution of child access disputes.  In fact the philosophy of CAFCASS would appear that they are not interested in child welfare matters, and that children must not see the absent parent if the resident parent has blocked previous contact orders, regardless of what the individual is like or has been like in the past.  This can only lead to emotional harm for any child in the long term as well as the short term whilst not partially in that persons parenting care. We therefore seek to restructure the system to remove CAFCASS from its current advisory role to the magistrates, in order that a decision may be made by the courts (if required) without bias favouring the resident parent's whim to the exclusion of child welfare.",
