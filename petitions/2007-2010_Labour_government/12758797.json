            "background": "We the undersigned believe that the Telegraph was wrong to leak a freedom of information that was going to be released anyway to the public before it should have been, and that their timing did intentional damage to all three major parties ahead of important EU elections which allowed smaller extremist parties to win, newspapers should be more responsisble and should be ashamed of the role they have played in allowing extremist parties to be elected in the UK. We note that people have the right to vote how they wish, but the Telegraph should not have published the stories before the elections, knowing it could influence the results in an unfair way.",
