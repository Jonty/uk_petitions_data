            "background": "Home education in England and Wales is completely unregulated. A parent has the ability to keep their child away from school without any need to even sign a document. I believe that this creates a loophole in society, where children can be kept away from society and not have any contact with other adults and which then enables abuse to take place nad be covered up. This can be seen in the recent case where the child was pulled out of school and kept locked up and abused at home until she died, under the guise of 'home education.'\n\nI am not at all suggesting that HE's are abusers - I am merely saying that without any regulation, there is a definite possibly for home education to be used and abused by anyone wishing to keep their children from being seen in society.",
