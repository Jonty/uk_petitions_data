            "background": "Certain councils overstep their legality by putting up signs \"advising\" that certain actions may lead to prosecution even when the actions in themselves are not illegal. The only aim of these signs is to scare people. This is a way councils have found around central government legislation while they eagerly await the by-law paper which will allow them to make any laws they please even if the new laws are in breach of human rights. \nA representative from a certain council recently responded to correspondence on this issue saying \"It is accepted that as an authority we may be unable to \"ban\" nudism [sic][read \"naturism\"]\nbut we can erect advisory notices to the effect that such actions may \nlead to prosecution by the police. The signs at present are \nsatisfactory in that they achieve what is required.\"\nThis is clearly going beyond their powers and it is not the councils right to lie about what is legal in order impose their authority. The councils are relying on the fear of prosecution to impose their will.",
