        "background": "Over the last couple of years, the discussion of having a new UK national anthem specifically for sporting events has been raised. After having been to the Bill Bailey concert \"Tinselworm\" at the NIA in Birmingham last night, I think we should allow Bill Bailey with his jazz version of God Save The Queen be used at these types of events.\n\nIt especially would work well when it comes to the medal ceremonies.",
