            "action": "take a leadership role in the fight against child hunger by allocating \u00a3100 million in new funding to treat those children suffering from life threatening child hunger (severe acute malnutrition) in key priority UK aid-targeted countries.  We ask that this commitment is made in time to mark World Food Day 2009, with the view to deliver the allocated funding within a three year period.",

            "background": "Child hunger is preventable and predictable, yet 19 million children worldwide face death as a result of a lack of food and adequate nutrition.  This phenomenon has been exacerbated by the food price crisis.  However, the political response to that crisis has, to date, failed to prioritise the provision of programmes to address life threatening child hunger (severe acute malnutrition). \n\nAnalysis of severe acute malnutrition indicates that \u00a3100 million in new, non-emergency International Development aid; is the sum required to treat children in key priority UK aid-targeted countries.  Such action would be a positive development in the government\u2019s response to the current food crisis.  It would also place the UK government in a leadership role in relation to responding to children\u2019s food and nutrition needs in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries. This petition will close within 8 months to ensure government has time to take decisive action before World Food Day 2009 (October 16th 2009).",
