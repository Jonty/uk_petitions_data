            "background": "Pensioners who are 80 years old are supposed to get \u00a3400 Winter Fuel Allowance.However,those pensioners whose 80th birthday falls after the 21st September 2008 will get \u00a3150 less(the same as 60-79 year olds)They will therefore have to wait until their 81st birthday before they get the full \u00a3400.That is assuming that they survive this winter on the reduced payment.\nThis is totally unfair,and I urge the government to give the full \u00a3400 to all pensioners whose 80th birthday falls within that year.Give Pensioners Justice,the least this country can do is to give them ALL enough money to keep warm during the winter.Please support my petition.",
