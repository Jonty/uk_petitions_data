            "background": "Year on year, the number of students wanting to study traditional science subjects such as chemistry at university is going down. Many students blame the lack of practicals they do whilst they at school. Students learn more if they do experiments themselves rather than watching a video of it. If the govt isseriously wants to increase the number of UK bred scientists working in the UK, then they need to start looking at how science is taught at schools",
