            "background": "Different local authorities provide recycling facilities and collections for different items. If large supermarkets within a local authority were only permitted to stock items which are packaged in materials which could be recycled locally, it would improve the simplicity of recycling - for example, all plastic from all products sold at your local xxx supermarket are recyclable. This would in turn enforce manufactures of products such as yoghurt to package their products in more commonly recycled plastics instead of a plastic which can only be recycled in a few areas.",
