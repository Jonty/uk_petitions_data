            "background": "Save Manchester Adoption Society!\nManchester Adoption Society has existed for 44 years helping children find a family.  It is now threatened with closure due to lack of funds.\nAdoption is a vital service.\nMore than 4000 children are awaiting adoption.  We call on the government to give a much needed cash injection of \u00a3500 000 and also increase the fees so that Adoption Agencies can break even.\nEvery child not adopted costs \u00a325000 each for care and much more in long term costs- the real human cost is incalculable.\nIf the banks can be bailed out then this society and others like it can and must be saved.",
