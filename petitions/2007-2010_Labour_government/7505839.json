            "background": "Horses are a constant nuisance on the roads of Britain. Drivers must accommodate horse riders whenever they appear. Drivers have to turn down their stereos and drive on the other side of the road to not offend people who have acres of land to ride on, but choose to use the road unnecerssarily. A ban on horse riding on public roads would make them safer for everybody",
