            "background": "I have been unemployed for nearly 2 years. I have a very neish skill that is grately respected are required within the large banking organisations. I attented an interview with RBS and was offered the job, however, as I have been unemployed for nearly 2 years, I fell into some financial difficulty. RBS have now advised that due to their credit scoring process, they cannot proceed with the placement. I think this is totally contradictory given that the taxpayer/governmant has to bail them out of finiancial difficulty. I urge the PM to consider applying pressure to these organisations to relax their credit scoring matrix whilst in this deep recession as it is unfair to the ordinary person who is unable to be bailed out in this recession!!",
