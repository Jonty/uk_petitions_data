Air shows have a large percentage in the total number of air accidents.\n\nIn these shows especially military air shows. High speed combat aircraft which have standard operating altitudes of a minimum of 5000ft are expected to pull off dangerous maneouvres in a low altitude, leaving very little room for human error.\n\nWhen errors do happen the aircraft can land anywhere from a residential area to a large crowd causing devastation. In which the pilot normally walks away unscathed as they have ejected from the aircraft leaving its collision trajectory unknown.",
