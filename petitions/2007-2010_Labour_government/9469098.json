            "background": "The Hazard Perception Test is of no value at all, learner drivers have already been on the road, by the time they take the Theory test. As a Driver of many years and an Advanced Driver, I have taken the test on the many Pc Cd roms you can buy, I find that they are Totally useless if you spot what is considered a Hazard early and click the mouse you are penalized! Your view is not as you would get in the car. This is nothing more than a money gathering ploy. The Hazard Perception part of the test as it stands is very unfair and should be abolished in favor of a return to the established Theory test. If Drivers cannot spot Hazards They will fail their Driving Test. As that is part of the Road test.",
