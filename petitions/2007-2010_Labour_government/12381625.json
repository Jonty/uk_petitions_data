            "action": "introduce the new ISA subscription limits to everyone in October, not just those aged over 50",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In the 2009 budget by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Darling announced that the annual ISA subscription limit would be raised to \u00a310,200 (of which \u00a35,100 may be cash).  He announced that people aged over fifty would receive the allowance in October, whilst the rest of the population would have to wait until April 2010, therefore losing out on an additional amount of \u00a33,000 that could be saved tax free.  This change also puts a huge administrative burden on the already struggling banks and building societies.  We believe that it is unfair and discriminatory to introduce the higher allowance for one group of the population only, whilst there are many people under fifty who have been saving for their entire lives and use interest to supplement their income.",
