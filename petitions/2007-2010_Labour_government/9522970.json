            "background": "The Government is reported to be considering plans to create a national register of all emails sent, telephone calls made, and internet usage. It is hard to distinguish the creation of such a register from a systematic interception and opening of all private mail, to note the sender, recipient, and date. The creation of such a register could do little more than cause people who had been in contact with a criminal suspect to be investigated themselves, on the basis of association, even if there was no suggestion that those other people had done anything unlawful.",
