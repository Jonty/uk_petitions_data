In France, the Ministry of Justice operate the \"Alerte Enl\u00e8vement\", an emergency message which interrupts TV, Radio, and gets posted on everything from message boards at Railway stations, to electronic Motorway warning signs.\n\nThis system is currently being looked at for extension into Portugal, and the UK could certainly use a system like this.\n\nFor the sake of everyone's children, we need this.",
