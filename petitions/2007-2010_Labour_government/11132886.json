            "background": "The Government currently state that a part-time employee will only receive redundancy pay based on the part-time salary, not taking into account any full-time work that they may have done with the same company.  I am due to be possibly made redundant next year and after 13 years full time, will only receive 14 years of part time pay.  Although nothing may be done by the time my time is up, it may help others faced with the situation in future years.",
