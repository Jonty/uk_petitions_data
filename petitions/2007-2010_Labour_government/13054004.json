A high ranking officer recently said Northern Ireland is the perfect training environment for helicopter crews, we have more then enough inferstructure to cope, so why are we pulling out, who knows? It will cost the government more to move us then keep us here! Goodbye community relations and Northern Irish recruitment for the RAF!",
