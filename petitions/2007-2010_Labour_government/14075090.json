        "background": "The current position at UK border points is that visitors who are allowed to enter the UK who have had to apply for a Visa are not then actively counted back out again when they are required to leave.\nFor example if they were to overstay their visit nobody would actively go to seek them, or even be aware they hadn't left the country.This effectively means that once they are admitted they could stay indefinitely.\nThe USA has a proper system in place for all visitors who enter their borders with visa's and they have, as a result, much better control of their Borders and Immigration Issues.",
