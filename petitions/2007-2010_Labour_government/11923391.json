        "action": "introduce a basic citizen's income (BI) for all working age legal residents of the United Kingdom. In the longer term this would replace all standard benefits, tax credits, tax allowances, and be merged with the minimum income guarantee (MIG) extended to pensioners.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This is an idea presented in view of the current economic situation. It can be funded neutrally, replacing existing tax allowances and the first part of existing benefits and tax credits.\n\nAll citizens would be included, benefiting especially those at the transition point into employment where the benefit/tax credit system  applies punitive marginal taxation rates and requires expensive and unpleasant invasion into the means and lives of citizens.\n\nThe initial level may be less than current benefit such as Job Seeker's allowance, e.g. a BI of GBP 20 to 30 per week, sufficient to be effective, yet easily affordable to introduce.\n\nAdditional funding if desired, e.g. on the order of 15 billion GBP per annum may be provided by money creation, in preference to the present policy of \"Quantitative Easing\". If we are to print money let us put it equally into the hands of all ordinary citizens rather than banks, for each to pay down debt, spend, or save as they choose.",
