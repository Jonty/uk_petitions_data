            "background": "This Government has systematically destroyed the culture and freedoms of this Country. An unelected leader is making decisions without democratic approval of the public. \n\nThe public are manipulated through \u2018fear\u2019 and \u2018bullying\u2019.  The Terrorism Act has been abused to the point it no longer holds any credence. The Police are being used as political puppets. The bureaucracy that public departments work under is so stringent that they can no longer function effectively. \n\nSocial Services is more worried about ticking boxes than caring for vulnerable children. The NHS is more worried about targets than patient care. Schools are more worried about stats than education. Civil servants have now lost the right to approach elected MP\u2019s without fear of criminal proceedings. MP\u2019s are losing the right to inform the public when flaws in the system are known. \n\nI petition this Government to stand down and call a general election with immediate effect. \n\nWe, the people of this great Country, deserve better.",
