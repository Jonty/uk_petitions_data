I am sure that if you or I were caught defrauding the government for thousands a simple \"I'm Sorry\" would not be sufficient to close the matter. Let\u2019s stand up to these bullies from the top whose motto surely must be \"don't do as I do as I say\". \nWe want criminal charges to be brought against all MP's who have abused the system as well as them paying the monies back and being fined.",
