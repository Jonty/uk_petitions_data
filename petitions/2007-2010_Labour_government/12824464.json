        "background": "The Carter report proposes replacing AM and FM radio by digital broadcasting.  This proposal appears to place no value on the quality of the service delivered by FM.  It would also require the owners of radio sets to replace not only fixed radios but also portable radios and radios built into other devices such as MP3 players, alarm clocks and cars, which could amount to a significant cost to the owner.  Although this change may seem similar to the change to digital TV, in fact it is quite different for these and other reasons.  The needs of the consumer are being ignored in the proposals.  We call for FM radio to be maintained as a service in the UK for the foreseeable future",
