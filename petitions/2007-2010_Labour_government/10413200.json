        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We are calling for the government to scrap and replace all of the \"cheesewire\" central reservation barriers throughout the UK due to the huge number of fatalities and extremely severe injuries of Motorcycle riders and other road users. These barrier systems are only implemented because of a slightly reduced cost over the massively safer and easier to install \"concrete wall\" type central reservation. Fatalities and near fatal injuries have skyrocketed on roads where these cost cutting measures have been implemented. There is no excuse in reducing short term financial costs when in the long term the costs are far higher to the victim, their families and friends, the people they interact with, their collegues and employers and even the people whose job it is to collect the victim from several differant parts of the carrigeway.",
