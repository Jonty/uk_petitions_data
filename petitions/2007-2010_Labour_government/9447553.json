            "background": "With fuel prices at an all time high and the costs of rail season tickets also scraping the skies, the proportion of the average working Briton's wage that is sapped just for the priviledge of getting to work is at a correspondant high. At present, taxation rules do not allow for the costs of commuting to a permament place of work as a tax-deductable expense.\n\nAllowing the re-claiming of income tax set against travel costs for the employed both makes complete sense from a logical point of view (it IS an expense related only to the employment), but also from a social and financial stand-point.\n\nThe undersigned petition the Prime Minister to pass this matter to the relevent comittee for a report to Parliament and to give the matter due consideration.",
