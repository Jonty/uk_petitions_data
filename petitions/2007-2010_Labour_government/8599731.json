        "background": "The government seems to be considering charging all smokers \u00a310 a year to apply for a licence to buy ciggarettes.\n\nForcing people to apply for licences to smoke will not stop people smoking, it will just annoy and infuriate them.\n\nWhat information would we be expected to fill out to apply for one on these so called \"complicated forms\"?\nMany of us would surely just get our friends with licences to buy them for us.\n\nIt does not seem like a legitimate plan to make people quit, more like a shameful new way to just force more money out of people, and persecute smokers. There will never be licences to buy alcohol or unhealthy foods, so why should there be one for smoking?\n\nThe smoking ban encourages people to quit, if you are willing to stand out in the traditional English weather, a form will not stop you. Focus on stopping another unhealthy habit for once.",
