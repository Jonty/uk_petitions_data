            "background": "As koi carp and racing pigeon shows and sales are still permitted to take place this is obviously not a welfare issue. Biosecurity is always factored in as the shows/sales are under veterinary supervision. Bird shows and sales by their very nature help people to understand and appreciate the needs of pet/show birds, but this is not the case when anyone can buy a bird from a pet shop with no knowledge of how to care for them. I own a rescue parrot who was mistreated as the original owner had no knowledge or understanding of her. It has taken two years to gain her trust and this is what needs to be addressed and not to punish the people who have the birds welfare at heart. I wholeheartedly agree with Andrew Meads original petition that this ban is to the detriment of society in general and birdkeepers in particular.",
