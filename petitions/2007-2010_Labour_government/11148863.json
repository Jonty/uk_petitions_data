In fact it\u2019s based on archaic Turkish law which allows the removal of\nproperty ownership rights from both Cyrus and foreign nationals. It works like this: The developer builds a property, sells it, is paid in full and releases the property without providing final title deeds. They are only issued by the local authority if the developer applies for completion and has met all of the planning requirements for the project. Until they are issued the developer can use the land as collateral for further loans! The Cyprus Land Registry figures show there are 29,949 transfers of Title Deeds to foreigners still pending and are only being issued at the rate of 1,600 a year! Lots of UK citizens, many of whom are ex-service personnel and pensioners, are at risk of losing their home if a developer goes bust, or simply chooses not to repay loans on the building land! It is unjust!",
