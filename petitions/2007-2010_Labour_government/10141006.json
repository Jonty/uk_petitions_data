As a British citizen, I find it OFFENSIVE to be claiming from the British Welfare State, using British public services whilst waging terror on fellow subjects, heckling senior politicians and declaring the Head of State \"an enemy\".\n\nWe the undersigned all want respect for differences, freedom and religious tolerance, but urge the P.M. to establish a statutory mandate to deal with those who apparently do not.",
