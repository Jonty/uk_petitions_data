            "background": "A proposed cycle route is planned between Lord Street and the playing Fields along Portland Street.\nTraffic calming measures are to be implemented in parallel with this preposed cycle route.\nThe residents of Portland street are totally opposed to the creation of traffic calming measures along this street.\n \nThere is a traffic calming system currently in place along Kensington Road in Southport already, which does not \"calm\" traffic in the slightest.\nThis system is quite ugly and completely out of character for a Victorian seaside town.\n\nThe residents of Portland Street believe traffic calming measures will devalue the property along Portland Street, by turning a characteristic seaside street into something more resembling a \"council estate\"\nWe welcome Sefton councils estimated compensation value for the properties of Portland Street.",
