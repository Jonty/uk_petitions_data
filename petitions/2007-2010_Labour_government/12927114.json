            "background": "i am a 30 year old male and have 3 girls aged 10, 4 and 2 years old, the mother of my kids meets her father at her sisters house with my 3 children.\n\nher father is a child sex offender and a physcology report indicates he will remain a sexual danger to children for the rest of his life, i have begged the social services to ban the mother taking my children anywhere near him, they have turned round and saids to me it's ok, well it's not ok, why give him the opportunity ?\n\nI feel like i am up against a brick wall, i ask that you sign this petition to ban this peadophile from being allowed anywhere near my children\n\nthink of this, how come a person who abuses pets is not allowed to have pets in the house but someone who abuses children can have children in the house ???\n\nthank you",
