            "background": "The human rights act clearly is not working for the UK.  Crimanals are not learning from the current system, but only finding ways around it.  They are enjoying their time in prison, which they are finding it hard to get into these days.  Prisoners are getting too comfortable where they are because of the luxuries they are given, many criminals commit crimes just to get back in.\n\nYou would not beleive how much harm a person has to do now days in order to be put behind bars, we aren't safe and our children aren't safe.\n\nThe Human Rights Act has led us to a dangerous stage where nobody fears the law anymore, which is the perfect starting point for the law system collapsing and crime becoming out of your control.\n\nLook at the UK, it is not safe, crime is a common way of life to many people.  Visit a prison to see for yourself why criminals like prison and will do anything to stay in there.\n\nThe Human Right Act has failed, crimanals have it wrapped around their little fingers.  We need something stronger to protect us.",
