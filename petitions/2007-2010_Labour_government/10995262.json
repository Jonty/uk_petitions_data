            "background": "Insurance premiums for new drivers are ridiculous at the moment. Over double what it would cost a girl of 18. Why is that? It is because people who go around doing skids in McDonalds car park give good standing young men a bad name. Under part V S.45 Sex Discrimination Act 1975 states it is not unlawful for insurance companies to set their own policy. I beg this article of the statute be amended. \nFurthermore, high insurance for young men does not fulfill its aim to keep us off the road, instead it does the opposite, many take the chance. This discriminatory policy increases crime and is a threat to insured drivers who's premiums are augmenting in order to meet the number of uninsured drivers on our roads. So it is time something is done about this. Perhaps at least take into consideration other factors, for example, someone who passed their driving test first time should get a lower premium. Character assessments on people. There is no fairness and equality in car insurance. I feel it is the ethical responsibility of the government to impose on insurance companies and  to demonstrate \"fairness\" and \"justice\" and \"equality\" which a democracy boasts.",
