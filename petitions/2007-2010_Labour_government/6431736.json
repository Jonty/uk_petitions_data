            "background": "The Education Act 1994 requires Students' Unions to be inclusive and generally requires all affiliated bodies to be open to any student. While this is a reasonable general requirement, it is inappropriate that it should require religious bodies to consider for leadership those who may not subscribe to their religion.  Employment law allows for certain exemptions within Religious Discrimination legislation, for example allowing churches to require that any candidate for pastoral leadership be of their faith.  It is appropriate that other kinds of religious institution, such as Students' Union groups, should have a similar exemption.",
