        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I recently read a letter saying that cyclists should be insured \"if the Government and police are going to allow them to keep using footpaths\"(!).  As a pedestrian I sincerely hope this is NEVER going to be allowed or that it is not now allowed. Even now, however, I often see people cycling on pavements; I'm fed up with having to move out of the way to avoid impact when it is THEY who are doing wrong and I'M simply exercising my absolute right to walk on the pavement.  FOOTpaths are paths for FEET; NOT wheels even if there are only two of them. \n\nCycling on the footpath can be extremely dangerous for pedestrians as shown by the recent case of a young woman KILLED by a speeding cyclist who told her and her friends to get out of the way because he wasn't going to stop(!).  In my opinion he should have received a gaol sentence but apparently there is no specific offence of causing death by careless/dangerous cycling (as, of course, there should be).  \n\nPavements are for pedestrians; NOT wheels of any sort (except push-chairs and wheelchairs).  If cyclists feel unsafe riding in the road they should WALK on the pavement wheeling their bikes next to them.",
