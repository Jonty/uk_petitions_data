Laws against fly-posting, parking on grass verges, etc. etc. seemed to be ignored - the council will refer you to the police and the police will refer you back the council.\n\nLaws which are not enforced are meaningless - councils put up notices threatening large fines for breaches of by-laws but as these seem never be to enforced, people simply ignore them. \n\nThese by-laws either need to be enforced properly, and the central government make it clear who has responsibility for them and make that organisation take them seriously, and make it easy for for people to contact them to report them, or else they should be repealed because they serve no purpose.",
