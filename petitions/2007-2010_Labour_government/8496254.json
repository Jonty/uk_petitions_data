        "background": "Basically I think it is really disgusting that if you were the innocent victim in a car accident, you still have to pay more for car insurance when it comes to renewal. \nSurely it is wrong for us to have to pay for someone else's mistakes. We can not predict someone is going to crash into our cars etc so we have no way of preventing it.\nThe person who was in the wrong and caused the accident should have to pay the price, not the innocent victims.\nI am trying to get this changed as it affects everyone, so please sign this petition.",
