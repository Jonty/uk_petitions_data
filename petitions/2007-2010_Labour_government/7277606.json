            "background": "This petition is for the government to reduce the fuel duty for UK based Hauliers to the same level levied against farmers for red diesel. \nAdministritive details would need to be worked out, i.e. must be a UK owned, based and registered haulier etc. \nThere would be a reduction in duty received but this could be recouped from other areas, i.e. increase in road fund licence for domestic vehicles, a levy placed on non UK hauliers and increased fines for motoring offences.\nThere are a number of benefits for this:\n1, This may actually help with inflation (lower distribution costs thus reducing the price on the shelf) \n2, The impact of the high oil prices would be less so and therefore reduce the chance of further UK hauliers going under.",
