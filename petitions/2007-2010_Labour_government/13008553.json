            "action": "introduce legislation requiring manufacturers to provide easily refillable inkjet printers",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The slogan 'Buy an inkjet cartridge and get a free printer' is not far from the truth. The reason is that manufacturers employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to ensure that only their highly overpriced replacement cartridges can be used in their printers. The result is that hundreds of thousands of servicable printers are scrapped every year in the UK because it is more economic to buy a new printer than replacement cartridges. This wastage is environmentally indefensible. Legislation should be introduced requiring manufacturers to provide simple ink tanks on their printers which can be filled with ink from a bottle for less than 10% of the cost of current replacement cartridges.",
