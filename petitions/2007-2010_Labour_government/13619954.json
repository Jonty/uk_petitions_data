            "background": "I have been running an After school Club for twelve years. Parents ask us to collect their children from school and look after them on their behalf. I believe that after being at school all day the children need to be able to unwind, relax, have fun, and play with their friends.They should do this in a safe, welcoming, happy environment with committed, trusted, qualified staff. This is what the parents want. I do not believe that staff should have to deliver the EYFS learning and development requirements demanded by Ofsted. As the club is a secondary setting, staff should not be expected to observe, assess, record and plan an individual child's development. This already takes place all day in the school environment, and I think secondary settings should not be inspected on their delivery of the Learning and Development requirements.",
