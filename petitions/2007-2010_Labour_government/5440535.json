        "background": "The monarchy's finances are not scrutinised by parliament or routinely audited by the National Audit Office.  Campaign group Republic estimates the total cost of the monarchy to be \u00a3150m a year, rather than the \u00a337m quoted by the palace.  The issue is that these figures are not clear and transparent, and that there is not independent and transparent auditing done.  If we're to have a debate about the nature and cost of the monarchy, compared to European republics which cost between \u00a31m and \u00a310m a year, we must have clear and credible budgets agreed and scrutinised by parliament.",
