Whilst the large out of town superstores have no trouble with their delivery vehicles have space to unload, the smaller town centre shops depend on smaller lorries and vans for their deliveries. While some towns have addressed this problem adequately, many have not and town centre delivery drivers every day have to run the gauntlet with target driven traffic wardens. Also, anyone other than bona fide commercial drivers using these bays should be heavily penalized.",
