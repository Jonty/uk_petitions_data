            "background": "The National Youth Service will help to structure the life and attitude of our young people. The increasing level of gun and knife crime among young people calls for radical action. \n\nThe National Youth Service should be run by the Army and the Police. It should include low key military training, police training, community services, antisocial behaviour training sessions etc. Training sessions should last for 6 months and should be for young people after completing primary school and for another 6 months for those who have completed secondary school after year 11 before going to higher institutions.\n\nAppropriate Community and Military training can affect or change attitude and behaviour. \n\nThank you",
