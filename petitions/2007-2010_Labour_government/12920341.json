I know this because my local supermarket does just this. I urge the Prime Minister to allow towns that have only one free slot for a supermarket, as it were, to open the competition up for others. This would be especially useful in my town, where nearly all of the local businesses are owned by millionaires, who are unlikely to be affected by the competition.",
