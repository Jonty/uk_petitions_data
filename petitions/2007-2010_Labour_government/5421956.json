        "background": "Overstay your time on the parking meter? Ticket blown off of the windscreen? Visitors parking permit incorrectly filled out? Many local authorities across the UK will still tow your car away for all of these very minor \"offences\" and charge you anything up to \u00a3200 to get it back.\n\nThis can only be a money making scheme for the local authority. There is absolutely no valid reason to remove a car in these circumstances.\n\nIf your vehicle is badly parked and blocking the road or pavement then perhaps towing away is more reasonable but otherwise why tow when a ticket is a punishment more suited to the \"crime\"\n\nWe petition the Government to legislate as necessary to end the practice of towing cars away and let the punishment fit the crime!!",
