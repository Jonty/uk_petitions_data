            "background": "Organised religion breeds hatred towards certain people, especially gays and women, and people with differing opinions.  It also discourages independent thought and has been responsible for causing more wars than anything else in history.\n\nFaith based schools frequently teach one opinion, and ignore other opinions and certain parts of science.\n\nEveryone is entitled to their own idea of how/why we are here. Organised religion doesn't ask you what you believe though - it tells you what to believe.",
