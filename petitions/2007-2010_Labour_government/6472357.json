            "background": "In the central reservations of motorways can there be some sort of introduction of higher barriers so that people cannot see over them to the other carriageway. The reason is if there is an accident on one carriageway this has a knock on effect on the opposite carriageway as people are slowing down to see what has happened, commonly known as 'Rubber Necking' or 'Swan Necking'. Surely this would then help to reduce a number of incidents.",
