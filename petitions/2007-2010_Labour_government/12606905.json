Failure to pay Capital Gains Tax on the sale of her 2nd property which would have been left unpaid had it not be leaked by The Telegraph.\n\nShe has allowed maternity wards to close in Salford hospitals which means there will be no more Salfordians born which is tantamount to ethnic cleansing.\n\nShe's allowed investment to be poured in to the already lucrative parts of the city while other areas are desparate for assistance.",
