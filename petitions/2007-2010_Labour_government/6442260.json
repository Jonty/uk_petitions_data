            "background": "At the moment alcohol is relatively cheap. This makes it fairly easy for people to get hold of. If it is taxed a lot more than it currently is (at least 30% more tax if not more) then no form of alcoholic drink will be cheap. If alcohol is expennsive most people will not have the money to be able to buy lots of alcohol in one night. This will make it a lot harder for people to abuse alcohol as they simply wont have the money to be able to buy mass quantities of it. This is the only true way we or any other nation could put its foot down on binge drinkers.",
