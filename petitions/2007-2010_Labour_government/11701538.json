        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I am on income support while training and i very much need my children to recieve free school meals as i can't afford them, nor packed lunches. Both my children have had free school meals and would not eat them as they were 'horrible'. They were infact being cooked and then transported from another school. I did persevere for months, but it was affecting their learning in the end as they were hungry, so I am now having to buy Packed lunches for them,which is causing me to struggle even more.\nI would like the government to give  the money for the free school meals which my children, and others, are not recieving, so as to use the money to buy them their packed lunches with.\nI believe that if the Government did this then lots of parents would be better off, as my children are not the only ones who refuse to eat their free school dinners which is therefore affecting them physically, emotionally and also their learning potential. Also there would be a huge saving with regards to the amount of dinners needed and staff needed to cook them in schools.",
