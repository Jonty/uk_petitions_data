        "background": "I am sick of young offenders getting off lighty, just because of their age. Im tired of criminals getting released early because our prisons are full. The Armed Forces however need all the help they can get. Insted of letting young offenders of the hook and releasing criminals early due to room shortage, i say give them a good year or so of National Service. That will drum some respect and responsibility into them. \n\nThis will work because...\n\nThe Armed Forces get free Labour.\n\nThe Criminals get free training, and gain more respect, self responsibility and disciplne.\n\nThe community get a more qualified and responsible member of the community back with a brighter future ahead of them.",
