This cannot any longer be \"apparent\" it has to be \"real\" as this deception is costing us dear as a Nation. \n\nA public enquiry at public expense, with proper proortionate remedy/punishment should ensure that in the same way that an average member of the public would be treated, so must the individual/public body.\n\nThis goes for lowly parish Councils and Councillors right up to the highest ranking police officers, judiciary and all government ministers.\n\nNo immunity should exist any longer and all must receive remedies that the average person would receive in a situation which could be comparable in law. The individual discovering the current inequity can no longer be expected to self fund correction of the weakness of this system.",
