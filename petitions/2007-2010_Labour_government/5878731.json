This petition requests the sensible encouragement of alternative 'greener' forms of transport such as two wheel vehicles should be encouraged.\n\nCurrently there is little incentive to encourage commuters to travel into London on two wheels. Parking is too expensive to justify the additional road accident risk.\n\nTwo wheel vehicles include motorbikes & bicycles.\n\nSignatories should recognise that vehicle or bicycle security & safety are separate issues which are being addressed by other petitions.",
