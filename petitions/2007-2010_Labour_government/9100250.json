            "background": "As a hasty response to an appalling act in 1987, the use of firearms was banned. This included licensed gun clubs.\n\nWe propose that licensed gun clubs be allowed to re-stock all weapons for use within the club. There is NO reason for home ownership but shooting is a hobby that has been banned un-necessarily.\n\nThe use of the weapons at the club could even be restricted to suitable acceptance by police consent.\n\nFrom a sporting perspective, UK residents aren't allowed to practice locally for worldwide events.\n\nIt is now 20 years since the Firearms act was changed and we are still unable to pursue a sport based on an irrational response.\n\nThe Hungerford Massacre was an appalling event but shooting as a sport, in controlled clubs should not remain to be outlawed. THERE SHOULD STILL BE NO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP.",
