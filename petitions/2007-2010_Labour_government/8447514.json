I ask the Prime Minister and His government to reduce funding to the NHS, Schools and Local Councils. Make them reduce the amount of needless staff and resources. This will lead to a reduction in our taxes especially our extortionate council tax.\nWe want lower taxes and public workers to actually earn their money. Pouring endless amounts of cash into a system does not mean it will become better or more efficient.",
