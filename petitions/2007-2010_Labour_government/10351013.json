I refer to the accommodation (most of) the Armed Forces live in. Build a furnished en-suite apartment block for all MPs to live in and provide catering. If an MP chooses not to live in this secure all inclusive building, they can pay out of their own pocket, with no expenses.  This would be modelled on the Armed Forces accommodation, paying an abated charge towards the upkeep. MPs are public servants, not entrepreneurs. If it is good enough for the Armed Forces, is it not good enough for MPs?",
