            "background": "The current Anti Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) is not working and should be changed to Incompetent Parent Control Order (IPCO) and should differ from a Parenting Order in so much that it could be issued by a police officer or PCSO. Children do not ask to be born and have no built in discipline at birth, so it is clearly the parent(s) who must take full responsibility for a child up to 16 years of age. Failure to do so, should result in the order being placed on the parent(s).  Protocol must be easier to issue an IPCO than an ASBO and be allowed to be lifted once the parent(s) show a degree of control and guidance over their wayward young person. Failure of the child to improve should develop into a Parenting Order being issued.",
