            "background": "To revise the licensing act 2003. Since the new licensing laws came into play we have not seen a reduction in binge drinking, crime or anti social behaviour, infact it has increased. Prior to the Act of 2003 people living in our city centres knew that come 2.30, the night was over and we could go to bed to sleep. The introduction of later licenses mean we find it extremely intrusive to our lives.\n\nMany residents with our inner city apartment complexes are now at the mercy of the license where many late licenses have been granted until the late hours. In Birmingham's B5 community there are within a square mile around 65 licensed establishments with around 50% having a license permitting the sale of alcohol after 3.30 - This means no sleep for residential communities. The petition is to address the lack of guidelines. We ask the Prime Minister to apply a rule that means any establishment within a 1/4 mile of a residential complex is not permitted to sell alcohol or play music after 12 during the week (mon-Thu and 2.30am Fri and at weekends. With a 11.30 midnight limitation on Sundays.",
