            "background": "Rubbish is actually a very valuable commodity which, with a bit of imagination, could be used very constructively. To tax landfill is grossly unfair, because not only do we need landfill to reclaim valuable land which is unusable until it is made level by landfill, there is also good deal of erosion of land by sea encroachment which could be prevented, and much coastal land reclaimed. Hardcore, building rubble and topsoil is especially valuable in this regard, but all rubbish could be compacted and used as an infill between a dyke made of rock/concrete and the shoreline. Also many low lying areas currently at risk of flooding can have their elevation increased with processed and compacted rubbish. So rather than taxing us on rubbish the Government should recognise it for the valuble commodity it really is, and use the income derived from its constructive use to reduce other taxes.",
