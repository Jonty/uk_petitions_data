However, in this modern multi-cultural Britain it seems to be something that is OK to be walked all over as \"We wouldn't want to offend anyone\". Well guess what, you offend me and countless others by telling me I can't celebrate the creation of the universe by his noodly appendage or even mention it. I bet nobody will ever ban Divali from being celebrated. Belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the most important choice everyone needs to make. Full stop. Wars will come and go, as will Governments and rulers. One thing is certain: Death. Another certainty is that it can be overcome by beer volcanos and a stripper factory. For FSMs sake, let us tell people about it and remember Him at every opportunity we can. Please",
