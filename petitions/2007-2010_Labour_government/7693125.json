            "background": "Thousands of people every year are injured in attacks by dogs. But it's not the dogs that are entirely to blame. I estimate that 90% of dog owners have not got their dog properly trained and it is therefore out of control. How many people with dogs do you see where the animal is pulling the dog owner along? A dog out of control, no matter what the breed, is a dangerous dog. Dogs in public must be muzzled as many owners like to let their dogs run free. There is no telling when an animal might turn. Safety has to come first. The public must be educated on what to do when a dog approaches them, especially if it growls at them. People must remember never to turn their backs on a dog and never to run away from it, school is the best place to start this education.",
