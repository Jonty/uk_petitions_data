        "action": "take the power away from banks and give us the right to have our wages and benefits paid in cash if we want.",

        "background": "In the current financial crisis our taxes have been used to 'bail out' many banks in the UK. These banks are now increasing interest charges on loans and credit cards making it harder for us all to make ends meet. I believe that if the power was taken away from the banks by giving us the choice of how we are paid, rather than forcing us to have our wages and benefits paid into bank accounts as we currently are, then the banks would have to work harder to keep us as customers. At the current time they have a monopoly on our money and don't have to work to keep us, hence the high charges and poor service. I call on the British Government to give us the choice of how we are paid, take away their control of our money, and let this country grow again.",
