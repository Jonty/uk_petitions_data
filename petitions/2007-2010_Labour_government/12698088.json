            "background": "This petition calls on the government to bring in legally binding legislation abolishing all 'Faith Schools' \n\nThis would allow schools to retain the right to teach about religion in schools should they so choose, but this must be done in a fair and balanced way with no bias or extra attention given to any specific religion.\n\nThis is not anti-religous, but is intended to increase social cohesion, and better understanding of different cultures and religions through the encouragement of a more equal, and unbiased way of teaching religion in the education system.",
