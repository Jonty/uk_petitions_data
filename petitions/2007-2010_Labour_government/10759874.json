            "background": "Across the USA there has been an introduction of 'claw' vending machines, where customers can for a small fee attempt to grab a live lobster.  If caught the restaurant boils the lobster for the 'lucky' customer. I consider this form of 'entertainment' to be both cruel and demeaning to crustaceans and any other animal that may be put into this situation.  This type of machine has no place in a modern, civilised society.",
