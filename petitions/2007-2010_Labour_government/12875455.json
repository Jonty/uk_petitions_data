            "background": "Public sector pensions are unaffordable and are storing up massive problems for the future in terms of cost.  The vast majority of private final salary schemes are now closed, the public schemes should be too.  Let's close the over generous public schemes and use the money for better purposes like creating jobs and getting out of recession.  Public sector jobs are safe and well paid without the over the top pension provision.  Let public sector workers (including MPs) have defined contribution pensions like most in the private sector have to.  For public sector employees reading this think about the future cuts to your jobs to reduce anticipated debt during the next parliament, surely giving up some pension entitlement would be better than a significant number of you losing your jobs?",
