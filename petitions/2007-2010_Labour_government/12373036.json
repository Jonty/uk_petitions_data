            "background": "This petition is to stop the passing of the telecoms package within this country. I have serious concerns  that the changes that the European Parliament is proposing will adversely affect business in the  European Union.\nI understand that the European Parliament is proposing to include changes to the law which will affect my access to the Internet, and which may limit, restrict or place conditions on my ability to access websites and services. The changes in the law that the European Parliament is  proposing will permit my broadband provider to offer me a limited, restricted or conditional service. My concern is that such changes will kill the life of the Internet as we know it, and could have serious, detrimental economic impact on Europe\u2019s economy.",
