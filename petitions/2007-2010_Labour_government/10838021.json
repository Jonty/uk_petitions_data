            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If the tax burden on the average person was decreased then both collectively and individually people would have a greater ability to absorb the above inflation price rises in utilities, fuel, food, public transport, council tax, etc. In addition when people have more money to spend they will consume more thereby mitigating the impact of the current financial situation on the economy. These tax cuts are requested in addition to current government measures since those currently implemented by the government will only help a minority of the population and in many cases overlook those who will be hardest hit by the potential recesson, whilst tax cuts across the board (for example a reduction in fuel duty) will have a knock on effect which will help the majority of the population.",
