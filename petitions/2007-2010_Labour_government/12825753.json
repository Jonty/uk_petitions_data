            "background": "Many parents, whose children are not automatically entitled to free school transport, would be happy to pay a reasonable charge in order that their children could access existing school transport services.  However, many local authorities do not allow this and would only provide concessionary passes if spare places are available.  The numbers of children travelling by car to school often causes traffic jams and accidents in addition to increased pollution and road damage.  It also means that more petrol/diesel are used - and these supplies are depleting rapidly.",
