        "background": "The proposed Infrastructure Planning Commission will result in the loss of opportunity for those affected by major infrastructure projects to make their views known in any meaningful way. There is no excuse for any inquiry to involve seven hundred people giving evidence over four years as was the case at the Heathrow Terminal 5 inquiry.  Instead good independent inquiry management can and should ensure that common objections are distilled down to a few groupings who could then present their cases in a more constructive manner.\nThis was the case at the recent Stansted inquiry which lasted less than three months. The role of the independent inquiry manager is crucial and should be enhanced to ensure cost effectiveness whilst preserving the right of objection.",
