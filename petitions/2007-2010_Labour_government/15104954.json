        "background": "The United Kingdom has one of the greatest number of traditional customs in the world. These are an important part of our culture and deserve protection. UNESCO recognises this and has a convention on World Intangible Cultural Heritage. The annual custom of Cheese Rolling has been cancelled. This is  symptomatic of a culture in which we are losing our national heritage. The United Kingdom has not ratified the convention; therefore many of our traditional customs are increasingly threatened. If something is not done we will eventually lose most of our customs and traditions, and the world will be a poorer place. The United Kingdom should therefore ratify the convention",
