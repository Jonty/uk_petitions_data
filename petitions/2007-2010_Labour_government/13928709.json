        "background": "The DWP is fast becoming notorious for making unfair decisions about individual claims for disablity benefits.  Their interviews are conducted by people with no medical understanding. let alone equality/respect training.  \nThis leads to unfair and incorrect decisions about individual claims.\n\nThe humiliation (of personal and accusatory questioning) suffered by genuine claimants is bad enough.  For those with mental health issues, the stress and fear of these interviews can make the situation unbearable.  \n\nThe prime minister should order an end to the practice of interviewing people with mental illness immediately to prevent further distress and deterioration of health.\n\nAssessments for vulnerble individuals should be based on medical statements and not on face to face interviews.",
