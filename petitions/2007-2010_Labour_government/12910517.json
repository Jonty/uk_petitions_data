            "background": "Li Zheng is a Chinese national claiming asylum in the UK because she is a member of a group persecuted within her homeland. She could, if deported, face arbitrary detention, torture, or even execution.\n\nAs of Friday, 3 July 09, Ms Zheng has again been detained when reporting to the UKBA, as required by the asylum process, and is now facing deportation on Tuesday, 7 July '09.\n\nLi Zheng is, demonstrably, a practitioner of Falun Gong. Evidence shows that practitioners face persecution and human rights abuses by the Chinese authorities (see Facebook group - http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=116696972237&ref=nf - for more details.)\n\nThose who know Ms Zheng personally, or as the mother of Meng Tian, will testify to her impeccable character, and devout religious practice. \n\nMs Li Zheng therefore fulfils the UKBA's own (along with the European Convention on Human Rights) criteria for asylum (see Facebook group for details).\n\nWe therefore ask that the government acts urgently to grant her the asylum to which she is so clearly entitled.",
