            "background": "ADHD is common with 3 to 4% of all adults affected. Undiagnosed ADHD leads to academic failure, substance abuse, criminal activity, disrupted family/social relationships, unemployment/work problems, & poor mental health.  Adults are diagnosed with anxiety/depression without recognition of ADHD so treatments are inadequate & deplete mental health budgets.  Millions of pounds a year are lost from work- under-achievement  &  millions more are spent on associated problems like imprisonment, substance abuse, & unemployment. \n\nNICE recommends provision of diagnoses, psychological support, work & social help but implementation is either slow or absent.  The few current adult ADHD services provide less than recommended minimum due to inadequate funds.  It\u2019s certain too that demand will outstrip current capacity.\n   \nThus, we ask the Prime Minister to review current funding arrangements for adult ADHD,  & to provide dedicated funding to ensure care complies with NICE & national priorities.",
