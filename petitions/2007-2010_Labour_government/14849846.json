But I was horrified as I recently discovered they DO NOT work weekends.\nNow how many parents have seperated in the country I know that people (parents and children) would benefit from weekend visits or appointments. Even if it was just a skeleton staff on call. Childrens lives could be saved.\nIn a country where supermarkets are open 24 hours and weekends why can't an agency that is suppossed to safeguard the future of our country do the same?",
