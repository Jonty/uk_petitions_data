I have recently lost a daughter by indifference and urge everyone to act to ensure satisfactory practice within the NHS. Despite all complaints of \"serious failures\" being \"upheld\" by the Ombudsman, NHS Tayside has allowed the bad practitioners to escape without any recourse. Yes, there may be changes but we need it written \"into the stone\" to ensure that people with learning difficulties are afforded an equitable respect. I'm afraid that ignorance is abound, even in the medical environment.\nFor a detailed report see: http://www.spso.org.uk/investigation-reports/2010/march/tayside-nhs-board",
