            "background": "The central Bank of England like all other central banks are corrupt and their profits are privatised and losses nationalised, They are never audited and answer to no-one. They create the boom and bust cycle by artificially controlling interest rates and by contracting and expanding the money supply which they create out of thin air. This cant continue as every bust will be bigger than the last. I urge you to research central banking and how corrupt the institution is",
