            "background": "The racing of greyhounds has led to a vast number  of unwanted greyhounds being destroyed or dumped if they fail to make the grade in training, and similarly, at the end of their career.  They are often killed inhumanely, or left as strays to be injured on the roads, tortured by humans or used for  badger baiting or dog fighting. \n\nDog rescue centres have numerous sighthounds to rehabilitate and rehome. Centres will tell of the appalling suffering, the hours and money spent on surgery for dogs thrown out of cars or off roofs, injured in baiting or fighting, left starving outside or in, often with their ears cut off, or simply traumatised by shouting and kicking by cruel owners.  \nref. www.greyhoundaction.co.uk and other sites.",
