This horrendous problem ranges from verbal and threatening behavior to our windows being smashed, being spat on, car and fence damaged, our gas and heating messed around with, burgled. And the list goes on.\nWe have been living in a nightmare.\nOur local council have not been helpfull enough at all! We have sent more than enough diary forms and still no action has been taken. Other than a few complaint letters to them which just makes things worse. We also have got our local MP involved, so it seems to be moving somewhere now. We need these discusting people moved as we really cannot take anymore abuse and anxiety.\nPlease help! There needs to be a clamp down on Anti-Social behavior to stop anyone else going through the same misery.\n\nVicky Jones",
