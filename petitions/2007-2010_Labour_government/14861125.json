Our lanes do not have any speed limit signs and do not have any speed restriction ramps. We constantly have vehicles pass by at excessive speeds and it is only a matter of time before we witness a serious accident. Our lanes are unpaved and we consider them unsafe at times so respectfully request the the PM may consider our situation and act before there is a fatality.",
