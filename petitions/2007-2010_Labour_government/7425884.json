        "background": "Why has the UK government outsourced one of its key functions--processing visas from people who want to come to the UK? \"Worldbridge\" is CSC/DynCorp, which combines computer information processing and private security work. This company charges callers as much as \u00a31.50 per minute but has so few operators that one can be on hold for well over an hour. And it's now handling biometric data as well as personal and financial information. Is this something a non-UK private company should do? Its contract should end for poor customer service alone!",
