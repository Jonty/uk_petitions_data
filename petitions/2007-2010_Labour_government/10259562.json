Amber beacons are not enough to warn the general public, as too many vehicles already use amber beacons i.e. milk floats council vehicles and farm tractors to name a few. we think that we should be able to legally use rear facing red flashers at the very least, better still amber/red beacons (red to face the rear and amber to face front) There are far too many operators killed or seriously injured on our roads each year for this to remain as the present legislation stands",
