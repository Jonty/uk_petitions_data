            "background": "After the decision to give the 2 perpetrators involved in the brutal attack at Edlington last year to an'indefinite period of detention to serve a minimum five years' is a disgrace to victims and their families. With this kind of attack they 2 brothers involved clearly knew that what they done to those 2 boys was wrong. Why should these boys be allowed to serve a minimum sentence at least and be rehabilitated to come out and live a normal life again whilst the 2 victims will never lead a noraml life again as they and their families will be suffering from this horrific abuse. This seems to be the case with the Jamie Bulger killers too as they were children served a mimimum sentence then got released and as far as we know were moved to a different country. What these children have done are as bad or even worse what adults have done and adults face a more severe sentence. What kind of country do we live in!!!!!!",
