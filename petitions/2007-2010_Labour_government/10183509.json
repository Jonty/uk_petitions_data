        "background": "After watching a horrific expose on the channel 5 news about the real living conditions of hens in a farm in Norfolk and seeing the real reactions of the RSPCA, it has urged me to start this petition in order to protest that the RSPCA needs to work harder to ensure that farms are indeed following the regulations of free range living conditions for animals and not granting certification to farmers that are not providing such living conditions. Consumers purchase 'freedom foods' on the basis that the animals are living good, happy, healthy lives and this farm in Norfolk, specifically, was granted a certificate from the RSPCA when it was actually exposed as not providing free range conditions for the poor animals. The RSPCA needs to do as promised and ensure that farmers are all up to standard with regards to free range.",
