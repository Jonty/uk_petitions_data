            "background": "The Government is spending more on unemployment than the money it receives from income tax.  If everybody's dole money was reduced by \u00a35 per week - this money saved could be used to set up manufacturing companies.  The products could be branded DHSS and free of VAT. Ideas for products would be chocolate, food, drink, shower gels and soap etc.\nThe new factories would reduce the number of people out of work.",
