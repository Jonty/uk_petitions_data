        "background": "For politicians to be more proactive when it comes to flying and climate change. They should be encouraging people to fly in cleaner aircraft - just like they advocate for cars.\nIt is time to ban the oldest, dirtiest aircraft in the sky. It would be easy to do and would have a big impact.\nIt is wrong to tax families but not private jets and cargo. Air Passenger Duty should be reformed to tax aircraft emissions - those that pollute the most should pay the most. UK air travellers already pay more tax than any other country in Europe.\n\nAir travel could be 50% cleaner within 10 years.",
