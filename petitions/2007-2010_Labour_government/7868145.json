        "background": "My name is Leah Asfaw. I live at #1 9494 Millen Avenue Montreal Quebec, Canada. I am a gangstalking victim of over 15 years. The primary perpetrators are also British. I am being treated like a lunatic who's making this up. I need urgent help to get home, now. The stalking has become very violent. I am stuck here without legal status as although I am married a Canadian my visa wasn't renewed, recently. We are financial broke and every effort to escape is ruined. I have 2 cats left, the vets here are doing everything to prevent me from returning them to Britain. They finally had their rabies and positive titer but I need to come home now. Please please let this go to someone who can help me. I am frightened I need help.  Please help me to end my gangstalking, it's too much.  The perpetrators are primarily in the rave industry but are funded from other means.  Over the years I've reported this over and over.  Iam willing to answer all questions and take this further, and finally put an end to this.  Please help me somehow.\nPlease respond with a contact or information on how I can get help. I have no one that will help me here at all. I am truly trapped and being violated relentlessly as ever. anticipation,\nleah",
