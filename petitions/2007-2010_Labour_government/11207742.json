            "background": "I would like you to sign a petition to stop financial institutions using deception to obtain personal ID data when they telephone.\nCard companies, banks, debt collecting companies and others all INSIST that ''The Data Protection Act'' requires them, over the telephone, to obtain my: Full Name, Full Address and Date of Birth and often my password, before proceeding with a call.\nThe very things anyone would need to clone my ID! These companies include the same institutions who say 'don\u2019t give out your ID to anyone'.\nCallers such as 'Robinson Way', other consumer debt collectors, local councils &c., do not require it, but insist its \u2018The Law\u2019. It is not! They need it to register bad debts or bankruptcy notices against the 'right person', they obtain your ID by deception and under false pretences.\nI refuse to pass all of this information to them as they have not passed MY SECURITY procedures! I then have circular arguments about ''My Security'' with them whilst they insist ''We are your bank''",
