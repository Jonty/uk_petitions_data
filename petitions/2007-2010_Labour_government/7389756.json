        "background": "Rule 133 of the current Highway Code states: - 'Use fog lights when visibility is seriously reduced\u2019 This means when you cannot see for more than 100 metres (328 ft).\nIt can be shown that as the road is wet when there is fog, the overall braking distance of a vehicle travelling at 53MPH would exceed this visibility (333.9 feet stopping distance). Therefore, I propose that the wording be changed to 'Use fog lights when visibility is seriously reduced AND reduce speed to under 52MPH. The Maximum speed allowed is 52 MPH whilst your fog lights are lit.\u2019",
