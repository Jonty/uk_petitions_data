            "background": "For far too long now, the international community has stood by and watched the country of Zimbabwe descend into despotism. \n\nThis is mainly due to the efforts of 'Sir' Robert Mugabe.\n\nHe's destroyed Zimbabwe's ecomomy, he's destroyed Zimbabwe's agriculture, and he's all but destroyed democracy there, with atrocities committed angainst anyone who dare challenge his regime.\n\nI find it appalling that this government doesn't consider stripping Mugabe of this honour a worthwhile endeavor. It should be a matter of principle.\n\nThose of you who feel uneasy, that feel this travesty has gone on long enough, sign this petion and let this government know what it feels like having a despotic dictator as a Knight of the Realm.",
