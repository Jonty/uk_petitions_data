        "background": "Firstly remove all traffic lights then as a suggestion, all drivers should be forced to take a much harder and more realistic driving test - to include the basics of using roundabouts, junctions and motorways thus cutting congestion, reducing fuel emmissions and allowing more money to be spent on our dilapidated roads.  This will allow those of us who are capable of using the roads to get where we want to go without being cut up or stopped by lights every 30 seconds.  People need to learn how to drive instead of relying on lights, signs and markings to show them the way.  If you know where I'm coming from, please support us.",
