            "background": "Sir Fred Goodwin was appointed to the post of Honorary Air Commodore to Number 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force by Her Majesty the Queen on 1 May 2008.  It is clear from recent events that his professional and personal standards have fallen far below the expected standards of a Royal Air Force officer, that he cannot discharge the duty of Honorary Air Commodore effectively, and that his continuation in this role will damage the impeccable name and reputation of the Squadron, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the Royal Air Force.\n\nWe call upon the Prime Minister to instruct the Secretary of State for Defence to seek the removal of Goodwin from this post in accordance with The Queen's Regulations, the Air Force Act and any other applicable Acts and Orders, and for the Prime Minister to humbly petition Her Majesty The Queen to command the removal of Goodwin from this post and the appointment of a new Honorary Air Commodore for 602 Squadron.",
