        "action": "Ensure that there is a funding mechanism so that the BBC is strengthened, not cut, so that it remains a strong and independent organisation capable of delivering advertisement free quality news, documentaries and music, for both majority and minority interests, by radio, TV and the web/internet.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "BBC documentaries, music programs and news reporting are of a remarkably high standard on a world basis, and form part of what it is to be British. We don't want to start losing this.   \nThe BBC is considering sweeping cuts, chopping its website in half and dropping TV and radio stations... all to appease corporate media rivals. \nInstead we want the BBC to become able to deliver even more of its high quality programming, to represent fully the interests of all parts of the British community, to be able to go confidently forward with its digital radio and TV, to instigate yet more high quality music (classical, modern and folk), and to keep developing and exploiting the potential offered by the web and internet.",
