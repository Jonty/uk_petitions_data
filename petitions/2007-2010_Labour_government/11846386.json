        "background": "Many people of Britain are suffering  hardship due to the current recession and when turning to government websites such as realhelpnow.gov.uk they are looking for information and assistance, not government propaganda.\n\nWe call on Gordon Browns comments on the website to be edited to remove the dubious justifications of his actions over the past 11 years and palming off of responsibility to other people. These are presented as facts, despite being disputed by many people (probably the majority). Taxpayers money should not be used in this way.",
