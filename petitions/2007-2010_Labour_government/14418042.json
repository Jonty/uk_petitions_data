        "background": "Why should we as a British Nation have to put up with the immigrants coming into our country and living on benefits. Many countries have entry requirements which means immigrants must have a return ticket to their homeland and have proof of funds so they will not have be a burden on the state. Those who do not have that are refused entry,  We should do the same.  We request that the British Government limits entry to those who can support themselves and are prepared to support themselves for the benefit of the country.",
