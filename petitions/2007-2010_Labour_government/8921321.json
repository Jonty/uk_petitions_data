            "background": "Wretham is a rural parish designated as an Area of Special Protection and an Area of Important Landscape Quality. Four years ago Norfolk County Council gave permission for a brown-field site to be developed as a waste management facility. The locals said this would be the thin end of the wedge, but the Council overruled their objections. Now the operators want to set up two new sites in green-field locations. One is Victory Belt, a stand of woodland planted to commemorate the victory in WWI, containing protected and Biodiversity Action Plan species and their habitats. The other is an agricultural field in an area of gently rolling farmland in the neighbouring parish of Kilverstone, also containing protected and Biodiversity Action Plan species and their habitats.",
