They should be instantly dismissed instead of receiving pay until the next election. They should not receive their relocation expenses either.  The rules of law should apply equally to everyone. They should be investigated exactly as would someone being accused of benefit fraud and fined or imprisoned accordingly. Their offer to repay any identified errors in their accounts does not go far enough. The punishment of resignation on full pay does not fit the crime.",
