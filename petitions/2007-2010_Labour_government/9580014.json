            "background": "I am starting a petition to stop the London Borough of Brent from its calculated vicious attack on our communities by refusing new leases for community based businesses, voluntary and community projects.\nAs a local authority it is using every dirty trick in the book to remove existing tenants from council owned property, which is leased out to these groups.\nRoundwood Lodge a community Cafe is one of them, that his been penalised under this new regime in our town hall.\nI have written to the leader of the council three times without a response, which is in breach of their own guidlines. As a community we have gathered 6000 signatures and we still have not been heard by our council whose party political antics are legendary. We ask you to sign our petition to illuminate support for our communities.",
