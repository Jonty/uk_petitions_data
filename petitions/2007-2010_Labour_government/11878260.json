            "background": "While the public, in general, are in no doubt that Sir Fred Goodwin is not deserving of the level of pension offered to him when he left The Royal Bank of Scotland, it was approved and he is nevertheless entitled to it.\n\nThe government claim that the board of directors 'misled' the treasury over this issue, leading them to believe that the pension was a contractual obligation.  If true, the board of directors are responsible for a deliberate fraud on shareholders, both at the time and in the future, which now, of course, includes all British taxpayers.\n\nIf the government is serious in tackling the problems inherent in the UK banking system, it must report its allegations to the serious fraud office, who can conduct a full investigation into the actions and reasoning of the directors of RBS on this issue.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the government do not wish to follow this up, they must explain to the British public why they have taken no action (to withold evidence of fraudulent activities is, in itself, a criminal act) and publicly retract its original allegations, offering an apology for such unsupported accusations.",
