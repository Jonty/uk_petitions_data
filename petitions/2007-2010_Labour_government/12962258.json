This has quite obviously failed, energy watchdogs have confirmed they believe we are being overcharged, a large majority are struggling due to others greed. These are things vital to every household, not luxuries us with little money don't deserve. Nationalisation is the only way this government can even successfully attempt to keep to its earlier pledge to seriously tackle fuel poverty.  Please sign.",
