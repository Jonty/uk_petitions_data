            "background": "Given the number of deaths and serious injuries every year to cyclists, especially head injuries, we should ensure safety by making it law to wear a helmet.  We are being encouraged to use less environmentally unfriendly transport like bicycles and as the number of regular cyclists increases we need to ensure the corresponding number of deaths and serious head injuries is reduced.  This is particularly relevant for children cycling to school each day.",
