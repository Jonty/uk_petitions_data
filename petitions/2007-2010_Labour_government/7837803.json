        "background": "The new idea to make being an organ donor an opt out scheme is appalling. It assumes all organs belong to the state, and users are entitled to their organs only until death, unless they extend the lease (for free). Lack of donors is a problem, one which can be addressed partly by making it easier to become a donor. Also, to be fair, require a patient to be a donor if they are to have a transplant from someone else. If you are unwilling to let someone in need use your organs when you do not need them, you should not be able to use someone else's organs when you need them and they no londer do.",
