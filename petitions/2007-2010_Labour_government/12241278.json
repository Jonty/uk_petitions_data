            "background": "The Government is spending more than \u00a312,000 a year on a hub in the virtual world Second Life that it does not even promote online.\nA 3D \"innovation centre\" was created by the Department for Work and Pensions but it is not advertised on the DWP website.\nJunior minister Jonathan Shaw told Parliament it cost \u00a320,000 to build and a further \u00a312,000 a year to maintain.\nThey hope money from the private sector will help cover some of the cost. The project will be reviewed in 2011.\n\nAt a time of rising unemployment, and global recession why is the government wasting OUR money like this, in an online game?\n\nStop the madness, close this project now.",
