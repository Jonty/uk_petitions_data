The local populace are outraged at the proposals to destroy what has become an iconic landmark in the eyes of most residents. If necessary the model should be renovated to avoid it deteriorating to the point when the Council may call safety reasons to bear in its decision to destroy it. Save the Cat!",

My children have grown up delighting in its incongruous appearance and still look forward to it coming into view. The hundreds of comments on the Facebook support group bear testimony to the fact that, though it is now a somewhat old and worn favourite, it commands a place of significance in most locals' personal histories.",
