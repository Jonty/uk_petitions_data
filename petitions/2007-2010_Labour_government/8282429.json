        "action": "Persuade the Executive of Lewisham Borough Council to listen to the wishes of the electorate with regard to the model cat outside the Catford Shopping Precinct. The local populace are outraged at the proposals to destroy what has become an iconic landmark in the eyes of most residents. If necessary the model should be renovated to avoid it deteriorating to the point when the Council may call safety reasons to bear in its decision to destroy it. Save the Cat!",

        "background": "The Catford cat has been in existence ever since I have been in the Lewisham area. My children have grown up delighting in its incongruous appearance and still look forward to it coming into view. The hundreds of comments on the Facebook support group bear testimony to the fact that, though it is now a somewhat old and worn favourite, it commands a place of significance in most locals' personal histories.",
