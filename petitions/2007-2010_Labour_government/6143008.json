        "background": "Many countries limit the rights of foreigners to own businesses or homes. In some countries British people aren\u2019t allowed to own land. This can cause difficulties for British investors and home buyers abroad.\n\nThe United States has enacted reciprocal treaties, such as the US-Thailand Amity treaty, which bring their citizens rights in Thailand into line with those of the people of Thailand. The British government should seek to enact such treaties.\n\nIf other countries are not willing to enter into reciprocal agreements with the UK the government should limit the rights of their citizens in line with restrictions for our citizens in their countries.",
