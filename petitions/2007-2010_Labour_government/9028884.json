        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Christian bulletin \"Care Today\" highlights findings of the research paper by expert fiscal consultants, Draper and Brighton, which suggests govt should do more to support marriage since the current system penalises stable couples, encouraging family breakdown. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to reform the family taxation system - headway has been made, (eg. paternity rights), but the professionals advising people still have to catch up amidst all this change and influx - sometimes govt. initatives reform something that wasn't necessarily broken - so what chance have the welfare state's service users to know about entitlements ? The petitioner is urging the P.M. to adopt a more systematic and easily understood Finish model of taxation.",
