Among these tests were the \u201cGrapple Y\u201d and \u201cGrapple Z\u201d series of six detonations at Christmas Island in the Pacific Ocean (November 1957\u2013September 1958), of weapons many times more powerful than those discharged at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n* Of 2,500 men surveyed in 1999 30% of the men had died, mostly in their fifties. \n\n* In their grandchildren spina bifida rates are more than 5 times the usual rate for live births in the UK. \n\n* More than 200 skeletal abnormalities were reported. \n\n* More than 100 veterans children reported reproductive difficulties. \n\n(info taken from British Nuclear Test Veterans Association)",
