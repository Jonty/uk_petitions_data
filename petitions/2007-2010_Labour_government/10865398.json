            "background": "As you know well fireworks are for sale in the uk at the moment. They aren't just kids or teens there are adults too that use them. I dont think I just speak for myself when I say ban fireworks for sale in the uk and just have public firework shows hosted. Firstly, they are much safer and if they are more expensive im sure people would rather be safer than have a little more change in their pocket. Secondly, it isn't just people that get hurt it's animals as well. Over the last few years many animals and people have gone to hospital with various firework related injuries. Im sure you would rather have a safer Britain than money in your pocket. Furthermore I would like to go on and say that fireworks are too easy to acquire these days. Mainly anyone can get hold of them as you see children as little as 5 with fireworks on them. If you battle this problem they will eventually stop the sale of fireworks and have safer public displays. In conclusion lets ban fireworks for sale in the UK to make a happier, more safer community. I leave you with one last thought if u think the firework problem ain't a serious one........think again!",
