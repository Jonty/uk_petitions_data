            "background": "Homework is something that has its strength and its weaknesses. It provides a chance learning outside of the 6 hours spent at school but the combined time and stress caused by homework can cause a lot of problems for students socially and mentally, which isn't healthy for people of such a young age. So by signing this petition we ask that a real debate is started on all the issues surrounding homework. This would not only create the possibility of an improvement to the current problems caused by homework but would also show young people that the government cares by addressing an issue that affects all young people and is an issue often brought up in the classroom but never makes it out of the classroom because the issue is simply ignored by teachers.",
