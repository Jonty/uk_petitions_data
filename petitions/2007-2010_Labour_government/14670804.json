            "background": "The BBC spends \u00a354 million on its top-earning stars, according to new figures. \nThe figure accounts for 1.55% of the \u00a33.6 billion annual licence fee income and is paid to artists, presenters, musicians and other contributors earning \u00a3150,000 and more. \n\u00a3115 million was spent on those earning up to \u00a350,000, \u00a344 million on those earning between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000 and \u00a316 million on the \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3150,000 bracket. \nThis sheer waste of the licence-payers hard-earned cash must stop NOW!!!!\nThe BBC is a luxury that our country can no longer afford to subsidise. It must me FORCED to pay for itself.The licence-payer should have more say in the running of this over-subsidised,\"fat-cats\" regime.\nThe BBC already show \"advertisements\" of their own programs and presenters.\nI do not see the difference between advertising their own programs and advertising products in the case of commercial television.\nThe BBC should be reformed as a Limited Company able to maintain its own funding by the use of commercial advertising and the global marketing of its programs.",
