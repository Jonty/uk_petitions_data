            "background": "According to my own experience and that of others recorded on many web sites, the local government ombudsman serves only to protect Local Authorities interests and serves no useful purpose to members of the public. The people who work for them are ex-council officials and civil servants who take the council\u2019s side regardless of how overwhelming the evidence is. In the tiny number of cases they do find for the public the compensation and remedies are totally inadequate. In these times when we need to save money they are an ideal candidate to cut and as soon as possible.",
