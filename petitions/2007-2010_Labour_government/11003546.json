            "background": "The proposal by the UK Ultraspeed project to link London, the English North and Scotland by a 300mph maglev system is the only right option for the future of UK ground transport.\n\nThe aforementioned project has comprehensively proven that overall it will be much cheaper than a standard \"high speed\" rail network. More importantly it will result in faster journeys and better reliability. The German developed technology is already in use and is working well in China\n\nLondon to Birmingham in 30 minutes.\nLondon to Newcastle in 100 minutes.\nGlasgow to Edinburgh in 15 minutes.\n\nOther countries will be stuck with their existing slow \"high speed\" networks for decades to come. The UK should seize the opportunity to gain an advnatage. Any TGV style plans should be scrapped and we should start building the cheaper, faster and more reliable intercity maglev now.",
