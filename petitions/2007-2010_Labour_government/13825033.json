We need new laws. MP's should, by law, work for the national average wage,about \u00a328,000, more than enough.  All politicians, by law, should travel on public transport, it would soon improve and become safe if they had to use it!!! All politicians, by law, should send their kids to state schools, we'd soon see education standards pick up. All politicians should, by law have to use the NHS and go to the back of queues for treatment, I bet the hospitals would soon improve.",
