        "background": "As well as a proliferation of Off Licenses, many small grocers shops are obtaining licenses, they are open up to 17 hrs a day 7/7.All sell CHEAP ALCOHOL. We cannot object to these changes because they do not need planning permission. Section 13.23 Licensing Act 2003 prevents any objections to these shops.That we do not need them is not a reason to refuse them.Every shop could have a licence and we cannot object. Residents have to prove that the selling of cheap alcohol by these shops, before they open will cause problems in the neighbourhood!\nHotels,Pubs,Restaurants need planning permission, so objections can be made on the grounds that there are already enough in the area.It is proven that vandalism and loutish behaviour is caused by alcohol.There is too much cheap alcohol readily available for too many hours. By changing 13.23 to reqire all premises wanting to sell alcohol to obtain planning permission, to give the residents the right to object by reason of NEED would stop towns and villages becoming 'BOOZE CAPITALS'",
