            "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to withdraw his invitation, on account of:\n\n1.  His professed respect for Christianity and particularly, his professed adherence to Presbyterianism, which is founded on the Word of God, and which in its substandard, the Westminster Confession of Faith, rejects the pope on the authority of Gods Word as \u201cthat Antichrist, that man of sin and son of perdition, that exalteth himself in the Church against Christ, and all that is called God.\u201d Ch 25; 6; (as ratified by parliament in 1689/1690)\n\n2.  The pope denies the final authority  of the Inspired Word of God, in matters of doctrine, worship and practice, and particularly salvation, and therefore cannot be a positive influence for good in this United Kingdom, as readily acknowledged by our forefathers.\n\n3. The pope is the Head of a System of Religion that practices the mass, a ceremony that is an affront to Bible believing Christians across the United Kingdom., and more seriously, abominably injurious to Christ\u2019s one only Sacrifice.\n\n4.  Our sovereign is under solemn oath to defend the Protestant faith, and this invitation will seriously compromise further, her obligations under this oath.",
