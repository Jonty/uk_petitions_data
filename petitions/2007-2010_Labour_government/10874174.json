It is estimated that this will cost the RNLI around an extra \u00a3220,000 per year.\n\nPeter Bradley, RNLI operations staff officer, said the charity estimated that fees would rocket from \u00a340,000 to \u00a3260,000 a year.\n\nHe said: \"It means we have got to put in a lot of extra effort in a very difficult economic climate. What we will be doing if they do apply it is extra fundraising which is quite difficult to do.\n\nWhen people make donations to the RNLI it is for the saving of lives, not to pay fees to a government quango.\n\nThis petition calls for the RNLI to either be exempted from the proposed fees or to be be given a full discount.",
