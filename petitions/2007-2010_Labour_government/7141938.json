            "background": "Secondary school children in B&NES travelling to school face:  \n\u2022 Overcrowding \n\u2022 Being stranded as there isn\u2019t enough space on the bus.\n\u2022 Sustaining injury (one incident Sept-Oct 2007).\n\u2022 Buses arriving late, early or not at all\n\u2022 Being left at school for more than 1 hour.\n\u2022 Having to use several buses on each journey, significantly increasing the cost of travel.\n\u2022 Slow buses \n\u2022 Buses frequently arrive at school late, resulting in being marked absent.\n\u2022 Overpriced fares \n\u2022 Parents pay more than \u00a3500 per year per child  \n\u2022 There is no child-rate travel-card or season ticket available in Bath.\n\u2022 Many parents drive out of desperation at the situation. \n\u2022 Congestion & pollution faces everyone in Bath\n\u2022 A real solution to the home-school transport issue would make a significant difference to everyone in Bath, not just parents and children\nWe therefore call on B&NES Council to:\n1. Ensure that every secondary school child has a seat on a suitable bus.\n2. Re-establish home-school transport as a high priority in the council\u2019s budget.\n3. Ensure that home-school transport is more:\na. reliable, \nb. safe,\nc. affordable.",
