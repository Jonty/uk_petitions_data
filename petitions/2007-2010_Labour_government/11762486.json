            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The NHS is now bedraggled with endless waiting lists, an ever-expanding centralised bureaucracy, and more and more crises such as the  disastrous waste of money on the failing 20 billion pound computer system.\nThus I petition the government to move towards a Britain with no NHS and instead to a country with a system of mostly free-market provision of healthcare that will foster competition, efficiency, innovation and consumer choice. As for those who cannot afford it, they can be provided with cheap state-controlled health insurance or decentralised public hospitals funded by local government, as many countries such as Germany have pioneered with success. (The Germans have no such waiting lists). This would not only save the government money but provide the people with the power to choose among efficient and effective health services.\nPrivate healthcare may also create some problems, but at least it won't spend 20 billion pounds that could be used to treat patients on an unworkable computer system.",
