        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Parents can save \u00a3200 million p.a. if the Government scrapped VAT on school uniforms.\n\nThe tax is unjust, especially as the Dept for Education & Skills began a campaign against overpriced school kit earlier this year.\n\nThe Government argues that uniforms stop brand wars & bullying, yet they tax secondary school uniform.\n\nParents pay the full 17.5% VAT on clothes for children aged 14+, including school uniform.\n\nChildren's clothes that are larger than certain sizes are taxed so that petite adults cannot avoid the duty.\n\nThe VAT cut-off points of 43in for chests & 28.5in for trousers are not reasonable.  The size limit should be scrapped & instead all uniform - both primary & secondary - should be free from VAT as long as it carries a school badge/emblem.\n\nBy ensuring that uniform carries a school badge/emblem petite adults would not be able to take advantage of the change in the law.\n\nIt would seem to me in terms of justice & logic that it would make clear sense for all school uniforms to be zero-rated.  \n\nThe VAT charge hits poorer parents hardest, making up a greater proportion of their spending.\n\nScrapping the VAT would save about \u00a335 for every parent.",
