We the undersigned would like to restore a degree of dignity and respect to the House of Commons by asking the Prime Minister to donate figgy puddings or the more practical monetary equivalent thereof to a homeless charity of his or her choice next Christmas. We believe this is more practical than pardoning a turkey and a useful reminder that homelessness can affect anyone. Thus the Prime Minister must give a fig!\n\nThis is in the spirit of the famous secular sixteenth-century carol \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\".\n\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister of the UK to bring us some figgy pudding.\n\nWe all want some figgy pudding and a cup of good cheer!\n\nWe won't go until we get some, so bring some out here!\n\nIt's not for us but for the homeless of the UK.\n\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nPlease give the puddings or the more practical monetary equivalent thereof to a homeless charity of your choice.",
