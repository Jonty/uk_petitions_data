            "background": "Their names are John Hill, Uncle,  (30), James McAllister (18) and John Gore (28). These men were shot by government forces i.e. RUC, A Specials and the Green Howards. After the shooting, Barrington-Ward, Churchill's Secretary, came to Cushendall, and took depositions of many people. Churchill said the forces should be charged with murder but James Craig ordered that it was an internal affair of the state of NI. He closed the files for 50 years under the Official Secrets Act and in 1974 closed them for a further 25 years. There  were no rifles, ammunition etc found to prove the forces were ambushed. The question is: why close the files for 75 years? What were they trying to hide? Please clear their name.",
