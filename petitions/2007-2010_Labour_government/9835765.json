            "background": "Recently publishers have said that they want to introduce age ratings on books. This cannot be allowed to happen, it will put children off books they might otherwise read which will make even more children unable to read and write properly as you cannot determine what age someone is going to want to read something at.It will also lead to less sales thus damaging the economy. The government must stop the publishers from taking steps towards censorship by banning such actions and prosecuting any publisher who tries any such thing serverly.",
