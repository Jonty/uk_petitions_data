        "background": "In his latest call to the press, Ian Blair has said that celebrities should be prosecuted over photos of alleged drug-taking.\nHis statement that he considers it reasonable that the photo alone is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider a case 'beyond reasonable doubt' ignores that people have snorted more mundane things like crushed caffeine tablets or validly prescribed medication. It risks prejudicing a jury towards a decision not backed by solid evidence, and thus undermines the fundamental principle of UK law of innocence until proven guilty.\nAs such his view is not an acceptable one to voice publicly for a person holding his position and he should be held accountable",
