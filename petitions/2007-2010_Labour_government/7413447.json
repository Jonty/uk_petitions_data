            "background": "The BBC gives two minutes of airtime on its well-respected Today programme on Radio 4 to religious commentary. It has publicly stated that it will not allow secular viewpoints to be expressed within this segment, arguing that doing so would undermine the distinctive aspect of the segment. In making this asssertion, the BBC ignorantly assumes that all philosophical reflection must occur within the context of religious belief. It is wholly unacceptable that the BBC uses licence-payer funds to regularly discriminate against non-theists whose philosophical beliefs are as profound as those of religious believers.",
