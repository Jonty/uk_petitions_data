        "background": "Like all people, I think, I welcome technological advances - but am reluctant to implement research unless govt. endorsed. The petitioner is calling for more categorical guidelines on the recent announcement that high-fat diets could help epileptic children, sicne elsewhere, for alternative diagnoses, high fat diets are contra - indicated.\n\nAmong children given the diet, seizures dropped by more than a third over a three-month period. At the same time, children not given the diet experienced a more than 33% rise in seizures.\n\nThe ketogenic diet has been successfully used to treat children with drug-resistant epilepsy since the 1920s. However, this was the first time it had been tested in a randomised trial.\n\nThe diet consists of large amounts of fat, little carbohydrate and controlled amounts of protein. It is thought to mimic the biochemical response to starvation, when ketone bodies fuel the brain rather than sugar.",
