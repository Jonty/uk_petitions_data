Not only this, but types of dance crosses all cultures and ought to be encouraged.\nAcross the country, former ballrooms have been converted into flats, offices or are due to be demolished. Places sometimes provided for dancing are frequently too small to allow proper ballroom dancing, although this has recently come back into fashion.\nBlackpool has people coming from over the world, but older people like somewhere local they can dance regularly and so do the not not-so-young!\nPlease prevent the demolition of buildings which retain sprung dance floors which could be utilised and require local authorities to provide decent sized spaces where people can enjoy dancing for pleasure and fitness.",
