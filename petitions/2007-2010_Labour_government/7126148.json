            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "St Joseph's college is a Science Specialist college based in Stoke On Trent and features among the top 200 schools in England. The future of St Joseph's is under threat by the LEA. Ofsted inspectors summed up the school ethos when they said that St Joseph's provided \"outstanding\" opportunities for pupils to develop as well-rounded citizens. Good teaching,excellent support,polite and respectful pupils,and outstanding leadership were among the other highlights.These skills appear to meet \"the vision\" laid out by Gordon Brown in his speech on Education dated 31st October 2007..All involved in this petiton do not understand why you want to close the City's Top School.We do not understand why this Government wishes to close a school that is delivering.Therefore, we politely request that you assist us with our plight and intervene to ensure that St Joseph's college remains as per it's moto \"faithful and strong\"",
