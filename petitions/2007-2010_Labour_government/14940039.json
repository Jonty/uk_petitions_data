        "background": "Enable people on benefits to contribute to the economy and their communities by making them work for their benefits. No body can expect to be given money for nothing, and most people on benefits are able to contribute in someway. They could be used for litter picking, grass cutting, Painting etc. i am not saying it should be a full time job i am suggesting something more like 300 hour per year( approx 6 hours per week)of community service. It may cost a lot to implement and run, but i'd rather spend a bit more and get a bit back than spend a lot and get nothing. This could encourage a lot of people back to work and would certainly improve public areas and peoples respect for their environment. If people don\u2019t do any community service their benefits could be stopped, if they do a proportion of their quota they could be given the same proportion of their benefits. This would Show the children of people on benefits that the more you work the more you get and would hopefully slow the never ending conveyor belt of benefit claimants.",
