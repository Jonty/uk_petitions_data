            "background": "The Gurkhas have just earned the right to stay in the UK having served in our armed forces honourably for at least four years.Why do we give the right to live here to foreigners who are not willing to do the same but just complain and protest against the country that has given them a home.Each male who wishes to settle in England between the age of 18 to 34 should be required to serve honourably in the army.If they misbehave in that time or receive a bad report from their OC their citizenship is revoked and they are deported.If they serve for the minimum period without causing any problems then their right to stay in the UK should be finalised.This will solve our manpower shortage in the army and prove if a foreign migrant is willing to fight for his new chosen country and prove he is a worthy member of our society or is he just coming here to freeload like most of them.",
