        "background": "The volume of motorised traffic in Richmond Park is out of control.  The noise and visual impact of the constant stream of cars destroys the whole purpose of having open green spaces in London.  The introduction of a toll for driving in the park (parking can be included) should reduce the amount of leisure through-traffic (clearly evident from the number of fancy sports cars).",
