        "action": "Make it law for children to wear helmets when riding bicycles on and off the road.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is estimated that 90,000 road-related and 100,000 off-road related cycling accidents occur every year in the UK,of which 53% (100,000) involve children under sixteen. Many accidents have been fatal.\nI'm a mother to a 10 year old son. \nEven after a recent cycle accident, he would rather not ride his bike anymore than have to wear his helmet.\nWhy? Friends/other children take the micky out of him/call him a geek because they don't wear one!\nIn most if not all schools these days have a uniform policy. Those polices help prevent bullies picking on children who's families can't afford expensive branded clothing.\nThere is no difference here. If all children were made to wear a helmet, they would all be the same. There would be no more bullying for those who do wear one. But most of all, any child that does become a cycle accident victim, they will be protecting one of the important organs in their body. They are so cheap to buy too!!\nIf your a mother,father,sibling,grand parent,aunt,uncle or just care about children's safety,then please please sign this petition to make it law that all cyclists MUST wear a helmet.",
