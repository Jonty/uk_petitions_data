            "background": "This is not a request for the previous operator of GNER to return to operating the East Coast. It is instead the suggestion that the government obtains the rights to the GNER branding and makes it the permanent branding for the East Coast Franchise.\n\nIt's currently ridiculous that every time a new company takes over a franchise that they get to rebrand it. This is a waste of resources as well as looking a mess while most trains are still in an interim livery.\n\nGNER had probably the best looking train livery and gave a genuine feeling of quality and tradition.\n\nThe brand was generally popular with customers, so it's a good one to retain on the route. A lot of people wanted NXEC to retain the GNER brand.\n\nThe brand is good for tourism, with historic references such as \"Route of the Flying Scotsman\" giving the impression that they're travelling with a company that's been around many years.\n\nThis petition is neither for or against nationalisation of the line. That's for another petition.",
