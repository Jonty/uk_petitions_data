        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With all the publicity around to support a healthy work/life balance, we believe a four day work week should be introduced.\nSurely having more time for leisure and family based activities would reduce stress levels, and subsequently reduce the number of people requiring medical attention, when symptoms do arise.\nObviously this would not be possible for shops - due to seven day openings; however four day shifts could be introduced to allow full time shop workers the healthy balance also.\nSchool days could also be changed - to either start earlier, or finish later - to allow students to enjoy a four day week.  This would also help more parents who experience child care problems, as the school day would fit more appropriately into the working day.",
