The most vulnerable people in this international financial crisis, are those on low incomes or no longer employed. I believe we now need a two tier banking system where there is a choice between a Corporate Bank or a Government National Government Bank. The Corporate Banks could still operate with incentives of interest and loans and the Government Nntional Banks of all countries would survive on deposits and lower interest rates for depositors.I petition that our government safeguards the poor and the frugal through the establishment if a Government National Bank.",
