        "background": "The Government  should: -\n\n1.\tEstablish or utilize UK testing sites where heroin from police drug seizures could be tested.\n\n2.\tEnter into negotiations with appropriate overseas Governments to procure processed opium poppy extracts at a fair price to local farmers.\n\nThe prime aim of the pilot is to fight drug abuse in the UK and associated criminality. \n\nThis pilot would also involve administering heroin free of charge by medical practitioners to registered UK addicts at licensed support units.\n\nThis initiative would help reduce the incidence of associated criminal supply and enable addicts to sign up to treatment plans.\n\nFurthermore if the pilot proved  successful then it could be rolled out across the UK and also be used as good practice when combating other illegal drugs.",
