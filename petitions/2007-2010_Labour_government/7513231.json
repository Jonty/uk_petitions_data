            "background": "Heating courtyards takes up an immense amount of energy, which I thought is what we are trying to save!  Carrying on the way we are is simply not acceptable, but making it worse by adding more energy consuming features in pubs is even worse!\nThese facilities are for smokers, which have been told to smoke outside. Giving them privilege of a heated courtyard isn't helping them to stop. Going into a heated courtyard for a cigarette is much more appealing than the cold outside.  We should be trying to encourage them to stop this foul habit, rather than leave them facilities to continue pleasantly.\nI just don't think it is at all acceptable! My local pub has recently been refurbished with a heated courtyard and i hope that in the next year it'll be gone.  It just takes up too much  energy in a world which is meant to be saving it!\nPlease join to help stop this, it may be a small issue, but it helps.\nAlex Hicks, age 15. Manchester",
