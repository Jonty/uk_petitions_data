        "background": "Everyday millions of fast food take-away leaflets are posted through people's front doors encouraging them to eat often poorly prepared and unhealthy food.  The government is supposed be doing everything it can to encourage people to eat healthy food and protect the environment from global warming.  Where is the paper coming from to make up these leaflets?  It is a disgrace.  The only people who should be allowed to post anything through a front door are a Postman and Milkman. Anyone delivering a takeaway leaflet is trespassing!  The amount of horrible little fastfood takeaway outlets has increased dramatically, an indiaction of the calibre of immigrants we are letting into this country no doubt!  Anyway, how many more leaflets do I have to throw away? Please make it illegal for anyone to post a takeaway leaflet through our front doors!",
