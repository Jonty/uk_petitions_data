            "background": "Harry Redknapp has a proven record of achieving at the top level, playing attractive and effective football.\n\nHe is a staunch advocate of developing youth and is responsible for the likes of Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand, Joe Cole, Jermaine Defoe and Michael Carrick to name a few.\n\nGraduating from the West Ham academy, he knows better than most the values and expectations of English football.\n\nHis nationality seems to preclude him from the top club jobs in England - but it should be a distinct advantage when it comes to national job.\n\nHe should have been given the job before Sven-Goran Eriksson was appointed, and again when Steve McClaren succeeded the Swede.\n\nNow is the time to rectify the catalogue of errors made ever since Glenn Hoddle was dismissed.\n\nIt is time to get a manager the public can empathise with and can meet the expectations of the nation.",
