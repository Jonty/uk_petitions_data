On Tuesday you spoke to Congress powerfully about the genocide in Ruwanda quoting the 10 year old child David whose last words were,\" the United Nations are coming\" and said that the mantra of all of us who are committed to the abolition of genocide is Never Again. I am sure that the same thing is about to happen. You spoke of judgement and I believe that we will be judged if we stand by and do nothing. I can do nothing but ask you to do something and in the name of God I do. Remember what St Theresa says,' Christ has no hands on earth but ours.'\nThis is a prayer that you will use the power that Almighty God has given you to save these people.\nThank you\nBeverley Ward",
