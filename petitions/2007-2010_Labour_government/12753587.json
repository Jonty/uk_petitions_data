        "background": "On a recent holiday to Scarborough, Whitby and Pickering we were disgusted to find that all the car parks that are run by the councils here are not free for blue badge holders.  \n\nThe only option is to park on double yellow lines for up to three hours to evade the fee, which with the size of the towns this would cause severe obstructions (and would probably result in the car being towed away anyway!).\n\nThe other option is to park at the top of the hill (where it is free for everyone) and to walk down into the town.  This is an option for anyone who is able bodied and doesn't qualify for a blue badge, however anyone who is not that able bodied enough has to pay at the car parks even though they have a blue badge.\n\nBy far the worst car park we found for this was the Sea Life Centre's at Scarborough.  Here there isn't even yellow lines to park on as it is at the bottom of the hill.\n\nI have been to numerous other seaside resorts throughout Wales, and even in central London many of the council's car parks are free of charge for blue badge holders.  \n\nWe find it really lets Yorkshire down by cashing in on people with mobility problems, where as they should be just cashing in on the people who are too lazy to walk down the hill.",
