            "background": "This chemical when in a pure state is relitivly safe. \nProblems are only caused due to it currently being a \"controled substance\" this means that it is difficult to educate people properly, it also causes the main problem, which is the regulation of the quality or pureity of the product. \nShould MDMA use be legalised it would be possible to regulate all aspects of its production and use. It could also be used as a source of income for the government through tax being applied to its sale.\nEven in its current banned and un-regulated state it is still widely used and there are very few problems occuring from its use.\nMDMA has no known major negative side effects.\nMDMA is non addictive.",
