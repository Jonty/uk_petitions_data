            "background": "Britain is owned by the british public, not the government. The government might make decisions on our behalf but its not fair that they can tell us what games we can and can't play. Obviously they can come up with systems to stop the underage getting their hands on particular games but they certainly cant tell us we cant legally own them. If this gets signed then the brittish public has said that they want this freedom in our country which is ours as much as the governments and the people who say these games should be banned doesn't have to buy them but they shouldn't complain to the ones who does want to play them.",
