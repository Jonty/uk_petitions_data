            "background": "This petition is to keep dogs out of public parks where OUR children play, harmful or NOT they do scare people especially our children and them being there can mean either our children and us are at risk of danger or they do not want to play in the park because they are scared, this is unfair as parks are not made for dogs they are made for children and they should not have to feel threatend or even attacked by a dog when innocently playing. This petition is also to keep all dogs that are walking,playing or doing anything in a public place to be kept on a lead, this is not unreasonable i am not asking for them to be banned from public places or mussled just kept on a lead so that members of the public feel safe when passing a dog. Many a times i have passed a dog in the street with or without my child and felt scared and so have they. So many dogs approach you, hamrful or NOT people are SCARED of dogs and i think its wrong that they can rome the streets without a lead.",
