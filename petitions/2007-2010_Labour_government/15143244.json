            "background": "All service personnel now have to register annually in order to be able to vote. Lack of knowledge of this fact and the unreasonable requirement to sign annually has resulted in the number of service personnel registering falling from 139,000 to 21,000. While preserving the right to democracy for other British citizens, our brave servicemen and women are in danger of not being able to exercise this right themselves. The USA and Canda have both ensured this with convenient online registration and voting.",
