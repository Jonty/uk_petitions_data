I still have the same costs as somebody aged 25 but am not entitled to the same Tax Credits as them.\n\nHad Labour not removed the 10p tax rate, this is the rate I would have been taxed under. Instead, they have introduced Tax Credits which leave many people ineligible for help.\n\nAs a young person, I am employed full time and am fully independent. I receive nothing in return for hard work and being everything the government expects me to be.",
