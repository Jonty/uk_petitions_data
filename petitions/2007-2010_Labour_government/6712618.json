(BBC)\n\nCrabs are having their claws removed for sale in fishmongers or restaurants before they are thrown back into the sea alive.\n\nAlthough crabs are able to regenerate claws this practice is very likely to cause them to starve to death or die from shock before, especially in large crabs. \n\nThis is an unsustainable and cruel practice, which needs to be stopped.",
