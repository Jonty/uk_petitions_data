Also, it may increase pollution to the extent that residents in the charging zones are forced (in the knowledge of an annual charge of up to almost \u00a36,500) to sell their vehicles to rural owners with a much higher annual mileage. \n\nThe \u00a325 charge, if applied at all (which is opposed), should not be borne by those who purchased their vehicles without the knowledge that such a charge would be introduced and the discount for charging zone residents should be applicable.",
