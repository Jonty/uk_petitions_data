            "background": "An increasing number of companies are subjecting applicants to psychometric tests and personality profiling exercises such as Myers-Briggs. This is because the companies believe these tests and exercises are the best way of identifying which people are the best to employ. \n\nI therefore propose that companies are prohibited from subjecting applicants to psychometric tests and personality profiling exercises because: \n\n1. There is no scientifically proven evidence that people who perform better at psychometric tests perform better in the workplace and vice versa.\n\n2. Personality profiling is highly intrusive and no employer should have the right to know personal information of such a deep level.\n\n3. Psychometric tests and personality profiling can work against people with certain disabilities such as Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism, who often perform worst on these tests than people without disabilities.",
