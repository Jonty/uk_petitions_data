            "background": "Those objecting to the proposed 18% flat rate CGT will have made \u00a3millions when they eventually sell their businesses and the proposed 18% rate for CGT is reasonable given that most of us pay much more than that on earned income.\n\nMany investors seek out those shares listed on AIM that qualify for business assets tax relief - cutting maximum CGT by 50% if held for a year and by 75% if held for two years.\n\nThe proposed 18% flat rate opens up shares listed on the main market to those investors not willing to pay the current extortionate 40% rate.\n\nThe 40% rate can be avoided by using spread-bets where gains are free of tax. Many investors would be willing to hold shares if potential gains are taxed at a reasonable 18%.",
