        "background": "Defence chiefs have abandoned plans to raise a regiment of British Sikhs amid advice from the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) that the move would be branded racist. We the undersigned believe that such a more is not 'racist' and urge the Prime Minister to get the British Army to disregard the advice from the CRE and press ahead with plans to form the unit.\n\nThe Sikh community is whole-heartedly in favour of such a creation and this would help the UK armed forces meet it's recruitment quota and also increase the diversity of the armed forces.\n\nWe firmly believe that any accusations of 'racism' are wrong and unfounded.\n\nThe decision will also dismay Prince Charles, who has expressed an interest in the creation of dedicated units to boost the number of people from ethnic minorities in the services and to harness the military tradition of the Sikh faith in particular.",
