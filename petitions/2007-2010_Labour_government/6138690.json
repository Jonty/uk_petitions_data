Neither is an atheist\u2019s time or money parted through a life-long battle for self-righteousness in life and moral high-ground in death.  \n\nAtheists do not mutilate the genitals of their children and nor do they enslave them through arranged marriage.  Neither do they punish themselves through abstinence of nourishment, sexual satisfaction or any other illogical behavior.\n\nAtheists work, help others, and contribute to society without the presence of dogmatic belief or mental constraint.\n\nWe believe the teaching of religious mythology to children too immature to reason for themselves to be nothing short of child abuse, and incompatible with the civilised, pioneering legacy that our international admirers respect us for.",
