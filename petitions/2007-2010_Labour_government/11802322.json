            "background": "Independence means the creation of an English Parliament having full sovereignty over her own affairs and the right to choose her own system of government. This would give England the same rights and the same responsibilities as other nations,and would give us a voice on the world stage . It would unite her people; give them a country to be proud of. We want England to have what other countries take for granted\n\u2013 the freedom to decide what kind of society we want to live in and how we want to interact with the world around us. We want our communities to have more freedoms. We want to have a greater say in deciding how our public services should be funded and delivered, we want to participate in decisions which affect us, but it won't happen unless we start by taking control of our country and taking decisions for ourselves. The undersigned believe the nations of the United Kingdom should be equal, self-governing nations \u2013 partners - free to make our own choices.\n\nThe undersigned want England to become independent in a democratic referendum. If a majority of those who vote in a referendum vote for independence, we would call for elections to be held to elect a new English government.",
