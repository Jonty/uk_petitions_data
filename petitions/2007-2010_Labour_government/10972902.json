            "background": "I am petitioning for a reduction of 10p per pint on the duty levied on cask conditioned ale (defined as beer that undergoes secondary fermentation in the cask and can be dispensed by gravity without the need of external pressure).\nCask ale is unique to the United Kingdom and should be promoted and supported at every level. Along with our pubs, it is a living part of Britain's heritage and attraction.\nWith high demand for quality, locally brewed ales comes an opportunity to boost sales further by reducing the duty on this style of beer, creating more local jobs and offering greener deliveries through reduced delivery miles.\nIt should be noted that cask ale drinkers are not the binge drinkers causing problems on the streets, but are socially aware drinkers who respect their environment both in and out of the pubs they use. They should be supported as an example to fo;;ow, not penalised by high duty rates that do nothing to stem the tide of cheap supermarket alcohol. Our cask ale is envied and sought out by drinkers worldwide. \nNow is the time to see it given the Government backing it so richly deserves.",
