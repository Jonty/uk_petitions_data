        "background": "Please Mr Brown, I, and the innocent animals of the UK would be grateful if you could ban anything that unneccesarily puts an animal through harm. Some of which may be;\n\n1. Battery hen sheds where the chickens don't have room to move and are in the most appalling of conditions.\n\n2. The sale of real fur items in UK shops, whether this be clothes, soft furnishings etc. These animals are often skinned alive which is heartbreaking, not to mention the extreme pain the innocent animals go through needlessly.\n\n3. Impose a hefty jail sentence on those who organise or encourage dog fighting.\n\nPlease Mr Brown, find it in your heart to help the animals. Since you came in to power there has been a considerable positive change to the way the country is being run. There is only you that can but a final stop to all forms of animal cruelty. Please, please help.\nKind regards",
