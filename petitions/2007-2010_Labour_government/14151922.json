There is not enough information available to women about the dangerous side effects whilst using the Depo-Provera contraceptive injection.  Doctors ignore the fact any problems you may suffer can be down to this jab.  I myself have suffered with various side effects which now ive stopped taking the jab have all dissapeared but my doctor kept diagnosing problems and prescribing medication i didnt need - all i needed was to come off the jab.\nDoctors ignore women all round the world and this needs to stop so they can be helped",
