        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As the government, via its QUANGO Ofcom, have no wish to enforce EMC law in relation to the cessation of interference caused by Power Line Technology (also known as Broadband over Powerline and Power Line Adapters) to the HF radio spectrum, we the undersigned demand a new interference-free UHF frequency allocation to replace the current HF Citizen Band allocation. The new UHF allocation should be well away from any Amateur bands to negate the ability to illegally modify \"Ham\" kit. A maximum transmission power of 5 Watts with Frequency Modulation and 80 channels (spaced at 10kHz) plus the use of CTCSS/DCS will be provided as a minimum specification. The government will provide incentives to UK industry to produce new radios (and associated accessories) and introduce a \"scrappage scheme\" whereby new radios and aerials will attract a 50% government subsidy when HF CB equipment is taken to an approved supplier for exchange.",
