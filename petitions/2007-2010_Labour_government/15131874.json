            "background": "Recently in the news you will have all been hearing a lot about 'mephedrone' or 'meow' and the related deaths, which are deeply regreted. However it is time to see the bigger picture. In 2008 there were 9,031 alcohol related deaths. Yes we must remember alcohol is a drug too, yet there is never any mention of this in the papers? Prohibition clearly has not worked or else why would demand for these 'legal highs' be skyrocketing. \nIf we look at Holland there prisoner rate is one of the lowest in Europe, surely this is linked to the legalisation of cannabis there in 1978? Is it not time we adopted an intelligent approach and created a regulated market for these substances?\nThis not only would bring in much needed tax revenue in these hard economic times, it would also permit a 'harm minimisation' strategy that would take away trade from illegal drug gangs. Statistically they say 80 % of crime are caused by these gangs. It is time we had an intelligent debate and end the current doctrine, which is clearly not working and adopt a fresh mode of thinking that looks at the science and statistics. This would mark the start of a complete change in direction, not only in government, but for society as a whole.",
