        "background": "Stop wasting taxpayer's money to fund overseas nations that cannot or will not support their own people. If a nation can afford nuclear weapons (Pakistan and India) or its own Space Programme (India) why are we supporting projects to help their poor and disadvantaged millions. In Africa, corrupt governments steal international funds and neglect their own. Let us spend funds on our own. E.g. pensioners or to help pay our universities to train our own young.",
