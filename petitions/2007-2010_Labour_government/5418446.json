            "background": "Despite assurances that the treaty signed recently by Tony Blair would only be ratifying previous treaties, it has been found to contain most of the clauses of the failed constitution (with very little change) but has been set up so that each clause can be changed individually without recourse to the UK Parliament (or any other national government) or by referendum to the electorate.  This will, in effect bring in the 'European Constitution' by the back door. It is obvious that politicians can no longer be trusted to convey the wishes of the majority of the electorate on matters concerning our membership of the EU and we would therefore, be better of out of it before we are drawn irrevocably into a Federal Europe.",
