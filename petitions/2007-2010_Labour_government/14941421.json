            "background": "Aylesbury Vale District Council are trying to create a new town-sized development of 5390 houses, four schools, and a seconrary/grammar school in an area they call Salden Chase which joins onto West Bletchley and Milton Keynes so that the development disbenefit will accrue to the people of Bletchley and Milton Keynes, but the revenue and housing numbers will accrue to Aylesbury. There are many other areas within Aylesbury Vale more suited to such a development, and we would urge the Prime Minister to use his influence to make any such development well within Aylesbury Vale's own area and not try to make it look like an expansion area of Milton Keynes.",
