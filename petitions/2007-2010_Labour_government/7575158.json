            "background": "For too long we the general public have sat back and watched people starve to death on the news every week feeling no emotion for the countless numbers that die every year from malnutrition. I feel now is the time to act. I am only 16 years old but i refuse to live in a society where we  don't do enough to help those who need only the basic facilities to live, where we don't do enough for the population of countries like Zimbabwe, where we don't help feed the 58 million children who are currently starving all around the world. \nIt says in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nArticle 25.\n\n (1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food\nYet clearly around the world today people human rights are being violated and this government spend little money on helping to end world hunger.\nSo i plead to anyone who read this and feels even an ounce of pity for the 9 million people who will die this year because of malnutrition to sign this petition and maybe this will be the first step to helping end world hunger",
