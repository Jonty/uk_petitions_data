This could (obviously again) cause an accident; possibly very serious or even fatal.  People may feel it's unfair that anyone should be deprived of the freedom of the road due to a condition which is not within their control; I would agree but would also contend, VERY STRONGLY, that the right to use the road safely - and, ESPECIALLY, not to be an accident victim - should greatly supersede this.",
