Its players and managers have inspired, given hope to, and entertained young and old people alike for almost 100 years. The inland revenues reluctance to accept a compromise regarding the current situation could bring about the demise of this great northern football club and we believe that the views and hopes of the public, rather than the single minded views of the treasury, should be taken into consideration regarding this matter.",
