        "background": "Just because somebody commits an act of violence towards another person, and it's found out that they've played violent videogames in the past, does it mean that the game definitely influenced them to do it? No. Lots of people play videogames involving violence, but that doesn't mean they're going to go around killing people, does it? Take a step back and look at the big picture: videogames are just a small part of society, just like films and books, many of which also depict scenes of violence. But have we banned them? Of course not, that would be stupid. Oh wait, didn't we ban Manhunt for being violent? That was rather stupid, wasn't it?",
