        "background": "Being an investor on the Aim market, there is many shares which are manipulated and groups of people get together and destroy companies share prices by a term known as 'shorting' this makes the AIM market a very unfair trading arena and is detrimental to the success of many new and existing companies. It is full of crooks and should be stopped. Thousands who invest lose money by these tactics and I am asking the government to stop such things taking place as its not healthy for private investors nor the AIM market as a whole.",
