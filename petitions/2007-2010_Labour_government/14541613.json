        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I think that any revenue raised by speed cameras should be used to keep all roads safe and useable. This could be used in winter to keep roads clear and traffic moving, and to pay for the repair of pot holes and other essential work, including rural and pavements. This would not only make roads safer, but save money in the NHS and emergency services.",
