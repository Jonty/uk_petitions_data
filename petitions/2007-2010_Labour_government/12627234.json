        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A new law should be created that would make the abuse of the public purse a crime. There should be two parts to this crime: Wilful, i.e. deliberate, usually for personal gain; and by neglect, for example by incompetent management of a major government project. The National Audit Office should be given powers to arrest, charge and prosecute persons suspected of this new crime, and any person found guilty could be sacked from their position, and banned from public office and the civil service. There should also be an alternative method of bringing a prosecution, that could be used by bodies such as the Public Accounts Committee and the Audit Commission. The law should also enable the interim suspension of further spending on a project linked to a case of abuse of the public purse. All contracts signed by a person found guilty of abuse of the Public Purse would be subsequently reviewed and declared null and void if the continuation of the contract perpetuates the Public Purse abuse. This law should also apply to third parties who fail to deliver a service that has been paid for by the Public Purse, for reasons of incompetence or personal gain.",
