I firmly believe that if they were obliged to charge per mile throughout the UK they would earn just as much revenue as they do now and we would all be a great deal happier.In days gone by BR had by law to sell 'workmens returns' which were far cheaper for regular commuters whereas now they charge as much as they can get away with  to travel before 10 etc.",
