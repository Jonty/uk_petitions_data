            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "How can the government allow gas and electricity companies to raise utility prices by upto 20% whilst working under the climate of sub inflation pay rises. The water industry is regulated so as companies must keep bills stable for 5 yrs and then show how any rises will be passed to the customer in terms of a better service. \nIt should be illegal for any rise to be passed to the consumer whislt allowing astronomical profit - causing thousands of people (usually elderly or low income households) to struggle to have the necessity of heat and warmth.",
