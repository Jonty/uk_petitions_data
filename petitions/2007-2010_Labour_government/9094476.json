Minimum of 3 years.\nNot only would this be a Deterrent it would also allow Offenders time away from their Environments, and, have pride, respect and Common Sense towards others!\nAt the very least it would take the Idiots who find themselves in front of a Judge some constructive work and allow good ethics to be set in place.",
