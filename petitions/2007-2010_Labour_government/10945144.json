            "background": "The big energy firms have refused to cut household bills despite a huge reduction in crude oil and gas prices. Politicians, unions and customer groups have condemned suppliers for failing to pass on their savings and yet nothing is being done. Price hikes of up to 44% are swelling their coffers at great expense and hardship to the British public. The government should force the power companies, under threat of nationalisation, to reduce their bills as quickly as they increase them.",
