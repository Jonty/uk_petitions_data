When our daughter-in-law could do with 'grandma's emergency help' there is no hope she will get it. As a Moroccan, grandma has to have a visa. It takes an age to negotiate with the British Consulate and has even been refused on a technicality. Me? A 12-year RAF pilot. A security-cleared MoD civil servant for 25 years. It makes no sense when the UK is being flooded with non-Brit incomers of every other random kind, many of them 'hardly legals'.",
