        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The residents of Eastham Village are fighting back against the proposed construction of a biodeisel plant less than 200 meters from our homes.  We are concerned about the impact we believe it will have on local air quality and public health.  The Bioessence plant will operate a form of incineration with dangerous emissions of Nitrus Oxide and of fine particals including PM 10 and PM 2.5.  Nitrus Oxide emissions are linked to respiratory diseases, including ASTHMA.  Fine particle emissions, in particular PM 2.5 have been linked with premature deaths and heart and respiratory illnesses and have also been linked to cot death!  Permission to build this plant had been refused in Belgium, Germany and Holland, why should we stand for this?!",
