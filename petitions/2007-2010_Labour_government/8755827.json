        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Adult fare on bus and railway networks is applied when a customer is over sixteen years of age. However adult priveledges such as drinking, voting and even adult minimum wage are not given until eighteen. Therefore classing sixteen year olds as adults is untrue and wrongly justified. I would like to abolish all adult fare on buses and railway for people under the age of eighteen.",
