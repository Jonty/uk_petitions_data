        "background": "We wish to ban cycling on all canals, due to the inherent danger of wheeled vehicles mixing with pedestrians on a narrow pavement designed only for pedestrians and horses. \n\nThe growth of cycling over recent years has made cyclists discover the canals. This is now causing pedestrians undue stress from cyclists whom believe they have the right of way. With the growth of cycle routes, there is no need to allow cycling on canal towpaths.\n\nWe also believe that stringent enforcement and on the spot fines are used to police this sanction.",
