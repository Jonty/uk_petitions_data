            "background": "Darwin was undoubtedly one of this country\u2019s greatest scientists and one of the world\u2019s most significant thinkers, and his work has given humanity profound insight into our origins and elemental nature. Those insights and their scientific basis take an important place in the psyche of many rationalist, and religious, people in the United Kingdom. As the established church, of which Westminster Abbey is a part, the Church of England has a responsibility cater to the \u2018spiritual\u2019 needs of all people irrespective of the nature of their beliefs, or non-belief. \n\nAs such Darwin deserves to be commemorated at a national level, and what better place than Westminster Abbey, not only the focus of commemorations of national importance but the place where Darwin is buried.",
