Nothing should be for free, after all the people who provide the funding have to work for it. Maybe the prospect of cleaning up the local area five days a week for benefits would provide the necessary encouragement to seek a better wage. Able to work and don't, no benefits, simple. After all if you're working hard there's less likelihood of being bored and getting into bother. The country and the local area also benefit from the constant attention to its appearance. More tourists, more wealth, more jobs.",
