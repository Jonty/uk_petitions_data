            "background": "wHEN immigration laws changed here it would spell nothing but trouble,and how right we where..if we dont have enough trouble with our legal system trying to convict rapist or drink driver's (who kill) and are being let off with very lite sentances..but as we now face the problem that immigrants know our laws well and how soft we are,and they know how to abuse the system here and shout human rights at every turn..but i feel it wont be long before the justice system will let us down when immigrants rape or murder people and the sentances will be soft on them..which i know in the end will cause public out cry and people will take the law into there own hands and serve justice themself's..as we speak now that they are saying in national papers that an immigrant is being arrested evey 4 minutes for theft..but how much longer before it gets more serious crimes of rape and murder..we as a great nation have stood by each other when the system has let us down in one way or another..so what i hoping for that immigrants that break our laws should be deported with out trial however big or small the crime is.if the crime is serious then we sentance them here and then when they are released they are deported..",
