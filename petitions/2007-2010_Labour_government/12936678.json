It is time to stop.\n\nEducation is too important to us, to our children and to the future of this country to be used as another issue in party politics.\n\nIn the national interest, put the education of our children in the hands of an independent body, one that has all party agreement, run by people qualified in education, with experience and expertise in Nurseries, Schools and classrooms, Colleges and Universities.",
