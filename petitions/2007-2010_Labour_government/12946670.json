            "background": "Back in 2005 the government planned to spend \u00a3680 million on keeping schools open from between 8am and 6pm. What happened to this proposal?\nI believe it should be introduced.\nThe benefits are huge. More parents able to work a full working day which would bring a higher income to many families. It would also reduce the need for after school childcare. \nIncrease in educational ability of our children. Chinese children spend on average 8.5 hours in school a day compared to the 6 in the UK.\nGive children a better idea of what a full working day is.\nThe additional time could be used to increase the amount of P.E. and exercise that children do decreasing the rising levels of obesity.\nLife lessons could be given to teach basic entrepreneurship, money management, home economics. All of the skills that seem to have been lost in the last two decades.\nThis introduction would supply a huge boost to the UK ecnmomy.",
