Sickle Cell can be extremely difficult; it is not only harmful to ones physical health but can often take a toll on emotional & mental health.\n\nSufferers are discriminated within schools, colleges, universities, work, medical health & government organisations. Sickle Cell sufferers should not have basic healthcare needs neglected! Basic needs such as free prescriptions & the amount of research invested will improve quality of life & help prevent complications that lead to death. Sickle Cell is one of the most commonly inherited genetic disorders in the country with over 12,000 diagnosed & over 200,000 carriers. Unless Disability Discrimination Act policies are in place, jobs, pensions & salaries are in jeopardy due to time taken off due to Crises. Sickle Cell Sufferers deserve equal rights & acknowledgement sufferers of other chronic & debilitating illnesses within the Disability Discrimination Act & should be protected from discrimination within society.",
