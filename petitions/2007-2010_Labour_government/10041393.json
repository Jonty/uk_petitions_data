        "background": "As a tax paying citizen of Scotland, the United kingdom and Europe I should not be discriminated against or offered a lower rate of exchange or charged Commission or refused sale for using Scottish Money in England, Europe or any foreign Country or have to convert it into English notes first.\nI no longer find it acceptable that my elected members cannot find parlimentary time to sort out the mess of the UK currency, or deal with the discrimination that people using Scottish and N. Irish Banknotes often face.\nEither sort it or give us all the same currency as i fear the resentment and embarrasment felt when Scots and Northern Irish face refusal or are discrimnated against with lower rates of exchange will not help with European or British unity.",
