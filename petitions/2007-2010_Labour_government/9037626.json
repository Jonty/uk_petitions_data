        "action": "change the law to extend the privilege of tax free expenses (paid for by the taxpayer) used for the purpose of buying items totally unrelated to the carrying out of the job, such as new quad bikes, iPods and plasma screen TVs, which are allowable on MPs expenses, to the rest of the population.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is absolutely NO justification for any employee who is paid for out of public funds garnered under threat of criminalisation if they are not paid, including elected representatives, to be allowed to purchase ANYTHING which is not directly required to assist in the carrying out of the job, on expenses.  If MPs are to be allowed to retain this facility then it must be on the basis that the facility is extended also to every taxpayer in the country who must be allowed to purchase these very same items and deduct the value from the amount of income tax handed over to government each year.",
