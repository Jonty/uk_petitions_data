        "background": "We believe that this man has done everything, and given everything to our school. He has served at Aston for over 30 years. His enthusiasm has helped pupils for years to enjoy English and he has inspired many to continue studying English further.\n\nCycling to school everyday, wearing many a variation of tweed suits, coaching cricket teams, he is THE ultimate British gentleman, and deserves recognistion for his service to education!\n\nHe is truly inspirational to all the boys he has taught at K.E. VI Aston, and defines an 'unforgettable' teacher.\n\nHe has become a bit of a local legend among many local schools who have heard about his legendary teaching and sport coaching. \n\nA quote from a rugby match he voluntarily coached \"Remeber Dunkirk!\". A prime example of his sense of tradition and great Britishness.\n\nIf anyone deserves to be an official 'Member of the British Empire' it is William Gurney.",
