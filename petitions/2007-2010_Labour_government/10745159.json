            "background": "We call on the Post Office to abandon their proposal to close the Post Office Branch at 213 Crookes Valley Rd.  Neither of the 2 nearest branches specified as alternatives offer practical access to Post Office services to people with limited mobility due either to steep terrain and substantial walking distance or the infrequency of the bus service.  Removing this post office will in fact deny services to many older and disabled customers.",
