They are using a 50 year old technology and ignoring the viable option of undergrounding these new cables. Undergrounding does have a higher cost (although not as high as National Grid would like you to believe), but what price do you put on a beautiful landscape. If you support undergrounding of these power lines please sign this petition.\n\nThanks you.",
