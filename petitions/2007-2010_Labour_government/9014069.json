            "background": "Over many years council tax increases have been several times higher than the rate of inflation, more than doubling the the total amount payable by each household. Local authorities during this same period have increased revenue from several other sources (Parking and congestion charges etc) while at the same time reduced the services they provide. Council tax should be limited to inflation increases only and not as authorised by central government around five percent. How can inflation busting increases be justified year on year when we are led to believe efficiency drives in local government are reducing costs.",
