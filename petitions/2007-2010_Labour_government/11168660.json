            "action": "use the British taxpayers' status as the majority shareholder in Royal Bank of Scotland (as of 28 November 2008) to usher in far more equitable, transparent and consistent lending policies toward exisiting mortgage customers. And, specifically, actively to discourage RBS from using cuts in the BOE base rate as an opportunity to boost profit margins at the direct expense of mortgage customers.",

            "background": "UK banks continue cynically to use changes in the Bank Of England (BOE) base rate to exploit customer inertia and boost their profit margins on mortgage products. \n \nOn 6 November 2008 the BOE cut its base rate by an unprecedented 1.5% to 3%, the lowest level since 1955. \n\nFollowing a good deal of pressure from the Government, and a media outcry, RBS in common with other major banks and building societies reluctantly passed on the rate cut to customers. Or did they? The mortgage interest rate of tens of thousands of variable rate 'One Account\u2019 (wholly owned by RBS) customers has, in fact, remained completely unchanged (as of 29 November '08). However, this has somehow passed 'underneath the radar'. \n \nWe're talking about serious amounts of money here - \u00a3250 a month for someone with a mortgage of \u00a3200,000.\n\nWith the British taxpayer now owning a majority stake in RBS, the government has a unique opportunity to demonstrate that it is prepared to intervene in situations where a state-owned (or majority-owned) business is acting in a way that flies so blatantly in the face of government wishes, values and rhetoric...not to mention basic standards of fairness and openness with customers.",
