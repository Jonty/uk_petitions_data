        "background": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to review the  tough medical test, called the work capability assessment (WCA), which is at the heart of controversial changes to sickness benefit that were introduced last October when employment support allowance (ESA) replaced incapacity benefit (IB) for new claimants.\nThe test contains a series of questions, called \"descriptors\", that relate to physical and mental functions, and from which claimants score points. The test fails to include questions relating to energy, stamina, illness and malaise. which affects people with M.E. (Chronic fatigue syndrome) Instead, it focuses on specific physical functions, such as reaching, bending and continence. In some cases, the \"descriptors\" are the same as they were in the IB test, but are now awarded fewer points, making the test harder to pass.",
