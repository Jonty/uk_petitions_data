If I had a sgillinn for the number of times I've gone the wrong way down a one way street, or ended up outside the Thurso Arms instead of the local wildlife reserve (it's often difficult to tell the difference, especially with the trouble I've been having with the optometrist) I'd be sitting on a whole cnoc of them. Please help me by signing this petition and striking a blow for short-sighted Gaelic twitchers everywhere!",
