            "background": "We would like to ask you to update the law as to the limit of 3 years to make a claim after an injury caused by a third party. A criminal who injures a person, can be made to go to court to answer for thier actions, many years after they have commited an injury. An injury in some cases, as you know can be ever lasting. A person who causes an ijury to another should be held responsable no matter how long it takes to go to court.",
