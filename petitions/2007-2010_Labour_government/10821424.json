            "background": "As part of the plans to centralise HMRC business, the Government has proposed to reduce the staff levels in Aberdeen tax office at Ruby House.\n\nThe office in Aberdeen has seen steady reductions in staff over the last 2 years. Up to 70 more jobs are likely to be lost before 2011, with the long term future of the office remaining unclear. \n\nThe job losses will have a serious effect on the local economy and customer service can only suffer as a result of this proposed action by HMRC. \n\nCentralisation of Government departments is having a devastating effect on towns and cities like Aberdeen. Our local economies are being run down and our share of public sector jobs are being withdrawn in favour of those who live in larger cities in the UK, resulting in Civil Service job opportunities being lost to our Community forever. \n\nPlease help save the jobs in our office and keep a presence in Aberdeen for many years to come by signing this petition and taking a stand against centralisation of public sector jobs.",
