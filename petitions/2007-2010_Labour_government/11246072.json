We get stupid laws and endless red tape about what we can and can't do.over that period it cost each member of the poulation (pop. 59million est.) \u00a3678 and that is just the net loss. We could count the whole \u00a3104bn as it was not spend in ways that we would have spent it if we were independent. that meant it cost every U.K citizen \u00a31,763 per year.GET US OUT!",
