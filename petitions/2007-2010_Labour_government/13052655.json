            "background": "NHS Audiology departments continue to provide a restricted range of hearing aid solutions via hospital based ENT departments. Despite attempts to modernise these services, waiting lists are still too long. Elderly patients in particular are forced to endure a reduced quality of life while on the waiting list and then often find they are dissatisfied with the solution provided because they have little or no choice of the style or complexity of the solution provided. I urge the prime minister to reform this service and allow the release of funding via a voucher system to allow improved access to hearing support services.",
