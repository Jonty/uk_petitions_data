            "background": "We the undersigned request that the government make holocaust denial unlawful, as it is in many other countries.\n\nFree speech is a human right, but it is being badly abused when it incites racial hatred, as it does when people deny that the holocaust took place.  To debate with them, is giving them a legitimacy that they do not deserve.  In addition, it is providing misinformation to gullible and malicious people.\n\nWe wish that it was not necessary for the UK to take this step, but the fact that people have attended conferences on holocaust denial and there are websites devoted to the subject, show that it is quite well organised.  Worryingly, there is increasing antisemitsm in this country and  at this time it is necessary to show how unacceptable it is to express such views.",
