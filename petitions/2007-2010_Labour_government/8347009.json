        "action": "NOT reduce the time limit for legal abortions in the light of increased levels of survival of premature babies",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It may be true that more premature babies are surviving at lower and lower periods of gestation; but how many of them suffer disabilities of one sort or another and how will such disabilities affect their lives? (not to mention their parent's/s' ability to care for them).  I would also make the point, VERY STRONGLY, that survivability rates at specific gestation periods is TOTALLY IRRELEVANT to the abortion debate in which the issue is NOT whether the foetus would survive if born at a specific point in the pregnancy but how the pregnant woman feels about the pregnancy, how the forced continuation of it would affect her and any already-existing children, and what sort of life the foetus would have if its birth was forced by refusal of abortion.",
