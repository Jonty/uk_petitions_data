            "background": "In a time of breakdown of family life, the government needs to look at stopping Bank Holiday trading. This year, more and more retailers are open longer hours over Christmas, using the excuse that December 26th is on a Saturday and trading normal hours. They are also treating December 28th and New Years day as normal trading days rather than open reduced hours. All these days, and other Bank Holidays should become trading free to allow more family time,which has all but been eroded by greedy high street retailers.",
