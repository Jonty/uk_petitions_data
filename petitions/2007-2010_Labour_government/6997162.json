            "background": "All continental speed camera's capture the offenders face, and speeding fines although much smaller are paid quickly because of this.  I am asking for us to do this in Britain.  This way the offender is identified and would pay a smaller fine much quicker.  This would reduce the time most courts are sitting to argue about who was driving.  I am sure the authorities would welcome the fact that they would then be able to identify the driver of any car on the day it was caught by a speed camera, so saving time and court costs.",
