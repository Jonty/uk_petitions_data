            "background": "This idea is loosely based on American Federalism and would allow power to be devolved back to the traditional counties. Each county would elect a Mayor (or Governor) and an Assembly, similar to that of London, to hold the executive to account and pass secondary legislation. The idea would help tackle the problem of the West Lothian Question and make local politics more interesting and relevant. It may even be possible for the Mayor/Governor to appoint a representative for the county who would then sit in the reformed House of Lords, reflecting the way in which Senators represent their respective American state in the Senate.",
