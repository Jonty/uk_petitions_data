The \"Give Your Vote\" campaign recently launched on the internet enables people to do just that. It is an affront to British democracy and an insult to British voters that people on the other side of the world who have never contributed anything to British society should be given a vote which is equal to a British citizen's vote. It is astonishing that such action is even legal. Take action now to make it impossible for foreign nationals to vote in our elections or for British voters to give their vote to foreign nationals.",
