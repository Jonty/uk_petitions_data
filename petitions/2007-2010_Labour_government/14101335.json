            "background": "Fridays have been synonymous with the art of frying for time immemorial. From greasy spoon fry-ups to deep-fried fish and chip suppers, the British public has long had an affiliation with the consumption of anything fried on a Friday. In the current economic climate it is vital that we support our local businesses as the lifeblood of the community. We humbly propose that the simple transposition of one letter thus making Friday become Fryday will serve to impress upon the public conciousness an inherent desire to frequent such aforementioned establishments, from independent sole-traders through to multi-national corporations, contributing to fiscal recovery through subliminal advertising and national pride without any additional marketing costs to the taxpayer. Support your local businesses and make a frying start to a great weekend with a Fryday!",
