Those who choose to disregard this duty are justifiably penalised with being denied the vote.\n\nThis farcical ruling, which states that disenfranchising prisoners is in breach of their 'human rights', merely highlights the irresponsibility of the European federal state which seemingly seeks to impose hyped-up liberalism in its most vacuous form. \n\nThe undersigned are deeply apprehensive and displeased with this decision. We seek an act of good will by the Prime Minister and Parliament to restore confidence in the judicial system and in our working democracy.",
