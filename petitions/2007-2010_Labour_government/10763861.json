            "background": "Currently 16+ young people in England can be paid up to \u00a330 a week to attend School/college courses.\n  Natrually it is dependant on family imcome. But there are several ways the system can be exploited. \n  For example if parents are seperated only the imcome of one parent is considered. Regardless of money provided by the other parent.\n  Also in cases where parents are retired, such are there riches again, this is not taken into consideration.\n  In addition to this I belive the government should take into account the number of children in a family, before deciding whether a young person is entitled to tax payers money in order to gain further education.",
