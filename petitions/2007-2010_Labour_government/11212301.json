            "background": "We understand that ITV are to cut jobs at Central News East, merging it with Central News West. Meaning that we will receive about six minutes of news, weather and Sport relevant to us here in the East Midlands. This is a large area and so the relevance of regional news, weather and sport will become meaningless. We want ITV to reconsider its options on cost cutting and keep this area as it is at present. Regional news is important to us here in the region. It keeps us informed on local issues and good causes. By reducing that and merging our news with another region means that we will lose a lot of information relevant to us.",
