This means many dogs of two mixed non banned breeds are seized and put to death just because of what they look like without them actually ever hurting or showing any intention of hurting anyone or anything...if this was done with people it would be rightly so called rascism!\nWe believe that a dog should only be taken away if it poses a threat and not because of what it looks like... even though it is a much loved family pet\n\npunish the DEED not the BREED",
