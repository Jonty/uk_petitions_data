        "background": "on a basic salary of \u00a364k, it is unnecessary for mps to need further funding. they have proven recently they cannot be trusted to use tax payers money with respect, wisdom and without abuse.when they take these obscene amounts from the public purse to fund overly lavish lifestyles (when have duck houses been an essential requirement?) they are effectively stealing from the health service, education, pensioners etc. this money could be better used to provide our troops with essential equipment or to raise the standard of living for hardworking individuals and families. this money could be used towards paying of the national debt this country has been lumbered with. do higher earnings attract talented people? this recession proves not. as hardworking people face a future of belt tightening, insecurity and fear, our mps abuse the public purse and steal our money without a twinge of conscience.",
