        "background": "\"Booze Britain\" and \"Binge Drinking\" have become tabloid regulars. Doctors and Health officials regularly express concern over excessive alcohol consumption. Police and Hospital resources are being used to attend to drunks. This petition has been created in an attempt to tackle the problem.\n\nWe request that the government introduce 0% tax on beers/lagers/ciders which have, say, 3% ABV and below.  The lost revenues to be recouped by increasing the tax on high ABV beers/lagers/ciders, say 6% and above and also increase tax on alcopops.\n\nThis would 1. encourage people to switch to lower ABV drinks; 2. encourage brewers to brew lower ABV drinks; 3. leave a majority of \"regular\" drinks such as bitter etc. unchanged; 4. discourage the consupmtion of extra strong beers etc.",
