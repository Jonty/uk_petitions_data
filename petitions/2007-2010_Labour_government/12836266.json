        "background": "The recent Digital Britain report outlined by Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw in Parliament includes a proposal to allow up to \u00a3130m of BBC licence fee money to be allocated to ITV to fund certain programmes. Mr Bradshaw said in the House of Commons that the BBC did not have \"exclusive rights\" to the licence fee.\n\nWhat Mr Bradshaw seemingly fails to recognise is that ITV is a commercial TV station. It is funded on it's principal of showing commercial media - adverts.\n\nThe public should not be forced to PAY for being force fed adverts?\n\nThis is wrong and should be stopped now!",
