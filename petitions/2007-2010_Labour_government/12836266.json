Mr Bradshaw said in the House of Commons that the BBC did not have \"exclusive rights\" to the licence fee.\n\nWhat Mr Bradshaw seemingly fails to recognise is that ITV is a commercial TV station. It is funded on it's principal of showing commercial media - adverts.\n\nThe public should not be forced to PAY for being force fed adverts?\n\nThis is wrong and should be stopped now!",
