            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Any British Citizen living and working in an EU member state who needs to renew a British passport are currently charged extortionate fees by the British Embassy in that country, i.e. in Spain the current price for renewing an adult passport is approx 140 euros.  According to British Law, any person who resides in an EU Member State country other than Britain for more than 180 days cannot apply for or renew a passport in the UK as they are classed as non-residents and therefore have to, by law, apply to the relevant British Embassy but are then penalised by paying these extortionate fees!!  Our Human Rights are clearly being breached by working and living in another EU Member State!!",
