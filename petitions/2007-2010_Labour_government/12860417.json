        "background": "Thames Water, a company that recently announced record profits, has written to the all-party House of Commons environment committee requesting to be allowed to cut the water supply of late-paying customers to a trickle. \n\nThis is currently disallowed on public health grounds.\n\nThames water proposes to allow non-paying customers the equivalent of a jug of water per household per day, but although a spokesperson says that this will only be aimed at persistent non-payers, once a law is passed it's use tends to become more and more common, and it surely won't be long before families struggling to make ends meet in the recession will be faced with having their essential water supply cut off.",
