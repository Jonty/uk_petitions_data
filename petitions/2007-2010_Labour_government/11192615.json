        "background": "We all need to do our bit to help reduce Global Warming. Recycling is something we can all do to help, but is the government doing enough to help us, help? We are one of the worst countries for recycling, and i feel we should be setting a better example, as we are one of the most powerful countries in the world. I think, if recycling bins were introduced on our streets, it would be easy to  sort out our rubbish, instead of just throwing it away in a normal rubbish bin. For example, separate bins for paper, glass, cans etc. but in the style of a normal public bin.  I have been to other countries in europe, and they are doing loads to recycle, including the recycling bins in public areas. I have also seen this in a few places in the UK, but there is not enough of them. \nMy name is Rebecca Townsend and I am a 16 year old student in year 11, living in South Gloucestershire. I think its important that we recycle and do as much as we can do help our planet, as it is my generations and the generation to come, that will suffer from Global Warming.",
