            "background": "All immigrants should have to complete the full driving test and obtain a british licence before they are able to drive in the uk. The increase in raod accidents is alarming. In the East of england the majority of incidents are caused by polish immigrants who drink and drive. Also before a transport of goods can cross into the uk the driver should also have to pass our test as lorry accidents are very high and the highway code is not being adhered too. If not then we should insist that the vehicle is excanged and driven by a uk citizen to complete the transport of goods.",
