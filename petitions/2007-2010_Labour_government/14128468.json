            "background": "The present practice of charging higher rates than local calls via 0845, 0870 and even 0800 numbers cease. Many needy people now only have a mobile phone and are charged higher than 'normal' or 'local' rates when contacting these numbers from most mobile phones. Companies should not be able to gain financially when someone contacts them about a product or service or for advise other than a 'premium' rate service. Government agencies should not use these numbers and a suitable 01, 02, 03 number should be provided",
