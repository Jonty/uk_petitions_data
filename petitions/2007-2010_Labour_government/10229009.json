They are composed of pieces of wood/card/plastic with glue on one side which animals become stuck to, often struggling for up to five days before they die due to starvation or dehydration.  These animals become extremely distressed, and have been known to chew off their own limbs or rip the fur from their bodies in an attempt to escape.\nThe RSPCA are aginst the use of these devices against rodents \"because of the suffering they cause\".\nThis kind of cruelty is unacceptable and the law should reflect this.",
