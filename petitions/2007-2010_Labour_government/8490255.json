        "background": "The Archbishop has shown an incredible lack of understanding of the impact of Sharia Law and the lack of status it allows women - it is not the solution to promoting an understanding society. Sharia law was veto-ed by the EEC as it does not uphold the basic tenants of human rights.\nHolding the position of Archbishop gives him the opportunity to defend these human rights - he has failed in a spectacular manner - it is time to give the opportunity to someone else.",
