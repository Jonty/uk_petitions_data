        "background": "Having been in discussion with Winchester CC on the usage of Blue Badge for my mother, who is disabled and visiting from SA, I have found out that while her disabled badge together with a letter from the WCC will be valid, it is, however, not necessarily valid in Southampton, Portsmouth, London or other places outside of Hampshire, which we are likely to visit.  I have been advised that I have to apply to the respective governing bodies for each city or town either for another letter or for a Blue Badge issued by the respective council.  To me this absolute ridiculous and a complete waste my money as a tax and council tax payer. I am sure we are not alone in this mess of unnecessary bureaucracy.  As your ministers are currently looking at ways on how to reduce costs in this tight economic time we are going through, I look forward to your giving this your immediate attention to ensure that one standard process is put in place that is usable in every county, town and village.",
