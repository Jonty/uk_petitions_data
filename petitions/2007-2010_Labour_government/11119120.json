These sorts of ciminals should be incarcerated for life for their crimes, without consideration of their Human Rights which in my opinion they forfeited by perpetrating such a heinous crimes.  If they are released We, the Law abiding members of society have a right to know where and who they are so that we can benefit from our Human Right to know that we and our loved ones are safe.  Their Human rights were served by the fact that they were not put to death by this forgiving society for their crimes.  Lets protect the innocent not the guilty'",
