        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The appeal for the siting of a snack wagon at Wilsford lay-by on the A153 near Sleaford has again been refused  by the Inspectorate. The lay-by is close to a level crossing and the highways department is saying the it  has the highest accident rate in the area. Having proved from accident reports from the Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership that this is not so we are still fighting the objections to this application to trade from the lay-by. Drivers and especially truck drivers have no-where else to stop for breaks in this area. The lay-by has been in situ for many years and as reports show the few accidents in the past 3 years were not caused by traffic entering or leaving the lay-by. These were caused by drivers errors.  Please add your name to this petition if you feel that this refusal in an injustice to the single mother who is earning a living for herself and her daughter and not living off the state.",
