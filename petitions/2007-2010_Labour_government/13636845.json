        "background": "The Tote's profits totally remain in horseracing, and so by selling the Tote to a private company could mean that the profits will be paid out to shareholders instead of remaining in racing.\nIt could also mean that any less profitable parts of the business (e.g. at smaller racecourses etc) could be withdrawn - losing jobs and seriously affecting racing.\nHorseracing itself is a very important part of the economy employing thousands of people and putting the Tote at risk and it's contribution to racing.\nPlease leave the Tote as it is to protect it, it's employees, and horseracing.",
