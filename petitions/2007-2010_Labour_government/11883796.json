            "background": "If the Govt reversed the decision to up the age to 55 this will release more money into the economy. Private pensions are just that private and the fact the govt raised this to 55 for civil servants has put a lot of private pension holders in the muck.I missed out by 8 days so am biased but think that it will release money to go into the economy.",
