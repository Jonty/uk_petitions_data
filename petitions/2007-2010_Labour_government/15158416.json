            "background": "In the most recent episode of Channel 4's 'Dispatches', Baroness Sally Morgan admitted using her contacts and influence as a Member of the House of Lord to help an educational organisation secure a \u00a350m government contract. She has asked Questions in the House of Lords about diabetes treatment for children, without notifying the House that she had a prior interest being on the board of a pharmaceutical company which is conducting research into this area, and admitted she can \"push a direction on policy\". The reputation of the Upper Chamber and of the Labour Party suffer by allowing Baroness Morgan continued membership, and she should be stripped of the Party Whip so that she can no longer use her public position to dilute standards in public life.",
