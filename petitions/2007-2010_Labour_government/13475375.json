            "background": "At present it is known that both England and Wales have free bus passes, (it is not known if Scotland or N. Ireland have the same provisions if so they could be included). There are no reciprical cross border arrangements. When over sixty's go to Wales from England or vis versa they are unable to use their bus pass in opposite locations. It makes sense that if two or four areas provide the same facilities they should be able to accept any bus pass provided from other areas.",
