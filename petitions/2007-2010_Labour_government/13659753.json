        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "On motorways and dual carraigeways HGV are overtaking with very little relative speed difference, causing a rolling roadblock. This overtaking procedure frequently takes a mile and in a lot of cases 2 or 3 miles. There is recorded case of 9 miles. Due to speed restricters, the relative speed difference between two HGV can be 0.1mph. Also it has been noted that the relative speed difference changes due to slope and as such the overtaken can become the overtakee and as such two HGV's  can 'duel' for miles causing massive queues. Educate / enforce to drivers to realise that an extra 0.1mph will not speed their journey by more than a minute, but will hold up a many vans, buses and cars.",
