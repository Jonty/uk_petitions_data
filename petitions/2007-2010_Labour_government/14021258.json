            "background": "Jeremy Brett who died September 12 1995 was never formally recognised for his many roles on film, stage and tv. His acting career dates back to the early 1950's.  He is of course most famously known for his role as Sherlock Holmes. he once presented a BAFTA award but he himself never got one which was an insult given the masterclass actor that he was. And even today 14 years after his death, his most famous role is still giving entertainment to many millions around the world. Surely one of our most talented and remarkable actors should be given the long overdue recognition he so rightly deserves.",
