            "background": "Families who have lost a loved one to criminal activity overseas can wait years for justice.  This protraction causes unnecessary trauma for the families who are embroiled in complicated legal affairs, often in another language and always in foreign law.   \nAt the moment the family of a victim of manslaughter/murder committed abroad may have to wait several years just for a trial date to be set.\nThe lines of communication between justice departments in the UK and those abroad are currently convoluted and restricted.\nBritish citizens should have the active support of their own government to ensure that they are not subjected to delays or put at the bottom of a foreign body's 'to do' list.\nA British death abroad is treated as inconvenient.  Even within the EU there is a terrible reluctance to offer justice to British victims.  Moreover, we are left powerless because any criticism of the foreign legal system can be so frowned upon as to hinder the process further.",
