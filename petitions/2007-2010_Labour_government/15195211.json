I have recently noticed the increase in sick people on facebook there is people on the groups thinking it is right for babys or young children to be killed it is sick and why should people have to see this? Something serious needs to be done to stop this as it looks like facebook are doing nothing to stop these people and they dont make it easy for you to contact them either. These children should be left to r.i.p without people saying they deserved it.",
