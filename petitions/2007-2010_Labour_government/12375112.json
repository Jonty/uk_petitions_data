            "background": "Proposals before the EU parliament to limit access to the internet across Europe are to be voted on very soon, this will potentially allow internet service providers to have a system like that of the popular Satelite TV providers \"Packages\".\n\nFor more information just google \"EU Blackout\"\n\n\nIf passed, the new law will permit your broadband provider to impose \"conditions limiting access to and/or use of services and applications\". Downloading via P2P will almost certainly be forbidden, and blacklists and whitelists are on the hidden agenda, but the proposals also covers copyright enforcement (3-strikes) and risk permitting sinister forms of filtering the networks. They threaten fundamental freedoms for everyone who uses the Internet and anyone who has a website.",
