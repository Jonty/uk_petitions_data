            "background": "Children of age 16 \"School-leavers\" are encouraged to have an injection at school that contains MMR, Diphtheria, Polio, and Tetanus.  While this single \"all-in-one\" should be an option, we believe that parents should also have the choice of individual vaccinations under the NHS.  Currently this is not an option; parents have to pay \u00a3100 upwards to have separate injections. If they cannot afford this, they may simply opt-out of all vaccine boosters.\nWe therefore petition that the choice of separate, or other combinations of, vaccines is made available under the NHS to parents of school-leavers.",
