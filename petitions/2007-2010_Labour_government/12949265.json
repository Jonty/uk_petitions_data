            "background": "We petition the Government to intervene and stop the merger. We believe Thurrock and Basildon College can provide excellence in education for its communities. We believe a merger will not improve education for learners and communities of Basildon and Thurrock. The new building programme in Grays is now delayed. We believe there is a real opportunity for Thurrock and Basildon College to work with its Acting Principal and exceed the results of SEEC. We see the merge with SEEC as a takeover and asset stripping exercise and not in the interests of our local communities.",
