        "background": "Since the beginning of 2008 staff have been cut back by half at the resource centres in the London Borough of Sutton. This is effecting opening hours and group sessions and number of clients able to access the service. Although the NHS is trying to modify the overall provision of all services, this is causing setbacks which in the long run could be more costly to the government, through acute and forensic costs. We feel that the mental health services, instead of being improved, are being deteriorated, at everyone's expense.",
