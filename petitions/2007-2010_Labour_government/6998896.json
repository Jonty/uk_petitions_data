            "background": "Whilst the majority of traders are honest, hard working people, there are a few rogues who often prey on the most vulnerable people in our society. These are people who charge high prices, apply pressure on potential customers (often through deception) to agree to have the work undertaken and often do the work to a poor standard. Blaby District Council and the Leicestershire Constabulary have set up \"No Cold Calling Zones\" in an attempt to prevent rogue traders putting pressure on the elderly and vulnerable on their doorsteps. Reputable traders have nothing to fear from such Zones and indeed may see their own businesses and the reputation of their fellow professionals benefit. However, these Zones do not have any legal force and so can be breached almost with impunity.\n\nLegal force to \"No Cold Calling Zones\" will protect the vulnerable in our society without harming the business of the decent, honest traders.",
