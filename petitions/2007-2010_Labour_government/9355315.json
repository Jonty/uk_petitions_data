This will then give us English our own day as the Scottish, Welsh and Irish all have their own days, whereas we do not. This will give us a sense of being and we will have finally shown that we can be English as well as British.\n\nSo by signing this petition you are showing your support and are saying that you want this day made a public bank holiday.",
