            "background": "Hundreds of motor cyclists would be alive today if they had to wear a fluorescent top and had dipped headlight on permanently. The recent television ad for drivers to be more watchfull for motor cyclists was a complete waste of money and I do not believe it has reduced the death/injury rate for motor cyclists. It is obvious that drivers do fail to observe motor cyclists. Is it not common sense then to make it easier to observe them. By wearing a thin fluorescent top over the jacket and showing a permanent dipped headlight drivers will be able to see them.This simple answer would significantly reduced death and serious injury to motor cyclists.",
