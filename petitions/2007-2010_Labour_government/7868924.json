            "background": "The published CPI figure is 2.1% (December 2007), yet we are seeing above inflation price rises in so many areas.  This implies that there must be a large number of items that are seeing below inflation price rises or declining prices.  \n\nIt is in the government\u2019s interest to have a low inflation figure:  for example, low inflation means that you can negotiate pay deals at a low rate and it allows the BoE the flexibility to lower interest rates.  Low interest rates allow the public to take on ever increasing amounts of debt to keep the economy going.\n\nNobody believes that inflation is really 2.1%.  It is time to come clean on CPI before you ruin the economy.  It is time for CPI to accurately reflect what is happening.",
