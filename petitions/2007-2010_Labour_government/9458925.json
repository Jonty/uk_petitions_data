            "background": "i am a 13 year old in year 8 and i am about to take my QCA tests which will determin my sets for year 9. Prime Minister and the schools Minister, you do nnot understand how much stress you are putting children under. You may be thinking that i am saying this because i am a normal student who doen't like school and just wants to get rid of tests but you would be wrong. I like pther pupils do want to learn and are tested on our abilities during the year but you want to make SATS so you can make your \"league table\" so that you can judge schools on there students abilities and so that you can make the rest of Europe and the world think that your education system is well organised and brilliant. Well it's not and that is because of your constant testing. Wales is a good example of a country without Sats because they are improving without them. Why don't you try it because us students and you prime minister, both know that they are a waste of time.",
