Perhaps even Gordon Brown should also consider resigning too.  Actualy, why is there so many Scottish Labour MPs running the UK, is this not disproportional?  It is alright for the Labour party to set Gender targets and ethnic targets, but they dont include this when goverment is concerned, dictatorship springs to mind.",
