Take Club Penguin and Gaia Online, for example. Both charge money. Club Penguin charges at least $5.95 per month which is worth around \u00a33, although it claims to be \"a kid-friendly virtual world where children can play games, have fun and interact with each other\". Gaia Online takes money in return for using the \"Gaia Shop\" which is a basic avatar item shop. These are just two of hundreds of chatrooms, many of which are in the UK.",
