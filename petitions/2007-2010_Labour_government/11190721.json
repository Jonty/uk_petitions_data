            "background": "Affordable HIV treatment could save 6,000 lives a day. But this is not happening.\n\nWhen pharmaceutical companies create a new type of drug, they automatically own the exclusive right, or patent, which prevents the manufacture of cheap, generic copies.\n\nA 'patent pool' is a proposed system, financed by 5 countries including the UK, that would enable the production of affordable HIV medicines.\n\nThe good news is the UK Government is leaning towards supporting the pool. What's needed now is a strong show of public pressure to get them fully onboard.",
