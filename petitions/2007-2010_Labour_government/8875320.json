            "background": "It was a legitimate gathering. In search of hope and fundamental human rights; but in the eyes of the establishment - it was seen to be rebellious.\n\nEleven people were killed and over 500 were injured [including 100 women]. Many more were trampled by horses, whilst others were left to bleed from the numerous sabre cuts received from the hands of professional soldiers. \n\nIt was a carnage that is a forgotten page in the history books and it is the right of family members to receive our embrace. \n\nFor this reason and in the spirit of today's world the Government should offer a public apology for the actions of its officers in suppressing the legitimate concern of the working classes.",
