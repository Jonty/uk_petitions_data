        "background": "At the moment, High Wycombe is governed by a district council which covers 125 square miles and 161,000 people. Wycombe itself has an urban population of 120,000, the remaining 40,000 people living around the district in the other towns of Marlow and Princes Risborough. This system cannot go on. Wycombe is large enough to deserve its own borough. This new borough would be for High Wycombe only. Marlow and Princes Risborough would benefit with independence from High Wycombe. This new system would make life better for everyone under the current Wycombe district council, which is simply too big.",
