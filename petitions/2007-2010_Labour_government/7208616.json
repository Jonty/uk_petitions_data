            "background": "The Alcohol Health Alliance wants stringent taxation to curb binge drinking and resulting injury and deaths. We the undersigned do not believe taxation is the answer. Binge drinkers seek escapism and tax will not deter them, merely adversely affect ordinary people who want a beer after work to relax or enjoy some wine with a meal. The social causes of binge drinking should be tackled, not punishing innocent people with its effects through tax.",
