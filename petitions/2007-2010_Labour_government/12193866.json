        "background": "We propose a petition to allow MPs to claim expenses for watching adult films through their TV for the following reasons: \n\n1)Due to frequent travels to Westminster they are away from their partners for a great deal of time.\n2)MPs can already claim for subscription TV and allowing some forms of subscription TV and not others creates confusion.\n3)They have very tough and demanding jobs and need healthy ways in which to relieve the stress and pressure. \n4)Much of this kind of material can already be viewed on the internet and both MPs computers and internet connections are paid for by expenses. Being able to view this material through one medium but not another is contradictory.\n5)If we as taxpayers are prepared to give them \u00a3750 for a new TV why not also pay for what they watch on it?",
