        "background": "Despite the recent bailing out of major banking organisations at the taxpayer's expense, banks who are now owned in part by the public are continuing to charge exorbitant fees when customer goes over their limit and are still forcing people out of their homes for defaulting on their mortgages.  This is clearly unacceptable for a publicly funded organisation and is tantamount to the public paying to be charged fees or being made homeless.  Stop this now and send a strong message to the banks that their practises are both unethical and intolerable.",
