        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is unfair that a student studying in England may receive a higher amount of funding than one studying in Scotland. It is the same that is a Scottish student studies in England than they will receive the same as they normally would in Scotland and vice versa. There is no reason for there to be any difference in these amounts. If tuition fees can be paid for Scottish students studying in Scottish Universities then this should be rolled out across the UK, especially with the lack of range of courses available within Scottish Universities. \n\nIt is an unfair system for students across the UK. \n\nAlex Salmond hasn't gotten his way yet; we ARE still the same country.",
