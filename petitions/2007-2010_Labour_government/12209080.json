        "background": "why can't the government set up a monthly direct debit scheme the same as they have for the t.v. licence,you were able once to buy a stamp from the post office towards your road tax but not anymore\nit's a struggle for some families to tax their car in this present economic climate and this would help people to spread the cost of car tax and would lead to less untaxed vehicles on the road as it has helped those with the cost of t.v. licence's\nthis could be done on this budget if labour were serious about helping people with the cost of living but it would seem they are hell bent on helping people get into debt by buying house's in an uncertain market.\nput your money where your mouth is brown...not into banks!",
