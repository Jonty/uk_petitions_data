            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Over recent years Parliament has voted to increase the parachute payment to MPs who either are defeated at a general election but also to those who choose not to stand again. Depending on their number of years in the House of Commons the payments may exceed \u00a3100,000. \n\nWhile it may be debatable whether these parachute payments and associated pension pots were over generous from the beginning it was always asserted they were appropriate for honourable members who had given their best years to public service.\n\nThis petition therefore calls on the Prime Minister to work with Commons authorities and other party leaders to ensure that parachute payments are not made to members who have abused public trust. There should be no reward for fiddling of expenses claims or inappropriate expenses claims or other forms of 'accidental' but extravagant expenses claims that clearly indicate that public service was not foremost in the MP's mind at the time of claiming.",
