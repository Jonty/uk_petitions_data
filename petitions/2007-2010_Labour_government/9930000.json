            "background": "Dear Mr Brown, I was disgusted to learn that whilst visiting a very sick relative in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary that patients must buy a card costing \u00a33.50 per day to watch television or listen to the radio. This card expires after 24 hours whether you switch on or not. As the sick are among the most vulnerable in our society I am ashamed that this is allowed. Access to the GRI is a disgrace.Frail sick patients and also visitors are expected to walk down a series of concrete ramps and stairs that to a great many of them is an ordeal.The distance to the lifts is also a disgace.Being in hospital is becoming  very expensive for some poor peoples budgets. Between the aforesaid charges and the parking fees to both visitors and also staff I am disappointed beyond belief that it is a Labour government this is happening under.",
