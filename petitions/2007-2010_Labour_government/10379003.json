We request you to kindly reconsider the following changes before implementing the news set of rules:\n1. There is a proposal for extend the minimum period of permanent residency to 8 to 10 years. We request you to limit the proposed changes only in the case of new immigrants\n2.We request you to award either citizenship or settlement straight after the probationary period. \n3.We request you to let the dependents apply with the main applicant instead of applying separately as per the new proposal.\n4. We request you to kindly exempt the professionals like doctors, nurses and carers from community work as these are already community works, \n5.According to the proposal, you are planning to collect extra annual fees from immigrants. We strongly believe it is discrimination as all immigrants pay full tax and NI, but never accept any kind of benefits. Therefore we request you to kindly scrap this plan.",
