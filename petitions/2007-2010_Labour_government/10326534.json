            "background": "It is inequitable, divisive and unjust to subject social workers and students to a 'fitness to practice' panel. \nThis procedure can be based on evidence that can reflect either overt prejudice or disguised disability discrimination both within the profession and within the workplace, when used against a disabled student or worker facing 'concerns'. \nThe other professions do not use the concept of 'fitness' which acts as a barrier to an inclusive and representative profession, which is doubly unfortunate when one in five of the population is disabled or has a long-term illness.\nDoctors, teachers, nurses and the other professions have set out clear guidelines for professional competencies, and do not use such questionable and potentially discriminatory means to exclude disabled colleagues.\nSocial work espouses values of anti-oppression and empowerment which is not at all evident in this practice, which needs to be urgently revisited in the light of the poor rates of admission, progression and retention rates of disabled people within the  social work profession, which remain shamefully low.",
