            "background": "Stop primetime scenes of torture on TV shows. US shows like 24, Alias, Lost and UK programs including Spooks regularly show graphic torture scenes.\n\nNot only are the methods totally illegal - but images of people being kicked directly in the face and suffering even worse abuse, makes such actions \"normal\" to certain individuals.  \n\nYoung people in particular are susceptible to imitate such behaviour.  Banning the screening of such material until after 11pm would help to stem the desensitizing effect of torture voyeurism.",
