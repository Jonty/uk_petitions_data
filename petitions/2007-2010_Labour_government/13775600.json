            "background": "Each Local Authority as its own Pensions management team of around 16 people, these funds can be well managed or poorly managed; this is academic since all Final Salary Pension Schemes are ALL Underwritten by the Government regardless of performance.\nThere would be an economy of scale if all these departments and funds were centrally managed (by the most successful fund managers). This would cut the duplicated effort in all the UK regions to one highly successful pension\u2019s team. \nSince the Terms and Conditions of local government employees are the same (for the current pension team) this is one way of helping to plug the pensions gap; focusing on the pensions fund not the mass of people supporting their own little version.\nThis would save a lot of money as well as improve the total pensions funds performance.\n\nI therefore propose that all these duplicate departments be consolidated.",
