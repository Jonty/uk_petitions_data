            "background": "While I am sure the government will bleat that the lower wage for under 22's is intended to encourage higher education, it is absolutely appalling to allow a 20yr old to earn a significantly reduced sum despite doing the SAME job? If 18 year-olds were paid the same as 22 year-olds, would youngsters find it quite as difficult to gain a rung on the property ladder? How much can the expenditure of a 20 year-old differ from that of a 22 year-old? Stop this injustice right away and ensure younger people are paid an equal pay as their older co-workers when employed in the same role. END THE AGE DISCRIMINATION.",
