        "background": "Tony Blair is viewed very unfavourably in the Middle East, and rightly so, due to his decision to invade Iraq, and also to his support and involvement in the air raids on Lebanon. He has also proven himself to be totally biased on the side of Israel, and its supporter the US. There can be no real peace advancements with this man in charge of negotiating them. Tony Benn on the other hand is a man with a proven history of interest in World Peace. He is far more respected by all parties concerned.",
