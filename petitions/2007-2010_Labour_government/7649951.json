        "action": "abolish the legal necessity for car insurance and force drivers at fault in accidents to pay for the damage they have caused.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I've spend \u00a35000 on car insurance in the last six years and claimed back \u00a3300 when my car was set on fire. I have NEVER had an accident and cannot afford to give a substantial amount of my salary to already rich insurance brokers. My father disagrees with this argument since he has been hit by two uninsured drivers and has had to claim on his own policy, therefore increasing his premiums. If uninsured drivers were forced to pay damages there would be no conflict and insurance companies would have to reduce premiums to obtain business since they wouldn't have us by the b@!!s any more.",
