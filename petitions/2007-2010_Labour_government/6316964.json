Police have no rights to question known criminals even if it seems similar to their own MO.  When they do eventually secure a case, then the criminal 'gets off' with a fine (more often than not paid by the tax payer by the benefit system) or community service - leaving them to have a great laugh at the Police and public and carry on breaking the law - ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!",
