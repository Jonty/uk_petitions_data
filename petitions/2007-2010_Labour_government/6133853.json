            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Increasing nett minimum pay to the \"poverty line\" plus 5% would, of course, have to be done via tax allowances.  These could be paid for by MASSIVELY increasing taxes for people paid, for instance, over \u00a350,000 or \u00a3100,000 a year (almost \u00a31,000 or \u00a32,000 a week).\n\nThe main reason for this petition is that some time ago I read that the \"poverty line\" for childless couples was \u00a3214 a week; yet Pension Credit for a couple is \u00a3181.70.  (I imagine that Income Support for a childless couple is considerably less than that).  If \u00a3214 (for a childless couple; obviously it would be more or less than that according to individual circumstances) is the \"poverty line\" - i.e., presumably, the level below which one is considered to be impoverished - surely it is the minimum amount everyone should be entitled to.",
