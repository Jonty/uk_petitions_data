More should be done to normalise the donation of organs, to make donation common and normal, but never to be carried out without asking. Presently if you Opt-in you take the responsibility of checking with your family yourself. If you haven\u2019t Opted-in then the hospital will ask your next of kin. If you change to the opposite, the hospital does not need to ask, they can just take and if you have not registered your opt-out and your family have reason to object, or maybe you have an unrecorded disease then tough, your family's knowledge or views don\u2019t matter. If they have another family member who also needs an organ, they have no say who gets the organ, no say in anything.",
