If there are problems at Dover The Motorway Overhead Message Signs on M6 and other trunk roads give advance warning of this 250  miles away.\n\nBut, if there are Hold-ups  on the A55 or at Holyhead  it is rare or unusual to see advance warning on the M56 or M62 or M6.\nCould you please ask the Highways Agency to arrange closer liaison and better integration with their  \"brother\"  agencies  Traffic Wales, and also  The Highways Agency of Scotland.     The Overhead Roadside Message Signs Are a valuable source of Information for drivers,  But there is room for Improvement.",
