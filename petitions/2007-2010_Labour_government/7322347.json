            "background": "Please introduce rules preventing NHS managers and executives who have failed to manage their hospital or department satisfactorily and who are allowed to resign before being dismissed,receiving large severence payments, as in the recent situation in both East Sussex and Kent.Managers and executives must not be allowed to manufacture their own contracts and their contract should not differ greatly from that of a nurse or doctor.\nAt present with massive overspending in the NHS for a pretty poor service to the taxpayer,the reduction of  \u00a3millions going into the pockets of a generally poor management, should ensure that some treatments denied at present could be made available.",
