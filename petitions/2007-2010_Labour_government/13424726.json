            "background": "95% of all internet traffic is caused by SPAM.   \nSPAM mail is an issue that affects us all, our families and friends, and fools your dear old mum to part with her life savings to a Nigerian Prince.\n\nInternet providers need to be held more responsible, how, well for a start they can detect where the mail is coming from, the internet is made up of millions of interconnecting gateways.\n\nIf the end user IP banned traffic from another gateway until they stopped spam, then that would cause a chain reaction up the chain, as they all began banning connections causing spam. \n\nWhy would they do this, simple, people would stop using providers who are banned from accessing other providers and begin using the \"friendly\" suppliers.  The offenders would begin losing genuine customers and lots of cash money.  SPAM would become a non-money maker as it wouldn't be getting through, so they would need to comply or die.",
