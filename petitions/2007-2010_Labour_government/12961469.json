        "background": "How many major motorway roadwork projects drag on for months or even years causing us all misery and yet when you drive past on Friday afternoons or over a weekend, there is no one working?  Why can't the condition of getting the contract be that they have to work 24/7 shifts, especially during the summer when they could easily work under floodlights?  This would cut the disruption time and could mean larger teams and therefore more jobs.",
