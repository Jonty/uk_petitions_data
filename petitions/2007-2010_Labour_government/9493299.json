It has been deemed ineligible for funding by the National Lottery, and turned down by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nPlease do not allow this crucial piece of both British and World culture to disappear.  If ever an example were needed of Britain leading the world, this surely would be it.  To allow it to fall into the hands of developers would be simply unconscionable.",
