            "background": "There still seems to be a 'hard core' of drivers that believe that motorcycles filter through traffic illegally. They will often impede the progress of motorcycles, sometimes causing unnecessary accidents. This has often been addressed in motorcycle publications but unfortunalety thats like lecturing cows on chewing grass. I believe that a national TV campaign to educate drivers could prevent many accidents and possible road deaths.",
