            "background": "31 July residents of Deri Road Penylan were sent a letter from Cardiff Council informing them without consultation about their plans to remove 8 Crab-apple trees. The trees in question are in fact actually cherry trees and the beautful blossom in Spring calls into question how 'diseased' as claimed by the Council they reallly are. With each tree being 50 years old the felling would mean the destruction in one year of 400 years of tree growth.",
