        "action": "Explain how the The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 can possibly be enforced, when the government itself imposes age related minimum wage bands and restricts access to working tax credit to the under 25",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The under 25's are possibly the most neglected demographic; coincidentaly not a great deal of under 25's vote. At the age of 16 you are presented with the choices, work for an appalling minimum wage, or continue in education and become financially crippled with student loans. I suggest the working tax credit age limit should be scrapped and tax credit amount should be reduced to cope with increased demand on the treasury. End age discrimination for everyone not just the elderly. End a goverment built of paradox.",
