People living on their own do not use 50% more services than someone living with another adult at home. It is very unfair and should be reduced to 50%. With this policy, I am having to pay an extra \u00a3350 per year because of this unfair policy!\n\nThe govt can recoup the money by charging 75% on people's 2nd homes",
