            "background": "Storage heating appears in a lot of rented properties - both council and private. Storage heating is inefficient and expensive. Plus you cannot control what times they come on unlike central heating. During evenings, the house is cold as the heat is pumped out during the day. I lived in a rented 2 bedroom property and my electricity bill was \u00a3440. People on low incomes/benefits cannot afford such money.",
