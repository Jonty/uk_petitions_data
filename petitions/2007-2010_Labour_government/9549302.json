As well you might know that there is and will be greater pressure on Water in the South East of England now and worse still in the future.. Please help in the name of fairness,  as my next door neighbour has one only because she is a 'Leaseholder on our council estate=NOT FAIR or ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND either. Thank you for this opprtunity to communicate with you direct+ GREAT STUFF!!\nDavid B. Taylor",
