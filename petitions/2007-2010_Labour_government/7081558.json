            "background": "There has been a dramatic increase in the number of railway lines closed at weekends for what network rail describe as \"engineering works\". Prior to privitisation, and in other countries, any required track work was done overnight or in between services. Some rail companies find it cheaper to run buses rather than trains and so are colluding with Network Rail not to provide the service that they take government subsidy to deliver. This is a national scandal.",
