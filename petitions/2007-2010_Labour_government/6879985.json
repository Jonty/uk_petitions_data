            "background": "Most families living in properties owned by private landlords are on short tenancy's, meaning the landlord has only to give two months notice to quit the property.  Families living in these situations have no piece of mind and live in fear of having to find another home. I would like this government to legislate for secure tenancy in the private sector, therefore giving tenants a chance to belong to a local community in the long term. I can't immagine how insecure tenants feel in this situation.",
