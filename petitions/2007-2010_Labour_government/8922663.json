            "background": "This country's identity crisis lies in its name. \n\nWe are currently called \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". We cannot call ourselves 'British' with any serious pride whilst 'Britain' only describes three quarters of this country, while it is used confusingly as a different name for the United Kingdom, and whilst Americans and tourists cannot tell whether we are English or British. \n\nThe USA does not call itself \"the United States of America and Sioux\". The German Federal Republic does not call itself, \"The German and Bavarian Federal Republic.\" When a German Prime Minister speaks they can speak with official pride of \"Germany\", because the noun is already contained in the official title, giving the description official pomp and weight. We have two official names in our title, so must borrow one as an unofficial, colloquial, legally useless word which carries no official meaning or importance. This is why at heart we are not proud, and have no sense of self-identity. \n\nThe only other countries with this problem are Sao Tome & Principle, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guinea-Bisseau. We need to change our official name and re-gain some deserved national pride.",
