            "background": "The \"Roads Minister\" Jim Fitzpatrick wants to reduce speed limits to 50mph. He has decided that it is possible - not guaranteed - but possible to save as many as 200 lives each year. This is from a current annual total of 3000 lives lost through accidents.\nThere is no published data to support this new infringement on civil liberties. There is no published data that establishes that speed is a factor in this small number of deaths, but our \"Nanny state\" wishes to curb the speed limit anyway. Please, let us not allow this. Please endorse the petition.",
