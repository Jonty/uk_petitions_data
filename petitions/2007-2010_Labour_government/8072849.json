            "background": "Storage heaters are in many low income and council housing. They are the worst form of heating in terms of cost and efficency. They generate the heat in the middle of the night. Then they pump out the heat during the day. What happens if the house is empty during the day, people come home to a freezing cold house. It's impossible to change the time (unlike GCH). The cost is bad as well. I rented a 2 bedroom house with storage heating and the winter quarter costed \u00a3485. These people I have mentioned above cannot afford that sort of money. Ban them now!",
