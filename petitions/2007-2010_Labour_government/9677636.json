The grants and benefits that are available only go to one parent.  Unless the second parent can fund the necessary aids and adaptations privately, or though charitable donations, the child cannot stay with them.  This affects the parent/child relationship and means that the child has to go to strangers if respite care is needed - at a cost to the authorities.\n\n1 IN 4 DISABLED CHILDREN LIVES IN A SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLD",
