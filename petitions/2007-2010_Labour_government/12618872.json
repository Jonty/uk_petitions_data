If an ordinary person were to commit these offences, they would be put on trial, yet these MPs, voted for by the public, and who should be above such things, will probably end up just repaying the money they, in effect, stole, apologising to their constituents, then walking away free men.\n\nThis is wrong.\n\nThese MPs should be prosecuted.",
