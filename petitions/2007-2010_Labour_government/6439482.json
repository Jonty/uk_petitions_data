        "background": "The new three band system is inequitable and does not take into account that many people - particularly those over 60 - need to visit the dentist more often than younger people.\nThe old system was both cheaper and fairer and catered for more than two visits a year. This system penalises those people who regularly have to have teeth extracted and new dentures made after the 3 month period has elapsed.\nMost NHS dentists are most unhappy that they have to charge such exorbitant fees for the band 3 treatment. In my case, they have increased by 90%.",
