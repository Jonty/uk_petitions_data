        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A Local Authority `Dignity Precept` would raise additional funding, above and beyond existing Social Care budgets, that would be aimed at removing the negative and demeaning consequences that are a result of means testing and the criteria based rationing of social care services, both practices that currently devalue and undermine the dignity and self respect of some of the most vulnerable members of our society.  There is a direct correlation between the incidence of disability and age and as the average age of our society increases there will be ever greater demands placed on the Public Services that are absolutely critical to the health, dignity, self respect, independence and life choices of older and disabled people across the whole of our society.  As the demographics change it is essential that such valuable services are adequately funded if society is to avoid the increasing social exclusion and degradation of a significant number of our older and disabled citizens.",
