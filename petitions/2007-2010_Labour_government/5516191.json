            "background": "I am looking to abolish or substantially reduce the utterly ridiculous high cemetery fee charges that are being made to bereaved people in order for them to lay their loved ones to rest.  I have just been charged \u00a3129 flat fee plus an extra \u00a346 per additional name to be inscribed on the headstone.  I am having an extra 2 names added which totals in an extra \u00a392.  This is just plain daylight robbery by Local Council's and I intend to make things a lot easier, cheaper and reasonable in order for these fees to be affordable for people wishing to lay a gravestone on their deceased relatives grave/s.  The cemetery plot has also been used and owned since 1940 and I feel that I am being made to make extra payments in addition to owning the plot and paying a stone mason the full fees for the headstone and inscriptions.",
