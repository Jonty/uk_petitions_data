            "background": "I do wish schools understand that many parents are unable to book off annual leave during the school holidays. If a company has 100 staff and the maximum number of staff on annual leave at anyone time is 10%. If people booked a fortnight off work, the maximum number of staff able to book annual leave for the school summer holidays of six week long is 30 people. If in this company, there are 40 members of staff with school aged children, this means 10 will not be able to book time off during the summer holidays. Parents need a break as well.",
