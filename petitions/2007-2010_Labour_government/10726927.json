        "background": "Yep, thats right, legalise prostitution. Does exactly what it says on the tin. I just think it's about time that the Government and the media stop moaning about it and start making money from it. Just think of all the money the British Government can make with all the TAX and VAT. Also, we should be able to make the prostitutes who are willing to go legal safe. Safe from disease, safe from beatings and safe from poor pay. By signing this petition your not saying, \"Lets legalise it so we can go to brothels without worrying about the coppers.\" NO! THATS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT! This is about making the British Government money, and protecting the people that are in the trade anyway. There will always be prostitutes, but why not make the majority of them legal and safe. It makes sense to me, and hopefully it does to you too. So get signing, and tell every one else you know to sign it aswell.",
