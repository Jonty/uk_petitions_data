Is there any reason why we cannot be given more voting powers?\nWe need more power to the people!\nWe need to be told exactly what we are voting for. We need our power back. I call that for every law and decision that affects the people of the UK in a strong way (e.g. The Lisbon Treaty), there should be a referendum for the people on the electoral role to vote on.",
