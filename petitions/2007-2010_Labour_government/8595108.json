        "background": "Britain is getting wetter. Thats a scientific fact. We need to put in as many preventative measures as possible. Bringing in this new law would be the peoples way of doing their bit .Households should only be able to pave a certain percentage of their gardens . At present there are many many places in the UK which have a high risk of flooding , some places still havn't recovered from last years rain falls. We cant expect water companies to take all the flack especially as it means our water bills will rise well above inflation with whatever measures they choose to implement .If we rely on the government to pour money into defense mechanisms , it is us the tax payer who will bare the brunt. The government say we need 3 million more homes to be built in the next 20 years. This will have a devasting effect on the environment and we will hear of more and more homes being subjected to floods. The water has to go somewhere. If we all play a part and allow at least half of our gardens to remain as grass and soil , a great deal of the water will drain naturally .",
