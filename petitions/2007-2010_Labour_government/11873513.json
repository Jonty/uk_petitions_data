            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The proposed site is accessed by the A561 which has become busier in recent years owing to residential developments such as Cressington Heath, the expansion of Liverpool Airport and the increase in activity at Speke Retail Park. Plans to upgrade the nearby Sir Alfred Jones Memorial Hospital will increase traffic congestion in the area further. Fumes & noise from lorries will reduce the air quality and increase the health risks to residents; road safety will be affected. The area is mainly residential with a large established and increasing population. The large scale of the main building will dominate the skyline and will significantly reduce the visual amenity of residents. There would also be a negative impact on the much needed regeneration of the area.",
