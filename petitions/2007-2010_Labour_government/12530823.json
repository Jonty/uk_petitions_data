            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are few legitimate reasons to purchase or use a baseball bat in the UK! Baseball is not our national game, it is considered a niche sport in the UK and we have no significant major or mini league. \nThe use of baseball bats have a greater impact, quite literally ,in criminal activity in the UK! \nIt is my belief that purchased baseball bats are highly likely to be used in criminal activity, violent assault , intimidation and criminal damage - \n\nTherefore I would petition that the sale of bats be banned (with exception for legitimate sports associations). \n\nIf one takes the view that when a bat is purcased in a sports retail store - it is likely to be used in some element of criminal activity .....we need to act.We restrict the sale of knives and guns and should therefore now assess bats.\nConsider when the last report of violence with a cricket bat was reported compared to a baseball bat and my point is made. Please help me to send a resounding message to the legislature to address this issue.",
