            "background": "There are currently around 750,000 empty residential properties all around the UK. These can house between 2-2.5 million people. Instead of the govt building on greenfield sites and reducing our countryside, they should tackle these first. Empty houses makes an area unattractive and is a magnet for anti-social behaviour/crime. For any property which is deemed 'unsafe', the property is knocked down and a house is built in its place. Plus if the govt does something with the empty homes, then it uses fewer carbon emissions than building from scratch.",
