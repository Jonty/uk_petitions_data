            "background": "An unacceptable situation has arisen due to the existing Dangerous Dogs Act in the UK. Thousands of healthy behaviorally sound crossbreed dogs, particularly Staffordshire Bull Terrier crosses, are being destroyed each year in the UK due to legislation that dictates their destruction because they conform to a physical \"type\". These dogs are being routinely destroyed across the country because they happen to look like a banned breed, despite, in the majority of cases,  there being no other grounds for euthanasia. Veterinary professionals and animal care organisations throughout the UK  are being forced to uphold a piece of legislation they do not agree with and feel is unsound.",
