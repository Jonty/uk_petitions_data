We petition the government to increase the minimum number of airframes available to troops on a daily basis to be 50 not only to move troops but also resupply F.O.B.s by air to reduce ground vehicle movement as these are vulnerable to IED's and ambushes costing troops lives in inadequate vehicles.",
