All families receive child benefit regardless of their wealth. \nChild benefit should be scrapped and child tax credit could be increased to be made available more families except the rich who, most people would agree, shouldn't be relying on tax payers to help support their families.\nThis would reduce the burden on the benefit system including a reduction in administration costs.",
