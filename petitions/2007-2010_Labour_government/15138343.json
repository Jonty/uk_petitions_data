By bringing the UK into line with Europe we will be allowing the return of rabies to this country.\n\nThe fact that we have a natural barrier (English Channel) helps prevent wild animals from bringing Rabies and other diseases into this country.  \n\nShould we allow the EU to ignore the fact that we have kept rabies out for 100+years??",
