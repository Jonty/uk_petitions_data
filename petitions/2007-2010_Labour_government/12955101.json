        "background": "Save Vestas Blades UK\n\nOn Monday 13 July, while opening an onshore wind farm in the south of England, Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband confirmed the government\u2019s commitment to expanding wind energy. Expansion can help the UK to meet its target of 15% renewable energy by 2020 and can also help to create \u2013 and save \u2013 jobs. \n\nTo show that it is earnest about this commitment, we urge the government to do all that it can to prevent the closure of Vestas Blades UK, a wind turbine blade plant on the Isle of Wight, which is scheduled to close on 31 July with the loss of 600 jobs. There will also be knock-on job losses on the Isle of Wight and in Southampton. \n\nWe support nationalisation of this facility if that is what it takes to keep it open. We believe it would be a travesty for the plant to close at this time, laying off skilled workers who are already making the products that wind energy expansion will require.",
