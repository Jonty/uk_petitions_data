            "background": "As one of the most charismatic and erudite characters in recent British broadcasting history, Stephen Fry has made many contributions in the areas of literature, radio, television, film and stage. Stephen has a huge following around the world, and there can be very few British citizens who are not aware of his work. I, and many others, believe that he should be recognised in the New Year Honours List with a knighthood for his contributions to the entertainment industry",
