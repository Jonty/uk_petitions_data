            "background": "Barclays Firstplus sold many thousands of secured loans to UK home owners on the premise of resolving financial worries.  The loans they sold were sold as \"variable rate\" and in letters advising rate rises these were linked to BoE base.  Since financial meltdown however Barclays have hiked rates and they have not moved at all for most customers despite interest rates by all measures being at their lowest for decades.  These are secured second mortgages so missed payments equate to homelessness, and inflated repayments equate to less spending power for beleaguered Barclays Firstplus customers.",
