This has led to many instances of people being contacted by service providers who claim that they have signed up for services, based purely upon IP addresses. Due to the nature of the pop up bills employed by these companies, there has also been significant disruption to people's use of their personal computers. \n\nBilling methods of this kind are causing great distress amongst those affected and should, in our opinion, be outlawed.",
