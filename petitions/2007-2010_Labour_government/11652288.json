            "background": "Dear Mr. Prime minister,\n\nHOPE IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY?\n\n \n\nI am a British Tamil of Srilankan descent would like to bring to your attention the humanitarian disaster in northern Srilanka that you probably already aware of.  Hundreds of innocent Tamils have been killed by indiscriminate aerial bombardments, cluster bombs and shelling by Srilankan Government forces.  Today, there was an urgent request by a chief medical officer in the region for medical supplies to save over thousand people severely injured in the last two days. Everyday there are photos coming out showing kids, women, and men bleeding to death on streets. These people were already deprived of food and in constant run to save their lives.  Srilankan forces intensified their aerial and ground offensive in the recent days.  About 300,000 thousand people are trapped in the region. It is you who taught the whole world how to hope with audacity.  It is my humble hope that you, as a man whose intentions are to bring peace and prosperity to the world, make an audacious decision to intervene in Srilankan crisis and call for an immediate cease fire. \n\n \n\n \n\nYours Sincerely,",
