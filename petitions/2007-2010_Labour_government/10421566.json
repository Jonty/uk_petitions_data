        "background": "Murray Walker commentated on motor racing for over 50 years. His enthusiasm for motor racing is unrivalled and he is almost as famous for his many gaffes, such as \"I'm going to stop the startwatch\" and \"The car in front is absolutely unique \u2013 except for the one behind it, which is identical.\"\nYes, he has been given an OBE but this highly patriotic man should be given the highest award for giving so many people so much pleasure for over half a century.",
