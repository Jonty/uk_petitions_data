        "action": "Freeze student pilot loans until such time that the economy and therefore aviation industry recovers and we can find work.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Student pilots training to become airline pilots pay a minimum of \u00a370,000 for their training, with the majority having to secure large bank loans in order to be able to afford to train. When people such as myself took out training loans the economy and industry were very healthy, but as a result of the economic crisis we are graduating and there are no jobs available. We have large repayments to make and many of the now fully-qualified pilots are unable to find work of any sort. The aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit by this recession, and newly qualified pilots are the most affected. I believe an investment of \u00a370,000 into any career is very high, and to not have a job at the end of it is worrying, to say the least.\n\nThe government has introduced schemes to support other beleaguered industries and I would ask the government to consider putting something in place to protect newly qualified pilots through this recession. For example, putting loan repayments on hold and freezing the interest until our first jobs as pilots are achieved.",
