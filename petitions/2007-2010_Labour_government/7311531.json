            "background": "By comparison to many other European Countries, Britain has fewer public holidays and none at all for a period of some three months between the August public holiday and Christmas. Moreover, Britain does not have a \"National\" day. So what better way to celebrate than to join our antipodean comrades in celebrating the race that stops their nation, Melbourne Cup Day Holiday, falling on the first Tuesday in November each year to reinforce the kindrid spirit shared by our two nations. The Melbourne Cup Day Holiday will further serve to break that period between late summer and Christmas when there is currently no public holiday.",
