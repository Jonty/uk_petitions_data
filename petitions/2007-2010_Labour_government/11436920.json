            "background": "The rights of many users of greenlanes are slowly being eroded.  Greenlanes are public rights of way that should be open to all users including 4x4s.  They constitute a very small preportion of the countryside, and as long as 4x4 drivers stick to them and do not leave their routes then they are doing very little damage.  They provide an access route to the countryside for many people that would otherwise never manage to access these areas.  Quite frankly anyone that wants to rampage about on them at high speed damaging the countryside around them should not hold a licence for any vehicle on any road, so please don't take away this privaledge from those who are responsible because of the actions of a minority.",
