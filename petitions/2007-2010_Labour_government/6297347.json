            "background": "It is planned for Rugby to near double in size with housing to \"meet the demands of housing requirements\", Rugby is a market town and does not have the infrastructure to cope with such and expansion, crime is rising at an alarming rate with youth crime being a particular problem the town centre is struggling for parking space at the moment let alone with doubling the population, the police station is closed at night so there is next to zero night time policing and are stretched as it is, these houses are not needed and will only force down housing prices in the area creating negative equity and repossesions and ultimatly poverty in the area as the wages for the area crash due to an influx of cheap european labour.",
