Some benefits are necessary, for seriously disabled, etc, but too many people see it as a life choice.\n Benefit payments should be limited to a maximum of the equivalent of 48 hours paid at minimum wage. To receive these benefits the recipient must do community work, effectively becoming an employee of the state, doing such duties as collecting litter, recycling, etc. If they don't turn up for work they receive nothing. If they are sick they receive SSP. See how long it takes the long term unemployed to find a \"proper\" job then.",
