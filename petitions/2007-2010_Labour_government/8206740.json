            "background": "The current government has made it abundantly clear that too much salt is seriously bad for your health. The Tv Ad campaign featuring the animated slug sticks well in the memory. Cigarette packets display enlarged warnings as to the danger of smoking, units of alcohol are displayed on relevant products.KFC have had great success with a promotion called 'fully loaded', a meal available to the customer for between \u00a34-\u00a35 sterling. What KFC fail to inform their customers of however is the dangerous amounts of salt the meal contains (the reverse side of a KFC restaurant tray liner is still the only place i have seen it displayed!). 6.0 grams is the recommended daily allowance for salt, so when a person on their dinner break decides upon having a 'TOWERED' and 'MAXED' 'fully loaded' meal from KFC the chances are they have exceded that RDA! One 'Fillet Tower' burger contains on average 4.8 grams of salt, one piece of 'original recipe chicken' - 1 gram of salt!. KFC have a moral responsibility to inform their customers as to the dangers in consuming their product! Heart disease is always going to remain such a big killer in the U.K. when consumers dont know essential facts!",
