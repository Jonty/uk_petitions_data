Users must explicitly opt-in to permit personal or private information to be shared between different web sites. An example of the wrong way is Facebook's \"Beacon\" application which shares information about users without their explicit consent, they are instead offered fleeting and not necessarily obvious opportunities to opt-out.\n\nThe Data Protection Act should be updated to reflect this abuse of personal and private information.",
