            "background": "The highways agency plan to turn j4-7 of the M20 into a controlled motorway\nThis is similar to the M25 where the overhead gantries display a mandatory speed limit (40 or 50mph) the system will slow traffic down when it senses high traffic\nIn reality, this is will be triggered by the following\nLorries overtaking and cars using the outside lane\nIgnorant people sitting in the middle lane\nVolume of traffic that won\u2019t be reduced by slowing everyone down\nFact of the matter is, people are not using the road efficiently,a mandatory speed limit being enforced whenever a lorry overtakes is crazy,give it a few minutes and traffic will be back to normal again as others overtake the lorry and the lorry moves over.If a 50mph speed limit is introduced,cars will not be able to overtake the lorry,and the lorry will take longer to overtake,causing more congestion\nThe Highways agency need to realise that killing peoples speed is not the answer,the  congestion between j4-7 could be reduced by concentrating on peoples driving style,e.g targeting middle lane drivers,make use of the highways agency staff in there gas guzzling 4x4\u2019s&display a sign to advise the driver to keep left",
