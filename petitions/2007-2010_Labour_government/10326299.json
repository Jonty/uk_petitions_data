            "background": "Landlords and their agents can give unfounded bad references and cause families to be either left homeless or having to live in unsuitable accomodation.\nThe power of these bad references is mainly due to the popularity of Rental Guarantee Insurance and the overly-stringent credit and reference checks it demands.\nA situation has developed where Landlords and their agents have almost total power over their tenants.\nThis power has been handed to them by Insurance companies who make the incorrect assumption that all Landlords and their agents are benevolent, honest and fair.\nThe threat of a bad reference can stop families from moving house or force them to accept bad conditions and unfair rent increases.\nGiving unfounded bad references should be a criminal offence with set minimum financial compensation to the victims.\nThere should be clear procedures for warning tenants and giving them a chance to redress before giving bad references.\nThere should be clear procedures for tenants to highlight abuses and get fast resolution.",
