In this country it is illegal to discriminate against someone on grounds of either their race, gender or sexuality. Those who serve their country in the Armed Forces should enjoy both similar protection and similar rights afforded to other minority groups. Legal action should be taken against those who do so. It should therefore be made an offence to unreasonably discriminate against someone on the grounds that they are a member of the Armed Forces.",
