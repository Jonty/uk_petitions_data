Criminals do not live in fear, the law abiding do.  The government must withdraw from interfering with policing, remove its spurious targets, cease to push through ill conceived bright ideas,reduce the bureaucrasy it has imposed, honour the 2.5% pay award, and let chief constables get back to the basics of policing their counties.",
