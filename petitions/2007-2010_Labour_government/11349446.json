            "background": "The current rates are based upon a stereotype of the British family, of a father in full time employment and a mother in perhaps just part time, whereas many women today are the main breadwinners.  \n\nWomen should have the equal right to have a career whilst raising children, as our male counterparts do. \n\nWhen the household salary drops to less than half (or even a third in some cases), a parent is forced back to work due to financial strain, after just six weeks at 90%, without real time spent with the newborn/s and often against their wishes.\n\nMaternity Pay should remain at 90% for 6 months (24 weeks), allowing a child to enter nursery or childcare full time at a more appropriate age.  \n\nWorking mothers should be accommodated for their contributions towards Britain's workforce whilst still helping to raise the next generation.",
