        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The A303 passes through the Wiltshire Village of Chicklade and is the main arterial route to the West Country.  West Country exports and tourism have increased year on year.  The weight of traffic has reached such a large volume that village residents safety, property access and lifestyle have become compromised and nothing has been done to mitigate this.  Traffic congestion is now an enduring part of village life and ensures that village freedom of movement is regularly compromised. Children, of which there are many in the village, have no means of movement within and across the village and have no crossing point on the A303.  3 road deaths have occurred in the village in recent years. The road has become completely dominant by way of the air, noise and light pollution it creates, coupled to the increasing risk it poses to all village residents.  Please insist on a public inquiry to investigate how to resolve this deteriorating situation.",
