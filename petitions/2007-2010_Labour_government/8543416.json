Murderers are today getting soft sentences whilst families of murdered victims serve a life sentence, children have no father and quality of life is non exsistant, whilst they sit in a cell for a few years with a colour TV and 3 hot meals a day, all free of charge! Thats not justice...weve had enough, lets get this goverment to listen to us, murderers lose all human rights when they take a life. Life means life!",
