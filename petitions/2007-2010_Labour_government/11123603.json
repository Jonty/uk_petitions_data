        "background": "At the moment, the media are describing children as 'horrible' and they are putting a bad look on youths, saying all of them are 'hoodies' and 'dangerous'. Being a teenager myself, I would like the Prime Minister to help the media have a more posititve attitude towards the children and youths of today, as it is not fair to call them 'horrible'. I think the media are just looking at all of the bad points of young youths, such as crime, and not looking at what positive things teenagers have done. I would like change in the media because it is not right to say nasty things about children, just because they think every child/youth is like this.",
