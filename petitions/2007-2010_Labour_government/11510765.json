        "background": "A number of post offices have severely limited opening hours. My local collection office is open from 0700 to 1230. For most people this makes it impossible to collect items, although there are always staff in the post office they cannot hand-over packages if a collection is attempted outside of the opening hours. \n The Post Office has faced huge financial problems over recent years, resulting in losses of \u00a34m per week and a drop in use. The government subsidises the Royal Mail to the tune of \u00a3150m per year. \n All we ask is that the Royal Mail delivers value for money. If a package cannot be delivered it should be possible to collect it at any time during the opening hours of the Post Office.",
