            "background": "My experience of the Home Office has shocked me after accompanying my girlfriend there to get her \u2018Indefinite leave to Remain\u2019 transferred from her old Passport to her new one.\nAlthough there was a slight complication, she wrote to the Home Office requesting advice on this, and which form she should use, and referred back to previous information given to her by the Home Office.\nThe result was still a 'declined' application, a loss of \u00a3515 in application costs, and no explanation why, only suggesting she tries again (another \u00a3515), or returns to S.Africa where she has no family, and being separated from her 14 year old son who is British and about to start GCSEs. When asked about the advice given to her letter, they told her it was \u2018a different department\u2019, and that its 'not their problem'.\nThis is made even harder to understand when you consider most of her family are British citizens, and her Grand father fought for this country in the RAF.\nIt appears this is by no means a one off case!",
