            "background": "Recently, proposed cuts to courses and potential redundancies were announced at Tower Hamlets College. We are appalled by the plans to slash some 1000 places on the English for Speakers of Other Languages courses in addition to the 2000 places that have already been lost since 2005. In such a diverse community as Tower Hamlets, English is not the first language for a large proportion of residents and these ESOL courses are vital for people of all ages as learning English allows residents to progress in both work and education, and to participate more fully in the community. \n\nWe are extremely worried that local residents who lack English training will continue to be marginalised in our society and their ability to integrate into the labour market and society more generally will be substantially reduced.",
