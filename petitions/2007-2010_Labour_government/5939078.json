            "background": "We are calling on the Prime Minister to use his influence to help secure a better deal for members of the Newsquest final salary pension scheme. \n\nIn order to keep the current scheme, which Newsquest claims is \u00a365 million in deficit, the company is asking staff to increase their contribution dramatically, from six to 10 per cent over the next four years, while the company will only put in 12 per cent \u2013 far below what other comparable employers in the media sector contribute. \n\nAt the very least Newsquest should postpone any changes to the pension scheme until it can base those changes on the results of the official valuation, which it began in April 2007. \n\nWe also call on the company to increase its own contributions to the pension scheme to a level commensurate with those of other comparable employers, and re-open it to new members.\n\nNewsquest UK Ltd recorded a profit of \u00a3700 million last year, and has a profit margin of some 35 per cent.\n\nIn 2003 its chief executive, Paul Davidson, earned \u00a3246,700 with a \u00a3153,000 bonus.",
