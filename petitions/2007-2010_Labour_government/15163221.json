            "background": "I wish to start this petition just 24 hours after I was a few cars behind a major accident where two people where killed on the A5/A483 Chirk bypass. \n\nThe A5/A483 Chirk/Oswestry bypass is approximately 10 miles long between Ruabon (Where the A483 becomes a dual carriageway) and mile end roundabout at Oswestry. After this point the A5 continues as a single carriageway road to Shrewsbury this to is a road that is prone to accidents as well. (But that is another matter and I do not wish to bite off more than I can chew). \n\nThe A5/A483 is a main link road between north Wales and Shropshire. Used by many HGV's to access the port of Holyhead. On average 26,500 vehicles use the stretch of road everyday. Over the 10 mile stretch heading southbound the there are no multi-lane stretches for overtaking. When travelling north bound there there is a crawler for slow moving vehicles to be passed which is approximately 0.7 miles long.\n\nThere have been far to many accidents on this road already.\n\nAshley Williams, 18 \nOswestry",
