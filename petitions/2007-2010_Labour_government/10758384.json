Public transport will never be adequate to provide for all journeys that need to be made. Please reduce the amount of this duty as it is penalising working Britian! it does not encourage industry and will not encourage people to use their vehicles less. Using a car is now considered essential for most people especially those who do not live in cities. This tax is purely a source of funding for the government and does not represent the true cost of transport. On top of this each car must have a road tax, yet again another source of government funding.\"",
