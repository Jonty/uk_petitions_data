        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As it is known the London Borough of Newham is hosting the Olympics in 2012 and with the large scale regeneration projects taking place in Newham alongside Central Government encouraging people to reside and work in Newham, it seems very unfair to the residents and employees in Newham that the local authority is still classed as an 'outer London' borough, whilst neighbouring local authorities are classed as Inner London Authorities and reaping the benefits of it.\nWith the current financial crisis it seems unfair that those working and living in Newham are not able to reap the benefits that other Inner London Boroughs receive, such as opportunity to improve on current provisions including employment benefits, and financial assistance to improve on services.",
