        "background": "U.S. talk show host Michael Savage is guilty of expressing opinions and thoughts.\nHe has never advocated violence in any way, and has roundly denounced those who practise it. \nAnd yet, he has now found himself on a list which includes skinheads, thugs and murderers.\nIf the U.K. still wishes to cling onto the notion that it is a 'free' country, Michael Savage's name needs to be removed from this strange list immediately.",
