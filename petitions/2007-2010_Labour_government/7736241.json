            "background": "I think that Brian Clough (1935-2004) should be knighted for his services to Football. He was a talented player and manager. He will probably be best remembered for succesfully managing Nottingham Forest FC. In 5 years from 1975-1980, He took forest from being a second division side to winning 2 European Cups, The First Division, and 2 league cups. I am sure that most football fans will too think he was as inspirational as most other managers. He then went on to win a further 2 league cups. Pherhaps most importantly, he made up one of Europes finest teams through youth players and signing as yet unknown players and developing them into world-class players. Because of these reasons i think he should be knighted for his outstanding contribution to British Football. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest managers to have ever lived. He was also a born goalscorer, in my opinion.",
