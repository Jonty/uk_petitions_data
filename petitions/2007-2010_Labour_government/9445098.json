        "background": "NHS staff are paid different mileage rates dependent on entitlement. However with regular users the rates drop after 9000 miles. Community based staff often do over this mileage particularly when working in rural areas and are providing a service to help prevent admission to hospital, part of the government agenda, the NHS Plan and Primary Care Trust targets. It is time now to no longer restrict the mileage to maintain good morale in the health service.",
