            "background": "This petition calls on the Prime Minister to ensure full implementation of EU Directive 98/18/EC on maritime safety to allow passenger vessels more freedom in the conduct of their business.\n\nTwo Yorkshire pleasure boat companies are in danger of going out of business due to tough restrictions imposed by the British Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA). These new restrictions limit boats such as the MV Coronia and the Yorkshire Belle to sailing no longer than 15 miles from their point of origin, meaning they are no longer able to make their traditional voyages along the Yorkshire coast. Should the MCA apply the more appropriate regulations contained in the EU directive, these boats, and others like them, would be able to sail within 15 miles of the nearest harbour, meaning they could continue to make their traditional voyages and would not face the threat of going out of business.",
