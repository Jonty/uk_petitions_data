We believe that there are  \nmany non-Catholic Christians in this country who also welcome the visit and even many non-Christians of good will. We ask that our Government should take immediate steps make it abundantly clear that all religious leaders of good will are welcome to visit our country and that, specifically, Pope Benedict XVI will be most welcome when he comes to visit us.",
