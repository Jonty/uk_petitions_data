        "background": "What is interest but an unnecessary evil? The only people who profit from it are the rich. \n\nIf there was only \u00a31 in the world and I borrowed it at 8% interest then WHERE do I get the additional 8 pence from? Interest charges are self defeating and cause suffering and poverty whilst benefitting the deceitful and barbaric individuals who 'invent' the money.\n\nWe as a (once) mighty nation need to stand up to the select few around the world and let them know what we think of their \u2018money for/from nothing WITH interest\u2019 ideas. There is NO requirement for interest to exist except to enrich people for doing little/no work and to continue the unnecessary enslavement of millions/billions of people.\n\nI propose that interest be abolished. It would end \u2018boom and bust\u2019, rid us of the virus that is \u2018inflation\u2019 (devaluation of our currency) and provide each and ever individual the opportunity for TRUE stability in our short lives. Opportunities where we could thrive and accomplish without dragging a ball and chain around behind us.",
