            "background": "Many of the properties advertised to let on the council house lists throughout the country, are restricted to applicants of over 50, or sometimes over 60. In Calderdale they put an age restriction of 50 on all there bungalows, and in Leeds it's often as high as 60, and the same ageism is happening throughout the country... I can understand disabled people being given priority for ground floor properties, but a 16 year old can be even more disabled than a 90 year old, putting age restrictions on properties is ageism, each property should be offered to people of any age.",
