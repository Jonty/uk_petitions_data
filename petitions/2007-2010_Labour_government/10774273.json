            "background": "Why are replica guns still on sale?\nSurely given that most gun crimes are now committed using converted replica firearms, why have they not been banned from sale?\nI can not see any reason for them in our modern civilised society. All that they do is to promote the gun culture amoung the youth of this country.\nGuns and knives are such a large part of youth culture here because replicas guns are easily available and knives can be bought over the counter by children.\n\nTime it stopped in my opinion.",
