            "background": "Why does this Government allow the use of 0845 / 0870 numbers for their departments, also local Government? These numbers are not included in free minutes packages provided by telecoms providers. These numbers are often dialed by people who can least afford it I.e. People on benefits, disabled etc. \n\nWhy should these people need to spend extra money to contact departments like the DWP. Especially when they are calling because that department has made a mistake.",
