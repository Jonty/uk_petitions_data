            "background": "Some premier media channels like GEO TV and ARY TV have been closed down after ridiculous and disgusting actions from General Pervaiz Musharraf. Not only, did he banned them from reporting in Pakistan but also used his anti-human tactics to force them to bankruptcy so they stop reporting even from outside Pakistan. Geo and Ary were headquartered in Dubai. Under immense pressure the UAE government has ordered them to be shut down. Geo TV is the main source of information to millions of people in UK for Sub-Continent especially Pakistan. They maybe based in Dubai for low tax benefits. UK government in the name and honour of Freedom of Press should extend support for these organisations to be based in UK. So, they can continue transmission for the sake of journalism and information. In the beginning the government can provide them with some tax holiday to assist them to shift in a country where their profession will not be attacked.",
