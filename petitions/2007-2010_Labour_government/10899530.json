Within weeks of a factory producing id cards for the government there will be another producing the same cards for the crooks- see any TV programme. The personal information compiled for public  purposes should be held separately and on different data bases- e.g. names separate from addresses; bank accout detail separate from N.I. numbers;etc; so that a loss of data is only ever partial and not disastrous. Governments cannot be trusted to use information collected for id purposes in the interests of people and the whole idea should be consigned to the dustbin containing the previously issued German Nazi and South African pass systems",
