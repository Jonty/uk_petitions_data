            "background": "We believe that Britain has an overwhelming, and over-riding, duty of care to those Iraqi citizens who served with British Forces as interpreters or translators, and that such Iraqi citizens and their dependants should automatically qualify for asylum in Britain, if requested, without being required to apply through the usual channels.  These people served with British troops, often being exposed to the same dangers as the military, in addition to reprisal action from other Iraqis who disapproved of their co-operation with the Coalition Forces.  We believe that to refuse asylum to such people would be a gross betrayal, a blot on Britain's honour, and an example of ingratitude which will shame Britain for years to come.",
