The second home allowance is very controversial.\n\nLondon 2012 will have an Olympic Village for the competing athletes and will be equipped with modern security facilities.  The infrastructure will be in place to provide safe a secure accommodation.\n\nWe can end the MP second home allowance and provide each with a high standard apartment.  As the MP changes the apartment gets a new occupant.  Any MP is free not to take up the apartment and fund their living arrangements from their own resources.\n\nLondon 2012 is being funding via public money. This will give the site a real legacy and help restore faith in Members of Parliament once again.",
