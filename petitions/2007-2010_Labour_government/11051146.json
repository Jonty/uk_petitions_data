        "background": "This week, details were release regarding the failures of Haringey Social Services to protect 'Baby P', who was murdered following months of abuse at the hands of those who were meant to protect, care for and love him. The fact that Haringey social services were monitoring 'Baby 'P', and had visited him 60 times in his short life points to a complete failure in social services actions, and gross dereliction of duty.  An internal investigation has been proposed, led by the head of Haringey Social Services.\nWe, the undersigned, suggest that an internal inquiry is insufficient, and that a full and public independent inquiry should be held and that any negligent parties within Haringey Social Services are publicly named, shamed and held accountable for their lack of action.",
