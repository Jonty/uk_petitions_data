            "background": "This government is supposedly committed to reducing the carbon footprint of this country, yet how can it claim to be when all of it's members have 2nd homes and they have to frequently travel long distances to reach london. The simple answer is to use teleworking and abolish 2nd homes. Not only would this reduce CO2 emissions, but it would cut costs as MPs could no longer claim for 2nd home allowance, and instead the government could provide a slightly larger broadband allowance. \nIn this world, teleworking is the only way to go forward.",
