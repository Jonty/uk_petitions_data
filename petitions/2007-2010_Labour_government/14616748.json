        "background": "... to save the best farmland of the United Kingdom for food growing. The Cambridgeshire Fens contain Grade 1 farmland. This grows almost any food that is required - and it was all required in the second World War when enormous sums were expended on its further drainage and restoration. Our population is reported to be over 61 millions. Our growing population needs feeding. There is a limit as to how much food can and should be brought from less fortunate areas of the world. We deplore the loss of any of our best food-growing Fen farmland, for whatever worthy cause. The farmers and people of the ancient Fen-edge settlements of Wicken, Upware, Burwell, Reach, Swaffham Prior, Swaffham Bulbeck, Lode & Longmeadow, Bottisham, Stow cum Quy, Fen Ditton, Horningsea and Waterbeach feel threatened. Lift that threat, Prime Minister!",
