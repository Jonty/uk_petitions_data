The data concerned is for anyone claiming child tax credits, which as you can imagine is a vast amount of people.\nCurrently their is no legislation in place where if data is lost that the victims be informed.\nIt only makes sense for people to be informed so they can keep an eye out on a suspicious activity involved with their personal details.\nI gatentee that anyone would want to know if their personal data is missing, and if this happens in the private sector then at least people are held responsible",
