            "background": "In Novemeber 2006 and again in February 2007, traffic lights across London failed as a result of a power cut. Chaos was predicted. The reality was, courtesy thrived and congestion dissolved. Traffic appeared to move faster throught the city.\n\nMany have argued that in the vast majority of cases, traffic lights are unnecessary. The motorist should be required to think about his/her actions and share the road.\n \nAlso, all to often, traffic lights are unnecessarilly red resulting in unnecesary waiting and excess polution.\n\nWe the undersigned therefore petition the prime minister to switch off all of the traffic lights in London's \"Square Mile\" during a 4 hour trial.\n\nBy using ANPR and other technology, it will be possible to establish, through comparison, whether vehicles move faster or slower through the city with the lights off.",
