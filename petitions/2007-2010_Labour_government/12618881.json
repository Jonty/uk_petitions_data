        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We believe that The great British Pub is primarily under threat from the extensive availability of cut-price alcohol in supermarkets and off-licenses. We also believe that drinking in a pub, where landlords have a responsibility not to serve those already drunk beyond reasonable limits, promotes a more socially acceptable culture than cheap supermarket booze to be consumed at home or on the streets. therefore we ask the prime minister to increase alcohol duty for supermarkets to level out this price-gap.",
