            "background": "There is an oft repeated lie by road safety campaigners that \"speed kills\". This is simply not true. Exceeding the speed limit (which are mostly too low, and out of date in any case) has never killed anyone. CRASHING kills people, but speed itself does not. \n\nThousands of people in the UK each year are punnished THREE TIMES (Fine, points on the license and a secondary fine to get them removed when they are expired) for a single offence which harmed no-one. \n\nSpeeding should only be penalised when the \"offender\" is involved in an accident. Speed cameras should remain to prove how fast people were going at the time of the crash, but if someone drives at 44MPH on a 40MPH limited duel carriageway and harms no-one then they should not be prosecuted by the police.\n\nIt's time the government acknowleged that it is quite possible to drive safely at speed, and change the road safety campaign to encourage drivers not to run people over at all, rather than to do so at lower speeds.",
