        "background": "This would force HGV vehicles, but not coaches, to only use the inside lane during the rush hours or other peak periods and prevent additional congenstion by freeing the outside lanes (2 & 3) for faster vehicles. A suitable time would be 07:30 - 09:30 and 16:30 - 18:30. I have seen this work in Europe and I have nothing against the hard working truckers.",
