        "background": "ESA now excludes alot of people (who have been on sick pay via their employers) from claiming benefit when they are still too ill to return to work.  I have been told I have 'fallen through a loophole'.  Not entitled to ESA as I don't have enough points and not entitled to Job Seekers Allowance as I have been signed off sick by my GP and therefore I am unfit for work. My Consultant says there is nothing further that can be done to help me. I now have zero income.  I have worked my whole life and paid all my NI contributions - why can't those of us in the 'loophole' have help now that we need it?",
