            "background": "Scientists from Southampton University have proved that many additives, which include artificial colourings and the preservative sodium benzoate, which is commonly used in soft drinks, are directly linked to hyperactivity and disruptive behaviour.  The FSA advice that parents should carefully check the labels of food and snacks is wholly inadequate; perhaps this advice has more to do with the lobbying power of an industry worth $25bn annually than with concern about the health of our children. These harmful additives should be banned.",
