We should be free to control our own lives, to cooperate and direct production, to unleash the power of technology to liberate us from the monotony of work. \nThis government should take immediate steps to dismantle the capitalist state and hand the tools of production to the people. Liberal democracy has failed in its attempts to improve and enrich the lives of the many, only horizontal organisation and cooperative enterprise can release us from enslavement and oppression. Hasta la victoria sempre!",
