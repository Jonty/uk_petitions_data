A cyclist, on the other hand, does not, yet there is a suggestion before Government that the motorist would automatically be liable in the event of a collision between the two.  This would be unfair to motorists, and would cause their insurance premiums to rise, and no claims bonuses to be lost, possibly because of the stupidity or naivety of an untrained road user.",
