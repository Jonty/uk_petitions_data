            "background": "East Sussex County Council (ESCC) have published a new Waste & Minerals Core Strategy outlining the \u2018Preferred Area of Search\u2019 for the disposal of waste by means of landfill or land raising at five sites within the county. Out of these five sites they claim that two will be required to provide the capacity that they say is needed. One potential location that has been identified is south of the A272, east of Goldbridge \u2013 between Piltdown and Newick, bordered by the River Ouse. We believe that serious issues including inadequate transport links, likely pollution of drinking water and increased traffic levels make this site wholly unsuitable and unacceptable. \n\nThe search area is bigger than the whole of Newick and is approximately 1.1 square km (110 hectares, 270 acres) in size.  It is likely to reach 80 feet in height.\n\nWe believe that ESCC's search for a landraise site is not in line with their own strategy and is not an appropriate solution for waste disposal in general in the County and the UK as a whole.",
