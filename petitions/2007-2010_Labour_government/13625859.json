        "background": "Safeguarding children is one of the most important functions that local and central government performs.  It is vital that they get it right and we will only know they are getting it right if there is transparency.\n\nThe core membership of Local Safeguarding Children Boards is set out in the Children Act 2004, and includes Local Authorities, health bodies, the police and others.\n\nPolice forces, local authorities, state schools and NHS trusts are already subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 but Local Safeguarding Children Boards are not subject to the Act.  The law needs to be changed Boards are subject to the Act. The Government can very easily add public bodies to the Freedom of Information Act using powers it already has under Sections 4 and 5 of the Act.\n\nTransparency and accountability will improve the quality of care and protection that children receive.",
