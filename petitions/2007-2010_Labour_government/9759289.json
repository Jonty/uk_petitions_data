            "background": "As of last week Ebay have stopped Sellers making the choice whether to leave negative or neutral feedback for buyers - leaving normal people at the mercy of dishonest buyers.\n\nBasically if someone buys from a seller they can demand anything and threaten to leave negative feedback - ruining the sellers rating and helping to ruin businesses.\n\nEbay say it protects buyers - yet there is no protection for sellers.\n\nThis policy must be reversed",
