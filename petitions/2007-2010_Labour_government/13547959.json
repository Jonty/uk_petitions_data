        "background": "Please sign this petition if you are very much against having to purchase a home information pack, and energy efficiency certificate before you are able to have your home advertised for sale with an estate agent. The only people who gain from these packs are the solicitors or agents who sell them to us.  They vary in costs, also depends on how much your house is worth and how many bedrooms you have.  The buyer of your house already has a survey done through a surveyor and he gives his report on his findings.  In todays climate with the credit crunch people are already in financial difficulties without this added cost. I have been been told that this directive comes from europe, do we always have to comply with everything comes out of europe. Do we need all these directives, most likely not. This is just another unjustified expense for ordinary people struggling to make ends meet.  Thank you for your time and signature.",
