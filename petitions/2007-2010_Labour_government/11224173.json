Here in my town there are skilled people wanting skilled work, ranging from IT managers like myself to doctors, to welders etc.  Should people be thrown away on useless schemes, fored to work in jobs they have not been trained for and treated like criminals if they don't.  This is what the government is proposing to do with the benefits system.  I urge all decent people to fight this unjust system.",
