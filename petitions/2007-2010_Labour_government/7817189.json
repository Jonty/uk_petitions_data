        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Despite guidelines to the contrary, we witnessed an elderly couple get wheel clamped at southmead hospital,Bristol and forced to pay a release fee. The car parks were full and they were forced to park in a laybye. Managers are treating our hospitals like commercial enterprises and we belive this is not in their remit. We know it is wrong and unjust to charge people to use nhs facilities and services they have after all already paid.     This is blatant commercial exploitation of the weak and unfortunate who have to use the nhs. For the sake of good society let\u2019s get these scams abolished! Its coming up to election year again. As a suggestion, I would like everybody to ask canvassers and candidates at the next election to agree \"there is no moral and justifiable reason for wheelclamping and car park charges in hospitals and, most important, tell them they; Will Not Get Our Vote Unless They Agree To Abolish Wheelclamping and Car Park Charging In Hospitals.",
