We have invested a lot of time and money (\u00a350,000) to come here and study and changing the tier system yet again is wrong.\n\nConsidering we did our undergraduate here, we should get points if we want to transfer from one tier to the other. Stating in the HO page that those who hold BSc's do not qualify for transfer except they have masters is wrong and is not fair. We are the ones who have sacrificed the most to be here and deserve to be treated equally and fairly.",
