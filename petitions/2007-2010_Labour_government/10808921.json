YES,Raiden and Vamp having there face off.\nHave you looked at the Raiden and Vamp face off lately? I see amazing graphics still while the cameras are facing different directions and no lag?\nWhen I sit and play a game with my brother,we roleplay and talk to each like real soldiers. I like to feel what it would be like to be a two Agents in the middle of battle sneaking though enemy lines. It is great!",
