        "action": "support british transport firms by banning or reducing foreign lorries on our roads",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "as it stands now, many british transport firms are going out of business because of foreign firms undercutting costs and being able to get away with paying no taxes or fines when they flout the law. London is banning lorries which do not meet environmental standards, but it seems only british lorries are bound by these laws, as foreign lorries if caught, go home and refuse to pay the fines. More and more accidents are involving foreign drivers too, our roads are packed with these dangerous irratic and often under trained drivers who know nothing of british road laws. this government should make foreign firms pay road tax, insist on british standards for the drivers by testing/licensing them, and ban firms who flout the law of this land.",
