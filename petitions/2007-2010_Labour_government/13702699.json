        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Young people need pride in themselves, respect for their community and country, and need to prove their worth to society.\n\nI propose that school leavers are to be made to choose either National Service or Education (university degree or NVQ in full-time employment).\n\nEducation cannot be used as an easy ride and I propose the following solution to combat this:-\n\nIf education is chosen and a level of commitment is not being maintained (poor performance) or the level of qualification (degree or employment and NVQ) is not attained by their 22nd birthday then National Service will have to be taken at double the duration had they not taken the education route and elected for National Service in the first instance.",
