            "background": "Salaried employees do not get paid for working an extra day in a leap year and accordingly, in the interests of fairness, that day should be a public holiday.  The day off would only be once every four years and there would consequently be minimal loss to the economy while creating a feelgood factor in the country.\n\nI would propose that if 29 February falls on the weekend that the Friday before be a public holiday.  \n\nMake 29 February a public holiday and give Britain's workers a well-deserved break.",
