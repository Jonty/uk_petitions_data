            "background": "Under 18s have free travel yet students do not and they need it just as much. A 30% discount is has little effect especially with the state of the economy of the UK at the moment where the price of everything has gone up. Many students are desperate for a job but if so many other students (also considering school leavers and qualified adults already in the workforce) in the capital trying to look for work it is quite impossible for the majority to get one and with the financial crisis it is hard for parents to be able to support these young adults as well as themselves and the rest of the family.\nPlease help students by raising the discount to 60%.",
