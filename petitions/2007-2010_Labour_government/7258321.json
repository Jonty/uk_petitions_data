        "background": "We, the youth of Eton Wick are objecting to the Eton park and ride and the proposed off ramp of the Windsor relief road.\nWe believe that there is no need to pedestrioanise this area. Eton and Eton Wick area is perfect just the way it is. The Eton Wick infrastructure cannot handle the amount of new traffic this will bring through each day.\nThe increase of traffic will lead to an increase of heavy freight, rush hour traffic, number of crimes in this area and road traffic accsidents. It will block off the E0ton wick road which predestions use all the time to come from Slough, Eton and Windsor. it will add time to local people's journeys and push people put of there way into Eton wick.",
