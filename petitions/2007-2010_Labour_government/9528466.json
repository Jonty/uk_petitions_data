            "background": "It is the law in the UK that when replacing a central heating boiler, it must be replaced with a high efficiency boiler with a few technical exceptions. This is being forced on householders, often with additional costs due to additional materials and technical problems involved with fitting a high efficiency boiler. I would argue that the public should be advised of all alternatives but be allowed to have freedom of choice.",
