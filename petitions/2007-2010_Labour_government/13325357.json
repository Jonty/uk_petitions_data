            "background": "The press and media have turned what was, and should be solemn and respectful occasions into a circus. The people of Wooton Bassett began to turn out, to stand quietly in the High St to honour the soldiers who were killed in action. The media have turned it into a farce. They stand taking close up photographs and footage of the relatives of the fallen heros, then broadcast them around the world, making money from the grief of our Hero's Families. This is a despicable practice and we call upon the government to restrict the press from the High St, allowing the repatriations to return to the respectful and sincere occasions they should be.",
