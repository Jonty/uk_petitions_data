            "background": "Some vehicles use a high pressure hydraulic suspension system, rather than a conventional steel spring arrangement. We believe that this technology is superior in every way and that the government should recognise this by reducing the level of taxation on vehicles using it. This would have the effect of encouraging vehicle manufacturers to embrace, and further develop this technology.",
