            "background": "Every year, the public transport services are disrupted not only on christmas and new years days, but on the surrounding days.This causes havoc for the many people who rely on public transport to get around. Over the christmas period, people need more transport to get around due to festive events. Not only is this disruptive for those who have no access to cars, but causes those with cars to use them more as opposed to other methods of transport, creating even greater environmental problems than during the rest of the year. It is disgraceful that a service that probably millions rely on, is halted annually. This is why we petition the government to introduce legislation to force at least a skeleton bus, coach and train service to run on all major routes over the ENTIRE festive period.",
