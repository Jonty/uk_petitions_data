            "background": "The layout of the roads around Abingdon town centre has undergone a great deal of revision in the past two years. The A415 which is a very busy trunk road is directly affected in both directions by these changes. Since completion of the scheme the traffic has become gridlocked on a number of occasions causing severe disruption and misery to residents and commuters alike. Under the old road layout this never occurred. This petition seeks to urge responsible parties to reverse the changes made under the Abingdon Integrated Traffic Scheme (AbITS) which has failed to live up to the expectations laid out in the strategy proposed in 2001",
