            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The peace and privacy of the average British home is now regularly disturbed by the music of ice cream vans. If you live in an area of dense housing, you are forced to listen to the music not once, but many times, as the van makes its way round all the nearby streets, hawking its wares to all and sundry. The outrageous cacophony interrupts conversations, and can ruin the experience of watching a television programme or listening to a piece of music.\n\nWhy should this intrusion into domestic tranquillity be tolerated? Why are ice cream vans given a special exemption from the normal rules governing breaches of the public peace? Would it be acceptable, for example, if someone with a loudspeaker came and stood outside people's homes and read classified advertisements from the local newspaper? Clearly not. So why is it acceptable for ice cream vans to do essentially the same thing?",
