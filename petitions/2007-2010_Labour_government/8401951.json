            "background": "The majority of public opinion in Britain is that the Lisbon Treaty donates vast political powers to the EU at the expense of the British Government. Parliament has not been given the full text of the Treaty for consideration before a vote on its ratification is taken in the House of Commons and there is insufficient time for our MPs to study the interrelationships between all the clauses of this highly complex document before the proposed vote date. The majority of the British population does not want Brussels to have the proposed powers over Britain and demands a referendum as promised in the Labour Party's last election manifesto.",
