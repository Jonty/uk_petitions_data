            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There is a growing market in after market car modifications. As these modifications are tested by the manufacturer to comply with current noise output legislation the police have little power to do anything as the systems are deemed road legal and indeed many are. However some manufacturers push the limits of legislation to gain a competitive edge and some systems are fitted either poorly or deliberately in breach of manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. The end result can be significant noise nuisance to local residents and indeed this nuisance can sometimes be used to intimidate or irritate other tax payers. We therefore request that each individual vehicle should have a noise output test at both high and low revolutions to ensure modified exhausts fully comply with the intended noise output restrictions  as part of the mot test. This would help control a growing perception of noise nuisance from vehicles.",
