        "action": "make photovoltaic roof tiles (to generate electricity) compulsory on all new builds by 2020",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I used to have one very small photovoltaic panel on my elderly 17ft boat, it supplied enough electric power for the lights, radio and all battery charging for engine starts etc. It still worked in winter when under a tarpaulin, it used light not sun. It's going on my caravan soon. If all new houses had them as roof tiles the price would drop both rapidly & dramatically, as the manufacturers would have enough turnover to sell them cheaply by the millions. If tile sized they would look rather like slate roofs only bluer and would save a huge amount of power if new builds were compelled to use them. It may make the house slightly more expensive (but you wouldn't need to buy normal tiles first, so you'd save that cost) and the running costs would be much reduced. Maybe older houses could ultimately have grants to help them convert too.",
