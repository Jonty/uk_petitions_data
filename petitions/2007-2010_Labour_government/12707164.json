        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Buckinghamshire County Council has recently rejected the idea of a homecoming parade for Bucks service personnel citing the possibility of disruption by extremist protests. This decision is insulting to the servicemen and women of Buckinghamshire who risk their lives in the service of their country given that many similar homecoming parades have passed off peacefully in other parts of the country. It is also insulting to the local Muslim community to suggest by implication and innuendo that they are beholden to extremist elements. We therefore demand a proper homecoming parade for Buckinghamshire\u2019s service personnel.",
