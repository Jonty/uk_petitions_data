Eating meat contributes to global warming. Eating fish does not. It is healthy, improves the cognitive development and behavioural problems in children (and thus saves money on the NHS, Education and Home Office and DHSS Budgets) its expanasion would provide more employment for our fishermen. So let us eat our fish instead of the Dinosaurs of the Deep and Save our Planet for Ourselves!",
