            "background": "Physiotherapy students already study up to 5 days a week as well as undertaking placements for a small bursary that is well below the minimum wage and receive a drastically reduced student loan. \n\nThose who are not helped financially by their parents have to work additional hours to make ends meet, leaving them exhausted, ill and unable to attain high grades. \n\nThis is neither safe for them or the patient's they are caring for. Increasing the bursary and/or the student loan in line with other degrees would allow students to maintain a suitable quality of life and the chance to gain from their studies.",
