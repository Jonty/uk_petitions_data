        "background": "While the current government has strong record of consultation, all tax policy would benefit from earlier input from businesses and tax experts, rather than just politicians. A tax policy committee would provide practical information on the best ways to achieve particular results and on how any change would work in practice. \n\nSimilarly to the Monetary Policy Committee, it should include some constant members who would serve for a fixed term, but also have 'rolling places' to enable specific experts to be drafted in as required.",
