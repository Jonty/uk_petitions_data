Of this \u00a340 could be retained by the Police force which got the criminal to be spent on inititives as they see fit, with the other \u00a340 going to a national pot to be ringfenced for tackling crime.  \u00a320 to cover the administration costs of the scheme.\n\nWhen determining Police funding the government should not take into account the money raised in the manner I describe as this should be seen as additional funding.\n\nHM Government should adopt this idea and encourge the Scottish Parliament to enact similar legislation.",
