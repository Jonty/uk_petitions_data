            "background": "Many petitions have been created promoting the idea of decriminalizing the use of cannabis. For one reason or another, the government believes that this is not the right thing to do, and has recently increased the class of the drug.  \n \nOur government has been voted in to represent our ideals and stand for what we belive. In this case, this does not seem to be happening.  \n \nThe purpose of this partition is to hold an informal referendum on the issue of the legality of cannabis use. Two petitions have been created, one petition is for preserving the illegality of cannabis, the other for reducing the criminality of it. \n\nThis petition is FOR LEGALIZING CANNABIS.\n\nIt is up to you to signify your position by joining one petition or the other. Maybe our democratic government will listen to your vote.",
