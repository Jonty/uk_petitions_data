            "background": "It would be a good thing for the UK if Brown, Darling, Cooper et al., were made to take a lie detector test before and after every statement.And when they fail the test they should be sacked and put in the stocks for Joe Public to punish.How many labour MPs would be left after 6 months? Not many I fear, but look on the bright side,we could then employ Polish MPs for a fifth of the price our greedy MPs get. Strange how MPs think cut-price workers are good for UK - by that reasoning hurry up and get some cut price bosses and MPs.",
