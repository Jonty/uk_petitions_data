        "background": "At present Chief Constables have powers to pick and choose which powers they designate to their PCSOs.  We feel, even with the proposed introduction of \u2018standard powers\u2019 from the government later this year, this still leaves the Chief Constables with the ability to pick and choose. This is not going to help the public\u2019s confusion over powers, roles, responsibilities and remit.  We feel PCSOs should have all the powers available to them in current legislation, to use in the fight against low level crime and Anti-social Behavior.",
