            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The 15 point deduction which is to be applied to the start of the 2007/8 football season (on top of the 10 point deduction applied to the 2006/7 season) will effectively relegate Leeds United AFC to the 2nd division (4th tier) football during the 2008/9 season...\n\nIf the deduction occurs the team wont be able to strenghen its side with the quality of player it so requires.\n\nLeeds United AFC puts the city of Leeds on the world map with fans across the globe, and the 'winding up' of the club, as i believe would happen due to relegation, could have financial implications on the city as a whole...\n\nI believe this move by the football league to be unjust and unfair.",
