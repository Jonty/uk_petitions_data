Unfortunately the British Government has since shown little or no awareness of the significance of the Day.   The British Government should reinstate the importance of this day and it should be observed by all practical means.    Where British troops are engaged in military conflict, they should work in conjunction with the UN to bring about a ceassation of hostilities for the day of September 21st",
