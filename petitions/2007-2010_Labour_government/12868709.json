        "background": "The University of Reading is proposing to build a science park in Shinfield Berkshire. Wokingham Borough Council planning application number: O/2009/1027. This will affect the residents of Cutbush and Shinfield in the following ways: Construction that will span 25 years; Noise and disruption between 7am to 6pm Monday-Friday and 7am to 1pm Saturdays for 25 years; 150 HGV and 270 light vehicle movements per day to construction site; Buses running along Cutbush lane, a rural lane with mature and listed properties. Loss of Village character, and loss of green wedges separating the village from Reading; 41,958 cars through the village; and thousands of new homes being built in a village with no train station; no high school; and limited amenities.\nWe urge you to stop this frightening and unrealistic development of a rural Berkshire village.",
