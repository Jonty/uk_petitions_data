            "background": "Today (20 December 2007), in a live TV interview, Lord Mackenzie stated unequivocally that one of the reasons the proposed arrangements for buying back of pension years by women who are forecast not to be qualified for a full old age pension, are NOT now to be followed up, is that up to 35 per cent of the payments would end up being sent overseas 'which is clearly not good for the british economy'.  This flies in the face of the demonstrably obvious fiscal policy of this government which involves handing out huge bucketsful of GB taxpayer pounds to non-contributing foreigners: ex-asylum seekers given money to help set up businesses in their home country; cash aid to schools (which are known to turn out trained terrorists) in Pakistan; and, most recently, paying child benefit to Polish nationals who are claiming for children whom it cannot be proven (nor are efforts made to prove), that they even exist!",
