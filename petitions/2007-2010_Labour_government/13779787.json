        "background": "Following the recent announcement by the Maersk Company \u2013 one of the largest employers and trainers of British Merchant Navy seafarers \u2013 that it is making almost one-third of its UK officers redundant and reducing employment opportunities for newly-qualified trainees, the need for action is greater than ever. Noting that it is now more than two and a half years since UK shipowners and seafarer unions submitted proposals for improving support for maritime training and employment measures, we call upon the government to urgently adopt the package sought by all sides of the industry to help safeguard the future supply of skilled and experienced British maritime professionals.",
