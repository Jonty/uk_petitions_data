        "background": "I feel it is unfair how only under 16s and over 60s get to enjoy free healthcare, swimming and bus travel. It is hard enough being a student with these ridiculous unfair tuition fees yet we get no freebies like other groups. It is time for the Government to give students more help. Regardless of age this should apply to any full time university student",
