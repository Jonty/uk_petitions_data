            "background": "I am waiting for the tax office to give me 2 cheques for tax rebates. The first is for 07/08 tax year and the second is for claiming back the excess in tax when I was temping (deducted emergency tax). As I put in a claim for these start of June and end of July, respectively, I contacted the tax office for advice. Stated that cheques were issued roughly 4 weeks after I submitted my claim. I never received them. It will take another 4 weeks to get the cheques cancelled and reissue them again! If the tax office actually sent the cheques by recorded delivery, it will have a better chance of the cheques to be received by the tax payer.",
