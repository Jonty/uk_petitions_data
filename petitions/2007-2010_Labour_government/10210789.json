            "background": "Quangos are unelected bodies. They currently employ over 700,000 people, at a cost to the taxpayer of over \u00a360m per year. Many of these appointments are political, and are often cronies, acolytes, or relations of the political persons making the appointment.\nIf a quango is in the public interest, it should be able to fund itself by sponsorship from related interest groups. Quangos are often politically motivated, and do not make fair or objective recommendations, often ignoring the democratic views of affected communities. Many quangos are a total waste of money, pedalling unsubstantiated and subjective views. \nWhen NHS trusts and Local authority quangos are added into the equation, the amount of money wasted for little apparent value escalates to a staggering\nqurter of a billion \u00a3. This money could be better spent on schools, hospitals, public transport, and decent pensions, and reducing the unfair tax burden on poor and middle income earners.\nBritain would be a better place without quangos, the people would receive better services, and would have more disposable income.",
