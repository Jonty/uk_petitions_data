        "background": "Amazed..'gobsmacked' even, it seems ridiculous that in these times of 'global warming' rising fuel bills, economic slow down, etc that many of the electrical products that we buy for our every day use do not display the electrical consumption of the device any where on the packaging and in some instances not even in the users manual. (tv, computers, games consoles, kettles, phones, stereo etc etc)  \nWith the right information displayed on the packaging you could be saving \u00a310's if not \u00a3100's per year on your electrical bills.\nShocking?????? Yes it is!!!!\nby being better informed at the point of purchase about the power requirements of the item your buying, you can estimate the saving on your electric bills by buying more economical appliances. (same specs) \nBy signing this petition you will help everyone, domestic users and eco dwellers alike and thus create a more competitive market for the electrical goods manufacturers based on power efficiency of their products \nThank you for your time and\nconsideration. Eddie.",
