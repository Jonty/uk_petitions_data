        "background": "From the end of 2007,all ISPs are legally obliged to block certain websites so citizens cannot view them.The govt claims it's to stop p\u00e6dophilia.Anyone right minded is against p\u00e6dophilia,but what Im against is the errosion of our civil liberties.\nThe internet is a resource for everybody&whilst censorship may help in the short term for stopping p\u00e6dophilia,I dont believe it stops there.Freedom of expression&human rights are being eroded by govt propaganda.(E.g.the call to abolish the Human Rights act,saying it stops punishment of criminals.The Human Rights act contains provisions to remove the rights of criminals)Already,people are stopped from wearing things(search Gunchester Clothing)&soon this will extend to our everyday lives.\nBefore long,the country with more CCTV cameras per person than any other,will become a place of government oppression&censorship in line with North Korea&Iran,who have already implemented routine internet censoring.\nDon't let us get this way. Stop Cleanfeed.",
