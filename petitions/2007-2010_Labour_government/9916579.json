            "background": "Change sentencing policy so that all drivers who cause death or serious injury, because of dangerous driving or driving whilst intoxicated will receive a mandatory life driving ban.\n\nIn addition all driving bans issued under any circumstances (including banned juveniles) will be backed up by a suspended jail sentence (minimum 1 year).  Drivers found to have breached the ban will serve the jail term.\n\nThis will make roads safer, save police time and improve morale, close a legal loop hole, where current bans have no effect, reduce insurance costs and serve as a robust deterant effect.",
