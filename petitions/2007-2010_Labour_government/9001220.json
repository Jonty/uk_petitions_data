            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is an absolute disgrace for this present Government or indeed the Ministry of Defence, to even suggest that all British Gurkahs who retired prior to the date of Hong Kong independance, should have to leave the United Kingdom or otherwise apply to stay.  These British Gurkhas have surely more than earned their right to remain in the United Kingdom for as long as they wish, without having to apply to stay.  If it were not for the outstanding bravery, devotion and courage of the British Gurkhas during the last World War, and indeed many other wars since, we would not be enjoying the freedom we have today.  It is a fundamental mistake to treat the British Gurkhas any differently than any other military unit of the British Army. All British Gurkhas, no matter when they retired, should have the fundamental right to remain in the United Kingdom as a recognition of their exemplory devotion and service to the Crown.  They deserve our thanks, but more importantly, proper justice which is long overdue.",
