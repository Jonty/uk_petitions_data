        "background": "On 19.12.08 the Ummah Welfare Trust (UWT) received a 30 day notice from Barclays to close their bank account. The trust has been banking with Barclays since its inception in 2001 in order to carry out relief operations in over twenty countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East providing support to over a million people.  At a time when humanitarian needs in Gaza are so desperate, it is an inhumane decision that will affect many lives.",
