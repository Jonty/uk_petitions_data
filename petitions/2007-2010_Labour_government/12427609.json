        "background": "Inflation is often defined as a general rise in prices. Inflation is actually the increase in the money supply itself, which then leads to an increase in prices that would have otherwise not occurred. The higher prices are a consequence of the increase in the money supply.\n\nThe British Pound originally represented one troy pound of sterling silver back in 1560. Since its inception the British Pound\nhas lost approximately 99% of its value.\n\nRestoring the Gold Standard would limit government excess and help protect the savers and the prudent from the transfer of wealth caused by inflation. It would also enable businesses to plan more effectively and encourage investment rather than speculation.\n\nSince the de-facto Gold Standard failed in 1971 we have had rampant inflation and a number of booms and busts caused by the creation of excess currency. It is always the case that the bigger the boom the bigger the bust and easy money policies are made easier by having no anchor to Gold.",
