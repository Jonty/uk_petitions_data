            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is legal to allow a dog to defecate in public if the faeces is removed. Often it isn\u2019t removed. There is no system in place to identify the dog from the faeces that has been left behind. A dog owner would be less likely to let their dog defecate in public if it was illegal. It would increase the risk of prosecution because there would be time for someone else to pass and witness the act. It is too easy for a dog owner to leave the faeces behind once the dog has finished defecating. Allowing a dog to defecate in public allows traces of faeces to be left. This is a health risk. A dog can be trained to defecate on command. Dog owners can control and be responsible for where their dogs defecate. An increasing penalty system, e.g a fine of \u00a310 for the first offence, \u00a320 for a second, etc. increasing by \u00a310 each time would encourage the training of dogs to control where they defecate. The nation could be rid of a disgusting national disgrace and a health hazard that blights our streets, parks, footpaths and countryside. Most of us like dogs. 1 in 5 homes own dogs. Most dog owners act responsibly. A solution to dog fouling would be good for everyone including dog owners and their dogs.",
