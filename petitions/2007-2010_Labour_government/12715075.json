        "background": "we would like the pm to get the mod to look again at the idea of getting rid of 35 signal regiment and in particular 58 signal squadron north staffs based at newcastle-under-lyme, this is a ta regiment/squadron with a long history of serving the queen and country and with the problems around the world in which we have dedicated men and woman serving, you should be getting more ta centers and regiments instead of getting rid of them,as the ta are going out to fight just as much as the regular army,we need more men and woman instead of less.\nthe ta gives normal people in the locality the chance to see what it is like in the armed forces so that they may even go on and sign up to the regular forces, so these centres do make a difference and once they are gone then you loose your local peoples knowledge of the armed forces which is what you do not want to do, and your ability to get local people interested in the armed forces is also lost.",
