        "background": "Immigration Officers are intimidating, deporting and giving 3 months time limit to legal residents of the UK on return from vacation abroad. Such residents are people, who are mainly from ethnic backgrounds, such as the Caribbean. Residents who were brought up in the UK from early childhood, who were educated, employed, contributed to taxes and insurance, Some have travelled abroad on numerous occasions but are now being stopped on entry to the UK from vacation abroad, with the threat of 'being sent back' or 'having your passport stamped with a 3 month leave to remain with no access to public funds'. These are phrases being used by some immigration officers to intimidate residents.  Many of these UK residents, originally entered the UK, as British Citizens.  This Right was taken away under the Thatcher Government's (racist) Immigration Law. Families are under threat of being separated. The UK is home to these residents. There is nowhere to be sent back to. I urge the Government to change this unjust Law.",
