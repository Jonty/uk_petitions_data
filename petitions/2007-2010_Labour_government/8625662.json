It is a fitting tribute of his performance in maximising the National Debt, and the imbalance of trade and developing our economy with Europe as the only continent where we have an imbalance of trade.\nAdd to that that we are now at the bottom of league of private pensions just above Greece. Congratulations and well done Prime Minister. \n\nWell worth waiting for.",
