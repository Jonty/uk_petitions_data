        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We are a community group and the group is made up of  60 social housing flats and 3 streets of private housing. We have taken on board government policy & laws and have considerably improved the life and safety of our community by tackling anti-social-behaviour, drug trafficking and generally taking a pride in where we live. Now we are faced with our community spaces being taken away from us as well as 38 garages and 76 car parking spaces with a proposed 14, 2-bedroom houses. This is not only riduculous to take away our car park but also it will cause more problems in the area because there are double yellow lines in the neighbouring streets and parking is limited and there is not enough parking for people now. We will be living on top of each other and this in itself will cause anger and frustration and even crime. Please take this serious. Our area is full of flats & buildings and little green spaces.",
