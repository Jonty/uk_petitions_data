He was found by my 14 yr old son and 10 yr old daughter who now suffer from depression as do i.  \n\nI have worked since i was 16 and only took 6 months  off after he died.\n\nAll I wanted to do was care for my children but the money was barely enough to live on. With no absent father to claim maintenance from I had to return to work which has had an impact on my childrens and my own health.\n\nI just want to be a MUM. Not everyones circumstances are the same!!!!",
