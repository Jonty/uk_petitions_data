            "background": "In a multi-racial state like the UK, where much is made of the need to create social cohesion, it is of utmost importance to recognise the existence of the English and not redefine and exclude us in a way that makes us feel justifiably resentful.  \n\nHow are we supposed to feel when we see other communities given recognition and resources while the existence of the English as a racial group is at best ignored and at worst denied?\n\nThis is a sure way to make the English see the British state as an enemy.",
