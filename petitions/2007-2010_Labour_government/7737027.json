        "background": "If it were made voluntary, as most tax-payers would probably like, how many would continue to pay it?  Very few, I imagine, which would mean that either those who did have enough of a social conscience to continue paying would be taxed exorbitantly or far fewer services could be funded.  Payment of Income Tax, however unpalatable, HAS to continue to be compulsory or how will public services, such as education, the N.H.S., etc, be funded?",
