There seems to be control over other major politicians ever since including black propaganda for Prescott, and Mendleson. If we accept this, then democracy is even more of a joke than it ever should be. I urge the government to investigate MI5's role in his demise and the general effect that \"le cercle\" had on the politics of this nation in the 70's. By setting up an independent governing body to police the secret services role in control over democratically elected politicians.",
