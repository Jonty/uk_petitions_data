A great example of such trickery is on the M6, near Cannock, where you must turn off the road to avoid the toll and continuing straight on will take you onto the toll road, which is quite expensive. I think toll roads should be clearly signed, as in France, where 'p\u00e9age' is posted next to every destination which requires using the tolled route.",
