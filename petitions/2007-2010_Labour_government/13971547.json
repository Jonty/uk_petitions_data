        "background": "Recently a convicted murderer escaped while being escorted on a shopping trip.\n\nSurely there is no need for convicted murderers to exit prison on shopping trips.\n\nShopping online or even a prison officer going and doing the shopping would be better. This would be a good use of technology or just a humble pen, paper and a list.\n\nWe would like convicted murderers to be banned from escorted shopping trips.",
