            "background": "Since BT has separated it's engineering division ( Now BT Openworld) from it's telephony service it claims it is not responsible for line faults that do not affect the use of a telephone.\nIf you have Broadband and your speed keeps getting lower ( pointing to degradation of your phone lines). It claims this is your ISP's responsibility. You pay BT for the use of the line and your ISP for your internet service so surely BT should be responsible.",
