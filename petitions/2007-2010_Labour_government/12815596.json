            "background": "Our system is being abused.  The motorbility system is a wonderful one and for those who are wheelchair bound or with special disability needs it is a lifeline.  Unfortunatly there are a vast number of people claiming this sum of money who have no desperate need for specially adapted vehicles but who enjoy the luxury of a new free car to the value of \u00a315,000 every three years.  I have witnessed many examples of this on a first hand basis.  Every year these abuses are costing our country millions.  It is an utter disgrace.  The people who are claiming this sum of money without real need, are taking that money away from those who are desperate for lifesaving drugs and from hospitals sorely in need and from those with genuine disability.   What is worse, is that our government is willingly funding these people.  I call for an immediate investigation of these abuses and a re-evaluation of the criteria that needs to be met in order to qualify for this assistance.",
