            "background": "We need stricter sentences for drug dealers as not only do they break the law in committing a crime dealing drugs but also defrauding the government of tax.  I pay tax.  I pay for these dealers to sit at home, deal their drugs and get a slap on the wrist and more money in their pockets.  Enough is most certainly enough.  Make an example.  Make it a life sentence (being the rest of their natural life) or even 10 years, where they wont be allowed benefits when they are free - EVER!!!  Who else likes watching their wages go to dole dossing drug dealers when they could have more money to spend on themselves.  I most certainly do no.  They deal and get caught.  They dont care about spending a couple of years locked up because they pick up their drug dealing business when they get out.  They benefit and we lose.",
