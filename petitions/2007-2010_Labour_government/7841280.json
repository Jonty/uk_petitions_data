            "background": "One VERY frequently reads of people being given non-custodial sentences for crimes against the person, ESPECIALLY if caused by MOTORISTS, but, on the other hand, quite high custodial sentences for crimes against PROPERTY.  Are we to conclude that property is more important than people's lives; or than the effect on them of any assault or of an injury caused by a careless or dangerous driver?  \n\nSentencing is also often affected by the age of the defendant; whether because he/she is perceived as particularly young or particularly old.  The effect on the VICTIM is the same no matter how old the perpetrator is; in my very strong opinion the ONLY criterion which should be taken into account when sentencing is THE EFFECT OF THE CRIME ON THE VICTIM.",
