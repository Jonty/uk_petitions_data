            "background": "It's quite simple, really: Nationwide has decided that a tracker mortgage is not a tracker mortgage when the bank base rate falls below some figure dreamed up by Nationwide.  Thus they do not pass on the rate cut to the mortgage holder.  One is bound to wonder, if they are so keen on rate limits, if they would consider a MAXIMUM rate above which they would not pass on increases.  I doubt it.  Thus the present action is arbitrary and unfair.",
