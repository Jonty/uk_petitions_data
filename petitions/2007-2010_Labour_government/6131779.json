            "background": "Anyone who has taken an exam at secondary school recently will have noticed the replacement of the teaching staff by privately hired invigilators. Invariably these people are crap at there job, there unproffesional errors include: Not explaining exam procedure correctly, talking loudly during exams and allowing students to break exam rules. We all know that the privatisation of any public service loweres the quality of that service, but those who support such action would argue that this is offset by cost reduction, but come on! Talking during my history A-level! Thats just not on guys! Return this responsibility to teaching staff who actually have an interest in the exams going according to plan, they can't just bugger of home at night and forget about the person whose exam they just messed up. It has got the point were students have to tell invigilators to be quite during exams, this can not be allowed to continue. If a crappy invigilator has effected you during your exams then sign this petition and get them out of the exam hall!!!",
