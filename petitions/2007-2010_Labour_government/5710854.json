            "background": "First time home buyers are often young and need a helping hand to make it in life.  The least we the society can do is not to penalise them in their dreams to have their own roof over their head. The present stamp free threshold is nowhere near enough to buy a decent property in South East and in many parts of the Country. Further more the Council Tax can be a punitive tax for the first time buyer who may also be paying off education loans.",
