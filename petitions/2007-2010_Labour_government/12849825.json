We the undersigned petitioners signing this wish to bring to your attention that the British Bangladeshi\u2019s and the people of Bangladesh are very apprehensive and deeply concerned of this scheme on the international Ahu (Barak) River and express our strongest objections to it.\n\nIn a great modern democracy, such as INDIA, development must be for the people, by the people and of the people. The common good of the Nation must include, foremost, the good of those who are called upon to make the greatest sacrifice. The mega-dam proposed at Tipaimukh will smother this river; change its age-old knowable and reliable nature; and drown us all in sorrow forever! \n\nOur governmnet, must express concerns and reflect seriously upon the will of the people and do deeds to fulfill the people\u2019s expressed wants and aspirations. \n\nWe need to ask the Indian Government to cancel the Tipaimukh Dam, let the Ahu run free and be with the people of that region who can make the right choices for themselves.  Thank you very much for your help and support\nYours Sincerely, \nThe undersigned",
