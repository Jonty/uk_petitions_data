            "background": "Women worked in the munitions factories during the duration of the war.  Many worked away from home in lodgings, some were sent away as young girls - the first time they were ever away from home. Others worked long hours in very dangerous conditions.  Health could suffer because of the use of cordite. Woman could have died or become maimed due to the volatile nature of the materials they used.  Land Army girls and the Bevan Boys have been honoured but the many women who risked their lives making bullets and armaments to service the forces have been largely ignored.  Now is the time to recognise the work they undertook in what were the darkest days of the war.",
