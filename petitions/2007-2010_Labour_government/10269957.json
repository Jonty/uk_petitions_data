            "background": "I am fed up with throwing away yoghurt pots.  My council won't take them for recycling because they say they are made up of so many different plastics and polymers that there is no market for them and they are too difficult to recycle.  I would like the government to force manufacturers who sell their product in the UK to put their products in commercially recyclable containers.  This could also be done for magarine and allied products currently sold in non recyclable containers.  Rather than looking at the container and then saying how can we recycle this, lets look at the beginning and say what sort of recyclable container can we make to put our product in.",
