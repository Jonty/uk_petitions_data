            "background": "Palestinians are refugees and occuppied people, living below poverty level in one the most over populated places in the world. Israel are constructing a huge concrete wall around the west bank, it is dubbed a \"security fence\" it is by no means a fence but a huge solid wall that they say is temporary, but at such an effort and expence...?. Israel have and are planning to include further west bank territory within their side of the wall. Apart from depriving more people of their homes and basic human rights this will turn the west bank into a prison cut off from the rest of the world just as it is in gaza. The UN states that 400,000 palestinians will be affected by the wall. To take an already desperate situation and make it worse is wrong and the \"peace makers\" of the west must stop this gross injustice and destruction. Stop and dismantle the wall!",
