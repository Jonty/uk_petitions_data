            "background": "Allow refunds and nil charging if the congestion is down to 'street furniture', bus lanes or road improvement plans.  These are all matter which are out of the control of motorists and they should not be charged if a planner makes a decision which causes congestion or so called 'road improvements' impede traffic flow.  Basically charge when the driver causes congestion, refund when the infrastructure causes it.",
