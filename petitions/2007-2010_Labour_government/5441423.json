If you want to be a Pime minister that will go down in history the best thing you can do is bring back our troops from Iraq and afganistan.  Our men and women are not dying for their own queen and country. too many lives have been lost and nothing has been resolved.  The iraqis do not want us there and nothing we have done so far has helped, it just gets worse,  Please please please bring our men and women home before any more lives are lost and families are left without thier loved ones. its a no win situation, let the iraqie people fight between themselves.  its not our war.",
