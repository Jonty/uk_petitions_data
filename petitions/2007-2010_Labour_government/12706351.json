I am also a member of Breakthrough Breast Cancer and have for the last two years been raising awareness of the importance of Breast Screening and lobbying my MP Jim Dobbin. \n\nAt present, women have to travel to Rochdale or Bury for screenings, but with the construction of the town's new health centre it could be the ideal time to install a digital mammography machine within the health centre enabling women to access the service locally.",
