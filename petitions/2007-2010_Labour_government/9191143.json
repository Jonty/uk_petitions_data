        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "All drug dealers should be charged with incitement to murder no matter what the drug they are dealing, from cannabis to heroin the charge must be the same and carry a minimum 15 years for dealing in what is incitement to murder. After all the dealers killed my daughter aged 24 through selling the drugs. I have no doubt most of you will say the dealers did not force her to take the drugs, i agree but if there was no dealers then our daughter would still be here. Its time to hand out harsh penalties to those who deal in misery and death.",
