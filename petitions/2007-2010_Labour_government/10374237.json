This will only be reduced if irresponsible motorists believe they will be caught and prosecuted.\nAll signs warning of speed cameras should be removed though the speed limit should be clearly signed.\nAll cameras should be hidden to reduce the danger of motorists braking sharply when they spot a camera.\nMotorists should know that if they speed they will be prosecuted.\nThis is NOT a tax, this is a criminal penalty for anti social behaviour.",
