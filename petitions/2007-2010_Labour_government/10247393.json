            "background": "We need to, as a country abolish this attitude of killing to gain respect...many young people believe stabbing, shooting or attacking somebody creates status on the 'street', why? The only way to stop this is to change the way people think...we need discipline, use words young people understand and show that we will not take anymore murders. Show that we too can be rough, let the army take over the streets and be heard. People are not scared of the police, prison or courts they need to live in fear of consequences and quickly. Too many killings, it's gone too far now!!!",
