            "background": "\u2022Currently, milk is only free for under 5s in certain areas.\n\u2022Milk is a good way to keep children well hydrated.\n\u2022One serving will provide a 6-year-old with half his/her calcium.\n\u2022Dentists recommend water or milk as being best for teeth.\n\u2022Milk provides nutrients such as vitamin A, calcium, magnesium and zinc, which children with poor quality diets may miss out on.\n\u2022Children with milk in their diet tend to have better overall nutrient intakes than those who don\u2019t.\n\u2022Adults who did not drink milk as children are unlikely to do so later and therefore may have lower nutrient intakes and be at risk of poor bone and dental health. \n\u2022School milk and fruit combined provides a more complete nutrient package than fruit alone.\n\u2022When set against long term savings to the NHS, the annual cost of \u00a335 per child will be more than offset.\n\u2022This scheme would be an ideal partner to the already successful free fruit scheme and would provide a much needed boost for the health of Great Britain's population.",
