            "background": "In agreement with former Defence Secretary John Hutton, we are calling for additional support for British troops who desperately need more manpower, helicopters and protection from roadside bombs. This lack of adequate protection is causing unnecessary injury and death to frontline troops.\n\nChief of Defence Staff Sir Jock Stirrup went to Downing Street with a \"shopping list\" of equipment needed for Afghanistan. Both he and Army chief General Sir Richard Dannatt made clear that troop levels should not be reduced from 9,000 and may even need to be increased.\n\nPlease hold our Prime Minister responsible for the lives of any service personnel lost due to insufficient support.",
