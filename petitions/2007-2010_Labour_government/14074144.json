            "background": "As more people are encouraged to stop using their cars, bicycles are becoming a more common method of travel. Cyclists should not be able to get away with running through red lights or cycling on pavements when it suits them. Doing this presents a danger both to themselves and others. However, penalties for these offences are few and far between. This petition calls for the government to enforce penalties for cyclists and increase safety for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers.",
