            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The subject of drama has long been incorporated under the subject of english language, literature and/or the speaking and listening section of the National Curriculum. However, the drama involved is very minimal...often only involving an opportunity to use presentational skills when giving a powerpoint presentation or the opportunity to present vocal skills through class reading. This petition is to convince the Government and the DES that the subject of drama as an official, separate studying subject can offer more to students, for example skills in teamwork, communication, self confidence, independence and strengthening personality and one's own sense of identity can further aid one's own prospects when either preparing for University Application or when going for a job interview or simply just enable a surer sense of one's self and the particular skills and qualities they possess for a future career in an increasing creative industry.",
