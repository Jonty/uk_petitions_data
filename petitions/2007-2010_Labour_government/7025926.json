            "background": "Ulcerative colitis is lifelong chronic illness that requires lifelong medication, usually consisting of two or more ongoing prescriptions/medications. Cesation or reduction of such medication will in most cases lead to hospital admission and the requirement for surgery.\nThere is no action that colitis sufferers can take to stop the illness and there is no discernable link between lifestyle and the disease.\nWe would therefore suggest that it is only fair and proper that those diagnosed with colitis should receive free prescriptions for medications associated with their illness.",
