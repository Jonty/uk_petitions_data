        "action": "To make it ilegal for supply agencies to actively recruit and deploy unqualified cover supervisors for supply work as this is detrimental to the livelihood and professional development of supply teachers and NQTs that have worked hard to get their qualifications",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Since schools are recruiting cover supervisors for general cover work, supply agencies have started to recruit unqualified cover supervisors to do supply work. Newly qualified teachers can't get supply work to build up their experience and develop professionally. Supply teachers in general are being forced out of work.  This is against supply teachers' professional and human rights. Some supply teachers work this way because of difficulties in finding a teaching post, for health reasons or family commitments. The government should protect them and make sure that supply agencies stop recruiting unqualified staff to do supply teaching work.",
