Jack Straw yesterday announced that he would not grant Biggs his freedom for being unrepentant about his crime ,Biggs has had three strokes, he cannot speak and needs to be fed through a tube \u2013 but, in Mr Straw\u2019s words, that he is \u201cwholly unrepentant\u201d for his part in the crime which took place 46 years ago. Biggs is  now 79.He should be freed to spent the rest of his days with his family .\u201cAll the other Great Train Robbers served a third of their sentences, why should Ronnie be any different.This is an injustice !",
