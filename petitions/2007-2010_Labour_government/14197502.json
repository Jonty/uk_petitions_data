        "background": "Why should the BBC be given free money, whilst other TV channels gain no funding from the BBC TV License?\n\nWhy also is it satisfactory for the BBC to outsourse it's published programs to e.g. BBC Americas for viewing abroad.\n\nWhy also is it satisfactory for the BBC to use UK License holders money to spurn products for their own profit from the UK public, i.e. childrens toy product etc...?\n\nWith the current economic state the country has been placed into, would it not enable families with a lower income to utilise the monies used for a TV License on more benificial items, i.e. feeding their family?\n\nIs it not fair to the other broadcast network's such as ITV, Channel 4 etc... to not recieve monies from the TV License.\n\nSupport the scrappage of the BBC TV License, sign the petition!",
