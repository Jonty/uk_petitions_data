Although much more information is coming to the surface about what the Islanders did during the Occupation, little has been done to actually award the Islands in a suitable manner. \nFalkland Islanders really did suffer under occupation through their treatment at the hands of the invaders and they were constantly under threat of death. Consequently many did carry out acts which could have resulted in their being killed.\nIt is time something similar to the George Cross were awarded to the Islands.",
