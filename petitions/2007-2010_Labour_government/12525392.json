            "background": "Every year countless thousands of people are either refused travel, have to cancel trips or have a last minute panic when they discover their passport, or a childs passport, has expired or is about to expire. In numerous other areas reminders are sent - car tax, MOTs, TV licenses and income tax, to name a few. Sending passport reminders would save a great deal of anxiety, worry, cost and inconvenience and would be a valuable service. Passports are already expensive and a reminder service should be provided at no added cost. Such a system would help help the Passport Service as it would substantially elimiante pressures on staff and resources caused by seasonal surges in last minute applications.",
