The 5 mile section from Loughborough to Rothley is double tracked, making it unique in the country. The line gets many well known locomotives visiting. The Nottingham Transport Heritage centre ownes 9 miles of track from the NTHC at Ruddington to a siding by the Midland Mainline. We need to get across the MML and over some other obstacles to link up with the GCR, making us one of the longest railways in the UK. Then we can extend north and south, making us an Intercity steam railway",
