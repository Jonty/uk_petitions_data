            "background": "The NHS must provide FREE cranial remolding for babies with Flathead Syndrome.\nLike my baby, it affects 1 in 60 babies yearly and is caused by a babys environment ie prams/cots causing pressure on its soft, still forming skull and forcing the skull flat.\nCranial remolding typically begins at 6 months old and great improvement seen within a few months. This involves wearing a custom made helmet,it relieves pressure on the affected side and allows it to grow normally.\nThe NHS wont fund this as the condition is 'cosmetic'.Studies have shown hearing, vision and developmental problems can occur. The NHS would rather we wait and see and oh well if it does not improve! If there's no improvement there is a chance of facial/head abnormalities, as they get older, bullying and low selfesteem. A child can have their ears pinned or braces for free for these same reasons!\nOther countries provide this treatment either by health insurance or free like Spain. UK babies have to pay \u00a32000 privately!",
