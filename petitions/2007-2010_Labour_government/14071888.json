        "background": "I propose allowing law-abiding people to arm themselves for personal protection - \n\nAll adult permanent residents of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall be entitled to an Firearms Permit for life providing that they -\n\n1. DO NOT have a conviction for a serious violent or sexual crime, a conviction for alcohol related violence or a history of recidivism (repeat offending).\n\n2. DO NOT have a history of mental instability or serious mental illness.\n\nMinor, non-violent convictions such as possession of soft drugs for personal use or simple possession of an offensive weapon should NOT be a barrier to obtaining a Firearms Permit. \nThe Firearms Permit may ONLY be withdrawn on conviction of offences such as those stated above.\n\nThe Firearms Permit shall entitle the holder to own, carry and use any number of handguns, shotguns and semi-automatic rifles for self-defence purposes. It shall remain illegal to possess a firearm without a valid Firearms Permit.",
