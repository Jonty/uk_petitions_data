We also want to be charged AFTER the decision has been made.",

            "background": "Many many of us have had terrible experiences of calling the Home Office as regards ILR applications and have been spoken to bluntly.  We do not get any information from them until 14 weeks are up.  Within the 14 weeks we should be told at least, which office is dealing with our case and whether or not someone is dealing with it.  Also when it comes to the end of 14 weeks we should at least be given a good answer as to why we have not yet received it, and why it is taking so long.  We should not need to pay until it is actually being processed.  No other company would charge you for something and then leave you to wait for months before actually dealing with it.",
