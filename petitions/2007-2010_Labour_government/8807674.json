            "background": "The changes to the Schools admissions policy recently are rendering a child's education a lottery.  It should be done locationally again, as previously, thus ensuring greater certainty for local children and siblings' education and less congestion and pollution caused by traffic from School pupils having to commute longer distances etc.  If the govt. want to improve schooling (which is what they are trying to do) improve teachers pay, encourange school improvements and ecourange pride for each school.",
