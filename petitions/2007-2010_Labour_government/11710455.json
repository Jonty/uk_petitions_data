        "background": "Camelot is a small theme park in Chorley that has been there for as long as I can remember.  It is the only theme park dedicated to the old English myth of King Arthur.  Over the past few years it has been turned from a vibrant competitor to Alton Towers, to a run down small park, and unfortunately yesterday the receivers were called in.  In addition to this Camelot also has a rare breeds farm that helps rare animals from becoming extinct.  I am petitioning for the government to step in and save this small theme park, and to redevelop it for future generations and also to turn it into a interactive learning centre for children to go and have fun whilst learning about the myths of the British Isles, such as King Arthur as well as a conservation area for rare breeds",
