        "background": "At schools and throughout the country, whenever someone is cut, they use a plaster to help the skin recover, however the colour of typical plasters matches a caucasian persons skin colour with its peach type colour, and stands out on coloured peoples skin. We ask that this typical colour should be extinguished from all plasters, and a neutral colour should be used throughout society, which has no link to any caste. After all, former Prime Minister stated during the Notorius Big Brother row in parliament, that \"We should aim to resist racism in all its forms\".",
