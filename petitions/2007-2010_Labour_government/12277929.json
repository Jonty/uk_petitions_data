        "background": "Retired pensioners are no longer adding to the economy and are actually drain in terms of receiving money and services from the government. They are also more likely to vote on single issues in elections. They are also less likely consider the long term future in their decisions. They are valued members of society, but they are too powerful in terms of voting power, thus each retired person should have their voting rights halved. This would tip the balance in favor of the more productive members of society",
