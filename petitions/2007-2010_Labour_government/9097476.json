            "background": "BAA has demonstrated (with its Airline Partner British Airways) that it does not have the necessary skills and management to upgrade our decrepit Airport Infrastructure (Especially Heathrow and Gatwick) to a level consistent with safe, secure and efficient running of an international airport.\n\nThe current fiasco at Terminal 5 merely underlines BAA's lack of delivery on ALL UK airports under its control. \n\nWhilst BAA was a government body, at least it was under some form of control. Now it is owned and managed by a Spanish Building firm, it is demonstrably no longer acting for the interests of Britain: Constructing a \u00a34.5bn Shopping Mall near Heathrow and claiming its a passenger terminal is merely the last straw.",
