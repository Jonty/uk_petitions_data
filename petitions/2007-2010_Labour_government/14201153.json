Over 500 MS patients have been tested and all have shown deformities in their Jugular veins. No one in the control groups had the deformities.\n\nDoctors in Italy, The US and Poland have carried out procedures on dozens of MS patients, where stents are placed in the Jugular veins to allow the free movement of blood to the brain. Those who have undergone the procedure report miraculous improvement in their condition.",
