            "background": "Most of the council's in the country are giving preference to people of 50 and over for the best properties on the council housing list, in Leeds a person under 60 is not even considered for a bungalow, this practice amounts to ageism and cherry picking the best properties for people of a certain age. I totally agree that people with medical problems should be given preference for ground floor properties, but a 25 year old person can be more disabled than an 85 year old person, people should be judged on their needs, not on their age. Why should a 60 year old with medical needs be eligible for a suitable home, whilst a 18 year old with medical needs is barely eligible to apply for anything at all? And even worse than that, people without medical needs over 60 are being given bungalows whilst severely disabled young people are not even allowed to apply for them. Ageism on the housing list stinks and it must be banned as soon as possible... Ageism is unethical in every place, not just the work place!",
