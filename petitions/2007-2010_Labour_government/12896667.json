            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Ronnie has served 8 years now, he is nearly 80 and in extremely poor health.  He did commit a crime, that's true, but you impose lesser sentences for rapists, murderers, paedophiles and child killers and also show more compassion to them eg Jamie Bulger killers and we feel that Ronnie should now be freed.  You have admitted he will not reoffend again & that is more than can be said of many offenders you release back into the community.  Ronnie Biggs has human rights so let him have basic human right to die free with family and friends around him",
