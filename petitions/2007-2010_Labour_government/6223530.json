            "background": "I really don't understand why benefit fraud is seen as so much more serious than tax fraud; both cheat the Treasury of funds but tax fraud does so to a much greater extent.  In addition, as previously remarked, benefit fraudsters commit their crime out of desperation, because rates are so low, whereas TAX fraudsters are just being greedy.  Hard-working people in jobs (especially low-paid) understandably resent people receiving benefits; but why do they not equally resent people (who generally have a much higher income than they have) getting away with not paying tax when they have it deducted from their wages automatically and without any choice?",
