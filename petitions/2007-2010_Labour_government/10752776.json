            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Why are the Banks reluctant to lend people money?  Because their greed has seen them loan money unwisely on a staggering scale.  They don't want to take risks on unsafe loans to customers or to other banks.  In the meantime, they seek to recoup their losses by increasing the price of the money they do make available.\n\nSo, the Banks are responsible for the financial \"meltdown\" we are all affected by.  However, they tell us that the only way to ease the crisis is for us - the hard pressed taxpayer - to underwrite the loans they want to issue as mortgages in the future.\n\nSo.  The Banks will loan money and continue to take the nice profit from \"good\" debtors without the risk of defaults by bad debtors - WE will have to foot the bill for them.  No wonder they are all clamouring for Government to bail them out in this way!\n\nAre you prepared to subsidise the obscene profits in our banking sector?  Are you prepared to work yourself into the ground so that your taxes can be used to maintain private sector profitability and shareholder dividends?\n\nSign here if you're not.",
