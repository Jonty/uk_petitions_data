            "background": "The outpouring of sympathy shown in the wake of Michael \"Jacko\" Jacksons death shows how many little people he touched in his life, all around the world. Here we are just hours after his death and so many people, most of them sane, are in tears over a man they never met and, indeed, had very little chance of ever meeting. Some had probably never even bought an album of his. It seems fitting to ride this tide of public opinion and make June 25th, the day of his death, an annual holiday.",
