            "background": "Israel has blockaded Gaza for over a year in response to the Palestinian people electing a government of which Israel didn't approve. Israel withholds tax revenues, cooking gas, medical supplies and even water, and severely curtails the movement of the people. Its arguable that this in itself constitutes a War Crime as an occupying power has a duty of care to the civilian population under its jurisdiction, as stipulated by The 4th Geneva Convention. So things were bad enough in Gaza before 20th December 2008, but then Israel launched an attack with state of the art military firepower against a captive, besieged and virtually defenceless civilian population. Much of that hardware is British in origin. So far more than 300 CHILDREN have been killed by Israel in this latest onslaught alone. We demand the Prime Minister prevent our hands being stained with any more blood, by immediately halting the ongoing supply of arms to the Jewish state.",
