Its railway station was closed in 1964 for reasons unknown.  Road congestion on both the A38 and in Welington town center is increasing more and more which means that the railway line offers a potential alternative aswell as reducing emissions and reducing traffic outside of the Local St Johns Primary School which is situated on the main Wellington through road making it safer for children walking to school.",
