        "action": "object to the inclusion of a large Supermarket and Car Park in the Bishopbriggs Town Centre Redevelopment.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The proposed Supermarket, almost double the size of the existing Bishopbriggs Morrisons and with a 60% increase in car parking spaces, will result in a substantial increase in traffic on the already overloaded, pollution blackspot of Kirkintilloch Road, Bishopbriggs.  In addition, traffic will also increase on the adjacent residential streets which at present serve two Primary Schools, a Childrens Nursery and Sheltered Housing.  We believe that Bishopbriggs does not need a larger retail food facility and the consequential increase in traffic and pollution must be avoided.",
