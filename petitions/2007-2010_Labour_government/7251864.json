        "background": "We believe that there should be an amount of UCAS points (probably 20) which should be given to individuals if they have a full driving licence. UCAS already offers points for such accomplishments as achieving a certain level of musical proficiency and we believe it is unfair that such a necessary skill for attaining a job goes unrewarded when someone who can play a guitar at advanced level receives points for a skill which often has no bearing on suitability for a job.",
