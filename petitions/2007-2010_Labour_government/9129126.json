            "background": "Paper cash and coins fuels the black economy and tempts those who are paid in cash only or largely in cash to not declare their full earnings to tax authorities, HMRC.  By phasing out cash with auditable cash-less cards over a 10 year period, with education and support for the few without bank cards now, the tax coffers will dramatically increase and a fairer level of contribution will be made by many people not paying tax currently.",
