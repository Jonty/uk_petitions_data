            "action": "Force Ofcom to investigate significant breaches in UK Competition legislation by Kingston Communications (KC - part of the KCOM Group) in the Hull area through the illegal \"tying\" of its local telephone calls services with its telephone lines, which makes the supply of a telephone line to both residential and businesses in the Hull area by KC conditional on the purchase of its local telephone calls, of which under both UK and European Competition Law is illegal where no objective justification for the tying can be provided and to therefore force Ofcom to force KCOM to provide local call services on a \"metered\" \"pay as you go basis\" therefore allowing customer choice and competition to exist in the market for local telephone calls",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Ofcom has consistantly failed to create the conditions for competition for telecommunications in the Hull area and are clearly following a different agenda in terms of regulatory oversight of BT and the KCOM Group. \n\nThis is one of many issues of which ofcom has failed to address or investigate. \n\nEvery EU and UK Competition expert consulted with has expressed that the \"tying\" of telephony services under UK Competition legislation relating to a \"abuse of a dominant position\" is totally illegal due to the effect that these breaches have on the levels of competition in the market.       \n\nThis petition is therefore designed to form part of a class action of both Hull residents and businesses who force Ofcom to do its job in terms of market regulation within the Hull area of which it constinantly failed to do - through one reason or another !",
