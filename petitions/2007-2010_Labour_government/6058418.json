            "background": "We call upon the government to oppose the use of needle dispensing machines.\n\nWe believe needle exchange should be provided in controlled, supervised locations where professional staff are able to ensure that all that can be done is done to enable access to appropriate intervention programmes, it is our view that needle dispensing machines risk undermining the benefits provided by high quality, comprehensive needle exchange and intervention services.\n \nSuch machines pose a serious risk to the integrity of quality pharmacy and health centre based needle exchange programmes. Where government decides that the use of needle dispensing machines is acceptable then government should introduce stringent guidelines to mitigate against any detrimental effect on the local community ensuring these facilities are not provided adjacent to schools, youth clubs or where they may have a detrimental impact on the local community.",
