            "background": "Guyana, home of some of the most intact rainforest in the world, is the second-poorest country in South America, largely dependent on the now-uneconomical export of sugar.\n\nThe Guyanan government has had to allow logging of the rainforest, as a source of revenue.  Logging began in the north and is spreading south - a US company has been allowed rights to explore one million acres of rainforest. \n\nGuyana has offered to place its entire standing forest under the control of a British-led international body, in a bid to secure development aid and technical assistance to change to a green economy \u2013 to date there has been no public response to the proposal.\n\nThe rainforest is a vital and cost-effective means of fighting climate change \u2013 more CO2 will be produced from deforestation in the next four years than that produced by all \u2018plane flights, from the Wright Brothers, through to the year 2025!\n\nThis rainforest is of global importance, and needs our action now, to secure its future.",
