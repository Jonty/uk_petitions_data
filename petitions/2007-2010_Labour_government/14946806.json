The Asian Network provides a vital voice for people of Asian descent in this country and closing it is not neccessary.\n\nBoth the Asian Network and 6 Music are tangible assets with a loyal following. They should not be sacrificed for something purely subjective, ie 'better quality programmes,' as 'better' is likely to mean 'cheaper.'",
