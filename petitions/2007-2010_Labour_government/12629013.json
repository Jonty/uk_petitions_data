We feel that a revolution is called for and to appoint a fair and equal 'People's Parliament'. One where we protect British jobs, oust immigrants who are work-shy and out to claim every benefit under the sun and to bring back 'National Service', so that the chavs of Britain have something to do, rather than hang about on the streets causing a nuisance.",
