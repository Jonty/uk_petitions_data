As long as he does not incite violence or crime, he should be allowed to come to the UK and express his views, regardless of whether we like them or not. Freedom of speach is what makes the UK different from countries such as North Korea or Zimbabwe, once we start denting our basic freedoms, we risk loosing them all.",
