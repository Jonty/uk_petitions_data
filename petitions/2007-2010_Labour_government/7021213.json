        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We believe Yates of the Yard has fearlessly investigated the allegations of corruption at the heart of Tony Blair's government, and deserves recognition for his work in search of the truth. He was unafraid to question ministers and Downing Street aides despite the considerable tide of opinion against him at times within Westminster. We believe it is police officers such as Yates who help create a decent and fair society, and he should be elevated to the House of Lords where, as Lord Yates, he would be an invaluable addition to those working hard  to keep the government, and all future governments, in check.",
