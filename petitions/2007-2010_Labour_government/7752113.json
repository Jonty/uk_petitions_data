            "background": "The practice of importing software such as DVDs and video games is perfectly legal, but often the imported software will not run because players for that system will refuse to play them as they are region-coded. As a result, in the UK we often are forced to pay higher prices than those typically available elsewhere in the world for software.\n\nI believe the practice of allowing equipment manufacturers to allow region-coding of software should be made illegal as it effectively restrains free trade.",
