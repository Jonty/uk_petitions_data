Now, living with my parents in the Midlands, the signal is either very weak or cannot get a signal at all. I have had calls where the signal goes during the call and the call ends. I have spoken to my mobile network and they told me I have to pay \u00a3150 to cancel my contract as I have 6 months left on my contract. When I took out the contract out end Nov, I was not planning on moving back to my parents the following year. There must be other mobile network customers who have moved house and cannot get a signal where they moved to. Why should we pay them for cancelling their service when they don't provide a good service?",
