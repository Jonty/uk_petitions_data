            "background": "There was once a very famous Ice Rink in Kensington and Fairfield Liverpool unfortunately it was demolished in 1990. We feel storngly that the return of an Ice Rink managed and owned by the Communtiy would act as a community anchor and catalyst, creating new jobs, and giving the young people a great activity to take part in. The profit would be reinvested in other communtiy activities and ventures. It would also improve the image of the area, which even after \u00a362.5 million New Deal funding is still pretty poor.",
