            "background": "British troops out of Afghanistan in this unjust illegal war get the facts right on 9/11 before deciding to invade Afghanistan on a pack of lies all for world domination oil and wealth.\n\nWe have twice as many British trops serving in Afghanistan as we do in Iraq British troops are getting killed almost daily the number of casualties for the Brits is almost 100 and we need to tell Gordon Brown enough is enough. Its been estimated that up to 10,000 to 100,000 Afghans have lost there lives in this unjust un wannable war that needs to end now. This war is not worth a single British or Afghan life so lets leave Helmand Kandahar and Musa Qala and come home they can kill hundreds of Taliban a day there will be another hundred waiting the war is un winnable and unjust let Afghanistan deal with there own problems and according to a British General that said UK troops should be there for 50 years I don't know about you but that is just pathetic I say we end this unjust war now and have every British troops withdrawn from Afghanistan now instead of Gordon Brown sending more and troops to get killed I think we need to get out of Afghanistan now what do you think?",
