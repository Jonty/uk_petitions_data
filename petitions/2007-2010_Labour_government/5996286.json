        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We have seen recently many items in the news about youths showing lack of respect and without direction or purpose in their lives, causing many social and criminal problems.\n\nI suggest the introduction of 1 - 2 years \"Military style\" Civil (non-combat) HOME Service (CHS), for those not in full time work or education at 18. Employment for example bolstering the security guarding UK power stations and other potential terrorist targets, also providing valuable man power for the likes of natural disasters assisting the civil authorities. Such as the present floods. \n\nMinimum training cost, perhaps 8 weeks basic training, then teach them a trade, i.e. brick layer, computing, plumbing or HGV driving. Their wages could be enhanced dole money, gaining extra for each training course they qualify in. Then when they come out, they do have something to offer the marketplace, a trade and more self respect and respect for others.",
