It is unfair that those who cannot afford to buy and are housed by the coucil that when they have a child they are not a priority to be moved to more suitable accommodation but are expected to sleep in the living room when their child needs a bed. They also have to put family planning on hold as they will still not be moved from a one bedroom flat even if they already have 1 child and another on the way (speaking from current situation) More social houses are needed to meet the demand when there are people with too many bedrooms and those with not enough!",
