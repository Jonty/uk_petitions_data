            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In many countries, a system of exchange operates for unwanted household items whereby every 4 to 8 weeks, householders are invited to put out their unwanted items on a designated evening. The dates are publicly available, so that anyone who is looking for items can go around and help themselves. The residue is collected by the council in the morning.\n\n\n This would encourage re - use of items that would otherwise be dumped, as well as enabling people to learn repair skills. I am proposing that councils in the UK should introduce a similar system, perhaps as a trial at first. In order to make it cost neutral, the operating hours of the household waste dumps could be reduced.",
