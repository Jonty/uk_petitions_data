            "background": "The National Blood Service bans men who have had gay anal/oral sex from donating blood for life \u2013 even if they have always used safe-sex measures/were always monogamous. In contrast, a heterosexual having unprotected sex with multiple partners is not banned for life.\n\nAustralia, Argentina, Japan, and Hungary let men donate blood one year after their last sexual activity. While we believe the NBS\u2019s policy to be discriminatory and unfair, we note that NBS will only change their policy if peer-reviewed evidence is found to support deferral periods/removal of the ban. \n\nWe call on HM Government to fund more research into developing accurate screening techniques and creating better epidemiological models to assess the AIDS issue. We call on HMG to fund research into deferral periods, ranging from years to months, so that a modern evidence base may be generated that lets NBS policies to be better evaluated in light of recent advances and assumptions. For example, research in 2003 by Germain et al (Transfusion 2003;43:25-33) has suggested that a one-year deferral period, used in a nation the size of the USA, would cause only \u2018one additional case of HIV every 2000 years.\u2019",
