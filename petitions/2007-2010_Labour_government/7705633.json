            "background": "It costs more to travel in the UK than anywhere else in Europe thanks to sky high fuel duty, ever increasing rail fares and a creaking infrastructure which has been starved of investment since the 1960s.\n\nI therefore petition the government to recognise that Britain's commuters do not travel for pleasure, but to places of work.  Moreover I believe that in order for the \"green\" initiative to be taken seriously, cheap and efficient public transport needs to be urgently provided as a viable alternative to the controversial and hugely unpopular \"road pricing scheme\".\n\nFailure to provide cheap and efficient alternatives will be viewed by the British taxpayer as a cynical exercise in revenue extraction from the ever burdened motoring public.",
