            "background": "I think that it would be a disgrace for Gordon Brown to attend the D-Day celebrations because he will not publicly attend any of the funerals of those soldiers who die in foreign places, namely Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIf anything it should be both the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Princes William and Harry who should attend. It is totally inappropriate for Gordon Brown to attend, he is not a Head of State, unlike the other foreign leaders attending.\n\nIf he did not read out the names of the dead every wednesday at Prime Ministers Questions and just admitted to our involvement in acts which bring shame on our country then I might just have supported his attendance. However, I consider that it is an illegal war and illegal acts have been committed in our name.",
