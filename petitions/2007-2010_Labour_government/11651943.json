The birds are:\n\n1) Proper punishment for criminals\n2) Green energy\n\nThe stone is:\n\nPrison conditions need to be horrendous.  Cells need to be shared (nothing but a bucket) and food just bread and water.  So bad, that they look forward to the day!  From 9-5 (just like everyone else) prisoners should be made to work.  Get them all on exercise bikes, pedalling all day to create energy for the nation.  (Not quite sure how the technology works, but sure there's a way!)  Get army style enforcement in there too to ensure productivity.",
