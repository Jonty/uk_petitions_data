            "background": "Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley has publicly stated in his column on the Manchester Confidential website that Dyslexia is a fictional condition created by the educational establishment to cover up their educational failings, and as such, he further implies that dyslexics are 'functionally illiterate' and hints also that they are predisposed to crime and substance abuse. \n\nThis was stated using false, incorrect and misleading evidence, and ignored the medical and scientific evidence that states it as a valid and genuine learning disability.\n\nAs an MP, he should not have stated this in open forum until he had evidence based on fact, and this abuse of position and privilege should not go unpunished.",
