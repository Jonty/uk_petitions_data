This is 2009 and it is about time we had a specific day dedicated to all people affected by disability - and that is everyone. \n\nWe want better access both in attitude and into buildings. We are people first and are proud; affected by disability second and that is Not a Crime! We should not have to fight for what we are entitled to and that is Acceptance for who we are! If you are proud to have people as friends who are affected by disability or are frustrated by the lack of access and facilities and how hard it is to fight for what we need and expect and are also sick of being treated like a second class citizen, please join and sign up! Your views matter as does your signatures!",
