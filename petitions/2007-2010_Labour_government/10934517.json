            "background": "The EU has implemented a law banning side facing seats in vehicles, this will effect Buses, Ambulances, Trains etc, etc, the cost for those able to conform will be huge and there will be some sections of business for which it is impossible to comply due to the vehicle design, all of which means job losses at a time when we need all the employment we can retain. Certain vehicles have a record of no injuries at all and are safer than taking a flight on a plane yet no referendum was given to our section of business on the subject and neither were we consulted or forewarned about this regulation. I therefore request that our Government veto's this law until such consultation has been taken with those afected.",
