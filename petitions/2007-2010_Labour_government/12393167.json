They have went without complaint where some have paid the ultimate sacrifice while others have been maimed.\n\nAfter fighting for Queen and Country they are treated worse than migrant workers arriving in the UK on a daily basis.\n\nIt is a deplorable and despicable way in which to treat these men and their families.\n\nGordon Brown should stand up and be counted.  He should be man enough to review this decision as soon as possible and put it right.",
