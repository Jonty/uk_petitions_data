In-car smoking is banned in Brazil and in Germany, they are attempting to impose a smoking ban whilst driving. \n\nA popular German newspaper reported on accident research which showed that a vehicle travelling 50 kilometres (31 miles) per hour will still travel 14 metres (16 yards) per second whilst the driver scrabbles around for a fallen cigarette. Clearly there is huge potential for an accident whilst the driver has taken their eye off the road or dipped in concentration.\n\nRecent Spanish research indicates that smokers are twice as likely to be involved in a serious road accident as non-smokers.",
