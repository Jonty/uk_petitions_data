            "background": "The press laid the blame for Gary Newlove's death at the foot of the teenager's parents . However , what control could their parents wield over them ? Ask them nicely not to go out ?\n\nThe bible says \"train a child up in the way it should go and it shall not depart from it when its older,\" and \"spare the rod and (you will) spoil the child.\" Sadly many of our children are spoilt but whose fault is this when their parents are not allowed to minister such Godly discipline ?\n\n We used to employ the cane at school how many children died as a result ? Mmmm none ? Corporal punishment and Godly parental discipline were banished from our land, how many are dying now as a result of waywood teenagers ? \n\nI petition that parents be given the right to discipline their children in a Godly way .",
