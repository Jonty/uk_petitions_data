        "background": "Gift Aid helps charities to maximise a donation from an individual with 28% added by the treasury. Its brilliant and a fabulous extra to fundraising. However the administration of gaining Gift Aid declarations from donors, many of whom do not fully understand the system and the administration of the claims takes a huge ammount of time and resources for organisations.\n\nTherefore in these troubled financial times it would be fantastic if the Chancellor allowed all charities to assume Gift Aid unless someone actively opts out of the system. This would boost charitable income and release resources across the UK.\n\nPlease Mr. Darling allow charities to assume Gift Aid?",
