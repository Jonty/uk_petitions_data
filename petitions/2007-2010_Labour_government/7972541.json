The influx of East European workers has resulted in a higher number of accidents on UK roads.\n\nThis ePetition is a request to make it compulsory for workers who move to the UK to take a compulsroy driving test to ensure that they understand the rules of UK roads and meet the standards expected of driving in the UK.\n\nThe test will help reduce the numbers of accidents and deaths that have been caused by this problem in recent years.",
