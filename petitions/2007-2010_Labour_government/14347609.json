        "background": "Recently French President Nicolas Sarcozy has made it clear that the use of burkas is not welcome in France. In a similar way we would also like to express concern over the increase in the use of garments used to cover a woman from head to toe and hide their faces. We feel the burka is not a religious sign but a sign of the submission of women. The burka creates an uneasy feel with many Britons and hides the identity of an increasing number of citizens and for what purpose? Many Britons will draw their own conclusions of the reasons for hiding faces and they most likely will be very negative conclusions. More over they may be sceptical views towards the underlying reasons for wearing such attire which hides ones identity. One further issue is that of safety, with such severly limited peripheral vision and so many vehicles on our already cramped roads network - should those wearing burkas legally be allowed to drive a vehicle? If we were to visit an Islamic state we would be forced to abide by their rules... I think its time for change here in Britain too.",
