            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Compulsory reporting legislation for child abuse/neglect already exists in many countries including all 50 States in the USA, all Canadian States (bar Yukon Territory) and all Australian States (bar Western Australia). The introduction of this legislation is long overdue in the UK (please refer to Hansard Written Answers 6th May 2003 Child Abuse \u2013 Mr Hilary Benn & Mrs Helen Clark). In November 2005 the petitioner, who was employed by a mental health agency, reported child sexual abuse allegations with 9 indicators, in accordance with her employer\u2019s guidelines and under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, to the Police and Social Services and she was promptly suspended from her employment. In October 2006 her employment was terminated - if mandatory reporting legislation had existed in the UK this could not have happened. There is currently no legal obligation to report child abuse or neglect in the UK - help us to change this by adding your name to this petition to make reporting compulsory and the UK a safer place for children.",
