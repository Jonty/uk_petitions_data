            "background": "The Ban the Bump Key campaign aims to stop the sale of specialist locksmith equipment to the general public.  \n\nThis will help to ensure that tools capable of opening doors to homes and businesses remain only in the hands of recognised locksmiths and security professionals - and not in the hands of those with criminal intentions.\n\nWHY?\n- Over 4 million websites mention lock bumping, a technique which can be used to open the cylinder locks found on approximately 65% of UK exterior doors.\n\n- Bump keys can be bought by anyone for just a few pounds.\n\n- Sites such as You Tube offer demonstrations and tips for mastering the lock bumping technique which can be used to break-in to homes. \n\n- Bump keys, lock breakers and lock picks should only be available to recognised locksmiths and security professionals.\n\nBy signing the Ban the Bump Key petition you will be helping us to prevent thieves using specialist tools and techniques made widely available by the internet.",
