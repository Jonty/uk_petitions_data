            "background": "At present a perfectly innocent person may be held, against his or her will, for four weeks (28 days) on mere suspicion of terrorist activity and then released. No charges need be bought and no evidence produced for this incarceration, but the disruption to such an innocent person's life is hard to quantify.\n\nNow our present government is suggesting that this time be extended to 58 days, or over EIGHT WEEKS.\n\nIf the police do their job and only arrest people when they have a body of evidence to support the guilt of that individual, it should never be necessary to extend the period of detention beyond  the 28 days already in force.\n\nPlease do not let more innocent lives be  damaged by this unwarranted further reduction in civil liberties and basic habeas corpus rights.\n\nPlease sign this petition and make your voice heard.",
