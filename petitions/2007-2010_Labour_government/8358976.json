        "background": "every day we have miles of tail backs on our motorways in the uk caused by trucks trying to overtake each other on uphill and downhill gradients when they know they only travel about 1 or 2 km faster than each other and make no progress for miles. They are not allowed to do this in most european countries so why is it still happening here?",
