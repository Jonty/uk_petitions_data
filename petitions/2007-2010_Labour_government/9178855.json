            "background": "Mr Al Fayed has frequently accused members of our Royal Family and many others in authority of murdering Princess Diana, but has never produced one shred of evidence.He stands convicted of the most serious and wicked slander. He has also pursued his own personal vendetta, and cost the British taxpayer many millions of pounds. His assets in Britain should be confiscated, and used to defray the vast legal expenses, as well as paying damages to those he has slandered. This should be done as quickly as possible.",
