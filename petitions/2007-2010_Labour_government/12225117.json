            "background": "My name is Amanda Amory, I am an aspiring scriptwriter and I feel that there is a lack of positive Black-British representation on television, and would like this changed. \n\nThere is a wealth of vibrancy, humour, drama and passion in the Black-British community that deserves to be heard on TV and there are many talented actors/writers on television who have blazed a trail for us, but there is still room for MUCH more.\n\nI have personally heard from Television Industry professionals that there is a need for a larger Black representation on TV as what we have now is far from ideal, which is unfortunate in this day and age and in such a multicultural society such as ours. \n\nThis is why I am urging you to please sign this petition in the hope that it changes things for the better.\n\nThankyou.",
