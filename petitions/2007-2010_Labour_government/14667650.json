            "background": "Since the CSA has been going they have done the assessments on how much the non resident parent pays to the resedent parent based on the amount of nights the child/children stay with them through out the year. I have my child 4 days a week and 2 nights they are now coming up to 14 years old and this has been the case since they were 2 years old, when you ask the CSA why they base it on nights they can not give you an answer and just say to you its the way it is and we can not change it. Night time does not cost! During the day you have to feed your child/children but they do not allow for this in the assessments and you still have to pay the resident parent and not only do they get your money they also get child benifit which thewn allows them to claim family tax credits/working family tax credits",
