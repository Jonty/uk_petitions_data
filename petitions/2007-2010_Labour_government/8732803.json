This needs to be challenged by everybody who supports the tradition of The Great British Public House. Our Landlords need more support than ever to be able to continue to trade and the working man and woman needs to be able to make their own decision as to whether they sit down or not to drink. Responsibility for a safe drinking environment is the responsibility of each Licensed premises, we do not want a blanket ban, let the Police oppose applications for a License on those premises which serve without control and leave our local Public Houses alone.\n\nMark Dilworth",
