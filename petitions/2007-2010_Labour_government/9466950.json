            "background": "The reason more house prices rise exorbitantly is that estate agents usually arrange the valuation of the selling property. This is not a fair and just act, as it is biased due to them having a vested interest in the price of the property as the greater the price the bigger the fee they make.\nI propose legislation be made so that valuations have to be sort by the seller independently of the estate agent and that the average of 3 valuations be made. Also a flat fee be introduced so that any corrupted valuations be kept and regulated to a minimum.",
