        "action": "Abide by the governments stated aim to encourage people to work past retirement age by allowing those who so choose to work on beyond retirement age to receive and keep all their pension rather than reducing their tax codes so that the majority of pension is clawed back by the state.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The government encourages those past retirement age to continue working and asks if they wish their pensions to be deferred or to be paid at retirement. If the pension is deferred the government wins because the pension payment will not be as much because the pensioner will die sooner after choosing to take the pension. If the pensioner chooses to take the pension the amount of income that can be earned before tax is reduced by the amount of the pension. Either way the government is a three time winner (1) It receives funds during the persons employment that in can invest; (2)it gains from longer economic output by the person and (3) It either has a reduced pension liability or claws it back in taxes. This state of affairs is morally indefensible and an afront to those who have given their working lives for this nation IT MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE",
