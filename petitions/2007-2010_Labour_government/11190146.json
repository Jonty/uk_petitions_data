            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The UK is perhaps the only country in Europe where the price of diesel has far outstripped the price of unleaded fuel.  In France for example, diesel is still cheaper than unleaded.  This unfairly discriminates against people who use diesel which they were encouraged to do by the Government in the interest of reducing pollution.  It is now a purely artificial price inflation and is akin to price fixing by oil retailers.  Apart from private drivers, virtually all carriage is by lorries using diesel and so puts up prices of everything we buy.\nThis Government should launch an enquiry into why this situation has occurred and take all necessary steps to reduce the pump price of diesel.",
