That is why the anti-bed society has been formed.\n\nWe are succeeding in changing attitudes, and in making people realise that one of their responsibilities is to stay out of bed and go clubbing or stay up and watch late night TV instead.\n\nNot sleeping provides a valuable and cost-effective method of preventing the most common form of death.\n\nWe estimate that several hundred thousand lives a year will be saved if people stop going to bed.",
