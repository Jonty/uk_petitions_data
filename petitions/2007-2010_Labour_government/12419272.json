If he fails to sort out the problem then he will have nobody to blame but himself. If he does sort it out then he will get the credit.\n\nWhat I do not want to happen is for him to lose power and then for Gordon Brown and his supporters to say that if we had only been able to stay in power we would have sorted it out. We had the solutions, only you voted us out of power and let these other people in who have messed up.",
