And the government should put tougher measures in place to remove them from pavements where they are a serious hazard to pedestrians.  Why should we have to share the roads with cyclists who do not pay road tax, insurance and have not had any form of training to gain any kind of license?\nI think they should have to pay for all these things plus a yearly MOT and be subject to prosecution for poor conduct as all other road users are.  Only then would I have any respect for them.",
