            "background": "Penhale Cadet Training Camp is under serious threat of closure. It is also the home of the annual Griffin Camp for Cadets. It is a very old camp but still presents numerous oppurtunities that no other training camp could. No Cadet that has been to Penhale Training Camp would want it to be closed, some think of it as a \"home away from home\". There are Facebook groups containing hundreds of Cadets and even Staff who work at Penhale Training Camp, to try and prevent it from closing. This Camp is very special to Cadets from the Air Training Corps, Army Cadet Force and Sea Cadet Corps. Closure of Penhale Camp would be criminal.",
