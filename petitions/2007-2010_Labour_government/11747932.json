Britian must also legislate similar actions to secure our economy and the future of the working man. The average UK tax payer (who is in danger of losing his home) should not be bled  to pay for more additional homes or yachts of people who made their lavish lifestyles possible by hoodwinking the nation's populous with their corrupt schemes.",
