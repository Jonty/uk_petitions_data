            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I wish to propose that all rails fares and utility prices (inclusive of where the service provider is a privately owned company) are regulated and caped by the government. The UK consumer consistently  bear the brunt of price increases that our European counterparts are not subjected to, whilst wholesale price reductions are all too often not passed onto the consumer. This disproportionate and inconsistent pricing is totally unacceptable. As is increasingly the case in the UK today we (the public) feel incapable and powerless to do anything and so more often than not are forced to sit back and frustratingly accept these price rises simply because we feel there is no choice or alternative. This return to \"Rip Off Britain\" is the governments creating and so accordingly it's their responsibility. Now it is they who must start to represent us the public and electorate. Just as with parking tickets this all too common feeling that there is nothing we can do and that it's pointless to even try is representative of the breakdown of society and peoples disassociation with any sense of community.",
