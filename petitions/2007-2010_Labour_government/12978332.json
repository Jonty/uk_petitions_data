A natural change has occured only to find it's now getting lighter earlier. Unfortualty the UK government has not acted or even noticed!! With this time lost in the evening we could boost the economy by creating new jobs with bars and restaurants thriving, allowing shops to open later. Currently most of the UK public are sleeping through early morning day light. What a waste!",
