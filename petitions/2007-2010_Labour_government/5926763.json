Claim forms, GP's reports, medical notes and welfare officers appear to be reglarly ignored. Many of us have to rely on the charity of others for basic needs.  We get no help from the SPVA with priority treatment certificates.\n \nDeterioration claims take months to process and are routinely rejected, triggering an even longer appeals process.  \n\nWe deserve better.",
