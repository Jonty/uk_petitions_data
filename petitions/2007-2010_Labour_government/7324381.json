            "background": "The A21 has become so busy the current infrastructure just cant stand the heavy volumes of traffic, there have been plans to out a bypass round hurstgreen near Tunbridge Wells, but so far nothing has to fruition. The A21 used to be Dual carriage way jsut after the Flimwell Junction but this was reduced to one lane, this now means motorists cant overtake slow moving farm vehicles and lorries. The lack of a decent infrastructure is also partly one of the reasons for the decline in the seaside resort of Hastings and St. Leonards",
