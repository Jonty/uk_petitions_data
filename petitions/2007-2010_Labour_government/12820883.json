            "background": "In the event of a national emergency or disaster, sound radio is recognised as the way to address and inform the public. DAB relies on a network of local transmitters, that could be knocked out by power failures. Also, DAB receivers have a much shorter battery life than an AM/FM radio, important in a situation where people may not be able to obtain replacement batteries. Analogue radio has a much greater coverage from a smaller number of transmitters, one AM transmitter can cover the whole of Europe, so that even in the event of a total transmission failure in the UK, people would still be able to receive information from a transmitter on the continent. The Government's own \"Preparing for Emergencies\" leaflet recognises the importance of radio, it contains the advice \"Go in, Stay in, Tune in\", and suggests that in an emergency one of the things you should try to have to hand is a radio with batteries. Radio is not just an entertainment medium, in the event of a major pandemic, terror attack or disaster it is a lifesaver. To this end, public service broadcasting must remain on the AM/FM bands so that there are always radios in peoples homes with these bands included.",
