        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For the safety of all road users I believe that GPS systems should be banned for use while driving. Firstly most road users mount them in the middle of the windscreen, creating a blind spot. Secondly I see drivers tapping in details onto the screen while driving all of the time, surely this is just the same as \"send a text message\" which is illegal. Thirdly, It is also illegal to have a tv screen within the drivers view, surely the gps device is a form of a screen? And finally, yet another old fashioned skill is being lost as dumb drivers blindly follow what a computer is saying without even picking up a map and attempting to plan a route for themselves.",
