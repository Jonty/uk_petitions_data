        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Robert Fidler built a castle on his farm and his family has been living in it since 2002. He hid the castle behind hay bales so as to try and avoid having to get planning permission. He believed that so long as the building had been standing for over four years, it would be allowed to remain after its existence had become known. The building itself is of high quality construction and certainly of special architectural significance and general public interest. It is under threat of imminent destruction and for these reasons it could and should be listed by the government. Such action would allow the planning laws to remain intact while avoiding pointless destruction of a piece of significant British architecture.",
