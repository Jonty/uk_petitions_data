            "background": "Reason for this petition is to stop any unnessary fighting between dogs, or dogs approaching people who may be fearful of dogs or being attacked.  People with children would not be fearful of dogs walking loose.  Whilst walking your dog you would not feel fearful of dogs aproaching.  I am an animal lover but do not agree with people walking their dogs along the street with no lead, and in the park some dogs like to roam free and approach other dogs who may not appreciate that leading to an altercation which is not good for anybody!  All dogs should be fully licensed and the people enforcing this should be able to check the valid owners via a fingerprint identity machine.  There are so many issues relating to this petition; all are obviously for the welfare of animals.  These laws need to be changed now!",
