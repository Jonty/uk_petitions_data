Chuck Norris is always in control.  \n  \nChuck Norris can sneeze with his eyes open.  \n\nChuck Norris destroyed the periodic table, because he only recognizes the element of surprise.  \n\nChuck Norris can kill two stones with one bird.\n\nChuck Norris does not sleep. He waits.\n\nThank you for reading.",
