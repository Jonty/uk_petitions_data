            "background": "I live in Gloucestershire, where most bus services are run by stagecoach. \n\nLooking at the timetables, I noticed that buses are more frequent outside of rush hours! Many services run every half hour or every hour   during the morning rush hour, then at 9am, they suddenly increase to every 10 or 15 minutes. At 4pm, just before the evening rush hour, they suddenly go back to less frequent services. \n\nIn a time when people are are being persuaded to find alternative means of travel, it seems crazy that there are less buses when they are needed more. Shouldn't there be more buses during rush hour, when there are more people traveling? Who uses these frequent daytime services? No wonder prices are so high on the services. We need more buses during rush hour!",
