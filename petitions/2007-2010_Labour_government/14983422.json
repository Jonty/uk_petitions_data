        "background": "Britain portrays itself as a front running in establishing, and maintaining democracy; even attempting to promote it throughout the work, but the 'upper-house' of the British government is not even elected. \n\nEstablishing a Federal system of government in Britain would also solve the issue of Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland's devolution of powers. \n\nA Parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy is not appropriate for this century, and it could be argued that it is completely undemocratic.",
