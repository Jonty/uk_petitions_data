Its like saying all humans are the same. Please don't let these beautiful dogs get labelled. it's so not fare!! I'd invite all worried people into my home to change there opinions with no worries and she will make you think twice about this. Dangerous dog's are the makings of mankind with mistreatments... not a caring and loving home.",
