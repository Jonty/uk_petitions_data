            "background": "I would like the government to push a system via ucas or any method is easy to do to allow transfer of undergraduate, postgraduate, diploma students from one university to another mid course into the same year or above in line with a course studied at previous univerity.\nalos international transfers between universities.\n\nalso legalise transfers between schools and also colleges.\n\nby legalising transfer you offer students to study at another university without losing a year and opens the alterative if a student is not happy at their current university.\n\nthe transfer means courses passed get carried over only and no fails. in order to complete the degree only passes would count like a normal university and if non complete degree, post graduate etc then new university courses would fill up the completion of the degree.",
