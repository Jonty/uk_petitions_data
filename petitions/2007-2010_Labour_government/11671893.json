            "background": "The current recession has lead to our goverment \"bailing out\" some banks with the tax payers money.  This means that we as a country own shares in these banks.  So far most of us have not seen any benefits to this bail out.  The one thing that would help to get people back on their feet would be if they weren't being charged excessively by their banks.  We can all understand a small fair fee for these human errors, but when it's a few hundred pounds every month, it is no wonder that people do not have any money to pump back into the economy, let alone live.  The biggest thing Gordon Brown can do to ease the current economical state is to negotiate these fees now and put a bit of money back into our pockets so that we can all live.  We ask Gordon Brown that now we have shares in some banks, to please use our say to sort out fairer terms for bank users, negotiating smaller, but fair bank charges.",
