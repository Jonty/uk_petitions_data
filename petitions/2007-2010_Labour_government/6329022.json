            "background": "The law needs to be changed so that an addict can be given compulsory treatment. Alcohol or drug dependent people do not admit to having a problem or check themselves out of rehab before completing their treatment. Two signatures from members of the person's family should be enough for the compulsory admittance of the family member for treatment where they must stay until the treatment has completed. This will help to relieve the stress currently placed on the family.",
