        "background": "It is time that this Government accepted responsibility for its failures and that Ministers and other senior officials understand and accept the need to resign, or be sacked when there are serious failures in their Departments.  The public mood is that no-one senior answers for anything and the loss of data relating to child benefits is the last straw.  If he will not resign the PM must sack him or face further loss of credibility himself.",
