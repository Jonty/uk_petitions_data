I had an email from my energy provider quoting the January oil price of $92 and then July at $134 per barrel for the reason.\n\nWe were quick to bail the banks out, if we all warmed our houses up like we would like to then no one would afford their bills and then the government would have to nationlise the UK power companies.\n\nMaybe not a bad thing.",
