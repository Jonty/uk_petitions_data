            "action": "advocate the introduction of national and international legislation which allows wheelchair users, particularly those whose severe physical impairments prevent them from transferring from their wheelchair to a seat, to remain in their own wheelchairs whilst flying on commercial airlines.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many people with severe physical impairments are prevented from flying with commercial airlines because they are prohibited from travelling in their own wheelchairs.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why a disabled person would need to do so. These include it being unsafe for them to be lifted & carried, or the fact that most airline seats are designed for the more 'normal' of body shapes, making them extremely uncomfortable for many disabled people.\n\nAs you can imagine there are a number of reasons given, by both the regulators and commercial operators (the former primarily serving the interests of the latter), as to why, although none of them stand up to a great deal of scrutiny, which leads to the conclusion that the real reason is a financial one.\n\nThis issue affects many disabled people, and the introduction of such legislation would not only allow those who currently cannot travel at all by aeroplane (for either leisure or business purposes) to do so, but it would also greatly benefit to those passengers with less severe physical impairments who do currently suffer the humiliation and discomfort it is necessary to endure to fly commercially.",
