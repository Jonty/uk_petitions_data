We are horrified because we are attacked by Al Queida, yet when they were called the Mujahadin and fighting the Russians in Afghanistan, we armed them to the teeth and trained them.\n\nWe should either ban the transfer of arms across national boundaries or not transfer arms for politically motivated purposes or allow the transfer of arms to countries which are unstable, at war, likely to go to war or countries which act as intermediaries to other countries and sell the weapons on.\n\nThe arms business is treated as free trade and it should not be.",
