        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the current much hyped world of climate change and carbon reduction, it is ridiculous that Tetra Paks, which make up a large percentage of household waste, are not recycled by many local authorities. If I wanted to recycle a Tetra Pak, I would have to make a 17 miles excursion to the nearest facility, which would somewhat defeat the point. Land fills are only temporary solution, and they're only going to get bigger. Tetra Paks are recyclable, so it makes no sense that they aren't being recycled.",
