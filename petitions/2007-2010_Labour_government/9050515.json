            "background": "Despite the recent tax increases on alcohol, supermarkets are still selling their alcohol at incredibly cheap prices.  Right after the budget a leading supermarket advertised on television how cheap their cases of beer are, a slap in the face to the pub trade who are struggling to absorb the rising costs of alcohol.  Whilst we may never be able to stop the supermarkets and petrol forecourts from selling cheap alcohol, we can stop them from promoting it on television and billboards.  Such advertising is seen by underage drinkers and undermines the value of the British Pub.  Preventing these outlets from advertising their alcohol prices will go a long way to preventing the great British Village Pub from going the way of the family butcher and grocer.",
