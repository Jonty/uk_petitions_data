            "background": "Water companies have an unfair monopoly denying people choice, and giving them the ability to rip people off! They should have to fight for people\u2019s custom.\nThe government claims it is out of the remit of the P.M's and Government power ABSOLUTE RUBBISH! If Brown can nationalise banks then he can give the people fair water charges unless of course they have their snouts in the bonus trough! Thatcher got rid of monopolies so should Brown.",
