            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Mosquito Device emits a high pitched noise, used in areas where groups of people congregate and harass, alarm or distress ordinary law abiding people.\n\nIt's a breach of their human rights is an argument used quite frequently.  I ask, what about the human rights of the elderly who are to afraid to enter their own local shops becuase of the groups of young people gathering outside.\n\nWhat about those innocent young people who are not causing problems.  It won't cause them a problem as they don't hang around outside local shops all night long asking people to buy them alcohol.\n\nWhat about youths visiting the local shop?  The mosquito device only becomes uncomfortable if you stand in its output range for a period of time.  Those just passing by would not be affected by it.\n\nDoes anyone have any proof that it harms young peoples hearing?  Not that I know of.\n\nDoes anyone have proof that it stops Anti Social Groups of youths hanging around areas, making peoples lives a misery?  Yes, I know there are many many cases where it has made life immeasurably better.\n\nIf young people don't want to be irritated by a Mosquito, stop hanging around outside shops irritating ordinary law abiding people.",
