But it was stolen! Now it seems, if i do not pay for a new bin, and i place my rubbish outside in bags, i could be prosecuted for fly-tipping as they will not be collected! Rossendale is so big on Recycling, the least they could do is supply/replace bins at no charge..if only once, or at least use a little discretion and common sense!",
