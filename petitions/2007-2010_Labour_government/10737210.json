            "background": "It is has been intelligently  alleged that China builds 4 low technology highly polluting coal fired power stations a week! \n\nLow-Carbon producing power stations would cost 20% more to build, so therefore they are not built.\n\nChina claims that the west had economic growth at the expense of the ecology, so they should be allowed to as well. This is not a valid argument as the west (including USA) achieved industrial and economic growth largely in ignorance of the global damage. Their (China's) industrialisation will effect other countries so we have a right to take some form of action, by, for instance, a UN resolution. Their economy should not be allowed to grow at the expense of others (effected by the ecological damage they cause).\nThe USA acieved the current high consumption per capita when we were ignorant of the effect on the environment. China should not be allowed to now achieve those levels to be on a par with the US. The US is making efforts to reduce it's consumption.\n\nCan the Prime Minister urge the United Nations to pass resolutions to cap the carbon output of China and India to prevent other nations being adversely effected.",
