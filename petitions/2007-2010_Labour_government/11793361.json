The banking system is still suffering, and the Economy is still on a downward spiral. We believe that bailing out the UK Consumer, by writing off all Unsecured Debt, will not only stabilise the Economy and increase spending, but also bring Banks back into line, and benefit EVERYONE, not just the BigWigs who caused our Economy to crumble by following Get Rich Quick Schemes.",
