For whatever purpose, good or bad, we believe our soldiers were sent to Afghanistan or Iraq, they were not sent there by Blair or Dubya. Both wars have started because of resolutions passed by an unelected bureaucracy - the UN. So we petition the government to guarantee that:\n\nNEVER AGAIN, under any circumstances, will British soldiers will be deployed abroad as a result of a decree coming from an unelected bureaucracy such as the UN or the EU. That means that the only institution allowed to decide should always be our own Parliament. The UN and the EU should be ignored.",
