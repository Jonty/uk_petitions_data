            "background": "Circuses and other entertainment shows that exploit animals for human entertainment are outdated and immoral. It is evident that animals used in circus acts are unhappier than those allowed to live in their natural habitat. \nOutside of the circus, these animals are often kept in small cages, unsuitable for their needs. Abolishing animal circus acts is the next step after the ban on bear-dancing to ensure animal rights are practiced in the UK. Although many circuses may value the wellbeing of their animals and understand animal rights, many don't and this is why action must be taken against the exploitation of wild and domestic animals in shows.",
