However, the sum total is only about half of the original, so there is no argument of being able to restore the original in full. Many people view the Elgin Marbles in London and Athens each year and we should retain the status quo to so maximise the number of people who can enjoy the Elgin Marbles. If they were all in one place, only half the people would be able to see them.",
