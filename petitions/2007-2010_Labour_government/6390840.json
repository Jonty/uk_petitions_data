Each of them is \u0141400 mn more expensive than a Burke-class DDG, and yet technically inferior. The Australians have rightly chosen American-designed Burke-class DDGs, and yet they have also been granted the licence to build them at Australian shipyards, meaning that British shipbuilders could too.\nPlease order Burke-class DDGs, not Type 45 vessels.",
