            "background": "To help ease traffic congestion on all 'A' roads! it makes good sense to restrict very slow moving and agricultural vehicles from using these roads during peak periods, most of these vehicle drivers cause long tailbacks, which, causes more frustration, and causes other drivers of quicker vehicle types to take unnecessary overtaking actions. \nThese actions could lead to deaths, injury and destruction of property on our roads.\nIf you are serious about the environment and global worming! less congestion means less polution, which, can only be good for the environment.",
