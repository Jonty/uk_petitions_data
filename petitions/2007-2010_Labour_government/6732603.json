            "background": "Fur farming is barbaric and is a cruel way for animals to die. It happens in countries all around the world, however mainly in china. Animals such as cats and dogs, but also mink racoons etc are stolen from their owners or the wild, stuffed into tiny wire cages, thrown about or kicked to anger them, they are then stored in their cages (40c,x40cm is a standard size for two foxes) making them go insane and lack of food makes them resort to canibalism then either beaten of electrocuted. But worse, sometimes they wake up as they didnt die and get skinned for their fur alive, the pain they suffer is immense. Fur clothes should stop so fur farming stops",
