            "background": "my petition is all about cannabis, i am a 15 year old lad who has smoked cannabis for 4 years. i am trying to put my point across that cannabis only affects your behaviour if you want it to. i have done all my gsce's and passed them all. cannabis does not reck your life or you do not have to move on to other grugs to fulfill your needs. i think if the prime minister were to legalize cannabis it would be used in many fashions to help the general public. cannabis is a plant what is grown, alcahol is a drug made by man. cannabis is part of the earth , it was created to be smoked , alcahol is legal so why shouldn't cannbis be. sign the petition if you agree!!!",
