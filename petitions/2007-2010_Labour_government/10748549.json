        "background": "The Metro Hotel refused to allow Corporal Stringer, of the 13 Air Assault Support Regiment, the Royal Logistic Corps to stay in the hotel in June this year on the grounds that members of the Military were not welcome. Corporal Stringer had to spend the night in his car.\n\nAs if that were not bad enough, Corporal Stringer was only back in the UK because he had suffered a fractured wrist serving his Queen and country in Afghanistan. Following his recovery, Corporal Stringer has returned to his unit to complete his tour of duty.\n\nTo discriminate against anybody because of their race, sex, religion, age or sexual orientation is diabolical and has no place in modern society. To discriminate against an occupation whose members step into the breach when the civilian public services cannot cope and allows us to sleep safe in our beds is something that I find truly disgusting.",
