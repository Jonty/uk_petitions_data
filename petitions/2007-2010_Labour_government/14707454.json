Whilst this is an independent choice of those involved, by doing so they reduce the burden on the state education system. Therefore this petition aims to allow parents to gain tax relief for their choice by allowing them tax relief on payments made in relation to school fees. Under existing arrangements parents and guardians are currently taxed for services which they do not benefit from.",
