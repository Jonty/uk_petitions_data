Clive Stafford Smith, from campaign group Reprieve, which is representing Mr Shaikh, called for \"urgent and immediate\" action from the Government.\nHe said: \"Akmal Shaikh faces the possibility of a hollow-point bullet to the back of the head sometime very soon, unless Gordon Brown makes strong representations to President Hu.\"\n\"And at a bare minimum, the Prime Minister can surely ensure that we get a mental health expert in to see Mr Shaikh, so we can prove the seriousness of Mr Shaikh's illness to the Chinese courts.\"",
