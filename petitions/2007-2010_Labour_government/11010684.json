            "background": "It is well know that many women lie to the police to prevent or restrict fathers access to their children. The Police and family courts not only turn a blind eye but their acceptance of this practice only encourages women to keep doing it. \n\nFathers are not guilty by default! They are usually the more level headed parent, willing to put the childs interests first and yet they are criminalised by the false accusations of their ex partners. \n\nIt is often the mothers who are breaking the law and putting their childs interests second to their own selfish and vindictive tendancies.",
