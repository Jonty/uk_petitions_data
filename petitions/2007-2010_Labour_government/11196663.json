        "background": "The simplest and easiest way to help the liquidity of small and medium sized businesses is to defer their VAT payments. It works at once. \n\u2022 It can help all. \n\u2022 Requires no bureaucracy. \n\u2022 Has no administrative costs.\nThe government can control three variables: how many days delay in payment; how this may vary according to size of the business; and the total amount that each business can defer. Moreover it can adjust these parameters quickly as the economic situation changes\n\nThis simple common sense solution will keep people in jobs and demand in the economy.\n\nAnd it can be done NOW!",
