            "background": "Without easy access to public toilets, people with irritable bowel syndrome find it difficult to travel, to shop or simply to have the same quality of social life as their friends and colleagues. Properly maintained and resourced public toilets form a vital amenity in towns and cities. The Gut Trust believes that local councils have a duty to provide them for the good of their residents, and that companies and shops have a vested interest in supporting public toilets in their area.",
