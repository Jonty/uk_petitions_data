            "background": "The excellent measures taken to prevent meltdown in the financial system must URGENTLY be followed up by measures to ENSURE the benefits arrive at the hard pressed businesses and homeowners of Britain.  So too, must the major contributors to inflation (petrol and energy prices) be driven back out of the equation now that oil has fallen below $60 (nearer to 1/3rd of summer's peak). It is time for the big institutions to PASS ON the reductions. It MUST NOT be case that the British public and British business suffer merely to perpetuate the massive profitability of a very few organisations and individuals. \"PASS IT ON\" should be the mantra. Lower mortages and loan rates, much lower petrol prices, much lower energy prices.\n\nPlease, Prime Minister, ensure this happens URGENTLY and show that the hundreds of billions of support translates into widespread improvements for all.",
