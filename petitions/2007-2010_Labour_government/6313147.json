            "background": "The current Tax Credit system is a shambles. Many people are getting either under or overpaid, resulting in HMR&C issuing letters to families asking for hundreds or thousands of pounds back. We, the public, have no way of knowing if the tax credit award is correct and yet we are held responsible when HMR&C make a huge mistake. It is also apparent when you speak to HMR&C that the majority of employees do not understand the system either. This system has been a shambles from day 1 and needs an overhaul.",
