            "background": "If British consumers and British companies adopt a policy of buying British, or at least buying from British-owned retailers (including banks) or companies with manufacturing in the UK, the recession will have far less impact on our economy.\n\nThe Government should avoid placing contracts with non-UK companies unless with good reason and encourage UK ownership of utilities, banks and essential services.\n\nIn conjunction with this, the \u00a318 rule should be abolished so that suppliers mainly in the Channel Islands cannot undercut UK retailers by avoiding VAT on low priced items (currently exempt up to \u00a318).  Typically these are items sold by retail chains such as Woolworths which are important to the British economy.",
