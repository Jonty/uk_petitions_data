            "background": "BT Wholesale have increased the costs of their IP Stream and Datastream wholesale broadband services to internet services providers by 24.2%. BT have stated the increase is to encourage people to utilise their 21CN services, a product which has been extensively delayed and is not widely available on the scale of IP Stream or Datastream services. It is our belief that this announcement, just 2 days after BT's profit warning following poor performance from their Global Services division is a way for BT Group to exponentially increase their profits at the expense of ISP's and the UK consumer.",
