            "background": "We need to Impliment LED street lighting as soon as practicable.  The Department of Energy in America estimates that LED lighting can substantially reduce energy costs, by as much as 60 percent, compared with existing streetlights.  LED lights do not contain many of the harmful chemicals found in other energy saving lightbulbs.  The UK is falling behind other countries who are already testing and implimenting this exciting technology.",
