        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "By raising the legal drinking age to 21 our children will be better protected. 14-16 year olds can look so grown up it must be hard for those selling alcohol to determine their age. If the limit was raised to 21 then those slipping through the net would then be in the region of 18. The teenage years are so important for both physical and emotional development, both of which can be impared by inappropriate levels of alcohol. It is all to easy for teenage social scenes to be inextricably linked to the consumption of alcohol. They should be encouraged to engage socially without using alcohol as a crutch, perhaps by embracing the coffee shop / american diner approach, specific places where teens can hang out with their peers in an alcohol free environment.",
