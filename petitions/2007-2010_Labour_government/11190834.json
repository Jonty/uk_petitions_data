            "background": "In the light of the Baby P tragedy, it is believed that some councils are not always taking the necessary steps to have vulnerable children put into care on account of the legal & other expenses involved.  \n\nIt is therefore paramount that the costs of taking abuse cases to court and putting children into care should not fall upon individual councils.  There needs to be a central government fund in place for such expenses to ensure that money concerns are never allowed to influence the provision of child protection in this country.\n\nThank you.",
