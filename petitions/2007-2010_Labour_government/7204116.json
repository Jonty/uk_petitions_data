It is totally nuts - have someone else bid on services (maybe the above are right - how about YOU Mr. Branson) to run to Holland, Germany etc etc.\n\nIt means moving such a vast international gateway (with all the sites and sound and spectacles of the South Bank) to the rubbish pit that is Kings Cross.\n\nWhat a lovely impression our international visitors are going to get seeing all the whores, pimps and drug deals around Kings Cross?\n\nMost idiotic decision I have ever heard .... utilise the architectural marvel that is Waterloo and the EXISTING infrastructure that connects this key part of London to Europe.\n\nKings Cross may give better access to the North, but why should people in the South and South East lose a much loved international connection?",
