            "background": "I have a 7 year old daughter who has Celiac disease.  In order for me to keep her healthy and gluten free I have to supervise Ella thoughout the day to avoid any cross contamination of food or that she is not helping herself.  Ella is not a normal child, and the DLA feel that Ella is just the same as any other child of her age.  we at the minute claim DLA and Carers for Ella but as her blood tests have come back normal and this is only due to my supervision and complaiance of the diet that this has happened the DLA say that she is now better.  This is not the case so therefore no more entitlement.  Celiac disease is not an allergy but a life long condition that needs strict management.  Ella is too young to do this herself.",
