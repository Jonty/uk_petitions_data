        "background": "The government has added to the housing crisis by removing the housing support grant to Local Authorities and giving it to the Housing corporation.\nLocal Authorities need to be able to build the affordable housing required in their communities and in the expensive areas of the south east the private rented sector is increasing the nubers of homeless people who cannot afford the high rents and are then told they have made themselves homeless and will not be helped by local authorities, (even if they have children). This can create even greater problems for the future in terms of mental and physical health problems, a breakdown in relationships and poor educational opportunities for the children.",
