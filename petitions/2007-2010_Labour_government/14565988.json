The amount of 'post count adding' facebook dribble dross type blah on the BHF has gone through the roof.\nJust as an example, some dribblers are achieving an average of over 10 posts PER DAY (you know who you are). Some of these dribblers are achieving 5 helmet status in just a space of a few months!!! This simply cannot go on. \nI urge the PM to take urgent and drastic action about this most serious of matters, a strict limit on the amount of posts should be implemented immediately. \nSystems should be put in place for anyone breaching this, the user (dribbler) involved should have a 'facebook' account automatically created for them, and their 'BHF' account disable......\nIthangewe",
