        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is ludicrous that the prime minister is even considering reducing the minimum wage in these areas. For example Northern Ireland has some of the highest house prices in the UK, how does he ever expect people to afford housing if he reduces the minimum wage?  Not that this wage is enough to buy property in the first place!  Think about what he has done to the 10p tax banding (scrapped) hes made the lowest paid workers worse off by doing this and the middle class workers or those who earn much better income better off! Where is the sense in this?? Does he really want to lose his working class voters, which take up a vast majority of the population?  He certainly isnt doing anything good for them! And what about the cival service job cuts throughout the country??  Crippling areas that rely on the government for employment and a better local economy.  I think he needs to think about what he is doing before he acts, it doesnt matter to him earning in excess of \u00a3100k with all his expenses he can claim for, what about those who really depend on their \u00a310 - 15k per annum jobs, who actually make a difference to areas we live in and make services we need much more accessible.",
