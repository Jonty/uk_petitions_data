            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "An increasing number of telecommunications companies are charging customers for receiving hard copies of their phone bills. The companies reasoning behind this is that paper bills are bad for the environment. They wish customers to pay online and therefore forgo this additional charge. The reasoning some of these companies are giving for imposing this fee, is that a percentage of the charge will be passed on to a third party to 'plant a tree'. This charge penalises those with no access to the internet, I.T. equipment and those less well off in society. This thinking is effectively companies levelling their own corporate 'green' tax! Telecommunications companies should let customers decide which good cause if any their money should go to. They should only charge for the cost of the service they provide.",
