            "background": "The Department for Energy and Climate Change has this week announced that despite high demand, the funding to provide public sector buildings with Solar PV has come to an end.   Solar PV has proved to be the most popular renewable technology and it is important for both the environment,the economy and energy security to build on this success. We cannot afford to let this fledgling industry suffer at a time when the government wishes to create 400,000 Green Jobs.  We therefore urge the Government to increase the allocation for Solar PV grants.",
