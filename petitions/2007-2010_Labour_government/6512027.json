There are children in mainstream schools who would benefit from such a school but dont meet the criteria for a statement.  Some of these childrens needs are not being meet in mainsteam although most schools try very hard, the expertise is at specialist settings. it would be better if children who have a need rather than a statement could attend a specialist setting.
