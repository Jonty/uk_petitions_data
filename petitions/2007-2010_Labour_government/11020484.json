        "background": "Such a scheme is unrowkable and will cost a small fortune to implement.  The public transport infastructure outside London is not up to the job and this will drain money from an already impoverished society.  The government is deliberately ignoring the fairest tax on fuel, so that hungry cars automatically pay more per mile.  A pay-per-mile scheme will cost a fortune to implement and run, will not adequately manage foreign vehicles, enrage our population, create a black market in technical circumventions and has privacy implications beyond measure.\n\nWhat exemptions will there be for visiting relatives in hospital? For visiting far flung relatives? This will make poorer people prisoners in their own localities, wreck UK holidaymaking industries, increase the costs of goods in the shops due to increased transport costs and create minor chaos, like the minibus exampt from the congestion charge, still being pursued for payment.\n\nThere is NO faith in the running of such schemes and this will only bring missery to our country.",
