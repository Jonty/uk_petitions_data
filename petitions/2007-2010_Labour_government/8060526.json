            "background": "The government are proposing plans to inspect the school lunch boxes of children. Parents that include items such as chocolate bars will be sent a letter from the school advising them of what their children 'should' eat. Food may even be confiscated by the school if it is thought that the fat or sugar content is too high.\nThis has been done under the guise of preventing childhood obesity but is yet another example of 'The Nanny State'\nIt is the parent's responsibly to feed their child.",
