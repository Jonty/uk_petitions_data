Send every parent in the country information on how to raise children and how to deal with challenging behaviour, also hints and tips on how to communicate with and spend quality time with their child, including, help with organising community based activities for parents and children.\nYou know it makes sense!\nStop being so soft on crime in this country and get firm on criminals, starting with unruly children.",
