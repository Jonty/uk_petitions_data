            "background": "The amount of crimes being committed by young offenders in Britain today is as im sure everyone reading this is aware is rising, you only have to walk around the streets in many parts of Britain to see groups of youths committing criminal acts, vandalism, disrespecting fellow people. It seems to me that many of these crimes go unreported and unresolved because of a basic lack of evidence or apathy from the victims towards wanting to report the crime  we all know they just get ignored,  without evidence nothing can be done, or the excuse that sending forensics down to check the scene costs too much, so what does constitute something being deemed worthy of spending money on?  Why should we have to live in fear of our local communities being destroyed through aggressive behaviour from groups of youths, should we wait until the problem gets worse? I put it to the government that they need to sort the problem out,  it needs to be sorted out before it becomes even more of a problem!!",
