            "background": "It is reported by the BBC and the Times, and the Culture Secretary has stated, that the government will require ISPs to cut off internet access for people \"suspected\" of illegally downloading copyrighted material. The monitoring that this would require is an invasion of privacy; further, there already exist legal avenues for media companies to take action against people who unlawfully share material. If a media company has a \"suspicion\" that their material is being unlawfully shared, let them use the law as it stands to prove that and then have action taken to stop it.\n\nThis proposal gives private media companies an unwarranted privileged status and reverses the burden of proof to the detriment of ordinary citizens who may be perfectly innocent of any wrongdoing, yet be punished on the basis of no more than \"suspicion\". \n\nInternet access is important to a massive number of people in this country, and to suggest that it should continue only at the whim of media companies and their\n\"suspicions\" is unacceptable. We call upon the Prime Minister to abandon this draconian, intrusive and fundamentally unjust proposal.",
