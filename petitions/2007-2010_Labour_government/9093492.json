            "background": "The orphan asset/inherited estate belongs to the with profit endownment and pension policyholders. Contracts were sold when the company was a mutual company.  \nPolicyholders invested into stocks and shares which have increased overall since the 1940's. The company would take a lump sum each year from the investments when there was a peak and place it in an additional fund called orphan assets to cover any troughs, thus ensuring endownment mortgages always met their target but usually had a surplus.\nFor policyholders to be told there is a shortfall on their mortgage whilst at the same time the fund to smooth peaks and troughs is distributed to the company and shareholders with a small sum to policyholders renamed a 'windfall', is unethical.",
