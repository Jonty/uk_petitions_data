            "background": "Given recent cases that have come to light, it seems necessary to push for a full public inquiry into the tactics, and subsequent actions of police during the G20 protests. Clips that have entered the public domain clearly show police officers assaulting members of the public who pose no threat to them whatsoever, and also using excessive force.\n\nIt clearly states that police are entitled to use \"resonable force\", however the evidence suggests that the police in these cases have indeed used \"unreasonable force\". \n\nTherefore, due to the actions of these officers a full public inquiry should be ensued to bring individuals to account.",
