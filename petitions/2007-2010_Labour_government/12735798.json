            "background": "There are too many accidents and deaths on the British roads. An alarming number of young people are having their lifes cut short because of lack of driving experience and too powerfull cars. There is no legislation in place to limit the engine size of cars for new or young drivers, this needs to change. by limiting under 21's to an engine no bigger than a 1.1 could seriously help prevent such high speed crashes. There is still adequate speed and power in a 1100cc engine and can still easily reach speeds of 70, which is the national speed limit. \nEven this legislation will not stop high speed crashes, but it should help against the rapid speeds that some drivers can reach in cars which are too powerful and too easily accessable to young people.",
