            "background": "I am aware that many people welcomed the decision referred to in the text of this petition.  I am very concerned, however, that the necessary cost of this may mean that people, such as myself, who could never have afforded to pay for drugs unprovided by Local Health Authorities will lose out AGAIN as people who COULD afford to pay for these drugs now receive free treatment, which they had previously had to pay for, thereby obviously using up N.H.S. resources.  I would therefore request that, in order for people like myself NOT to lose out, less is spent on lifestyle choice treatments such those for fertility or impotence; and removal of tattoos or similar trivia.",
