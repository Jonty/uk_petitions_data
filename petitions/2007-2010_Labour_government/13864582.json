            "background": "We've all seen it on the news: a Media celebrity has a baby and then gives it a name that can, at best, be considered 'unusual'. For example, the Beckhams calling their son Brooklyn or Katie Price calling her daughter Princess Tiaamii.\nWhilst the names might seem to be a good idea at the time and suit their bohemian lifestyle, the parents, perhaps, forget that the child is going to carry that name for the rest of their life.\nBy all means, call your dog Fifi but not your child...\nOf course, this is then imitated by certain members of the population who emulate what they see in celebrity gossip magazines and give their own children 'unfortunate' names.\nThe purpose of this petition is to allow Registrars to refuse to accept names for children that may be considered frivolous or otherwise inappropriate.",
