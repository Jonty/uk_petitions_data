            "background": "The recent media coverage of a campaign for Royal recognition for Wootton Bassett has highlighted this issue.  This is something that Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth, also supports as, it seems, does a large segment of the UK.  Many are unable to attend Wootton Bassett to pay their respects to our brave men and women who have paid the ultimate price, so thankfully the men and women of Wootton Bassett are able to show our Country's gratitude and support through turning out to welcoming them back home.  Although the Mayor and residents have said that they do not do this for any thanks, this award is not just for them.  It is our Country's way of saying thank you for doing what many of us would like to, but are unable to.  The Government will be considering this matter over the next few months.  This petition will show how strongly the Country supports the request.",
