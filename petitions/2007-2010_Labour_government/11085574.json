His mother, the one person he would have turned to for help, was no good.\nThe social workers who sent him back to his mother, despite the warning signs should lose their jobs. No amount of support for the mother would have helped him. Just because someone is a mother, doesn't mean she is a 'mum'.\nChildren are constantly and systematically being let down.\nThe red tape needs removed and social workers need retrained to spot these things. They need to stop worrying so much about \"support for the mother\" and more on the actual needs of the child.\nThe child, after all, is the one who is in genuine need of help and support. The child is the one without a voice.\nHow many more innocent children need to suffer before changes are brought about?",
