            "background": "Medway Council are proposing the closure of three schools in Medway: St Peter's Infant School, St John's Infant School, Ridge Meadow Primary School. These are good schools with good OFSTED reports. The closure of these schools will be a real loss to the communities they serve, whilst also taking away the parents rights to choose their children's schools. It will also be detrimental to the children's well-being and their educational achievements as this will be very disruptive for them. Please join us in this campaign to save our schools.",
