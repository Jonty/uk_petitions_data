            "background": "Dyserth is a village in North Wales just outside Prestatyn.  It is less than a one Km from an existing gas mains yet has never been connected to the national (gas) grid.  Hopes abounded when the Welsh Assembly aka \"Welsh Nationalist's talking shop\" appeared to get the ball rolling, but this just got dropped, funding being one of the Welsh Assembly's excuses.  But as Westminster is now awash with re-paid expences, can a fraction of this be spent bringing mains gas to Dyserth.",
