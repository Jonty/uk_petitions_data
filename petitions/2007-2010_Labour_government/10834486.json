            "background": "In August 2008 a decision was taken to close down the free shuttle bus service in Guildford.  This invaluable service had made hilly Guildford accessible to EVERYONE. The campaign to bring back the bus is being supported by our newspaper and some politicians.  The issue is about the loss of a service which was vital to many people. \nTraders in the town are concerned about lost business. The young disabled and elderly have had their independence removed. The railway station is now virtually inaccessible from the town other than by the fit and healthy. \nMore people will use their cars leading to an environmental impact. Lots of towns have got a shuttle bus and many more are starting up their own mindful of the needs of many sectors of the community, making the closure decision appear perverse.\nYou can find out more about the campaign from the website of the Surrey Advertiser newspaper.\nTHANK YOU",
