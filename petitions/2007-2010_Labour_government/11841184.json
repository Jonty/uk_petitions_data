            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Every year there are thousands of accidents on Britain's roads, killing thousands of people. Unfortunately the morbid, innate curiosity of people is to stare at whatever has happened, even when travelling at 70mph on a busy motorway. This causes even more accidents and thousands of miles of traffic jams, even when the road may not be affected by the accident itself.\n\nWe the undersigned request that the government either introduce legislation to deter \"rubbernecking\", or invest in barriers to prevent people seeing what is going on. We believe that this will decrease the number of accidents and traffic jams and so making Britain's roads a safer and more pleasant system.",
