            "background": "Millions of prescriptions are dispensed each year and only a very small percentage result in an error. However because of the sheer volume of prescriptions given out daily, each and every pharmacist is involved in a number of error incidents throughout the length of his or her career.\n\nRecently a pharmacist (who has subsequently resigned from practice) was given a three month suspended prison sentence for making a dispensing error. A charge of manslaughter failed because the error was judged to have played no part in the death of the patient. When pharmacists make errors they are encouraged to report them so that systems can be reviewed and improved for the benefit of future patients. This case makes it less likely that errors will be reported.\n\nA custodial sentence is supposed to be handed down to protect the public. This sentence is likely to achieve the complete opposite. If every pharmacist who has ever made a mistake were to be criminalised in this way then there would soon be very few left to practice. This law needs to be changed and soon.",
