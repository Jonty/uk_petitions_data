No matter what ethnic background or religion you are from, this day would be for all to celebrate being British. Take pride in GREAT BRITAIN. Governments come and go, but Britain will always be Great. It's about time we celebrated the fact and flew the Union flag in more places and more often. Remind the rest of the world what the 'G' in 'GB' stands for!",
