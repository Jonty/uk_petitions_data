Most of the owners of these cars have been here for months and work and live in the area. I got Cllr Brian Silvester to ask the police what the situation is and the reply from the police may shock you.\n\nReply from the police\n\nRe Polish cars, this is a complex area but to summarise if a polish national is here as a visitor (includes those here working) they can drive for 12 months without any requirement for UK documentation. If they go back home for a few weeks when they come back the 12 month starts again.\n\nIf a polish national becomes a UK resident and is eligible to vote etc then they must comply with our legislation, including obtaining a UK licence and any relevant documentation for a vehicle ie tax, mot etc\n\nhope this helps regards\n\nPaul Broadhurst A/Insp, Crewe NPU\n\nthankyou for reading this.\ni do not aim to cause alarm or distress.",
