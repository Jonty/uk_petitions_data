It is open to anyone who places value on culturally diverse music broadcasts.\n\nThe .gov has given us this medium to show support for things we feels strongly about - this is a valid youth-culture issue, Help Us.\n\n\nThis specifically *isn't* just about us or our brand this is about us trying to preserve a way of life.\n\nSign your name and preserve the hardcore.\n\n\nP*L*U*R,\n\nthe AcidTV crew.",
