Whilst all/any of these may have had potential to have caused symptoms i.e. the credit crunch, without a carrier the infection could not have spread so rapidly. The carrier which caused people to overspend generally, to go into buy to let, to buy properties abroad which they could not afford, to generally live beyond their income, has been the media. They must carry substantial responsibility but will never repport that in their papers/programmes/adverts.",
