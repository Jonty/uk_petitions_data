            "background": "The police used to have this power but it was transferred to local councils some years ago.  I'm sure all Local Authorities do their best but, for instance, my own council, Camden, limits the times for dealing with such nuisance to a few hours per night and weekend; whereas presumably one could call the police at any time.  I would also imagine the police would have more power to confiscate noise-making machines, etc., and more authority generally.  As a previous petition pointed out noise nuisance can cause all sorts of distress to the victims; some have even had to move whereas in my strong opinion it is the PERPETRATORS who should have to move: preferably to the middle of nowhere!  Also; if a specific noise nuisance occurs on some nights, but not others, one can still lose sleep dreading that it will occur even on nights when it does not.",
