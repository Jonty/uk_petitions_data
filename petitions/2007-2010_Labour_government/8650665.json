            "background": "4x4s are the most dangerous vehicles on the road. With no extra license required to operate one, the drivers are no more skilled than other drivers. The sense of safety bestowed on the drivers leads them to care less for others around them, because there are no longer a threat. The bull bars on the front of many 4x4s also pose a serious danger to other people, especially children. A normal car hitting a child will mean the child bounces off the bonnet, but the bull bars will plough straight into the head of a child, resulting in much more serious injuries.\n\nBuilt up areas are used by many people other than 4x4 drivers, each using relatively safe methods of transport - either being harmless to others, or having taken relevant tests to obtain a license. 4x4s are too dangerous to allow anyone with a regular license to drive them, so should be banned as such.",
