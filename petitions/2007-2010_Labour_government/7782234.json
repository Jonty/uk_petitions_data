            "background": "This petition is in response to the proposals to raise the age of buying alcohol to 21 and the age for driving to 18. At 15 young people are made to pay adult fees for the cinema. At 16 they can legally have sex and have to pay full price for most public services. \n\nWhy do the government believe that the responsibility to have a family at 16 is greater than the responsibility to drink? Or that moving the driving age to 18 will decrease the amount of road deaths!",
