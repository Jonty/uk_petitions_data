            "background": "A lot of people want to visit the beautiful memorial, but don't have access to a car. Taxis are expensive, and the nearest train stations are in Burton and Lichfield. Buses in Staffordshire are very unreliable.\n\nThe cross city line which goes from Redditch to Lichfield Trent Valley via Birmingham New Street could be extended to Burton and have a train station, say at Alrewas, built for the National Arboretum, home of the new Armed Forces Memorial. The train line is already there except that it is used for freight.",
