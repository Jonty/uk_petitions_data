            "background": "Ed Balls wishes to see a new \"diploma\" in trades as an alternative to A-levels. These used to exist in the form of HNC and HND qualifications. We need to return to 'proper' 5 year trade appreticeships, offered by employers, training by skilled craftsmen (while some are still alive and in employment - most will be over 50) and colleges offering day release courses to provide the theory. The government can assist by offering tax benefits to encourage employers to offer these places. Employers and the wider community benefit by having products made by, and services provided by, skilled craftsmen/women.",
