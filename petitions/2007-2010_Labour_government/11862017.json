            "background": "Within the Banking sector, the policy is increasingly to replace UK contract workers with employees from offshore companies. UK workers are actively precluded from the recruitment process. This amounts to discrimination against the UK workforce. The offshore workers, many who are currently working here in the UK, are gaining the knowledge and expertise (from the very people they are replacing) to facilitate the work eventually going offshore. As the banks have been bailed out at the expense of UK taxpayers - the right thing for the Government to do, would be to now repay this support by insisting the banks retain the UK workforce.",
