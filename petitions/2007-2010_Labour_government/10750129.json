            "background": "Why must you apply for a 2 year visa for your spouse/child to enter the UK when you actually want them to gain citizenship? Why isn't there a 1 stage application that lets you gain citizenship?\nI\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 Because an average \u00a31500 in revenue is generated per applicant for the government; for the visa to enter, then the right to stay indefinitely and finally citizenship. There is also a requirement for the applicant to supply a lot of evidence of income/expenditure etc.\nApplicants are currently required to stay in the UK for 2 years and prove at the end of that period, that they have been doing so before they can obtain a right to stay. Europeans don\u2019t have this issue because their law doesn\u2019t believe in making married couples live apart.\nThere are also quite a few silly measures like the \u2018Life in the UK test', which most British nationals can't pass themselves without study.\nThe entire process is a farce and has been implemented without thinking of the actual consequences. A \u2018proper\u2019 referendum is required and I\u2019d be more than happy to contribute my views where there isn\u2019t a 1000 character limit.",
