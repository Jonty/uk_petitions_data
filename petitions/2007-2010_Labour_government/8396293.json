            "background": "The small village schools of Cramarthenshire are being closed by the local authority. The schools provide the only contact for widespread rural families. The larger town schools are already over crowded and transport is a difficulty for people living and working on rural farms. Winter time is especially difficult. These small schools function almost independently without much financial help. They survive because parents appreciate their value and contribute large sums of money to the school funds. The schools foster extremely valuable links between isolated farms and homes. Year on year these schools achieve the highest standards as opposed to the larger schools. Please give the communities the options to opt out and purchase the schools on a peppercorn rent instead of closing them and condeming rural villages to a slow death",
