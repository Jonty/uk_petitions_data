        "background": "In an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill, The U.S. Senate voted on September 26 2007 to regard the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (a uniformed part of the Iranian army) as a 'terrorist organisation' - because of alleged activities in Iraq.\n\nThis creates a remarkable precedent of labeling another nation's armed forces as a terrorist outfit and serves to make it easier for the U.S. to attack Iran if it decides it is in its interest to do so.\n\nThe author of this petition is in a favour of the sternest response to Iranian transgressions of international norms but this has to be done by applying diplomatic and military force is a deliberate, considered way rather than by changing long-standing definitions to suit short-term political needs.",
