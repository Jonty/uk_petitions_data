            "background": "SOME MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT ARE ABUSING THEIR POSITION AS MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT BY  TAKING PART IN TV ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAMS. I BELIEVE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HAVE A DUTY TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO FOCUS ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK. THE EVER GROWING PROBLEMS FACING BRITAIN TODAY, BOTH SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. THIS COUNTRY NEEDS MP's OF THE HIGHEST CALIBRE. THE COUNTRY DON'T WANT MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO HAVE AMBITIONS TO BECOME SHOWBIZ  CELEBRITIES BY APPEARING ON REALITY TV PROGRAMS ETC. TWO EXAMPLES BEING BORIS JOHNSON AND GEORGE GALLOWAY, THESE TWO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT REGULARLY APPEAR ON TV AND RADIO ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAMS. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS PETITION FOR A CHANGE IN THE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW SERVING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO  APPEAR ONLY ON  TELEVISION SHOWS THAT ARE CATEGORISED AS POLITICAL PROGRAMS.",
