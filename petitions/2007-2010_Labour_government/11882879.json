            "background": "A studio council flat should be allocated to any individual who needs a roof over their head.  Adequate numbers of studio flats should be built for this purpose.  These flats should be double glazed and well insulated and heating should be free.  People with above average salaries should be excluded from this scheme, but they should be included in the scheme if their employment terminates for whatever reason.  It is extremely important that people are able to quit their jobs without ending up in dire straights.  Eligible citizens should be given food vouchers redeemable at special shops.  All of this then means no one has to be a part of the rat race.  Intermediate steps may be required.",
