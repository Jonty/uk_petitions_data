The removal of \"Government Targets\", and a set standard for all services across Britain - Currently each district interprets the rules how they see fit.\n\nThis should include equal rights for fathers, and the inclusion of common sense over political correctness.\n\nThese errors may not always result in a death - but they do ruin lives, and mistakes should not just be brushed under the carpet - Those responsible should be held accountable.",
