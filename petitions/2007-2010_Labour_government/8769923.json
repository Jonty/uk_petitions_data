            "background": "East European immigrants living in makeshift tents on land which is part of the 2012 Olympics site have been slaughtering our swans. Carcasses from dead swans, broken up and stripped for food, have been discovered beside the River Lea in east London. It has also been revealed that Polish and Lithuanian immigrants in Bedfordshire appeared to be killing swans for food. They were spotted trying to drag the 20lb birds away from the Grand Union Canal, while remains of butchered swans were found on the towpath in Leighton Buzzard. \n\nPlease put an end to this barbaric slaughter.",
