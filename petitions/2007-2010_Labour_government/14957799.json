        "background": "The Hillsborough Disaster happened 21 years ago this April. The systems back then (perimeter fences, games not fully ticketed, the former hooligan problem) were the major causes of problems and crushing in standing sections. Now, there are no perimeter fences at stadia, all Premier League and Championship games are all-ticket, and the hooligan problem has died down. There are pockets of standing supporters at most games without incident, and safe standing is in force in stadia in Germany to great effect. All seated stadia are killing the atmosphere at football matches and we petition the Prime Minister to abolish this rule.",
