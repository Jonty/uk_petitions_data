            "background": "If the worlds population raised their standard of living and energy consumption to that in the West, global warming will increase vastly. If nuclear energy is employed to meet the worlds accelerating energy needs, in order to limit global warming, a new threat emerges in the form of easier access to radioactive (dirty bomb) and nuclear weapons materials. Rogue states and terrorism amplify these threats. To defend against them, while recognising the rights of the worlds poor to western standards of living, EVERY nuclear facility should be run and secured by the international community.",
