To avoid age discrimination claims it is stated that the 16-18 age bracket and 18-22 age bracket are classed as training brackets, however a person aged 18 for example may have been in a job longer than that of an over 22 yet be paid less due to minimum wage brackets. This is not \"equal work for equal pay\" and must be amended.",
