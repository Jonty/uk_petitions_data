        "action": "abandon plans announced in the \"Digital Britain White Paper\" to scrap FM and AM radio broadcasting which would leave digital radio as the only available option for listeners. The cost of this move would be a further addition to the cost of living of the British Public and render many valuable car, portable and Hi-Fi radio receivers useless.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "According to the \"Digital Britain White Paper\": Digital radio to become the sole national standard with FM and AM radio stations to be switched off by the end of 2015. This is far too short a timetable and will render many radio sets that are in good working order useless. Apart from the massive replacement cost faced by every household  with a more expensive and inferior quality system (DAB vs FM), the addition to the waste stream will cause serious issues for the recycling industry. The uptake of DAB on a voluntary basis is been very slow and the almost universal use of FM in car and home portable radios will mean that the cost of replacement will adversely affect radio listening in this country and could cost \u00a3billions.",
