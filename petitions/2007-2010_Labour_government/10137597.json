They are paid a pittance in comparison to other emergency services.. salaries start at 12,500 GBP pa compared to police (\u00a322,000 pa), firefighters (\u00a320,000). \nTo equalize pay for the 1200 MCGA staff would cost only about 9 -12 million pounds per year, \nWe the undersigned believe this amount of money is minimal in safeguarding the safety of our shores, seas and the people who use them.",
