            "background": "Houses should be seen as a home, not as an investment. stop people from being able to make hugh profits from buying and selling houses as this is driving up house prices. So long as investors can sell a house at any price they wish, house prices will not stabalise let alone fall, no matter how high inflation gets because \"property developers\" will still be making millions and be able to afford to out buy everyone else. Also the building of new houses will be in vain because most will just be bought by developers and then sold at twice the price.\nhouses should only be sold for the price they were bought plus the price of any work done on them (i.e. loft conversions, extensions BUT NOT redocoration). and house values must stop being set by estate agents who just see high prices as higher earings for them.",
