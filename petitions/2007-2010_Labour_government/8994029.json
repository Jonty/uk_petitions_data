            "background": "The use of overseas collections centres is reaking havoc to my home - they telephone late at night and persistently. Does the UK govt have a policy on it ? I have absolutely no intention on telling my confidential financial data to :\n \na) a non - UK citizen\nb) Someone I don't understand\nc) Over the telephone\nd) Anyone who won't give me their surname\n\nWe are the world's 4th richest country -why are we relying on overseas banking ? Have you ever been in an Indian bank ? The supervision of immigrant staff in all walks of British life is atrocious. Are we really recruiting more ? The petitioner is calling on Alistair Darling to look at this please for public sector workers as well as timesheet signing and salary payment. When I am working shifts, this is really unacceptable.",
