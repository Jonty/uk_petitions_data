            "background": "Licensing laws already exist to control binge drinking and by association the violence that then follows. As an ex licensee, I was trained to ensure that alcohol was not served to anyone exhibiting signs of being under the influence of alcohol. It is also illegal to buy a drink for someone who is under the influence of alcohol. \n\nWe do not need new laws to sort out the  anti-social behaviour of indiduals. By making the license holder responsible for carrying our his duty as defined in the licensing act, these problems can be resolved.\n\nWe therefore ask that, instead of creating new laws to counter act these problems, please use the ones that are already there to stop this cancer spreading through our country.",
