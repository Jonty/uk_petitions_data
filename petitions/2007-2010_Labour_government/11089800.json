            "background": "If you are wheelchair bound then the Government accepts you are disabled.\nAnyone unfortunate to be blind should have as much support as is humanly possible, by Government Funding of the  training of 'Blind Dogs'.\n\nAt present the training of blind dogs,costs \u00a338.000 per guide dog,approximately.\n\nThese costs are met by the kindness of donations and serious fundraising by extremely dedicated people.It is particularly hard to do this in such a harsh economic climate. \n\nThe Government should be supporting this training,I doubt the public realise that they do not do so financially or in any other way.\n\nBlind people NEED 'Blind Dogs' to give them back self-confidence,the independence to leave their homes and to go about their business.\n\n'Blind Dogs' enable the blind to undertake the normal everyday tasks that the fortunate sighted people can do, without even thinking about it, and take very much for granted.\n\nPlease support this petition.You never know you too may lose your sight.",
