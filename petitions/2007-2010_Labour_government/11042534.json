However I took him to see Motorhead and it bloody give me hope-it give my son inspiration. Give Lemmy the recognition he deserves. And no this petition is not meant to be funny I am totally serious. Lemmy Kilmister has done at least as much for this country as Elton John and Cliff Richard. Please take me seriously.",
