(\u00a340-\u00a350-not sure) then re-take your test (obviously they gain out of that) and then of course pay for your license again another \u00a350. I know the lesson is dont do it, but they are taking advantage of that lesson that they state so often and making poor people poorer.i would like this petition to cover all aspects that the DVLA charge or impose fines on",
