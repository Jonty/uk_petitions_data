        "background": "A number of University Chancellors are pushing for the current cap on undergraduate University tuition fees of \u00a33,500 to be scrapped, meaning that in theory at least fees of up to \u00a330,000 could be charged per year of a typical undergraduate course. In a recession where the British Taxpayer has rescued the banking sector it is an unacceptable financial argument to put this above the education of our nation. Education should be open to those with ability not those with ability to pay, otherwise Universities will fast return to their elitist past pushing out mediocre rich kids.",
