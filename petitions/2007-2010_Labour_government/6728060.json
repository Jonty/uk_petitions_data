            "background": "The recent ban on smoking in public places has been one of the Governments few successes. Unfortunately it has forced many smokers to light up in the streets. Areas that are designated for smokers are fine, but the smoking ban should now be extended to cover major shopping areas and other places where large numbers of non smokers might congregate. A mouthful of someone else's second hand cigarette smoke is just as dangerous and offensive from a smoker in the street as it is from a smoker in a pub.",
