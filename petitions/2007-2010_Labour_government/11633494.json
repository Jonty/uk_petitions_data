            "background": "I would like to attract the attention of Mr Brown to the systematic radicalisation and creation of a parralell taliban style government in the Swat valley of North West Pakistan. The government of Pakistan is doing very little to prevent this, and the international community is watching the ban on girl's education without even asking the Pakistani government to do someting about it. It is time that Mr Brown and Mr Miliband should take action and prevent the creation of another Afghanistan in the North of Pakistan.",
