            "background": "To qualify for working tax credits you must meet certain criteria, including being of 25 years of age. At 18 you pay full tax an NI. Why is it ok to pay into these, but get nothing out just becuase you are under 25. As well as this being age discrimination and a reason NOT to work, there just is no justification in making someone living alone & under 25 struggle because they earn their money, while someone else in the same situation but over 25 gets help.\n18 to 25 year olds are being forced to be worse off and can only spend what they get in their wage packets. The current criteria for WTC are creating a situation where under 25s are better off not working and claiming, or having children. It doesn't pay for under 25s to work!",
