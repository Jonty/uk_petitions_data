        "action": "Introduce Education Maintenance Allowance for every pupil aged 16, 17 or 18 in full-time further education at college or sixth-form.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "EMA is given to pupils from households with an annual income of \u00a330,819 or less. We the undersigned believe that all pupils aged 16, 17 or 18 in full-time further education should receive EMA. This would start at \u00a310 for all pupils on a non-means tested basis. An increased allowance for pupils in lower income households (as currently implemented by Directgov in the existing EMA scheme) would have a maximum of \u00a335 a week.\n\nWe the undersigned feel although EMA is an incentive for the pupils who receive it, it also has an almost opposite effect on those who do not currently qualify for it. Those pupils who do not receive Education Maintenance Allowance are discouraged by this, and tend to feel they need not attend college/sixth-form particularly often. Educational Maintenance Allowance should be an incentive for all pupils in further education, not just some.",
