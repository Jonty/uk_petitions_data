While I am sure we all appreciate they need to be housed, the residents and business people of the area do not accept the trouble some of these residents bring with them.  \n\nWe have on many occasions had to call the police due to incidents of varying degree's, recently due to 2 young people living there shooting an air rifle at passers by (http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/hendonnews/display.var.1591949.0.gun_boys_arrested.php), this kind of behavior cannot be tolerated and I ask the government to intervene and close this place down.",
