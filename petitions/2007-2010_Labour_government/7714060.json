            "background": "The current 'Health and Safety' culture appears to be causing a significant increase in the time motorways are closed when road traffic accidents occur.  This results in very significant inconvenience to the travelling public, loss of revenue, loss of business, major congestion on local roads not suited for this traffic volume and dangerous levels of frustration among drivers. \nCurrently there do not appear to be any controls or targets to encourage Chief Constables to re-open motorways as soon as the critical evidence has been gathered.  Other developed countries in the EU and North America put a more balanced priority on keeping open the main autoroutes.\nThe Prime Minister should require Chief Constables, who have responsibility for Motorways, to publish annual statistics of the percentage of times these motorways are shut for accident investigation and the total numbers of cars affected by each such closure.",
