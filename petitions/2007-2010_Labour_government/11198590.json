            "background": "Any interest rate cut should be passed on to all borrowers, whether business or residential.\n\nThe economy will not recover if it is only the banks that continue to benefit from the interest rate cuts.  There is no point in the Bank of England reducing interest rates if it is not passed on.  Banks and Building Society's will cut rates paid on savings, they should be forced to do the same for mortgages and loans NOW.",
