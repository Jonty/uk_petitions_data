            "background": "There are many mixed race and ethnic minority children languishing in care in the UK. There are also many families that would be prepared to adopt those children but are prevented from doing so because the prospective adoptive parents are not the same race. We believe that it is better for a child to have a family of a different race than no family at all and the present system which strongly discourages such adoptions should be ended.",
