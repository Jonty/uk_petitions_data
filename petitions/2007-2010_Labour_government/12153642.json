        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We consistently see advertising, especially for cosmetic or financial products, making claims for their products, which must be read in conjunction with a small print, lengthy blurbs at the bottom of the screen, which appears only for a few seconds. \n\nNot only is this deliberately misleading to the products benefits, but is also discriminatory to those with visual impairment. \n\nThe ASA already specify a number of measures which appear to being flaunted on a regular basis. This petition urges the PM to impose tough penalties to those who breach these regulations and ensure the legislation is unambitious.  \n\nAn example of the regulation which appears to be breached regularly:\n\n\"Advertising must not omit, hide or provide in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner material information if that omission or presentation is likely to affect consumers\u2019 decisions about whether and how to buy the advertised product, unless the information is obvious from the context. If the advertisement is limited by time or space, the ASA will take into account steps that the advertiser has taken to make that information available to consumers by other means.\"",
