            "background": "Do you like going to the pub? Or is 8 cans for a fiver from the cornershop more your style? Public houses are very often the hub of a community but their prices are becoming prohibitive and will result in those pubs going into demise. Shop prices do not discourage anyone, young or old, from drinking too much. The government can hit the drinker as much as they like with tax, tax, tax, but that only hurts the remaining public houses. Supermarkets can make alcohol a loss leader, and shift the expense onto anything else in the shop. Hardly a free market. If you wish to stand up for your local pub please sign this petition. Thank you.",
