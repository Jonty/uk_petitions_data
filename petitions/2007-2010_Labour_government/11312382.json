            "background": "Our country is often referred to as \u2018UK plc\u2019.  If it was a plc, it would not be 'ruled', but 'managed': by a Chief Executive and a Board of Directors, answerable to shareholders at an AGM. The UK\u2019s Ruler, HM Queen Elizabeth II, has delegated to \u2018Government\u2019 the management of the country for the benefit of its citizens -  \u2018shareholders\u2019. All shareholders want is that their investment , in taxes, is managed to provide security, health-care, education and pension, but \u2018AGMs\u2019 only occur every four years and no opportunity exists to express a view between them.  Nor can citizens vote for what they really want at the appointed time - only select between extremes.  Since \u2018Government\u2019 is now synonymous with \u2018Ruling\u2019, citizens suffer \u2018elected dictatorship\u2019, with unwanted and unpopular laws, taxes and policies imposed by a largely unaccountable Government and a wholly unanswerable Civil Service. To focus the minds of public servants, the word \u2018Government\u2019 should be replaced by \u2018Management\u2019, to remind them that their role is to enable the electorate\u2019s wishes, not to impose views upon them.",
