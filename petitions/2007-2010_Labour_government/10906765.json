If you odered a screwdriver and a hammer turned up you would send it back and if an employee refuses to make good on their conditions of employment they would be sacked. With election promises this is not the case. We have the blanket smoking ban and no referendum on the EU treaty, against what was promised and on what the government was elected upon. I propose that if a promise made is not kept by the winning party without very just cause, we the employers of government should have some way of reponding, not just waiting until the Government decides it wants an election.",
