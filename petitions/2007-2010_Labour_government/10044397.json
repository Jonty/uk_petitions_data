            "background": "Ever since the legal age to buy tobacco has been raised from 16 to 18, i have noticed an increase in young people smoking. This maybe because they are rebelling agaisnt the smoking law. It seems to be easier now for teenagers who are under 18 to buy cigarettes now than it was when the law was 16. Countries such as Ukraine the smoking age is 12, and 14 in Italy. If teenagers new that they could by tobacco and cigarettes at 16, then there is a good chance that they wont. People always want what they can't have.",
