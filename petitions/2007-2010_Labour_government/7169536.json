        "background": "Our \"Green and Pleasant Land\" is under threat from over development. Enough is enough for southern England. Yes, build on brown field sites, ex industrial and replacing sub-standard '60s housing, but not on our woods and fields. Land reclaimed from the sea could be built on. Garden plots should count as green field sites. Demolishing one detached bungalow and replacing it with two detached houses should be treated as redeveloping a brown field site.",
