            "background": "The latest government petition has concluded that every person who has had trouble with the bonnet of the Renault Clio Mark II was guilty of not maintaining their cars properly. We request that Renault provide a fully detailed published report of the tests carried out with VOSA. In the same way that no fault could be found with the Comet Jet liner in the 60's until several exploded in mid air, we would propose that there is an inherent design fault that has not been picked up by the tests Renault performed with VOSA. One suggested principle is that when the car is moving forward at a high enough speed enough pressure if formed under the bonnet to make it fly open with the catch, although safe at low speeds, being of an inappropriate design or quality to cope with this increased pressure. If so many cars have been involved in the same accident then surely there is a design fault somewhere - in short we dont feel that the company have tested these vehicles sufficiently enough and many hundreds of people have at worst had their lives threatened, and at the bare minimum have had their insurance premiums hiked - something that Renault should offer to reimburse.",
