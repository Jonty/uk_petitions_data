We would like to see the United team wear replicas of the 1958 kit, free of logos, sponsorship, player's names and squad numbers.  All players should be numbered one to eleven, and the kit should NOT be sold by the club in large numbers to make a profit.  If so desired, the kit could be sold as a limited edition, with ALL profits being donated to the families of those who died that day, both players and journalists.",
