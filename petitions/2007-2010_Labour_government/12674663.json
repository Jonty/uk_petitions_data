            "background": "Cash ISAs are becoming a dead end of saving. Providers are enticing people in for a single year with a good rate of interest, only to drop the rate the following year.\n\nSavers then find their money earning little interest and they can't transfer to a better deal as many cash ISAs don't allow transfers. Savers are not getting a long-term competitive rate of return.\n\nA simple way to clean-up the system and provide greater protection for consumers is to insist that all providers of cash ISAs must allow transfers from existing providers. This would be a core requirement for providing a cash ISA product - no transfers allowed - then your not allowed to provide a cash ISA product.\n\nThis simple step will lead to much more consistent and better rates of return for consumers, particularly pensioners who rely on these products to provide an income.",
