The typical cost of parking a motorcycle is \u00a30.50 per day to \u00a31.50 per day. And yet the fines are the same \u00a340/\u00a380. \n\nThis is utterly disproportionate and appears to be a hidden new revenue stream for councils.  Make the fines proportionate, I would suggest around \u00a35 per parking offence.  \n\nIn the few months I have been parking in and around Westminster, I have had over \u00a3240 in fines!",
