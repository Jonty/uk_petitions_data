            "background": "On Wednesday 21st Oct 2009, the Telegraph ran a story detailing how MPs are to receive a pay rise to compensate for their expenses changes. \nIn a time when civil service and other public sector workers are being asked to find efficiency savings, or accept pay freezes or pay cuts this is outrageous. Regardless of allegiance all MPs are responsible for the state of the economy, the lack of regulation of the banks and the catastrophe that the rest of the country is being asked to pay for. This is wholly unacceptable.",
