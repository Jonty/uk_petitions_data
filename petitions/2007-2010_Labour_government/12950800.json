These bodies receive public funding to promote public understanding of and familiarity with art and history, not to restrict it.\n\nAny museum or gallery which takes public funds should be required to release to the public all photographs it commissions of all objects in its collection, whether still under copyright or not.  This would include photos taken for curatorial reasons, publicity, web sites, as well as those taken for creating souvenirs, postcards, calendars, etc.  The original photographs should be made available at full resolution.\n\nThe photographs should either be released into the public domain or under a Creative Commons licence allowing public use of the material.",
