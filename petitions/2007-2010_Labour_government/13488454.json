        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Every year hundreds of people are killed and thousands are injured in Road traffic accidents, 99.9% are caused by driver error! in other petitions i see the call for members of the publc over the age of 65 to be re-tested, but bad and dangerous driving is across the board, all ages. And so if everyone has to undertake an assesment every 5 years it should hopefully make our roads safer, should you be in need of further training or found to be unfit to drive through health issues your licence should be revoked for medical issues or restricted until you meet the requirements of an examiner, this Should Not be considered as a retest, and all costs be met by the government. After all we pay too much in road tax and fuel duty for the pleasure of driving. We all want safer roads, and we all want to drive. I believe this to be an ideal solution.",
