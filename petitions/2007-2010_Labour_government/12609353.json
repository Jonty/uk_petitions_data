I would be sacked by my employer, prosecuted and placed on the DNA database if I commited an act of Fraud or Obtained Money by Deception. The Law obviously does not apply to Politicians. We want Gordon Brown to find his backbone,sack ALL who are guilty (which would appear to be most)and ensure prosecutions!",
