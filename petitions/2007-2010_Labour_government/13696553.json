            "background": "Im a disabled man of 27 with severe Fibromyalgia my condition is not visable & cannot be confirmed by blood tests. Diagnosis is through a series of elimination.\n\nCarers visit 3 times a day to look after me, whilst my partner works. I do voluntary work from home when I can.\n\nI have an electric wheelchair & a wheelchair car on the Motability scheme, along with an adapted bungalow for which we are grateful.\n\nLately there has been alot of talk about disabled people taking advantage of the system & I take offence to this. I have IB reviews every 18 months despite a recovery being unlikely. There are some people who abuse the system, but there are genuine people who suffer everyday like me and hearing all these new policies is frightening and I want to be left alone as life is difficult enough.\n\nThe review doctors are not very nice & do not understand my condition, its frightening. Please can you stop picking on us, we didnt ask be be ill. I receive less in benefits per year than the average MP claims for 1 month. There are other ways to cut money without picking on vulnerable people.",
