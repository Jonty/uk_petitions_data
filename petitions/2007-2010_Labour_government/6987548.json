For the rest of the time the store is open fronted and uses an air cushion to retain heat. This seems to me to be a great waste of energy, when doors would be a more efficient way of retaining heat in the store.\n\nWhile I understand that, in some cases, air curtains are put to good use, some common sense is needed and enery savings need to be made.",
