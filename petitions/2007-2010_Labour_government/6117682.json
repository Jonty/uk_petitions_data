        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Estate agents charge vendors a percentage of the value of a property in order for them to sell it. House prices are soaring and the fees are soaring with them - the Estate Agents are not doing any additional work to earn their ever increasing fee amounts and should not be allowed to charge more just because the value of the house has changed.  There is no reason why their costs should coincide directly with property value although a system could be introduced where they can charge a higher fee for a larger property (eg -a similar system to the council tax banding system).  Any fee should be fixed and should not change with house prices. Currently consumers are getting very little for their money and this needs to be reviewed as it is very difficult to sell your house and get maximum exposure without an agent and they are taking advantage of this to the extreme.",
