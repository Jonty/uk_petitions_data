Having a business that employs 40 staff I am responsible for alot of people and their families, therefore these uncertain times are not helped by the HMRC not being understanding enough on late payments.  \nAsking the HMRC for a delay in making a full payment comes with 5%, then 10%, then 15% charge.  Mr Gordon Brown has directed the banks to provide help to small business but I think the HMRC should provide some help by being a little more understanding too.",
