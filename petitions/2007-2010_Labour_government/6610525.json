Teachers and some NHS staff all get the Key Worker Status but the Customs Officer is left out it's just not fair Social Housing projects like Key Worker Living should and must be oppened up to Frontline HMRC Officer (Customs). I hope this E-Petition gets the message across to the good UK Public who if they want to know what we do check out the website HMRC (Her Majestys Revenue & Customs) I am proud to Searve the Queen. Thank you for your time.",
