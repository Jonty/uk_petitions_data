            "background": "The benefit system is all wrong - the government promote the fact that if you don't work you will get everything and if you do work you get taxed more and struggle. My husband and I work full time but we are always being penalised. If I stayed at home we would get \u00a3350 of child tax credit per month. I am basically working full time for \u00a3500 per month. My sister stays at home receives \u00a3800 per month in child tax credits along with her child benefit and so therefore receives more than I receive in a month and I work full time. Benefits should only be available for those who really need it for medical reasons. Single parents are single by choice, they shouldn't have children if they can't afford them, they shouldn't be handed houses, grants and benefits just because they can't use protection or their marriage or relationship has failed, it is not the tax payers fault. The more parents who work, the more childcare is required and so the government receive more taxes and unemployment levels decrease.",
