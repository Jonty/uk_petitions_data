We have to make a stand and call for these troglodites to be sacked forthwith. To say that a bath plug or a MOAT being cleared are essential to the well being and upkeep of an individual is disgusting. My family are on benefits due to my PTSD and I'm unfit for work. We have \u00a331.50 per adult per week to live on and we see this happening all over the country. It makes sense now that MP's are scamming us all just to line their own, considerabley well lined already, pockets.",
