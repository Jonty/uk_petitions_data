Also If you are recieving carers allowance a blue badge should be automatic, public places (such as shopping centres or restuarants) should owe a duty of care to carers and those they are caring for and if carers are not happy with the service they recieve they should be able to launch a complaint to an independent body. A grant should be avaliable if you wish to use the money provided to benefit who you're caring for and the financial boundaries should be widened so its more accessible.",
