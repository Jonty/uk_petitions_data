            "background": "The Department for Transport are holding a consultation period before introducing The Merchant Shipping (Prohibition of Smoking on Ships) Regulations which will effectively ban smoking on ships in UK waters. The excuse for this extension of the Health Act 2006 offshore is the usual spurious arguments about exposure to \"second hand smoke\" etc. The regulations have nothing to do with safety which is already well regulated. Whilst we all know that smoking is not good for us, surely this is a step too far? Ships are not only places of work for seafarers, but also their homes for long periods. Ships are well ventilated and there is no logical reason why a sailor should not be able to smoke in his own cabin without affecting anyone else. You may support this petition for 3 months and until 9 October may register your views directly to the Department, but I'm not allowed to give you the email address. You will find it on the DfT website.\nRule Britannia!",
