            "background": "No-one wants or expects a ban on gambling. However, the government needs to act promptly and decisively to reduce the nations saturation of Gambling Industry Advertising and Sponsorship. Slowly the laws are getting more relaxed as the general public are becoming de-sensitised to acceptable gambling limits.\nGambling has become marketed as anything but a way of losing money and certain addiction for many. \nIt is portrayed as a sport and a no risk past time.\n\nCategory D AWP's (10p fruit machines) are for the use of juveniles. 20 years ago, the same machines were for adults only. Adults are now expected to gamble more stakes by relaxed gaming laws but this does not mean that the 10p machines are now ok for children. \nIn relation to disposable income, a juveniles pocket money will see a much higher proportion of loss compared to an adults wage.\nAction needs to be taken now before the country sees the effects in years to come, similar to binge drinking, junk food and drugs. EITHER WAY THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO SOMETHING, NOW OR IN YEARS TO COME.",
