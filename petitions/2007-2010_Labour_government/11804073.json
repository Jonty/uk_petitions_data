        "background": "We believe that regardless of Dutch MP Geert Wilder's views we should defend his right to express them as they are not inciting violence but are his personal interpretation of a printed text and that by denying him access to the UK we are denying our right to question his views in open debate.\n\nWe believe the statement included in the letter to Geert Wilders by the Home Secretary, about Muslims and their beliefs\u2026 \"would threaten community harmony and therefore public security in the UK\" is insulting to Muslims as it implies that \"if you upset Muslims, there will be violence.\"\n\nWe call on the PM to overturn this decision and repair the damage the Home Office has done to the inherent rights our ancestors gave their lives to defend.",
