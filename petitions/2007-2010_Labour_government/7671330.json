        "action": "Censure Westminster Council for its plans to prevent the homeless getting their soup run this Christmas",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Westimster Council has said it will use its powers to prevent homeless people getting their soup run this Christmas.  They claim that some of the food distributed goes to people who are not \"really\" homeless but in fact living in hostels. So what? Are we going to stop feeding the truly homeless because a few meals go astray? Politicians (including Gordon Brown) have failed to solve the problem of affordable housing. Westminster council just wants the poor and homeless moved on so that rich people in Westminster don't have to see them on Christmas day.  Sign this petition to ask the Prime Minister to publicly speak out AGAINST Westminster Council and in FAVOUR of soup runs to the homeless sleeping out on the streets at this bitterly cold time of year.",
