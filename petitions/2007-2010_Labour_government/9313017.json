If fees are going to be charged for prescriptions it will create more problems with animals being abandoned and made to suffer.  I feel very strongly against this idea/ It takes two seconds for a vet to write out a prescription and possibly a lot of suffering for an animal.  Also a lot of heartache and worry for an animal lover like myself.",
