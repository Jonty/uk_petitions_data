            "background": "I feel people have lost there pride and proud to be British attitude because of the way the country has turned into a greed, rip off state. Everyone is out to make money off everyone to make themselves richer, also taking advantage of people who are in desperate need. Young people can't get on the house market due to the prices of mortgages, bills and living expense. Then we get taxed on everything aswell, and payrises are not inline with everything else that goes up. These are the main reasons why people despice this country and goverment. We don't work to live no more, we work to survive !!!!!!",
