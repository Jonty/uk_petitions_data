            "background": "We the Caribbean nationals, and family and friends in the UK, want the UK Government to re-band the level of duty that is proposed to be charged to travellers to the Caribbean, to the same level that is propsed for the USA.\nWe feel that compared to certain popular destinations in the USA, such as Miami and Los Angeles, the Caribbean countries merely fall into band C of the bandings because of geography, we certainly do not have the same level of carbon emissions.\nThe financial implications on a family travelling to see relatives in the Caribbean would be immense. Tourists maybe detered, which in turn would impact the tourist industry and fragile economic stability in this region.",
