            "background": "I am absolutely fed up of going for a walk with my dog and him being attacked by a 'staffy'. They are after all just a diluted pit bull and are extremely dangerous to other dogs. I work in a vets and have seen numerous injuries inflicted on other dogs by this dispicable breed. Also we are now seeing 'Irish staffy's' which apparently just have longer legs but which look like a pitbull. Also they are owned by people who cant handle them and dont castrate them which just adds to their violent tendencies. I would like a law which says that they have to be kept on a lead at all times.",
