            "background": "Middle lane drivers are a huge cause of congestion and frustration on our busy motorway networks. This petition is to emplore the government to produce a national advertising campaign educating drivers on motorway driving and make it socially unacceptable to hog the middle lane of a motorway.\nThere are a considerable number of drivers who think it is their given right to sit in the middle lane, causing untold congestion and frustration. If \"undertaking\" is punishable and unacceptable (fines & penalty points) then so should be \"hogging\".",
