            "background": "The recent price increase that we have seen in the UK will destabalise household budgets.  More and more people including the elderly will be put-off from using energy in the homes which will lead to health problems which will impact on our taxed industries such as the NHS and Local Authority budgets.  Families will be forced to cut spending in a financial climate that is already tight. The Energy  industries are making obscene profits year on year which should be regulated by the government.",
