            "background": "Buy the Vauxhall plants from GM so the British Car manufacturing Industry can survive and the British people can have some pride in our few remaining engineers and show we can still compete in the world. Whats wrong with the thought of buying British cars made in Britain! We have very little choice these days. The cost of buying this will be the same amount of money that will have to be paid to redundant workers - who will no longer be able to contribute to the wealth of this country. Give them and us a chance!",
