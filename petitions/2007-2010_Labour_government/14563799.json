Recognition due to these veterans and their service differs greatly in nature from the normal recognition given to active service campaigns. \nThe Cold War was one of deterrence with the emphasis on preventing a \u2018shooting war\u2019 from breaking out. Whereas any campaign of active service normally attracts it\u2019s own campaign or General Service Medal there would have been few survivors of a Cold War that went \u2018 hot\u2019 \nApplying the conditions normally given, by senior officers, to the inauguration of a medal then only after the \u2018mushroom clouds\u2019 from this \u2018hot\u2019 war had cleared would, possibly, a few survivors from the Cold War have had their contribution recognised by an award.  \nDifferent type of action ..different rules apply to instituting an award. Time this was put right!",
