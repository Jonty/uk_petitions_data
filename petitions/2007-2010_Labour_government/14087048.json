The turnout for this referendum was only 50.1% of the electorate. Of this the Yes vote received 50.3%. Of this the No vote received 49.7%. If this result were applied to a referendum that substantially changed the relationship of Wales with the remaining United Kingdom, 6721 voters could take Wales into independence. It is not enough that politicians say it would not happen, the people of Wales needs such assurance written into the British Constitution.",
