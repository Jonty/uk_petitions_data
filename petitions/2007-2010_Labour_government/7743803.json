Numerous authors have demonstrated convincingly to me and many other \u2018normal\u2019 people that the official story supported by government and the media would not work in court as a case for the prosecution against Bin Laden. More importantly to me is that no answers are given for the unexplainable events and loose ends of the official story when we live in a world with forensic science.  It is not unpatriotic or disrespectful to the victims to seek the truth which is all I seek and I ask you Prime Minister Sir to do the same.",
