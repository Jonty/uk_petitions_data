            "background": "Why cannot we abolish all guns? \n\nIn Japan it is a crime to own a gun, and the murder rate is spectacularly low. There is no reason for owning a gun, not even by the police. \n\nGuns are made to kill. The freedom to own a gun constitutes the freedom and the license to use it. Can we not begin the control and prevention of violence by the control and prevention of gun ownership?\n\nSince the start of 2007, eight young people have lost their lives in shootings - six in London, one in Manchester and now the killing of 11-year-old Rhys Jones in Liverpool.\n\nAccording to provisional Home Office figures, there were 58 firearms-related homicides in 2006-07 compared with 49 in the previous year. That is an increase of 18% in just one year. If we include airguns, the number of homicides in 2006-07 rises to 61. There were 413 firearms incidents that resulted in serious injury - more than one a day.",
