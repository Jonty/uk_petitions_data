For seven years he infiltrated her life, yet was jailed for just 16 weeks. \n\nClaire says: \u201cThe legal process I experienced throughout my ordeal was sometimes as bad as the stalking itself. There was a total lack of consistent legal representation. Often I would arrive at court to find yet another new face from the Crown Prosecution Service working with me. I was forced to write my own pr\u00e9cis of my case so that every time a new person came on board they would at least have the essential outline.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, stalking affects around 1.5 million people a year. Some of you may be experiencing stalking or know someone who is. You have the power to help Claire \u2013 and thousands like her \u2013 who live in constant fear. Claire has launched Claire\u2019s Campaign, asking the Government to make the following changes:\n\n1. \u2018Vertical Prosecution\u2019 by the Crown Prosecution Service in stalking cases. This means the same specialist prosecutor see cases through from beginning to end.\n\n2. A review of the guidelines on sentencing and the minimum and maximum jail term that can be imposed.",
