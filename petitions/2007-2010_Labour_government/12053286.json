            "background": "At the height of soaring pump prices Brown made a PROMISE (note the importance of this word) during Prime Minister's Questions on July 16th 2008 not to raise fuel duty for a year.\n\nHe stated: \"In recognition of the problem people face with petrol, we are freezing duty on petrol for the full year.\"\n\nBrown broke this promise in December 2008 when he added 2 pence per litre to fuel duty to offset the reduction of VAT to 15%. This promise is due to be broken again in April, as fuel tax rises again by 2p per litre.\n\nCould some from Number 10 explain why this has happened even after we were PROMISED it would not happen.",
