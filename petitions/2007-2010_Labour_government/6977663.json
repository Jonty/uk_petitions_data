Fireworks can be brought and let off any time of the year.  \n\nFireworks are very dangerous, and I have heard of fireworks being let off sideways in a park, and they can also set fire to trees, houses, and cause damage to cars, not to mention the harm it can do if it goes wrong and people are hurt by them.  They can be fatal.",
