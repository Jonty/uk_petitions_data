            "background": "As the law stands now, if the parents of a child are not married, only the person registering the birth name is entered in the registry.This is usually the mother. It seems grossly unfair that two people made the child but only one is legally held resposible for that child, usually the mother. Children Right Act states amongst other things, that children should have the opportunity to form relationship with both parents/siblings and the current legistlation is not honouring this most basic of a child's right. I believe that we need to start now to create a better future for our children and that surely include the input of both parents. fathers/mothers should be made accountable to support their children's mental and emotional welfare. The Child matters. Thank you",
