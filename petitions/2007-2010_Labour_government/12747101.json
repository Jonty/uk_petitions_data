            "background": "We Request that the Hazard Perception test be scrapped because:\n\n1. The execution of the idea is terrible; the graphics used make it impossible to see hazards at a distance.\n\n2. The Perspective and view range of the test encourage bad habits (for example, not checking your blind spot)\n\n3. The Pricing of the exam is now extortionate.\n\n4. The anti-cheating system is broken and does not work.\n\n5. The better you are at hazard perception, the more you are penalised. \n\n6. Many hazards used are ridiculous and would not be likely in real life.\n\n7. Half of all candidates fail the Hazard Perception test\n\n8. The test is not helping to improve safety on the roads- Practical experience is far more valuable than experience of clicking a mouse.\n\n9. Surely our reaction to a hazard is far more important than seeing them?\n\nWe request that the government make the DSA scrap the unfair and inappropriate Hazard Perception test.",
