            "background": "Stop the amount of people fraudently claiming benefits and make them work. Too many people in this country are living off the state just because they are not stopped. Most have never worked a day in their lives because they earn more by claiming benefits. Millions of children are being born into famililies that don't even want them, they just want the council house and the money that honest peoples' taxes are paying for. Baby P is a prime example of how unwanted children are treated. These people should be forced to work. They'd soon realise how it feels to make an honest living. It's a disgrace that this country has allowed this to happen and now it's time for it to change.",
