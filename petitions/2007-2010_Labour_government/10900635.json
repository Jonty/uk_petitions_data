The law actually state's that if you blow on the breath test at 35 - 39 (which is the UK limit) you will be not be charged. If you blow over 39 you will be charged. For example, there are roughly 2 units in a ordinary strength pint of beer. For the average 11 stone man that means you can legally drink 2.5 pints of beer and still drive. Lets change this to a 0 tolerance Law!",
