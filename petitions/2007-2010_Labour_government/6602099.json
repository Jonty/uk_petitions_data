            "background": "Home information packs are a waste of time and money, and represent a pointless bureaucratic intrusion upon both vendors and purchasers. They are useless because the information has been compiled in the vendors interest and at their cost, and therefore cannot be trusted by buyers. It is furthermore unacceptable to have goverment snoopers compulsorily let loose in a citizen's home, merely because he wishes to exercise his legitimate right to dispose of his property. Finally, HIPs are yet another steath tax, creating another new group of client state apparatchiks in the form of inspectors for whom the ordinary citizen must pay.",
