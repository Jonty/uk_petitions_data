It is mindboggling watching people walking out of Sainsburys and Tesco sideways, fighting to keep the trolley going in a straight line. \n\nI watched a TV programme a few years back where they had spent thousands of pounds researching how to make the trolleys easier to handle. Just lock the back wheels like every other industrialised nation on earth.",
