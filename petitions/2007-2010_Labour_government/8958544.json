            "background": "i would like this petition to be signed by every single parent or family that have no child care for their children while working. if there was moe childcare avaiable then us single parents would go out to work instead on sitting and worrying about childcare. i have for many years been a single parent and am increasingly finding it hard to find adequate care for my children. the system wants single parents to work and so we should but what about helping to find before /after school care that goes on to 7.30am in the morning and 6.30pm in the evening so that it gives parents time to travel to and from the destination. also holiday care when their on holiday it is alright stating that we should go to work and that employers should be flexible but this is not always the case, you dont have enough holidays in the year to book all your childrens holidays and there is not enough playschemes open at the hours you need them to be. childcare should be 7.30am - 6.30pm everyday. surely this would save the goverment more money if everyone was at work rather than using tax payers money to pay for us. we dont like hand outs and this would help if all schools catered for this.",
