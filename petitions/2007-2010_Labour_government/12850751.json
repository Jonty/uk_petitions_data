        "background": "There are 1.3 million businesses in the UK that don't have a website. This number is growing daily because it includes start-ups too! This petition asks the Government to help educate business owners and start-ups to understand how using today's technology can help them to keep customers and find new ones. \nWe ask that the Government sponsor a scheme whereby small business owners and start-ups are educated in the use of today\u2019s technology and unravel the myths and mysteries of how technology works for business purposes. \nThe scheme should be made available free of charge to everyone who is thinking of starting a business and established business owners and should be run locally in every town and city so that local retailers and business people can meet and be trained together \u2013 not far from their homes.",
