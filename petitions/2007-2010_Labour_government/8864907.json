Can, the Prime Minister, not give legally married British citizens 21day visit without visa, as is the practice when coming to the Philippines. If that would require a minimum period of 5 years married then so be it. I am informed that the UK and the Philippines have a reciprocal agreement, this action should be included in the agreement.",
