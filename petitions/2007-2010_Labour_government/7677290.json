            "background": "The RNLI have to scrimp and get as much donations as possible to survive, to buy boats and maintain the service.  If donations dry up who is going to save our sailors and public when in difficulty at sea. We have all seen the work they do but its a disgrace that what is a national lifesaving organisation gets little if nothing from our own tax money from our own government. The Goverment should fund at least half of whats needed if not all, its the publics money anyway and this is more needed than grants or loans to other countries. The government is often giving OUR money to countries abroad without asking us in its millions, but fail to look after our own first and the government should fund the RNLI which would allow more lifeboats to be bought.  Even the Arts are given 100's of millions each year, yet this important organisation gets nothing, that has to change, with even the lotery giving large amounts to daft organisations, the time has come for the RNLI to be funded the same as the Police, Ambulance and Fire as they are another emergency service recongnised as such by all. I call on all members of the public to support this petition and for the government to act now./",
