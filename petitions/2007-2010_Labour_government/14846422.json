        "background": "Aren\u2019t you continually astounded and shocked by the fines received by drivers who flout the law by driving with no insurance, tax or mot. Recently saw an article in the paper where a 19 year old with no insurance was fined only \u00a3250\u2026.Where is the reasoning behind this ? Why should he go legal when he knows his fine will only be one third of what his insurance premium should be !!\nWhen a case goes to court why doesn\u2019t the judge pop on the web to a comparison site and get a quote for what his insurance should be then set the fine accordingly ?? Doesn\u2019t that make more sense ?",
