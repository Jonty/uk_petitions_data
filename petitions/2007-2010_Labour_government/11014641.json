We should be allowed to choose whether we want to watch BBC channels or not, and be allowed to pay the same way we do the other channels. When we speak of freedom of choice, we must make it accessible to all, not just a few. \nIf moving home, the first letter to be put through the letter box is an abusive and threatening letter by TV Licence service. This is not acceptable to be thus harassed and must be brought to an end.",
