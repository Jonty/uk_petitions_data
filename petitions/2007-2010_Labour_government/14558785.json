        "background": "The DH has opened a public consultation on its proposal for Generic Substitution (GS) which could allow pharmacists to dispense generic medicines, even if the doctor or nurse has prescribed a specific brand.\n\n \nThe DH offers 3 options: \n\nOption 1 \u2013 Do nothing.\n\nGeneric prescribing is already at 83%; only 5% of medicines prescribed as a brand are also available as a generic.\n\n\nOption 2 \u2013 Introduce GS but with some medicines excluded.\n \nThe consultation suggests that due to the difficulty in implementing this, option 2 is not really being considered.\n\n\nOption 3 \u2013 Introduce GS for a limited list of selected medicines only (to be revised as many as 4 times a year).\n\nThe DH highlights risks with this option: \n\n- Compromised patient safety\n\n- Savings outweighed by cost of implementation and prescribers opting out \n\n- Difficulties in maintaining the select list and ongoing extra workload for clinicians.\n\nThe only truly safe option for patients is 1, to abandon the plans and leave prescribing decisions up to the patient\u2019s doctor or nurse.",
