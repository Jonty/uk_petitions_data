            "background": "Most 75+ year olds will not be able to aford a medicle certiicate if ti is on the same lines as a HGV/PSV, which is upto \u00a3225. Then on top of that have to pay for a HP (hazard percepton) test, the present test is a waste of time as it doesn't give a true picture in the vidio, there is no periferal view, & if my vision was that tunnelled I would gladly surrender my licence. The plans as I have seen them are hitting a vulnerable section of our comunity, who need transport, especially th nes that live in rural areas, where there is little or no public transport, & this would be renewable every 3 years. It should be enough for the persons GP to countersign the application, any cost being borne by the DVLA/DSA. I a HP test is included it must be made realistic & not the fare it is now, & also at the expence of the DVA/DSA.",
