A friend of mine was told by his local hospital that his operation had been already performed when he telephoned to see why he hadn't been contacted ! Today, AOL report on a probe into hospital records dumping\nin a wheelie-bin. In light of the loss of details of 55 Norfolk patients (described as a \"deplorable\" and \"serious\" breach of confidentiality), the petitioner is calling on the PM to address how this could be improved. Having already suggested hand - held notes and medi - alert bracelets, can I suggest possibly even a hand - held CD ROM for each individual - but does the general population and NHS staff have the IT skills to make this work ? What does the rest of the nation think ?",
