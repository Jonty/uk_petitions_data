            "background": "The proposition of moving the remaining 11 Plymouth based Frigates (4 type 22's, 7 Type 23's) will have a disastrous impact on the local economy when in an already bad state of recession. 1000's of jobs are predicted to be lost, as well as a huge amount of serving personnel who would be uprooted from lives that they have made in the South West, Families having to find new homes and schools. This move would disruption to at least  10'000 Sailor's and Civilians. \nTo reduce the Naval force in Britain\u2019s first Royal Dockyard would be absolute sacrilege.\nIn the current state of the UK the last thing the Government want to do is to make its Heroes and Helpers homeless, Jobless or forced out of the Royal Navy.",
