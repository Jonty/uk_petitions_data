            "background": "In our country it seems that the sentences handed down to criminals are very lenient. There is little deterrent in these sentences to stop people from offending in the first place or indeed re-offending. In the United States of America sentences are handed down to their criminals which run into many years of incarceration for crimes such as robbery and assault. For commiting the same crimes in the U.K. the perpetrator may recieve a prison sentence for a much shorter term at worst, but most likely is that they would recieve a community order or a fine.\nCrime is out of control and it is my belief that with harsher punishments for offences it would be less attractive to people to jeopardize their future to follow a life of crime.",
