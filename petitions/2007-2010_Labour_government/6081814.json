            "background": "Consumer protection is in place when you sign loans, mortages, insurance agreements etc. But there is absolutely nothing in place to warn consumers of the huge potential financial liabilites of signing and then later ending a marriage contract. The marriage contract creates a liability that can see someone lose the majority of their assets and up to half their future income for life. The terms of the marriage contract can be amended at any time by the law courts and the new terms applied in retrospect to those who signed years earlier.\n\nThose who sign this contract are provided with no information before signing as to what they are signing up to. They are not allowed any cooling off period.\n\nIt really is a complete anomally that the contract that represents the greatest financial risk for any person is the one with the least consumer protection and consumer information.",
