            "background": "Fremington Training Camp is due for closure in October 2009.\nThis camp is a great place, that lots of military units, both regular, Auxillary, and cadet forces use to train their personnel.\nIt is situated close to Braunton Burrows, Instow, and RMB Chivenor, but is the only location out of all 3, with accommodation and training space.\nThe buildings are not wooden as described by one person, but require some maintenance. This camp should stay open without question.\nIt's resources are well used by all, it is not in the way of any special buildings. This is closure, for closures sake. As we speak the camp is currently booked up for the next 2 years by many units for training, yet even still, the closure is due in October 2009. Help stop this.",
