            "background": "These events are of national importance and should be available for the entire nation to enjoy. \n\nAs it stands, people in Scotland require a subscription to Sky Sports in order to watch their national football side play their home World Cup and European Championship qualifying matches. This is unacceptable - why should anyone have to pay in order to watch their national side live on TV?\nThe FA in England, quite rightly, award their contract to a 'free-to-air' broadcaster, but the SFA, would appear to have financial matters at best interest instead of the Scottish population. Therefore they should be bound by law to award their live-game contract to a terrestrial broadcaster.\n\nAs things currently stand, a staggering 1 in 4 households cannot watch the national football team in international competition.\n\nBy ensuring Scottish international games are shown on a \u2019free to air\u2019 broadcaster it would mean a great deal for a proud Scottish nation.",
