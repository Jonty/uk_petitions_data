            "background": "The gaming industry in the United kingdom is failing, with the high tax rates on businesses playing its toll on the companies working here. The industry in the united kingdom was once the leader in gaming, now it is a relic of what it once was. Many industry experts have linked the downfall of the industry in the united kingdom to the fact that many other countries such as Canada offer tax breaks for the industry, promoting many companies to move to more attractive and cheaper economies to work in. Help bring our gaming industry back, boosting jobs and creating fun, entertaining prodcuts for the United Kingdom.",
