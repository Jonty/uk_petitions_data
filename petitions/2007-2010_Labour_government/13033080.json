        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I note the government's pledge to create jobs through a new green economy.  Sadly I feel the necessary skills to support this may be lacking.\n\nThere are few universities offering postgraduate qualifications in renewable energy, to enable already educated and skilled engineers to retrain for this important area.  Only one course at Loughbourgh is available to working engineers through distance learning, and that is so well regarded it is over subscribed with applicants being turned away.  \n\nThe Open University offers only one module in this area.\n\nMany people could adapt their skills through postgraduate study if it were available for people who cannot give up work or move away from their families in order to pursue it.\n\nI would like to ask the government to encourage the higher education sector to make available more accessible courses in Renewable Energy Systems and Technology, including certificates and diplomas, to enable more people to make a useful career change.",
