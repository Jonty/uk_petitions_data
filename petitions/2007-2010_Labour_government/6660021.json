            "background": "It is cheaper to pay to visit continental Europe and to buy a years worth of cigarettes than it is to buy them locally.  Try this and HM Customs & Excise will confiscate them at the ports claiming they cannot be for personal consumption.\n\nThe amount of tax put on tobacco products is utterly ridiculous, and the highest in Europe.\n\nIt is not because they are looking out for our health, as studies show that a 10% rise in the price of cigarettes results in a 4% fall in consumption.  We enjoy smoking, but begrudge the phenomenal tax. Please stop preying on our addiction to fund Ministerial expense accounts.  You're already denying us choice and free will, please stop taking our hard-earned wages in this ridiculous manner",
