        "background": "As increasingly the second home allowance is being misappropriated, we the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to  commission the building or conversion of flats for the use of MPs when sitting in Westminster. As these are not their primary residences, they should only need to be single bedroom flats, and police protection would need to be concentrated in one area. This also wouldn't penalise those with constituencies within the M25, who could reside in their main residence or their second home flat as required. This would provide a flat amount of expense to be claimed, facilitate more opportunities for conference and conversation outside of Westminster, concentrate security, and remove the taint of suspicion from the way these expenses are claimed. There should be no concessions made for marital couples, or those who wish to have family staying with them, as these concessions are not made in any other business or civil service department. IF the MP wishes to have their family stay with them, they should have to use their own salary to rent a hotel room, NOT public funds.",
