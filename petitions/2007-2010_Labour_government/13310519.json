            "background": "Keeping dogs on leads is cruel.   Puppies need to run about to enable their bone structure to develop.  Every dog expert say that you must let your dog off a lead to release the excess energy that they have.   The law is that a dog should be on leash or controlled by voice, this is a fair and perfectly good law.  An unexercised dog can become destructive and nasty.  To not let a dog of lead is irresponsible.",
