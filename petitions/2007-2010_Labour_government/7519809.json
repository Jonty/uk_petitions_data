            "background": "Although UK nurse training is professed to be one of the best in the world - and the UK govt today announces skills improvements, many newly qualified and junior staff are not experienced enough to deal with high risk cases in certain specialities. In response to hearsay complaints, the petitioner is calling on the PM to :\n\n1. Improve the quality of nurse handovers\n2. Facilitate better supervision - preceptorship on the basis of experience in case management rather than length of time since graduation\n3. Extend the content of nurse training in obstetrics - 3 weeks mid 4 yesar nurse trining is not enough - too much time is spent on wishy washy subjects like values and inter - personal skills\n4. Provide for HDU and ITU short course training in high risk cases - some of which are so rare that district centre staff rarely gain experience in their management (such as HELLP) etc",
