What seems to happen now (or did when I was working) is that the lowest-paid jobs were also the lowest grade: monotonous, soul-destroying, and (in many cases) far below the intelligence of the staff who were forced to do them; in my opinion it is THESE jobs, if any, which should attract the highest salaries as a form of compensation.  I imagine that no commercial company employs people it doesn't need so surely they should all be entitled to a salary which reflects this.",
