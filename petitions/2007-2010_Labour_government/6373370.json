        "background": "This would abolish grievances about some employees earning far more than others even though they are all, presumably, essential to the running of the company.  What seems to happen now (or did when I was working) is that the lowest-paid jobs were also the lowest grade: monotonous, soul-destroying, and (in many cases) far below the intelligence of the staff who were forced to do them; in my opinion it is THESE jobs, if any, which should attract the highest salaries as a form of compensation.  I imagine that no commercial company employs people it doesn't need so surely they should all be entitled to a salary which reflects this.",
