        "background": "The Redditch case shows how difficult life for families can be when one of their members has a disability and they may feel isolated. Further to the petitioner's earlier request for \"baby hatch\" depositories for unwanted newborns, I am calling for safe haven type - hostels funded by local authorities where families can receive respite care for their disabled relatives - when so many more people are returning from battle, this idea may be even more poignant.",
