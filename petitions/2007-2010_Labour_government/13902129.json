            "background": "The world is unsafe for the young and vulnerable who don't have a voice, can't protect themselves and are deceived by adults, leading to secret abuse. Abusers should be subjected to severe laws so they think twice before abusing. Convicted individuals must be removed, work for the community and receive psychological therapy. Other alternatives are: capital punishment ; castration; public exposure; facing those who have been wronged; cleaning our cities to receive benefits; full-time manual work; monitoring/tagging during bail; internal chipping for the convicted; hefty jail sentences for repeat offenders. A soft approach means that loving parents can't punish their own children; authority can't instantly punish wrong doers; teachers can\u2019t hold respect in the classroom. Suspected offenders are given bail and disappear into society and the authorities don't know what they are doing! Why should wrong doers have rights? To do wrong is to lose the rights of society! We need harsher laws.",
