        "background": "Near Coventry the new method of getting doctor appointments is to phone up and wait then to be 'approved' and allowed to visit your local GP. An elderly relative of mine who suffers from heart problems when feeling ill had to phone up the doctor for an appointment but was told that she would have to wait till the doctor approved her need for the appointment. The next day the doctor phoned and arranged the appointment. 1st why did the doctor have to 'approve' that an elderly person is ill enough to se them. 2nd why did the doctor herself have to phone for each patient? Isnt this wasting time and money for an NHS who is in spiralling debt?",
