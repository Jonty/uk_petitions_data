            "background": "Due to the life saving help a First Aider can provide, in the first instances of an emergency.  I think it should be a compulsary lesson as part of the curriculum.  We hear so often of children, playing a part in helping in an emergency.  I think everyone should be equiped with a basic knowledge at least, starting from an early primary school age.  This can then be extended to cover more important proceedures for older students.  This could very easily be brought into the curriculum, with life saving results.  Please sign below.",
