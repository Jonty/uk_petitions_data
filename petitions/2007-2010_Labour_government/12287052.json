            "background": "I am writing to you to express my concern at the MoD proposals to cut the pay and pensions of the lowest paid staff in MoD. As you might be aware the Department intends to reduce the pay band maxima for non-industrial civil servants at E1 and E2 pay bands. I understand that MoD plan to impose these cuts on 1st May 2009. I believe that it would be completely unjust to penalise the lowest paid staff in the department by cutting their pay in such a manner. I ask that you personally intervene in this process so that we can find an acceptable solution to this problem. I know that my union, PCS, has proposed a number of ways to resolve this issue and I would hope that my employer would seriously consider these. I hope that you will agree that low paid government employees should not have to take a pay cut.",
