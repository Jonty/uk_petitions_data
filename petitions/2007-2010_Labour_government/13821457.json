After filling in the application forms and either posting or emailing them you have a small spark of hope - you might be successful this time and get a job.\nAs time goes on you hear NOTHING, you are aware that someone else must have been given the job.  Come on employers most potential employees have email addresses, if not they probably have friends who do.  One email to let us know if we have been unsuccessful would be very much appreciated!  You never know perhaps the employers of today will be the unemployed of tomorrow!",
