Cancer care and cardiac procedures are 2 areas that the government are championing but their provision to the populace of this area includes a long journey and bridge tolls to get this access.\n\nScunthorpe and Grimsby (Diana) Hospitals should be able to provide this care rather than the people from this area needing to visit another health authority to get their vital healthcare.",
