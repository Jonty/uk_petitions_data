            "background": "Due to the rising numbers of people being attacked or mauled by dogs off leads, i ask for a law to keep all dog's on a lead in any public place.....how many more cases will happen until these steps are taken....i am a jack russell owner and have on 2 occasions been jumped by dogs after picking my dog up to safety. i am now too scared to walk anywhere near loose dogs just incase, and there are a lot of people scared of dogs who are not dog owner's and children  who do not feel safe to go out or anywhere there may be dogs off a lead. This is terrifying to a lot of people, this isn't meant to offend, i think it's a fair precaution. I love dog's but there are many people in fear",
