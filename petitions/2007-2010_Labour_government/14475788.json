            "background": "This petition is to protect the rights of those citizens over the age of 18 to practice the medicinal and/or recreational use of Cannabis without fear of persection or imprisonment. For too long has the war on drugs proved ineffective, the imprisonment of non-violent Cannabis users who do not harm anybody has to stop. This is not a petition to legalise the use of Cannabis, it is purely to end the obstruction of civil liberties that are the harsh drug laws we face.",
