The current weblinks on the EU committees, only have links to the 25 EU members of the 28 EEA members. Adding the www.efta.int/ weblink will mean all countries that contribute to new regulations/laws and are involved with EEA matters will be represented in the weblinks. I feel this would have cross-party support.",
