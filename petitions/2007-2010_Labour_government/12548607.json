            "background": "Stop interfering in the housing market in an attempt to prop-up the property price bubble. The government did nothing to stop the unsustainable price inflation, now do the decent free market thing and allow the market to find its own level. I appreciate that the country is close to financial ruin and that hm-gov would like some more stamp-duty money and some more retail sales fuelled by equity release from overvalued property; but this is not a good reason for propping up a financial bubble that is forcing many generations of Brits into homelessness or the financial servitude of working just to pay the rent or mortgage.",
