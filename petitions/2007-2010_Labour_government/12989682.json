            "background": "The Charity Commission is engaged in a wholly unfair and counter productive war on independent education under an ideologue Chair who is targetting the most vulnerable schools in the sector with very hardworking staff and where parents make the most enormous sacrafices both financial and personal to help their children. The schools are a beacon for national and local excellence and the situation is both unfair, counterproductive and a national disgrace. The policy must be changed and the leading tribune removed for this to happen.",
