            "background": "I think in these times of war and economic gloom the country needs cheering up.What better way to do it than have the man responsable for all of the gloom to jump into a cage full of lions.No live leaders debate needed here.The event would be broadcast live by the highest bidder and shown after the watershed so as not to upset little ones.I also think that for entertainment purposes mr brown should wear some sort of wrestling outfit for the occasion of his certain mauling.If the first lion escapade fails to do the job then all other tv channels will be free to show a second live lion v brown evening of entertainment.Lets see if that makes him spell names properly and learns him how to bow to our dead heroes.",
