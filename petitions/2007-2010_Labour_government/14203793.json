            "background": "We are outraged by the decision of Judge John Reddihough to jail Munir Husain for 30 months for acting to protect his family.\n\nThe man in question, Walid Salem, was one of three men who attacked Mr Hussain and his wife and children in their own home and tied them up.  \n\nIf he didn't want to get hit around the head with a cricket bat, he shouldn't have been in their home threatening and terrifying his wife and children.\n\nSurely we all have the right to defend ourselves against violent attack?\n\nWalid Salem has more than 50 previous convictions and is currently awaiting sentencing for another matter.  He has received only a two year supervision order for attacking Mr Hussain's family in their home.\n\nIf we are not entitled to use force to protect our homes and our families, this country has no hope of surviving.  No society can exist without the right to defend yourself and your family.\n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to intervene and ask the Lord Chief Justice to reexamine the case and the shockingly disporportionate sentencing in this matter.",
