            "background": "As a result of cost overruns the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), is recouping \u00a380M with a wide range of cuts to science programmes and facilities.  This includes the possible reduction in availability of the ISIS pulsed neutron and muon facility to UK University users.  Neutron Science is one of the few areas of science in which the UK can claim a world lead. A review of STFC's decision has recently been announced and we urge the Prime Minister to press for another solution to this problem before UK neutron and muon science is set back by decades.",
