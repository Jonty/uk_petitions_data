        "background": "The Wrekin Housing Trust are able to discriminate against disabled Residents on the grounds of disability.\n\nA Disabled persons Choice of Home is reduced by at least 95% when compared to an able bodied person.\n\nAs an able bodied person, regardless of banding, they have the opportunity to apply for 150 houses per year.\n\nThis figure is reduced to a maximum of 6 per year for a disabled person and there appears to be no formal or accurate method of assessing the needs of Individual Disabled Residents..\n\nMany disabled residents have aids that can easily be transferred from one property to another without any additional effort, but the Wrekin Housing Trust refuse to address the issue of ensuring equality of choice.\n\nThe gap between Disabled residents and able bodied residents needs to be addressed and closed with the Wrekin Housing trust being brought out to answer why they openly discriminate.\n\nWe request that we now formally enter into a process of open and full consultation to review policy, practice and procedure to ensure equality of housing choice for disabled residents.",
