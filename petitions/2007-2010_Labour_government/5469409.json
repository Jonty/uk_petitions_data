        "background": "The speed limits are now outdated. Motorway speed limits do not reflect the safe driving limits of most cars and urban speed limits are often reduced because the national limit is not suitable. The time has come for speed limits to be reviewed. The constant speeding that has become the norm would be reduced if most people felt the speed limits were reasonable.",
