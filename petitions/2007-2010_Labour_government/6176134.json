            "background": "It is, quite rightly, an offence to allow your pet to foul a public area. Although Local Authorities are keen to use this law they are not so keen to provide disposal units for pet excrement and even advise that street litter bins can be used. It is our opinion that special bins, emptied and cleaned on a regular basis should be provided in greater numbers, in all parkland where pets are exercised, and in residential areas there should be at least one bin per street, or every 500yards whichever is the smaller distance. Disposal of pet excrement into on street litter bins should be stopped. The law should also be extended to include those who choose to exercise pet ponies and horses in public places.",
