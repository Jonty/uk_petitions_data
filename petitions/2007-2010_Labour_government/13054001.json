            "background": "I have experienced the NHS mental health system myself and I am not happy with it. I am not alone, many people do not think the help the nhs gives to young people suffering from mental health issues like depression is far below sufficaint. I've read in magizines that help is readily available, but its a lot of hot air. The only options I had were councilling, which helped temporarily but as soon as it stopped it was back to square one, and the same for my friend *joe, back to been depressed and suicidle, un able to understand our own thoughts, back to been delusional and at times experiencing physcotic episodes. please sign this petition and contribute to make help more accessable for young people with mental health issues.",
