            "background": "It is clear that the U.K faces a huge threat from terrorism. However we believe section 58 of the terrorism act is too far reaching.Section 58 states that \"Collection of information (1) A person commits an offence if\u2014 \n(a) he collects or makes a record of information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.\"This does not make exceptions for records that are just someones thoughts e.g. poems or stories.I do not belive we want a thought police. We do not want the police to be distracted from investigating people who pose a real threat.\nIf someone is convicted of this offence they may be sentenced to up to ten years in prison.",
