            "background": "The price of diesel has not fallen as much or as rapidly as petrol. Diesel requires less refining and is generally a greener fuel compared to petrol. So why is diesel so expensive? Prices of petrol keep dropping, but diesel stays high. I have even seen some garages increase the price of diesel to compensate for falling petrol prices. It is unfair for people to be penalised for choosing a fuel that will get them more miles to the gallon and has lower CO2 emissions than if the car has a petrol engine.",
