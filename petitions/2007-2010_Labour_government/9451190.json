            "background": "Having just spent 10 days in Playa del Ingl\u00e9s in Gran Canaria and seen the kind of tourists from The United Kingdom who tend to visit, I feel it is high time to restrict passports to those who :\n1. Can speak intelligble English.\n2. Do not have head-to-toe tattoos.\n3  Do not drink alcohol from 9am in   the morning.\n4. Do not put ketchup on everything(including themselves).\n5. Weigh in at less than 20 stones. \n6. Have a linguistic and cultural appreciation of the country they are visiting.\n\n A visa system could be introduced for each country to be visited, rather like the linguistic and cultural tests given to prospective immigrants to the UK. Failure to reach the required standard would mean the refusal of the visa. This would singificantly improve The United Kingdom's abysmally low standing abroad and preclude  British yobs besmirching our reputation yet further.",
