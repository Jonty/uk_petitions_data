The role of the voluntary sector was clearly outlined in Bevan's vision to address the 5 giants - so why then does every single service in my local authority appear to rely heavily on public donations ? \n\nThis isn't to deny that many organisations do a great job, recognising local problems and responding with initiatives, though often difficult to maintain. Child protection, health care and policing are all statutory duties, which because of poor economic management over many years, by many administrations, rely on kind - hearted souls, the better off or more generous within communities and the church to piece back together.",
