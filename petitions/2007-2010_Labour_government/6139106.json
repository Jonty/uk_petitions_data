            "background": "When incorrect advice is given it can often lead to months (or even years) of misery as the person sold the IVA struggles to make the payments when it is quite obvious from their situation that bankruptcy would have been the more sensible option.  I believe that many of the companies selling IVAs merely advise you to go for an IVA, take the fees and then do not want to know when anything goes wrong.",
