I will hold Gordon Brown and his cabinet personally responsible and will seek personal compensation and apology from the Prime Minister if we suffer any form of harm or loss because of his cabinet's incompetence.  Great Britain, I urge you to vote NO CONFIDENCE in Mr Brown and his band of baffoons and ask that a general election be called ASAP as our current government is no longer fit for purpose, they cut school and  NHS funds and our elderely go cold in winter, our troops are left without proper arms but they feel its justified to find \u00a324BILLION of our money to shore up a badly run bank.  If ever there was a time for every resident of this country to stand up and be counted its now!",
