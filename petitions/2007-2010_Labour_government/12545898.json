        "background": "Intelligence chiefs have warned that China may have gained the capability to shut down Britain by crippling its telecoms and utilities.\n\nKey IT structures installed by Huawei have been bought from the Chinese military and contain Trojan horses designed to strangle Britain\n\nDespite repeated warning the Government has showed it's complete ignorance again on IT matters by simply not understanding the severe nature of this threat\n\nA Pentagon report last week cited Huawei as a key part of the cyberthreat from China, noting that it retained \u201cclose ties\u201d with the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA). Huawei denies any continuing links to the PLA. A spokeswoman at the company\u2019s UK headquarters dismissed the alleged links as \u201crumour and speculation\u201d.\n\nThe worst is similar totally safe equipment could have been bought from Marconi.\n\nIf anyone is in doubt China is committed to \"Asymetric Warefar\" with the whole world, whereby they will attack us on all and every front.",
