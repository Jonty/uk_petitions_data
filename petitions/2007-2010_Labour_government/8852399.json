            "background": "as many people are aware, in every city or town or village or anywhere in the country, there are simple minded people that have nothing better to do than drive around and around in there cars, literally in circles (barry laps). these people go around and around with there windows open and theyre music as noisy as possible. i think it is about time something was done about this. all they are doing is adding to pollution, and congesting and wearing our roads. if they are not using theyre cars for a reasonable reason why should they not pay a higher road tax. 4x4 drivers pay more for pollution, why are these people getting away with it. a law should be passed that any car that has been modiefied, not to enhance performance but to create more noise should pay more tax. it frustrates me that these simple minded people are wasting our natural resorces and damaging our planet for no reason, apart from to look \"cool\". every community has these people. its time to make a difference.",
