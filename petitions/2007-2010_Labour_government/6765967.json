            "action": "Stop using environmental taxes to force people out of cars and address fundamental issues with public transport in the UK.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is regarded as common knowledge that throughout Europe, public transport is substantially more affordable, punctual and in many cases, more comfortable than that of the UK. In many of these countries, the usage of public transport is much higher than in the UK, despite a substantially lower total cost of ownership for private vehicles in most of the EU.\n\nThe problems created by increased vehicle taxation are many-fold; it threatens the livelihoods of many people who have no choice but to move about by road for business, isolates those without viable public transport links and takes away the option of private vehicle ownership from the economically disadvantaged to name but a few.\n\nInstead of ill thought-out tax increases, we need to concentrate on ensuring public transport provides a viable, reliable and affordable alternative to private vehicles, at which point people will choose use it of their own accord.",
