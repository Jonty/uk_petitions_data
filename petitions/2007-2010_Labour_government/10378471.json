            "background": "Yet again we're hearing a minister tell us, the british people, to intervene if we see a crime being committed.  This goes completely against what the police, people who are on the front line every day, wish for people to do.  Having now spoken with several police officers and one person in high authority, it is clear to us that the police want people to remain neutral in a crime and to report it to them instead of confronting it themselves.  We call on the prime minister to control his ministers and to start supporting the security forces by listening to them and banning mp's (the government policy can easily be made) from making foolish suggestions about crime intervention and potentially endangering peoples lives.",
