Instantly recognisable, because it has rings.\n\nComposed of dust and ice, it should be possible to artificially create a set around the Earth.\n\nThe symbol of the Olympic Games is a set of rings, so what better way to commemorate the 2012 games by giving the Earth its own set.\n\nNot only that, but as shown in an animation by Roy Prol, they would really liven up Earth's sky.",
