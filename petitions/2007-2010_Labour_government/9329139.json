            "background": "For years, loose mortgage lending and a property obsession has pushed house prices to quite ridiculous levels.  When examining historical trends it is clear that a bubble was created, and that bubble is beginning to burst.  The Bank of England has already given over large portions of the public's money to try and avert this and save the bankers' skins.  These people all make reckless decisions over how much to lend and how much to borrow based on speculative gains that were clearly unrealistic over the long-term.  Taxpayers who do not own property should not have to be subjected to the risks involved in property ownership.",
