            "background": "The Policing Green Paper proposals would change police authority membership by replacing councillors with directly-elected crime and policing representatives. These representatives will undermine partnership working between the police and local authorities which has reduced crime by 48% since 1995, will also undermine public confidence in the fight against crime, and cost over \u00a330 million to introduce - which would fund 700 more police officers to protect our streets and neighbourhoods.",
