(Children would only be able to contact their mentor by mobile telephone number and would not be given the home telephone or address of their mentor)\n\nBetter monitoring of children in care.\n\nEach authority should be required to publish annual data on the children in their care to include information on how many children had changed either foster parents or schools, their examination results and statistics on those staying in full time education.\n\nWhere possible,children in care should be given the possibility of being placed in a boarding school.\n\nNB Without better integration between educational and social care services, improvements are less likely.",
