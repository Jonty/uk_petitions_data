            "background": "The site set to be developed for more new houses is the area running from Junction 7 of the A14 to Violet Lane in Kettering and along to the Weekley bypass for thousands of new houses.  An area of about 245 acres. If the plans go ahead this means a minimum of 3675 houses and a maximum of 4900 houses (based on the developers desire for 15-20 houses per acre). Of course this means if every household has 2 cars it could mean another 9800 more vehicles to add to the Kettering infrastructure. The proposed site is set in Glendon, a picturesque hamlet set on the outskirts of Kettering, well into Northamptonshire, the centre of England.",
