        "background": "The use of Road Salt on Britain's roads causes unnecessary damage to cars, motorcycles and other vehicles from corrosion during the winter months and untold environmental damage to our eco-systems and waterways as a pollutant.\n\nThere are many alternatives used in other European and US states that do not cause this environmental and personal vehicle damage.\n\nIt's not just vehicles that are rusting unnecessarily - damage to Vegetation, Mammal, Bird and Aquatic life are all suffering as a result, not to mention the damage to our drinking groundwater supplies.\n\nWe ask that you create legislation to stop the use of Road Salt within the next year and find a more suitable alternative.",
