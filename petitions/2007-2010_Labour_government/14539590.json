            "background": "There is a lot of groups going around facebook called \"dead baby jokes\" set up by fake, sick people. The groups consist of disgusting jokes, and pictures of dead/abused/murdered babies. Everyone has numerously reported these people/pictures/groups to facebook with no outcome of any ban or admins shutting down the groups. It's very hurtful to any parents who have lost a child or have living children. The pictures and jokes are very disturbing and i don't see how facebook admins can allow such a thing to be published on there website. It's easy for anyone of any age to come across these groups.",
