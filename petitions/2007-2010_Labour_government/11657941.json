            "background": "I believe that the short selling of any stocks and shares in the UK should be banned.  This practice has lead to huge profits being made by greedy hedge funds at the expense of the banks and private investors and has continued to undermine confidence in the banking sector.  The UK retail sector, already in disarray, is now being targeted which will inevitably lead to more problems and further redundancies!",
