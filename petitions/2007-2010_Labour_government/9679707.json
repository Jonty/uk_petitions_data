        "background": "Employees REQUIRED to drive as a part of their job specification may only claim mileage expenses to cover the fuel costs they incur on company business. most busineses now apply the pence-per-miles quoted by the Inland Revenue. Whilst this rate, supposedly based on 'Average Fuel Price' is quickly dropped when fuel prices fall it is apparent that the rate routinely does not rise for many months following a rise(s) in fuel costs. As a result MOST if not all drivers on company business (& therefore their familes) are left substantially worse off. This is clearly unfair and indisciminate taxation of people simply doing their job.",
