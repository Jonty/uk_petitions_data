Whilst this rate, supposedly based on 'Average Fuel Price' is quickly dropped when fuel prices fall it is apparent that the rate routinely does not rise for many months following a rise(s) in fuel costs. As a result MOST if not all drivers on company business (& therefore their familes) are left substantially worse off. This is clearly unfair and indisciminate taxation of people simply doing their job.",
