            "background": "Some medical practices have cherry picked parts of Agenda for Change. Whilst taking up large pay increases for doctors, the support staff have been left on the old Whitley scales. This has meant that many support staff are being paid significantly less than those practices that have taken up the Agenda for Change pay rates. It is proposed that all practices are made to take up the Agenda for Change pay rates for all staff as per the instructions on the HHS web site.",
