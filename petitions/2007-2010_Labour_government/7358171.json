            "background": "In West Sussex and sadly most of the country there is no follow on help for these children. ASD children have help in first and middle schools, my son has been in a special autisim unit, he leaves in september and i am expected to put him into a main stream secondary school with little help for his problems. That is what causes bullying and major problems for the child suffering from a ASD. We need to get help for these children in secondary schools, Things need to change.",
