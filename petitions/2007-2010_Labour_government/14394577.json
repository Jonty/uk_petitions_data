Currently we understand that only 40 Polish workers have been taken on to work night shifts.  While this petition understands the need for economic migration in certain circumstances, in this situation there are more than enough British workers to be employed on the site.  We urge the Prime Minister to honour his promise of giving British jobs to British workmen and women.",
