            "background": "under DDA  legislation providers of services are required to make \"reasonable adjustments\". The DFT and Railtrack shortlisted a number of stations to have DDA modifications.  The stations were chosen by using a test \"of usage\" . Kidsgrove failed the test and was not given any money.\n\nHowever since the station was assesed there has been substantial increase in services including trains to London and Manchester.\n\nBut the station is completely inaccessable to disabled people and in an age where you can send people to the moon surely it is not impossable to allow disabled people access to platforms of kidsgrove train station.",
