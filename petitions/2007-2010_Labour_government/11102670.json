In much the same style of the present Home Secretary's \"Policing Pledge\" it will set out the minimum standards of service and performance that the public are entilted to expect from our government. Performance could be guaged by certain key indicators measuring the state of the economy, cost of living, average earnings and life expectancy, and so on. Any shortfalls could be penalised by a comensurate reduction of MP's pay packets.",
