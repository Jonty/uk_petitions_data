            "background": "The reason for the boom in house prices and the shortage of affordable homes, even council houses and those suitable for updating and first time buyers is because of the Government allowing the purchase of multiple homes by so called 'property developers'. These oportunists have become mega rich, charging rents which are way above the mortgage repayments, and which even a normal working family man can not afford without having to resort to help from the Government, thus stripping him of his self worth. For a home that has no security and will never be his own.  No person should be denied the basic human right of an affordable family home, and particularly where children are concerned who need a settled home.\nSimilarly, no person should have the right to purchase multiple homes and deprive others of that chance, simply because he has the advantage to do so.\nThe Government has done nothing to stop this Housegrab situation and has actively contributed to the housing crisis by allowing it to continue.  Buy to let is the main reason for the housing crisis.  There is no shortage of homes, just shortage of affordable homes. Stop these so called 'Landlords' NOW.",
