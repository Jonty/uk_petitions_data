            "background": "All existing benefits should be scrapped and a new single simpler system implemented.\n\nThe new system will handle applications for all benefits and tax credits. It will look at a claimant's circumstances, calculate how much they are entitled to and for what reason and then pay them that benefit or tax credit without any hassle, argument or banging your head against a brick wall trying to deal with the job centre plus staff telling you one thing when someone else is telling you another.\n\nChanges of circumstances would be better handled under the system as the need to claim a totally different benefit would be eliminated with the change merely reported to the system, it will then recalculate the benefit and then payments will continue without any interruption. There would be no problems with people losing out on money they are entitled to as the system will cover the whole range of benefits and tax credits and as long as people keep it up to date with their circumstances, they will receive all money they are entitled to.",
