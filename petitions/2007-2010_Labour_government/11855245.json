            "background": "This petition's aim is to scrap the government's potential idea of levying a standard internet tax on every user as this would be pandering to the whim's of large companies who instead of moving with the times & accepting that some file sharing occurs (not only to their detriment but their benefit as people still go out & buy their films, books and music) & insist on maintaining their profit margins in business models which have been superceded & outpaced by the internet and changing technologies. For those who already fileshare this could be seen as justification for what they are already doing as a tax would be imposed despite them still be threatened with police action under existing copyright laws.  Not to mention the countless people who don't file share having to pick up the bill for an activity they do not engage in.",
