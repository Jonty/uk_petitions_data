            "background": "The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have identified the UAF organisation as responsible behind the weekend's violence in Bolton. According to GMP Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, his officers faced \"a lot of hostility\" and \"unwarranted attacks\" which injured many officers.\n\nAfter arresting at least 65 members of the UAF, including their secretary, Weyman Bennett, the police said: \"Today in Bolton we have seen groups of people, predominantly associated with the UAF, engaging in violent confrontation.\"\n\nChief Constable Shewan went on to say: \"It is clear to me that a large number have attended with the sole intention of committing disorder and their actions have been wholly unacceptable.\"\n\nWill you, as my Prime Minister, distance yourself from the diabolical actions of the UAF and take measures which will ban outright this evil malevolence affecting our Society?\nSigned:\nRev. Denis G Beedie",
