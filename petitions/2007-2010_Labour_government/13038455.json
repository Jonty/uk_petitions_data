            "background": "After almost 100 years of intensive mining the little village of Thurnscoe has finally started to recover. With significant investment in regeneration the beauty of this rural area is beginning to return. The local community is starting to repair itself and people are optimistic about the future. But just as this is happening the 3 local councils of Doncaster, Rotherham and Barnsley have decided to target Thurnscoe as a possible site for an incinerator. The environmental impact could be immense. Please don't let this poor little village become the victim of industrial development yet again.",
