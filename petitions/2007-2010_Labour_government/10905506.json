            "background": "During 2007, the UK housing market was at the height of a bubble funded by irresponsible lending, to return to those levels of lending is irresponsible, and to do so with tax payers money doubly so.\n\nAt the peak of the housing market house prices were double their fundamental value. I am basing this on a comparison of what it costs to rent property compared to the equivalent position of 'buying' a property with an interest only loan. The first being roughly half the latter. This tells us that either rents have to double or house prices half, in the absence of the former the latter is inevitable.\n\nTo force lenders to lend at 2007 levels will maintain this discrepancy for some time but ultimately the pain will be greater, more widespread and new loans will be defaulted on, crystalising taxpayers loses.\n\nIf the government goes ahead with this we believe they are making a grave mistake.",
