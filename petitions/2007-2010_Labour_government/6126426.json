            "background": "Is Wales the ONLY European country without a \"through\" trainline? And why does the government go on about public transport if we don't even have a trainline conecting the north of wales to the south. We have auful roads in wales. The least the government can do is bring back the trainline that was robbed by Lord Beechings in 1965. This would reduce the number of cars on the road and make wales a greener country. And everyone in Aberystwyth and the joint stations will be very pleased. Thankyou and please sign this petition as it means so much.",
