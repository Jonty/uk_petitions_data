Shame on you mr Blair and mr Brown.\n\nMy great uncle faught in Burma in 1942-45 and the one thing he remembers most is that a Gurkha saved his life from a Japanese attack.  If that Gurkha had not been there he would not be here today.\n\nThey deserve good pay, the chance to live in Britian.  Friendship and support from theis nations people.\n\nWe all owe them our gratitued and thanks.\n\nPlease help them",
