            "background": "As a very proud Englishwoman I was very disappointed with the lack of interest in the celebration of St. Georges Day 2008 and as the governments recent confession shows regarding spending for the event there is today a serious lack of priority for this celebration. In 2009 and henceforth I would like to see more patriotism and a greater understanding that we English should be allowed and encouraged to celebrate the fact that we are English within our own country with more government support and promotion. .   \n\nPlease sign the petition if you feel as strongly as I do about this matter.",
