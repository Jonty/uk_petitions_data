            "background": "Observation shows that bus lanes are usually empty whilst the main carriageways are gridlocked with cars.\n\nVery often when a bus does pass down the bus lane it is carrying very few or no passengers.\n\nThis petition is to open bus lanes only to vehicles that are utilising 25% or more of their passenger capacity, excluding the driver.\n\nPenalties can be levvied as today on both car drivers and bus drivers abusing the facility.\n\nBenefits are twofold: It will ease congestion by allowing cars to pass on the under-utilised bus lanes; and will make empty buses (which are far more wasteful in terms of pollution and congestion than empty cars) wait in the same traffic jams that empty cars currently sit in.",
