Think about the deterrent factor to an robber or murderer when he or she doesn't know wether this house is armed or not. We as people deserve the freedom that other humans in other countries (with lower muggings etc) have. You are 5 times more likely to be mugged in London than New York. I leave you with a quote, 'If you outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns'. Never has this been so true as to now. Only gangs have the firepower to control society. Even the police can't be everywhere.",
