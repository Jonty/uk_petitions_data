        "background": "Most people, even non-smokers, do not like the smoking ban. I am a non-smoker and even I can see that it was a stupid idea in the first place.\n\nPubs are made for smoking and drinking &c. but now the smokers have to go outside into the cold, so of course the non-smokers have to follow them or have no conversation for a while, so everyone end up outside. It's the same in hotels &c. They should at least have the right to choose to ban it or have a non-smoking room.\n\nEven more stupid is that people can't even smoke in their own cars or vans if they are considered a \"workplace\".\n\nThat is why we the undersigned believe the smoking ban should be repealed entirely.\n\n\nAlso, if this petition gets enough signatures we the undersigned woud like a real answer, not just the usual piffle trying to defend this rediculous law.",
