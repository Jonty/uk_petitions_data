It is also patronising for government ministers to be sent out to TV studio's to tell us voters that we are more interested in other issues. \n\nThe disclosure this week of what has been going on in the Prime Minister's 'War Room' brings British politics to a new low. It demands the Prime Minister take responsibility, show leadership, and make a genuine public apology.",
