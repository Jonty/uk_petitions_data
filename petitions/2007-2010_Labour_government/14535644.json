These environments are often harsh for a Student living in London who aspires to put in work for university, these students save as much money as they can to pay future fees and accomodation.\n\nWe call for all full time students from 16-19 to be given special oyster cards which permit them to travel on the underground for free ONLY during week days\n\nWe also believe that this would relieve some of the pressure on the overground services which suffer from overcrowding on certain routes during a school or college week.\n\n\nThe Chiswick Community school elders are happy to discuss this with this prime minister or any other parties concerned.",
