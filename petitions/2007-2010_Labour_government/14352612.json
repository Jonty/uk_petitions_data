Even an occasional gritting would have a long lasting effect (unlike on roads where traffic removes it).\nCouncils should make an attempt to grit pavements and provision residents with grit for use outside their properties.\nA resident who attempts to grit outside their dwelling should not be liable for injuries as might currently be the case.",
