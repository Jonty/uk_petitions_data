Some of those participating and committing to the show have very little money, particularly the public, but their committment and motivation is outstanding.  \n\nIt is sheer cynical greed and a week administtration that has allowed  a certain individual to disgracefully milk the event for his own agrandisement.  It is time it stopped, and, with public petitions such as this it is time he was shamed into doing so.  For him to pocket a fee vastly out of proportion to those who sacrifice so much is obscene.",
