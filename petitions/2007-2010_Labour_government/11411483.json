            "background": "Government legislation awarded to Councils has resulted in thousands of innocent people all over Britain being victimised and 'robbed' of their money by being given 'fines' by councils for such things as leaving a wheelie bin open or putting rubbish in the wrong bin.\n\nI want to put together a petition of names of people who are prepared to let Government know that this has got to stop. We all want a clean, honest, respectful and fair society. \n\nAll i am saying is that we do not need to have these cruel, unfair and money grabbing fines to make us do it.\n\nA FINE SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT AFTER EVERY EFFORT AND REASONABLE MEANS HAS FAILED. WE DO NOT WANT A TOTALITARIAN STATE IN BRITAIN!!",
