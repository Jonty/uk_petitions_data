            "background": "The police force has become a public joke, bogged down in paperwork, inefficiency and accusations of police brutality, corruption and racism. Therefore we propose that this largely useless institution is disbanded, and that citizens are instead given the right to police themselves.\n\nWe believe that every citizen of wisdom tooth bearing age should be issued with a Heckler & Koch G3 rifle, 100 hand grenades and a riot shield. We are of the opinion that crime will become a thing of the past with this method, and rather than wasting taxes on bureaucratic policing, the home secretary's husband can instead spend our earnings on more porn.",
