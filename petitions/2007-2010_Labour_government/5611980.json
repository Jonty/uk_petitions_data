            "background": "Currently the benefits system pays mortgage interest for claimants on a variety of benefits, capped at 5%.  \n\nWhen interest rates are in a period of rapid increase, once the mortgage rate is over this capped value, the benefit claimant has to pay any excess from his benefits, which have no allowance included for this.\n\nThe net effect of this is that the claimants risk losing their homes, simply because they may not be able to fund the excess from their benefits.  They then are then deemed to have made themselves intentionally homeless for the purposes of social housing and are then put outside this system, through no fault of their own.\n\nThe benefits system is designed to give claimants a minimum standard of living.  This lack of full interest payment dramatically reduces this minimum standard and ultimately will prove more costly to the government who will be left to pick up the pieces.",
