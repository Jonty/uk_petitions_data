        "background": "The number of long-term jobless youth is at a 15-year high.  \n\nNearly 400,000 people between 16 and 24 have been looking for a job for at least 6 months.  The number is higher if ages up to 30 years are included.\n\nYoung people, if unable to find work, are more likely to drift into disappointment, idleness, and crime.\n\nThis petition is for the creation of a national Yough Employment Program.  This program will offer employment to every young person, at a decent wage.\n\nThe program can put young people to work on a number of programs to improve our environment, parks, communities, security, and so on.\n\nThis program would be really useful for the country at this stage.",
