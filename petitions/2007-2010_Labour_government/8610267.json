            "background": "I think all religious schools should be banned in the U.K, there are too many ideals and opinions being thrusted upon us. Maybe we don't want to be religious? Hasn't anyone thaught of that? We have the right to not have religion battered into us. I see it as a form of trying to create prejudice. Personally from my experience in a Christian school I think that religion is forced upon you. There is no choice.",
