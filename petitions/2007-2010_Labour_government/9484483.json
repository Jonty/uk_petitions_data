This is a serious condition; the only treatment for this is to have a heart transplant. We both look forward to our classes; as we are each other's carer's, unpaid I might add.\nThe Government's so-called funding for this vital service is threatended. Often the centre is unmanned, there is nobody on reception.  I am studying for my Literatracy level 2, its quite hard for me to absorb but I am getting there. We have lots of people who find it very difficult learning.  It is not only older people who need help, we have lots of young particpants. I think that all the people who are currently gaining knowledge will be lost. Where will they go?  \nI urge you to think again regarding this essential learning resourse.\nJulia Lambson",
