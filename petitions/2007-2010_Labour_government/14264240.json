            "background": "After  it being discussed with a lot of parents, we think an extra weeks holiday over the christmas period is needed we think that schools open far too soon after the christmas period, most people have still got their decorations up and are still celebrating christmas at the point they go back to school now, we would be happy to have a week taken off the summer holidays ie start summer break later in july/beginig of august, and add the week onto christmas holidays, so children would be going back to school around 11th january!!",
