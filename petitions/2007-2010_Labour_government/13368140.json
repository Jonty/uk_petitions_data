            "background": "Multi-occupancy dwellings and halls of residence are mostly situated close to university campuses that have very good public transport links provided. \n\nCouncil's currently issue two permanent and one visitors parking permit per residence in permit holder only areas. When a property is converted into multiple occupancy this increases the number of permits issued and there is often no room for council tax paying residents to park as more permits are issued than there are on street parking spaces.\n\nPlacing a parking levy on student's who apply for parking permits in permit holder only areas for their term time addresses would discourage cars being brought into our cities unnecessarily.",
