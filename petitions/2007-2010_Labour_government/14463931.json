            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "EU competition rules allow drivers to save money by having their cars serviced under warranty at independent garages.\nThe rules, called Block Exemption Regulations (BER), force car manufacturers to share technical information with the independent market, allowing high street garages to service vehicles without invalidating the manufacturer\u2019s warranty. \nHowever, these rules are under threat due to a lack of awareness among motorists. \nConstant lobbying from car manufacturers could see the decision reversed, leaving UK motorists facing inflated bills and much less choice.\nThese rules are the industry\u2019s best kept secret. They were introduced to stop manufacturers acting like cartels and forcing motorists to use their dealers for servicing, but they can only work if people know about them. \nVehicle manufacturers hope to close the window of opportunity before the public has chance to take advantage. \nWe call upon the government to ensure this does not happen and uphold motorists' rights to greater choice and fairer prices.",
