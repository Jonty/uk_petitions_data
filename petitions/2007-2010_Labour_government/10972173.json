        "background": "I WANT to work but due to long term health problems, i can only do part time hours. I did a work prep course which showed i would not be capable of doing full time and as i don't qualify for dla, after tax,n.i., rent and council tax i would be getting less than the government says i need to live on, plus perscription charges to pay. I had to finish my last 3 jobs on health grounds.\n I feel there are alot of people with long term health problems that are willing to work, but can not afford to do so because of the tax credits system which penalises them for not been able to work more than 30 hours and not having children.",
