        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The proposed terminal will store over 100,000 tons of L.N.G in two huge tanks. Both tanks will be over 130 feet high.\n\nThe proposed storage facility will store one fifth of the natural gas for the whole of England. This will pose a risk to Canvey and to areas well beyond.\n\nIf there was a leak (like Bunsfield), the liquid gas would freeze everything in its path. It would then boil off, evaporate and expand some 620 times, from a liquid state to a gaseous state, making it possible to be ignited from the slightest spark. This \nwould cause an uncontrollable fire, for up to a 40 mile radius of Canvey Island.  The site of the planned plant is less than half a mile from housing.\n\nBoth the local and county council have rejected the plan. Do not let planning enquiry overrule local planning control",
