            "background": "Some people are mad, some people are bad and some people are partly both.  But, the origins of madness and/or badness are so similar that a similar response is appropriate in all circumstances.  This is why the prison service MUST be merged with the forensic mental health system.  The harshness of prison may deter many people from anti-social and/or criminal ways, but it also fails large numbers of people whose primary problem is mental disturbance and who need help.  Putting all offenders in comfortable secure units on indefinite sentences and only granting liberty when this is judged to be completely safe is the way to go.",
