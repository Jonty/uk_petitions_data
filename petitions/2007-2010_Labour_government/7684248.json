        "background": "After a period of planning and consultation, the Highways Agency announced in June 2007 that there would be a roundabout built at the A5/A444 junction. It has now suddenly decided not to improve the junction, as it says it doesn't give \"value for money.\" \nMany people have been killed at this junction over the years.  The safety measures they made to the carriageway layout in 2002 still hasn't stopped deaths at the junction. Installing a roundabout would make the junction much safer. The Highways Agency needs to reconsider this roundabout scheme in the light of safety not economics.",
