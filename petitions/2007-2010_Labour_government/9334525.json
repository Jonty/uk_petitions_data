The British Government has full knowledge of this plan but is nonetheless forging ahead with it, alongside \u201cEurocrats\u201d from Brussels.\n\nThe plan would see Great Britain divided into three regions: the \"Manche Region\" overseen by a non-elected regional assembly in France, the \"Atlantic Region\" again administered by a non-elected assembly in Portugal, and the \"North Sea Region\" governed from Denmark.\n\nPlease stop the British Government making a wholesale sell-off of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and stop a group of unelected European bureaucrats, whose obvious disdain for everything we Britons (especially the sacrifices made by our forefather) have fought for over the last century, becomes reality, and we are forced to subservience as were once other great nations in the none-too-distant past.",
