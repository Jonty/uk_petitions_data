            "background": "At the present time, the child maintenance is calculated on the gross pay of the non-resident parent. This does not account for the rent/mortgage and other bills, let alone any other children they may have with a new partner. This situation is making it impossible for these parents to move on from a broken relationship and has left them 'slaves' to ex-partners and the government. The resident parent often receives benefits and these are also not accounted for. We are asking the government to take into account the non-resident parents other financial commitments such as household bills and other children. At the present time this is not done and is leaving these parents struggling to keep themelves afloat whilst resident parents are often receiving benefits as well as maintenance. This is not a petition against child maintenence, only against the way it is calculated.",
