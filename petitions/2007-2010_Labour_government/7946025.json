            "background": "Too much traffic on the roads on Sundays. Instead of punishing people by banning or congestion charging why not close the doors of the large stores on a Sunday and if anyone wants something they can have it delivered instead. The cutting of CO2 emissions would be enormous. Not just from the amount of vehicles not being used by the public driving to supermarkets, etc. but from the stores themselves. They would not need to use so much energy by opening their stores. One day dedicated especially to deliveries only. The public are used to having goods delivered anyway so its nothing new and most people would be in to receive them on a Sunday. Sundays would be quieter which would benefit all, especially religious followers. \nIn fact, everybody wins, so sign up now!",
