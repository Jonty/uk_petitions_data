            "background": "By way of background, the Audi S4 (B5 model) comes equipped with 2 little \"K03\" turbos to assist with the vehicle's forward movement. These turbos pump their little hearts out as long as they can, but they don't last forever. The best known alternative is an upgrade to a \"K04\" turbo. These are much more reliable and kinder to the environment as they both reduce fuel consumption and last much longer.\nWe request the government to provide a grant of \u00a32,500 towards the cost of replacement of these fine turbos to all registered RS246.com Audi S4 owners.",
