        "background": "The British army has been in Afghanistan since 2001. Gordon Brown has announced an inquiry into the Iraq problem.\n\nIt is now time to set-up an urgent inquiry into our initial reasons for going into Afghanistan, our subsequent occupation, and how it is proposed that we can withdraw our soldiers as I do not consider that they can achieve any good.\n\nIf it is said that it is to protect our national interests, and security, then how can this be measured. Bombs have already exploded on the streets of London so that policy has manifestly failed.\n\nGordon Brown said that there would not be an inquiry into Iraq until all the troops were safely out of the country. If we are to believe that the British are to be in Afghanistan for a generation then surely we cannot wait until then to hold any inquiry.",
