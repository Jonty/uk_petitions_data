            "background": "The suggested closure of the Swanwick Memorial Hall in Old Whittington, Chesterfield will have a devastating blow to the local community.\n\nThe hall is the centre for the community and without it, many groups and organisations would be unable to join together and carry out activities as they presently do.  It is so prized by these people and the thought of closure horrifies the community.\n\nIf the hall did close, the Old Whittington Gala, which has been running for 21 years would have to end.  This would put an end to a day of community spirit which brings together the whole village and surrounding areas.  Thousands of pounds have been raised for charities within this time.\n\nIn addition, the local scout group would suffer with the closure as would many other groups including dancing, social events and local historian talks to mention just a few.",
