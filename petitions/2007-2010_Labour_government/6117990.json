        "background": "There are two basic forms of emergency vaccination strategy to control Foot and Mouth Disease. The \u2018vaccination-to-live\u2019 policy whereby the animals live out their normal economic lives and their meat is then eaten; or the \u2018vaccination-to-die\u2019 strategy whereby animals around an infected farm are vaccinated to reduce the spread of infection and are then killed.\nThe latter is quite unacceptable and we want to protect our animals now through a vaccination 'to live' policy",
