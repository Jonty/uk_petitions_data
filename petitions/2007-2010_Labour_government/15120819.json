            "background": "The Prime Minister wants to eradicate knife crime in the UK. PCSOs can play a big part in this, and make it a reality. PCSOs need to have the power of search, and at least carry handcuffs. Too much time is wasted waiting for a Police Officer to come and do a search when a suspect has been stopped. PCSOs badly need increased powers. The power of search is probably the one that would make the biggest difference.",
