        "background": "Maragret Thatcher is amongst the most reviled politicians of the 20th Century.  Far from being a unifying figure to whom we should look up to, she sponsored the break down of society, declaring society to be dead.  Her hatred of the working class is well known and her promotion of greed is not something we should give recognition to through a state funeral.",
