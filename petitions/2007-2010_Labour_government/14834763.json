            "background": "We ask you to  ban  all  revenue sharing on numbers, such as 087XXX and 084XXXX, whatever the demomination of the code.   Every phone bill today is inclusive of calls, many now offer the use of 0845 and 0870, but that still leaves 0844 and 0871, which surely proves the point that these numbers are not being used as just a national presence for companies but for revenue sharing at peoples expense and at a time the economy is dire need of people being able to balance their incomes to afford all of their outgoings. A complete ban on revenue sharing and the continued use of the numbers but at no expense to the caller.",
