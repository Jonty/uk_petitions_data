            "background": "In order to protect all marine life within UK waters I suggest that only sustainable methods of fishing are adopted that are selective to both the species that they catch and the size of the fish. Also that the method reduces the affect on other fish species, Crustaceans or Molluscs.\nHealthier sea beds hold more food and can sustain more life.\nBetter fishing practises can increase the quality of the fish to the consumer and give a better return to the commercial fisherman.\nSea Anglers benefit from more and bigger fish.",
