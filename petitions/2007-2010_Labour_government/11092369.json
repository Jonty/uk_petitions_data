            "background": "Great Britain joined the E.E.C with the idea of a free trade agreement between member countries. That has developed over the years, and now, people who have never set foot on this island are telling the British Parliament what to do,how and when to do it and telling us how much we must pay for the privilege. The British public hear and see so much about how Europe is good for us, and how bad it is for us, I ask that the same British public be asked what they think, and the Government to act accordingly when this public opinion is voiced, to get our country out of the financial and legal black hole that is the E.U. A European Trading Agreement would be a sensible idea, but Great Britain should be run by the British people through a British parliament.",
