            "background": "I believe that student loans owed by parents of special needs children - taken out before their child was born - should be written off or paid in full by the government. As looking after a special needs child is a full time job, and by looking after the child at home the parent saves the government thousands of pounds a year. Whilst the parents dedicate their lives to caring for their child their debt continues to increase. Even though the loans will be written off after 25 years or when they reach the age of 65, this means many many years of increasing interest payments and the threat of huge debt hanging over their heads.",
