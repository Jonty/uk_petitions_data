            "background": "Currently the interest on student loans is fixed for one year at a time, this means that this year it has been and remains far higher than the average rate of inflation. The consequence of this is that everyone with a student loan is unfairly having to pay back too much money due to the additional interest.\n\nA fairer system would be to use the average rate of interest each month then charge all student loan holders that rate a month in arrears.\n\nThis system while being fairer on students could potentially also ensures that no-one loses money in infaltion terms since any month the rate of interest on student loans could be adjusted to accomodate any change in interest.",
