            "background": "We have created this petition due to a family living in our West Wales locality who keep a young chocolate labrador dog in a permanent outside kennel with no room to run or play. This dog has little interaction, is shouted at regularly, not stimulated or played with and is bored to tears. What an awful life.\nWe believe there should be laws against this and better laws regarding the ownership of dogs. If people cannot treat their animals fairly then they should be punished and banned from ever keeping another dog.\nIt is not just the starving and beaten dogs who suffer. The plight of this dog and the many others like it should not be acceptable to anyone EVER.\n\nThank you",
