            "background": "Rather than arbitrary banding, fix each tax band boundary to a specific proportion or multiplier of the average annual salary for a full time worker.  Add in an extra band above the current super tax at a higher rate.   e.g. \u00a30 to half average salary tax free; half average salary plus 1 pence to twice average annual salary pay basic rate; twice average annual salary plus 1 pence to 4 times average annual salary pay super tax; 4 times average annual salary plus 1 pence and above pay super-super tax.  Also bonus and similar payments to be counted as part of salary for tax purposes, share options to be taxed as capital gains when exercised and the difference between super-super tax rate and super tax rate to be at least twice that between super and basic tax rates.",
