He is a polictian in the Greater Manchester area, together with help of some celebrity friends including Arthur Scargill he has found a charity to help young asian children and teenagers to intergrate into the community. The 'Oh Yeah Its Good Dat' foundation has made a positive impact on these young peoples lives. I think a plaque recognizing the good work done by Mr Choudhury would be fitting.",
