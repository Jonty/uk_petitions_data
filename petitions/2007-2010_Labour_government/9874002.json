            "background": "The NCT has a charitable status although it's activities do not really allow it to be a charity. Thier ante-natal classes are biased towards home birth and do not give out any real information that the NHS classes can offer - they constantly put down hospital births and c-sections. They also consistently bombard you with spam in order to buy products from them. In terms of what they help to provide in terms of improving childbirth, it seems very little apart from organising a social get together to raise funds for themselves and the results of the fund raising are not seen. This should be classed as a business and not a charity",
