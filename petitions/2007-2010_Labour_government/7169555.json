            "background": "The Leander Class Frigates served our country from the early sixties until the early nineties and was arguably the most successful and popular class of frigates in the Royal Navy, the class consisted of 26 ships. The last Leander class frigate to see service in the RN was HMS Scylla. But alas that has now gone. However there are still five of these ships in service in foreign navies, one of these, HMS Achilles was sold to Chile in 1990, re-named Ministro Zenteno and continued service until 2006. It now awaits scrapping. As these ships were the most successful and popular frigates in the RN, I would like to petition Parliament to re-possess one of these before it is too late. These ships are part of our military heritage and history.",
