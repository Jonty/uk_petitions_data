        "background": "I am an NQT and for over a year have been trying to secure a permanent teaching position. I have been a supply teacher since Jan '09 but can only do supply for 16 months until I complete my NQT year. Too may people are going into teacher training oblivious to how many jobs are actually available. Instead of advertising for more teachers, the government needs to think about supporting the thousands of unemployed teachers and NQTs who can not secure permanent jobs due to lack of positions.",
