        "background": "The Australian Government provides the most basic level of car insurance for all drivers on all cars, which allows companies to hire young employees for jobs which require driving a vehicle, whereas such young people would remain unemployed in the United Kingdom due to excessive insurance prices.\nNot only would this ease the cost of living for almost all British citizens, it would increase the employability of young people, and guarantee all drivers on the road the peace of mind which is not provided currently by the simple ability of people to drive cars illegally and uninsured.",
