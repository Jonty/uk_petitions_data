Also it is an inhumane way to kill them, it can take days to die and they suffer a lot. I personally take in many poisoned snails, many who are incurable, and one took two weeks to die, two weeks of suffering. I petition the prime minister to make in against the law to kill snails so inhumanely, and unessesarly use snail poison ( in gardens for instance ).",
