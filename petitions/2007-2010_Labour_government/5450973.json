A survey by Kwik Fit (that replaces a lot of the damage) has concluded that 1.1 million motorists damage tyres and wheels after hitting potholes each year.\n\nIt was already known that councils spend \u00a360,000,000 a year compensating motorists for pothole damage, yet only \u00a335,000,000 repairing potholes. why not just use this money properly and reapir the roads.",
