We all know that this is the first step in removing the four associations and creating one British team for all competitions.  The prime minister can remove his support for this proposal and effectively kill any chance of it happening.  It is opposed by the four associations and the three devolved parliaments as well as by the majority of the UK public, yet the PM continues to throw his support and influence behind the idea.",
