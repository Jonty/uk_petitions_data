            "background": "The carbon footprint is a political measure skilfully sold to us on the dubious premise that it will put a stop to global warming.\nQ.  Is there such a thing as global warming? \nA.  Well yes; after all we are just coming out of an ice age. \nQ.  Are our carbon emissions responsible for global warming? \nA.  Well the link has not been proven, and over 31,000 scientists have signed a petition refuting the case. In fact they state that carbon dioxide and methane emissions are actually beneficial to our environment. Besides, there are numerous other, much more robust, theories which account for the cyclic temperature changes of our planet.\nUntil it is proven beyond doubt, by scientists who won\u2019t lose their government sponsorships if they come up with the wrong \u2018political\u2019 conclusions, global warming should be looked on as just another excuse for the government to part us from our hard earned cash.",
