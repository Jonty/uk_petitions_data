            "background": "Where communities are strong and cohesive, crime and fear of crime is lessened. More needs to be done to address the underling causes of knife crime and boost communities. \nThis could be achieved by the setting up of local community champions within the existing framework of local participation.\nWorking alongside judicial reform which makes carrying concealed weapons an offence which carries a mandatory prison sentence would go a long way to promoting public confidence.",
