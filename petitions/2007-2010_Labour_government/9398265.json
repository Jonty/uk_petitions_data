        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As the Prime Minister is in no doubt as to the dissatisfaction by the public into what frequently appears as quite arbitrary qualifications for recipients of various forms of benefit for the low paid and pensioners. May I suggest the the new Local Housing Allowance is a prime case in point. This new way of helping people to obtain a decent home is definitely an improvement, but once again a problem has arisen in that those who are in receipt currently of Housing benefit are being penalised by up to almost \u00a3100 per month, dependant on the Civic Authority in which they live. Many are having to use other benefits, such as disability allowance and pension credit to balance their rent demands and thereby increasing their vulnerability. I would suggest that all current Housing benefit recipients together with all new applicants should receive the same, new and improved amount.",
