            "background": "All parents who are on low income or struggle financially (for whatever reason) should not have to pay a fine if they need to take their child or children out of school for a family holiday during termtime. It is unfair to poor families, single parents & families who struggle on one wage. Travel agents, caravan sites, airlines & other holiday establishments all charge more expense during school holiday times which poor families cant afford. Please put a stop to schools charging fines for this!",
