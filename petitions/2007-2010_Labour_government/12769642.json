The Prime Minister should recognise that the June 09 European elections were a disaster for Labour and reflect the disatisfaction of the electorate with our membership of the EU and related government policy. The Prime Minister should respect public opinion, abide by Labour's election promises and hold an immediate referendum or call a general election.",
