            "background": "We are in the midst of a financial crisis that the country has not seen for several years. The banks have created this problem themselves by lending to those who perhaps they shouldn't have and those in charge of the banks have still been drawing their huge salaries and bonuses. Most highstreet banks now are reluctant to lend, therefore fueling the downturn even more. The people of this country have (via Government spending) effectively bailed them out with billions of pounds. Surely, it wouldn't be too unreasonable to expect a part nationalised institutions to lend to those who helped save it from almost certain collaspe. Conditions should have been attached the 'bailout' enabling charges to be brought against banks who are not continuing to lend.( However,see fit to issue their staff with bonuses paid with taxpayers money! When the real bonus is that they still have jobs!...Sound familiar Northern Rock?)",
