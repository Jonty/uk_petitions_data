In fact, if young people have cash coming in, then their burden is more likely to be eased. Please facilitate moves against discrimination against pregnant working women - which IS still occuring (believe it or not !) as part of your family - friendly manifesto. Why cannot I not put A4E/ Royal College of midwives booklets on maternity rights in a UK job centre for mums ? Reproductive health rights include adolescents and working mums - shall the Blair babes burn a few bars (oops I mean bras) ? The petitioner is calling on the PM to endorse Mums plus one and go over backwards public managers' heads for first time mums who don't know their rights.",
