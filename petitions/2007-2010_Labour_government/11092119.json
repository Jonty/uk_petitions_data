Members of Parliament, the house of lords and all those that work in Parliament should be the first to demonstrate their commitment to this technology. The current parliamentary security systems could be greatly improved if access was authenticated using the ID card scheme and biometrics.\nWe cannot risk the most important figures in the country due to terrorism or identity theft. This action would also demonstrate the faith the government has in the technology and provide them with concrete examples of the benefits to silence the sceptics.",
