Callers were recorded asking petty and frivolous questions where no emergency exists such as the way to HomeBase and the date etc. This is blatant abuse of the service and a disgrace in our society.\n\nWe believe the above are indeed hoax callers and they should be prosecuted to discourage this type of behaviour.",
