Last week, Gordon Brown announced that cancer patients in England would receive free prescriptions from next year, while those with incurable longterm conditions will get them free at some unspecified time in the future.But many people just can't afford to pay for prescription medication and fall out of the bracket to get help.If you would like to see Free Prescriptions for England sign this petition.Why should England be singled out.",
