            "background": "Every UK citizen must wonder what protection is provided by the Government's extradition agreement with the USA. It appears that people who are ill can be extradited. It also appears that a UK citizen can be extradited for what may be a minor matter in the UK to face far more serious penalties in the USA. It seems that the Home Secretary, while he does not have discretion in the Gary McKinnon case, when he was a union official, he would not have tolerated such treatment of one of his union members and would have fought to overturn the extradition ruling.",
