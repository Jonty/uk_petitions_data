Cats however are allowed to roam free and foul many gardens creating a considerable health risk.\n\nI propose a fine system similar to that for dog owners if a particular cat can be proven to be fouling your property.\n\nI would not get away with bringing a dog to your garden every night for its business so why should a cat owner?",
