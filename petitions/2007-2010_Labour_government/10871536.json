        "background": "The country's productivity is reduced by people having to miss work to see their GP.  If it were easier to see GPs during the evenings and weekends patients need not miss work, or risk their health by putting off appointments.  Further, if GP more surgeries were open longer during evenings and weekends people with non-urgent medical conditions would be less tempted to wastefully dial 999.\n\nIf the response is that this is not viable we the undersigned would like to receive detailed justification for the policy, including costings and other relevant statistics.",
