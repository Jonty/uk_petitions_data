            "background": "Many small businesses suffer as a result of not being paid for products and services, in particular social enterprise which government promotes. In spite of their own Pay on Time campaign, government  departments are inclined to be among the worst with regard to paying their bills. For a social business, particularly those involved in international outreach, this not only stifles local employment, it cause harm to the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. For a government proselytising social purpose and increased aid to the developing world, it is both hypocritical and dishonest.   \n\nWe request that the government takes stronger action against late payment in the provision of arbitration where payment is delayed more than 90 days.",
