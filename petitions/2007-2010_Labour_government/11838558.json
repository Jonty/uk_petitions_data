This club has 100 children attend weekly and is run entirely by volunteers with the attitude of providing gymnastics to all in this rural community.  In the ever increasing cases of obese children and teenage pregancy closing this venue down is inappropriate to say the least.  Please show your support that WWGC should be allowed to stay where it is and keep all our children in a happy and safe environment instead of on the streets!",
