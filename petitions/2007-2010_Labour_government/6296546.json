            "background": "I recently visited a local farm that has legally produced its own milk, cream and yoghurt for sale at its farm and to local producers for years.\nWhen getting there I was told he was unable to sell me any, as the EU have changed the standards, and so products that were fine to sell days ago and have been for years are now no longer fine.\nThis is complete madness, it is no surprise that our own farmers are struggling to survive, due to the extra costs associated with implementing these new standards. No other EU country seems to stick to any of these absurd rules and they never seem to be held by these rules.",
