        "background": "The CRB vets applications for people wanting to work with children and vulnerable people. Many roles require a CRB check before employment can begin and while this is essential, there is currently excessive delay in obtaining a CRB. Their website states that 100% of CRB checks MUST be issued within 60 days however this target is not being met. Only 65% of CRBs processed by the Met Police are processed in 60 days. Delays in obtaining CRB clearance are affecting vital services. For example: A qualified nurse employed in Sep 2008 still awaits a CRB clearance and therefore cannot work. A clinic research project funded by 2 government bodies is on hold awaiting CRB clearance for a member of staff whose application is beyond the promised turnaround of 60 days. The excessive delay in obtaining CRB clearance is affecting the provision of public services and government funded research projects. The poor service provided by the CRB office and the police must be addressed to resolve this issue.",
