            "background": "So Jeremy Godwin wants to reopen Greenham Common as an airfield.  Don't be so stupid!  The common has been returned to it's natural habitat, with lots of wild flowers, birds, insects.  People go walking on the common to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life.  You can still see the relics of the cold war - like the silos and the fire-plane.  If you want to see real airplanes - you have Fairford up the road and Farnborough down the M3 - each have their own fantastic airshows every year / 2 years.",
