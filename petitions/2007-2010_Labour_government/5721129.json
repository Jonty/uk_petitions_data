        "action": "Remove the power of local authorities to enforce their own parking ticket and apppeal process.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "To enable people who have received a parking ticket and dispute it - to have an independent body to appeal to and not the company issuing the tickets. To have an option if still in dispute to go to arbitration BEFORE it procedes to the County Court for enforcement of debt collection whereby a \u00a330 disputed and unpaid fine can escalate to over \u00a3350 when bailiffs come to collect the fine, clamp or impound your car - without the 'debtor' having the opportunity to defend him/herself in the County Court process.\nThis will enable 'ticket victims' the democratic right we aim to uphold in this country and be allowed to use the 'innocent till proven guilty' term in Civil Courts under  the de-criminalising of the Parking Ticket Law Fiasco that now is in place.",
