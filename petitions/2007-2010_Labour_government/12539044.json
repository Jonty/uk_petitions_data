            "background": "i propose thus.\n\nto tax a percentage of a companys net profit.\n\nok here is how it works, the government gives a series of tax bands in relation to how much profit each company is generating (regardless of the companys total worth). an example is calculated as thus. an imaginary company generates \u00a310,000 profit per quarter, so a tax tier is associated with how much profit the company generates. so it gets taxed e.g 5% of its net profits (so 5% of \u00a310,000 is \u00a3500) this in turn will 'regulate' the amount of profits a company can generate. the benefits of this are that companies will still have monies to operate and manage their companies with, and will still generate profits but at a capped rate. this as i see it is an untapped resource for the government and will generate huge amounts of revenue but at a cost, emergency company benefits would have to be a side clause to prevent companies that are doing well from falling into a pit of economic depression. imagine this as a 'safety buffer' for our country's businesses, which these benefits will again 'regulate' and 'smooth out' our failing economy.",
