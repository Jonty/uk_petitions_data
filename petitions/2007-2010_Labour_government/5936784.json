        "background": "we lost our little boy at 22 weeks gestation due to cervical incompetance. we found this out when i got pregnant for the second time due to having cervical scans done every fortnight. i had to have a cervical suture put in to keep my cervix closed. if only i had been tested for cervical incompetance when i was pregnant with my little boy then we probably wouldnt have had to go through the pain of losing our precious baby. i hope this petition will give every women the chance to be tested continually untill 25 weeks of pregnancy to prevent this happening to anyone else.",
