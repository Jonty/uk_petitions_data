        "background": "The present Official Secrets Act puts a gag on civil servants and contractors who may be aware of cases where the public is being misled.  This enables inter alia, government ministers and interested parties, possibly unintentionally, to give incorrect information and half truths without fear of contradiction.  This act has been used by certain members of parliament to hoodwink the public and a change is needed to show a willingness by parliament to be open.  Obviously in cases of real national importance such as defence matters some censure is required but at present the law needlessly covers everything including the use of office stationary.  A benefit would be that junior officials at the bottom of the pyramid would be freely able to criticise the operation of new or existing legislation making it easier to spot flaws and remedy them.",
