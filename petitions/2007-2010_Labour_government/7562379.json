            "background": "The procedures for serving a Statutory Demand, as the Insolvency Service has acknowledged, is often used by Debt Collection Agencies as a means of forcing alleged debtors to pay debts which the debtor is often in no financial position to pay. The current system allows such agencies to bypass the need to prove the debt in the County Court, where the terms of the agreement and the debtors means can be properly scrutinised, and to impose a threat of pending bankruptcy against an alleged debtor. The current procedure also places an unfair obligation on any debtor who disputes such a demand or cannot pay it by requiring him to make an application to the Court to set-aside the Statutory Demand. An increase in the threshold upon the terms described above is therefore called for.",
