Whatever the election \"result\" there is no way the existing regime would have any remaining legitimacy. Desmond Tutu has spoken of the possibility of an \"indictment before the International Criminal Court due to the grave human rights violations\" in the name of ZANU and Mugabe.\n\nThousands more will doubtless join the UN petition. What more should it take? Will the Prime Minister join them by responding to this one?",
