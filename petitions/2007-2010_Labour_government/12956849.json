            "background": "The Faster Payments service has been running for 12+ months now and it appears some banks are still not subscribed to it. Further, those that are, often impose miniscule daily limits on payments/transfers out, in some cases as little as \u00a310. Alliance & Leicester, now part of Santander impose a daily limit of just \u00a3250 currently. I want the UK government to look at this siuation with a view to requiring all banks to offer a uniform service now. I would also like to see each institution publishing the details of its daily limits for Faster Payments on its respective website clearly.",
