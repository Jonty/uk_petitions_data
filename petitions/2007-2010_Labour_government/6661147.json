            "background": "Glasgow passport office refuses to give me(I'm canadian)a british passport based on the mother's side of the family (my mother was born and brought up in Glasgow),they say they only give british passports based on the father's side of the family (father born in Canada, but grandfather born in England UK in the 1800's and I don't have a clue to the exact date, but apparently they'd give me a british passport if I provide his birth certificate!). I've lived here 25 years.\nAlso if a foreign woman marries a british man before 1983, she can have a british passport.. I married a year too late for that.  However, if it's the other way round and a foreign man marries a british woman before 83, he does NOT get to have a british passport.\nTherefore it seems BRITISH WOMEN DON'T COUNT and are in no way equal in these matters.\nI would like to ask the government to review these issues. As I don't think it's fair for me or anyone else in my situation. I'm entitled to a british passport, I want a british passport and I really don't want to come up against a rude immigration lady at Glasgow Airport again because of the mess I'm finding myself in over all this!  Please sign my petition and help me get a british passport.",
