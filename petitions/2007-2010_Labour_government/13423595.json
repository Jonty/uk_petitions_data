            "background": "There has been much in the news about the music industry and 'stars' calling for either restricted bandwidth for file sharers or even the removal of internet access (removal of a human right according to Gordon Brown's view on internet access...see arguement for phone tax). No industry should have such a power on another. Does the speed camera industry have the ablility to prevent a person buying a high performance car? NHS to stop people buying high fat foods. Just because a broad brush approach can be used to protect revenue for a business does not make it justified",
