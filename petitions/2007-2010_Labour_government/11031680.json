            "background": "Recently we have had several high profile campaigns by the media to essentially witch-hunt celebrities who work at the BBC. \n\nIn the last week Chris Mole has decided to push for the sacking of Jeremy Clarkson for nothing more than a tongue-in-cheek joke during Top Gear.  This joke got around 200 complaints, and considering the size of the Top Gear viewing figures I don't see this as a high enough percentage of complaints to warrant MP involvement and wasting of tax payers money.  \n\nPlease ask all MP's to kindly stop wasting tax payers money, and just help govern the country.  MP's should not be abusing their position in this way, at a time of economic crisis and war I would assume MP's have more pressing matters to attend to.  \n\nIf this petition gathers more signatures than complaints made about Clarkson to ofcom about the joke, can we the people, call for the sacking of MP's who try to make a name for themselves by instigating witch-hunts on celebrities they don't like.",
