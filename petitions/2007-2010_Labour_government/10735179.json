        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Though addressed in a past petition in which FAC members wanted their sport back, I believe that this needs further attention.\nThe reason for the ban of handguns, according to the government response is the killings at Dunblane Primary School, however, allowing a murderer to ruin a sport for thousands of safe, tax paying people is appalling, as well as it jepordizing the safety of many more. It's no secret that the use of guns by gangs these days is taking its toll, and many people like me believe, if not have the Right, to be able to come home from working all day,earning the money to pay the huge amount that we're taxed, and feel safe in our own homes, able to protect the lives of ourselves and our families, legally and safely.",
