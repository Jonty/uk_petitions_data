            "background": "I am proposing that cannabis cultivation be decriminalised, not legalised. People should be able to grow a plant or 2 for personal use in their own home as long as they do not sell it. The many millions of cannabis smokers in the uk are forced to go out and buy cannabis from undesirable people who make lots of money on the black-market, these people sell allsorts of drugs and should not be profiting from doing so. If we could grow a small amount for ourselves, who would buy it from the black-market? The answer is, probably not many.. Do your bit, sign the petition!!",
