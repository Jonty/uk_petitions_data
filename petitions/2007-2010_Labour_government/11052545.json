It did not seem to matter to her that a baby had died, and that there were more than 50 injuries to the babies body. She thinks this is okay, and that this was best practice. Presumably meaning that it does not really matter if it happens again, after all they have followed good practice, and can not see any fault even though a baby has died again!! To make to worse, seeing as she does not see anything wrong with the situation, she has not resigned or sacked anybody!",
