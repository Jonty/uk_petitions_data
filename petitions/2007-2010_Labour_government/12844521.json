I went to a gym, and had a hand held B.M.I machine, which calculated my B.M.I to be a lot less than the doctor said, making me just overweight, not obese.  I think this is dangerous, as people could get told they are obese, when they are obviously not, thus causing them more problems than it should - ie anorexia.",
