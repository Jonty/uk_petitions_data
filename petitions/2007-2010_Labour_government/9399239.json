This makes a lot of young people hang about street corners etc. This makes them an easy target for peadophiles etc. Allowing these young drinkers into pubs clubs... would enable them to be monitored and not cause disruption in public parks or residential schemes. this would also curb scotland / uk gang culture of drinking then gang wars.\n\n          lower the age limit",
