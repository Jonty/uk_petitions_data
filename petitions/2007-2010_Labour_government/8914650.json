            "background": "Betfair have introduced a new robot where Betfair punters are no longer betting against each other, they are betting against Betfair.  Until this was introduced on February 18th 2008, if you submitted a bet at the wrong price, Betfair users got the chance to cancel often most of the bet they placed in error.  Betfair however are themselves betting with a zero second delay, and profiting risk free from their own user errors.  \n\nThis is a petition for Betfair to give the risk free profit they make from their trap bot from Betfair customers who enter a bet at the wrong odds in error, back to the victims.  \n\nIt is wrong for a betting exchange to scalp risk free huge sums of money from users who have placed a bet in error, and all money scalped by Betfair in these circumstances should be refunded to the victim.",
