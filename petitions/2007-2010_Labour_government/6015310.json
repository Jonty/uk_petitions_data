Sure we have some good entertainment channels, but we don't have many specific \"education\" channels - there is only 1 on Freeview and that's UKTV History. The government need to implement channels like the Discovery Channel and National Geographic onto these free TV platforms, as something needs to be done about the poor state of free TV we have these days! I mean, we have no virtually no nature or learning channels, but we can watch Big Brother for 12hrs plus of the day?!?! Ridiculous!",
