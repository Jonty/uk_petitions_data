            "background": "At the junctions where both Mauldeth Road and Wilbraham Road meet Princess Road it is very difficult to cross to the other side of the road without getting killed. there are no pedestrian crossings to make it easier to cross and crossing is only possible as the lights are changing. you therefore have to be very quick to get across the road. I cross both these junctions on a regular basis and sometimes feel like I am risking my life just to go to college. it is particularly important we get pedestrian crossings at these points as there are at leaast 3 schools within 100 feet, Whalley Range girls school, St Kentigerns Primary and William Hulme Grammar. I find it very odd that there is not one there already with so many children crossing everyday. it is a hazard that needs to be corrected as I was recently hit by a car on Mauldeth Road due to the problem.",
