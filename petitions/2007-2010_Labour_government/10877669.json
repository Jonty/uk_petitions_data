There are many non-profit groups that centre around an old piece of software but are unable to legally distribute fixes to this software.\n\nGetting an assessment of the monetary value of any IP from the treasury costs over a thousand pounds in various legal fees. It is impossible for a non-profit group of volunteer programmers to waste such money finding out the worth of the IP from the treasury when they already know its value is nothing, yet alone actually purchase it for release into the public domain.\n\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to release all software IP of no value from the Treasury into the public domain so that the public can legally redistribute changes to the old software, keep it working and keep it secure.",
