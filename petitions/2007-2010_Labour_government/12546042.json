            "background": "Darren Fletcher is the victim of a miscarriage of justice for which there is no appeal.  UEFA rules state that, in the Champions League, there is no appeal against a referee's decision. This despite the fact that such decisions could adversely affect a player's career and thereby his livelihood.  There should be a right of appeal just as there is in domestic football.",
