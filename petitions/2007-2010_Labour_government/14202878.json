        "background": "As the national public service broadcaster, the BBC has a role to educate, inform and entertain. It could easily be percieved by viewers, readers and listeners of the BBC in Scotland that coverage of the activities of the Scottish Parliament and the political process in Scotland has been less than fair and in some cases directly antipathetic towards certain individuals and parties. \n\nWe petition the Prime Minister of the day of the United Kingdom to set up a commission independent of the BBC to examine the activities of BBC Scotland. The remit of this commission would be  to determine whether or not there has been any overt or covert institutional policy of bias in the reporting of Scottish Politics and Scottish Political Events and to outline any measures that can be taken either to remedy this or to reassure the Scottish Public that the national broadcaster retains the highest standards of impartiality.",
