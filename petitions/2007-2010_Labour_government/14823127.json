        "background": "The plans for this area take no account of the previously expressed views of the residents of the area, the elected authorities in Leighton Buzzard, Beds or Bucks, yet against this the developer \u2013 Paul Newman Homes \u2013 appears determined to try and use its financial muscle to push through these plans, using Central Government powers against those of the locally elected officials and residents of the area. At best the residents of the area will see increased traffic, increased risk of accidents due to a blindingly na\u00efve approach to road planning, increased pressure on the railways, the destruction of more green field land and the wholesale reduction in the quality of life of all residents.",
