            "background": "6,000 babies a month are aborted in the UK,thats 72,000 new lives a year! The limit on abortion now is upto 23weeks,at this stage its not a fetus,its a baby with fingers and toes,makes facial expressions and responds to sound and touch.A lot of babies are born at 24weeks in the uk now and it doesnt make sense having an abortion at 23weeks taking place in one ward and on another they are trying to save the life of another at 24weeks! Hundreds of couples cant concieve in the UK and people need to stop treating abortion like its an ordinary thing to do.It should only be allowed to women in EXTREME cases.I would really like the time limit to be reduced! Please sign!!",
