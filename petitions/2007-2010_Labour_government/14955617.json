        "background": "BT have been pushing \"Next Generation Broadband\" for a substantial time now and charging accordingly. Unfortunately what they dont tell you is: if the line coming into your premises is copper (chances are it is) these cables have to much noise and interference on them which will make the Broadband speed drop substantially, and if you dont live near the exchange your Broadband speed will be virtually non existent.\n\nWe request that the Government insits that BT substantially and heavily invest in bringing all its Copper Lines up to date with Fibre Optic Cables, starting with the people furthest from the exchanges",
