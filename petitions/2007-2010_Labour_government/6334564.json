            "background": "A recent article (30/8/2007) by Boris Johnson in the Daily Telegraph highlighted the legal disqualifications that members of the public face if they confront anti-social behaviour. As it stands,  an adult is in greater danger of being arrested for trying to apprehend an anti-social youth than that youth for being rude, abusive, and violent, both to people and property. This system is not ideal, as has been highlighted by recent concerns in the media and more generally about increasing social tensions within Britain: something must be done.",
