These people are honourable and gentle, and very polite people, not scavengers who want to just take, and take from Britain's welfare systems. We should show respect and give thanks to the Gurkhas for the work they have done, not send them back to ridicule and to lose face in the land they are forced to return to. When the contracts were signed no one knew what the future held and how diligently these great men would assist this country. Let us show compassion and allow them to stay here to live out their lives in peace and security with the pesion they have earned.",
