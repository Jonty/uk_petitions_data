            "background": "Baby P was allowed to die despite 60 visits from Haringey Social Services. \nThis is completely unacceptable, and is a national disgrace.\n\nALL the social workers involved in the case of Baby P, including Sharon Shoesmith, Maria Ward and Gillie Christou should be sacked - and never allowed to work with children again.\n\nI feel that Beverley Hughes, the Children's Minister, and Ed Balls, the Education Secretary, should ensure that those responsible are removed from their positions with immediate effect.\n\nI also demand that the doctor and health visitor involved with Baby P, Dr Sabah Al-Zayyat and Paulette Thomas, should also lose their jobs. \n\nI call on the General Medical Council to ensure that this happens.",
