Many of the accidents involving lorries are due to the so called 'blind spots' and with drivers rushing to catch ferries/shuttles. On a daily basis the car drivers' safety is jeopardised. It has become progressively worse since the extension of the EU with an increase in such traffic on our motorways, particulary in east Kent.",
