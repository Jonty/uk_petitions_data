        "background": "We would like it to be compulsory for foreign lorries to use the special lenses (FREZNELL) offered free to each lorry driver at every point of entry to the UK from VOSA (Vehicle and Operator Services Agency). Many of the accidents involving lorries are due to the so called 'blind spots' and with drivers rushing to catch ferries/shuttles. On a daily basis the car drivers' safety is jeopardised. It has become progressively worse since the extension of the EU with an increase in such traffic on our motorways, particulary in east Kent.",
