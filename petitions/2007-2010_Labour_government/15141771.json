But unlike for adult workers, who have aminimum wage of \u00a35.80 per hour, there is no minimum wage for under 16s, and only \u00a33.57 per hour minimum wage for 16-18 year olds. By signing this, you are challenging this unfair discrimination against young people. If a young person works just as hard at the same job, he should get the exactly same pay rate as an adult.",
