            "background": "We all know that the poorest in our society have got these pre-payment meters installed and are forced to pay more for the same electric and gas as those who dont have them. this is a gross discrimination and forces the poor into more poverty. This must end. We should all pay the same for the same items. Those on pre-payment meters have the added (personal) expence of having to go out and get to a shop that sells this item to them, therefore they should have to pay less than those who use the internet or other means, or they should be able to claim back their expenses from the companies or government.",
