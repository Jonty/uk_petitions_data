            "background": "Too many do gooders believe that the wrong people deserve more rights to do as they please and not care for their actions or responisbilites. Political Correctness gone INSANE. Does anyone have any commonsense within our government and infrastructure. Does anybody care about our way of life, which is supposed to be safe, reliable and sustainable. When there are people who make decisions who really dont live in the real world. Criminals believe they have human rights. Rapists and other horrible people believe they have human rights. Terrorists and people who wish to bring madness and mayhem to OUR country, THEY ALSO BELIEVE THEY HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS. Stand up for yourselves. Let the government hear you. Tell them your not taking it anymore and that you want a country worth being proud of.",
