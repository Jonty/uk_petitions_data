            "background": "Nut allergy is now a severe issue in the UK, (more than 1/10) and while Supermarkets and Food outlets are now required to correctly label food, Restaurants/Cafes and Take Aways are not subject to the same laws.  This need to be remedied as soon as possible to protect allergy sufferers from potentially lethal allergic reactions.  Outlets who do not provide information pertaining to the ingredients they use are reckless and dangerous.  All I ask is that all nut allergy sufferers be given the information to make a choice as to where we eat out, and to avoid the gamble that we currently face.",
