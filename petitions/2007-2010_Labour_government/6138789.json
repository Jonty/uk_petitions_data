Royal Mail create these with no care to the local people as they have no representative in Northern Ireland.  \n\nPost codes would be better under the guidance of local government and a complete reallocation in order to have one post code per road instead of the ROyal Mail many post codes per road.  Royal Mail have also altered the traditional county boundaries such as half of County Armagh now in the postal County of Down to suit the Newry depot for Royal Mail.  Townland sshoudl also be used in all postal correspondance to keep the integrity of our historical addresses.\n\nI would like to see the Government grant the power for post codes to local Government, a body representative of the people of Northern Ireland and for a review to take place of the current system and useage.",
