            "background": "The town of Todmorden, Yorkshire has successfully in recent years started planting fruit and vegetable plants that can be planted and harvested by anyone in the area. This makes good food accessable and affordable to all. \n\nWith the council's full backing, residents can plant crops anywhere, from parks, to cemeteries, and outside the local fire station. This idea is so simple and has so many advantages from education and cheaper food, to improving mood and health, it seems only logical that this should be implemented in as many local council areas as possible, with the aim of making it a nationwide scheme.",
