        "background": "Southampton University research proves a clear link with hyperactive behaviour in children. It warns of the bad effects from these artificial extras commonly added to our drinks/sweets/processed foods.\n\nBy not forcing manufacturers to remove them, the FSA fails to protect children & all consumers. Burden has been landed on parents told to read every ingredients label. The additives are harmful. We ask the Prime Minister to catch up with countries that have already recognised this & order their removal.\n\nNatural alternatives can replace synthetic additives. M&S has removed artificial colour & flavour from 99% of products e.g. jelly beans coloured by fruit pur\u00e9es. Let this example be the majority not minority.\n\nHyperactivity, loss of concentration, even cancer links (sodium benzoate-commonly found in many items is cited as forming cancer-causing benzene when interacting with acids such as added Vit C) - worrying concerns raised by the Southampton study & other reports. \n\nLet it end here.",
