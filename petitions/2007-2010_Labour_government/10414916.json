Allowing motorcycles to use bus lanes which has been shown to have no negative effect for safety in London. Other cities have had trials which prove this is a benefit to all users on the road. I and other Motorcyclists voted for the Mayor to follow his commitment in the transport manifesto to open the capital\u2019s bus lanes. I / We now demand he renew that commitment by immediately stating the date by which we should expect access to all bus lanes under his control.",
