        "background": "tens of thousands of fathers, with the same parental responsibilities and rights as mothers in the uk are denied access to their children for no good reason.  often this is because of a dispute between the parents and has nothing to do with the children and the mother is using the child as a weapon to cause distress and harm to the father.  it is not within the  interests of the children and causes untold distress, heartache and stress.  however mothers get away with this time and time again and it is not right.  fathers should be able to see their children without going through a lenghty, expensive, court process which ultimately the mother can just pay lip service to anyway without punishment. imagine if you were prevented from knowing if your kids were crawling yet or had said their first word and are being alienated from you and forgetting who you are.  imagine if the first you saw of your child in time was a photo by chance.  families need fathers, children need their dad's and dad's need their kids.  something has to be done and put in place because it is simply soul destroying and not right.",
