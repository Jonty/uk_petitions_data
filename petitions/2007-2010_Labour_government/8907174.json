            "background": "The current \u00a38 per day congestion charge was aimed at reducing traffic and pollution in London. \nTraffic is just the same as it always was, this has made no difference whatsoever.\nThe proposed \u00a325 charge will also not reduce traffic as people will want and or need there cars in London. This is just another tax on people who have sporty and or upmarket cars.\n\u00a325 per day \n\u00a3125 per week \n\u00a36500 per year\nAdd 40% tax, \u00a39100 cost to the motorist per annum. \nPlease support my petition even if you are not a motorist, this (Ken Livingston) needs to be stopped.",
