        "background": "The government is rightly taking action in a number of ways to tackle the current financial crisis.  One measure which would have immediate benefit has not been mentioned, and that is to intervene and ensure the Bank of England carry out a minimum 0.5% base rate cut.  Whilst it is appreciated that the BoE is meant to be independent, it is clear that it's one narrow remit of inflation without consideration to economic stability, is hurting the UK households and businesses alike.  Inflation will bring itself under control as a result of economic slowdown, the BoE is powerless in the face of global inflationary forces, therefore it's prime remit should now be to ensure the economic stablity and well-being whilst keeping an eye on long term inflationary forces.  At the moment the MPC is too focused on short term inflation figures.",
