            "background": "Many foreign companies now own our gas,water,electric & coal industries.For too many years,prices have gone up and hardly ever come down and we the British public are being held to ransom over excessive charges creating huge company profits,and paying huge corporate salaries in fixed priced cartels which cannot now be justified.At least 30,000 people die each year from hypothermia because they cannot afford to pay their bills.Even more will die as a direct result of the new price hikes of 27%.Those who cannot afford their bills are hounded for payments through the Courts.Enough is enough and I demand immediate public ownership of our essential services and substantial cuts of 50% to our current bills.The worlds resources should be there for everyone at a fair price and should be controlled by the UK Government and not by a few greedy firms and individuals such as they are now.Thank you.",
