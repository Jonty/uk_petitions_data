            "background": "Just this week, three teenagers were jailed for life for the murder of father-of-three Garry Newlove, who was kicked \"like a football\" after he confronted them about vandalism outside his Cheshire home. Also this week, firefighters in the UK called for more protection from the daily threat of being ambushed, shot at, stabbed and abused, more often than not by youngsters. The list of vicious crimes allegedly carried out by youngsters in the last 15 years makes grim reading and includes high profile cases such as the killing of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed in London,  and the murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones, who was shot in Liverpool.\n\nThe British government needs to do something about this otherwise it will get worse and worse. Teenage crime in the UK is nearly at its worst. We have kids assaulting the fire brigade!",
