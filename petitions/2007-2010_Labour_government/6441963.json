They were sent to 1 institution and basically fed, clothed and washed, and nothing else, all day they would sit and rock because they were developing very big mental problems inside this \"care home\"from 75 children about 5 a year were dying. They were malnourished the same like African children. There is no 1 to help them, most of them can\u2019t talk, NO HELP AT ALL. In EU this shouldn't happen, its easy to read this, but to watch the program will be an experience you cannot forget. I urge that this program is republished so people can see these horrible conditions. This program is probably the worst thing i have seen in all my life. The Bulgarian government say all is ok but they need to be pushed to give even basic care, ANIMALS ARE TREAT MUCH BETTER than these children, if they were looked after by the RSPCA they\u2019d be in a better condition.\nThese children do NOT need to die but they are",
