            "background": "Few, if any, can claim to have shaped the minds of a generation in the way that Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate could through their pioneering children's TV programmes.  Through characters like Noggin the Nog, The Pogles, The Clangers, Bagpuss and Ivor the Engine they brought untold joy to millions.  They also taught the value of friendship and fairness, the need to right wrongs and the power of love.  They didn't just make the world a better place, for their young viewers they offered a door into worlds that were better places and in doing so added magic to millions of childhoods.  We the undersigned would like their work to be suitably recognised with an appropriate monument - whether it be a statue of an academy of children's television, or both.",
