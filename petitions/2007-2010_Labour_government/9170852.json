            "background": "Homeopathic is at best described as alternative medicine. It is however 18th Century quackery based on the spurious claim that heavily diluted chemicals can cure some afflictions. If this were true, then modern chemistry would have to be completely reworked. Homeopathy is no more acceptable as science than blood-letting.\n\nThere are five NHS homeopathic hospitals in the UK. They are located in Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Tunbridge Wells, Kent.\n\nWith many NHS trusts and hospitals under threat of budget cuts and closure, it is imperative now more than ever that more money be invested into mainstream medicine. Homeopathy defies accepted science and has yet to be proven rigourously to be effective.",
