There is no real reason not to allow\n    owners or managers to decide for themselves what is required by\n    their own customers.  I am sick of being treated like a pariah\n    when I want a smoke while out for a drink and have not stayed\n    in an hotel since the ban.  Tobacco sales are still legal in\n    this country and I would suggest the Exchequer would not like\n    to lose our tax from same.  We are not asking to go back to the\n    50's and 60's but to be included in this society.",
