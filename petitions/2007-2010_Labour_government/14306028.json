            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I want either the Prime Minister or the government to stop giving lone parents who are students a hard time by taking money of them due to the money they have coming in from student loans. Iam a student plus a lone parent who is getting a penatly for learning by getting a certain amount of money deducted each week from my income support because of getting a student loan. There is certain things that cant be took into consderation such as parent learning allowance,childcare grant and support grant. The reason ive gone back to education is too better myself and to get a good job in order to support myself and my daugther in later life but at the min it is diffcult to do because i get a certin amount of money took off my income support and therefore i think that lone parent students should be supported more from the government by not taking money out of their income support while learning because their are people on income support with full 8,000 savings and still get the full amount of income whilst i dont because of my loan to study with also that I will have to pay back my loan once i get a job after completing my studies",
