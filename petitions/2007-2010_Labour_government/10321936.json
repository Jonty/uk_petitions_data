However, they have a major difference in ability.\nThe university classifications need to be re-assessed. \nThis would ensure hardworking students receive the recognition they deserve. Is it really fair that students who gain A\u2019s and B\u2019s end up with the same classification as those gaining B\u2019s and C\u2019s?",
