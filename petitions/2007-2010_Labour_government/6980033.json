Almost every one of the 25,000 who died today depended on failed agricultural sales for the livelihood they lost.  \nYou may do nothing but if you admit this truth to yourself you will at least be operating in reality.  Lie to others, if you must but, no matter what the cost, do not lie to yourself.  \nThis, the most heinous crime in human history, can only be swept under the carpet at the same moral cost as ended the Roman Empire and, more tangibly, at potential physical peril in terms of the generation of terrorism among the 20-year accumulated 1 billion strong army of bereaved relatives. \nOf all issues in the world, this is the most important.\n I have 5 years of piled up research conclusively proving what I say but I need co-operating writers to produce interesting stories on different aspects.  \nThough I give all my life to this, it will be less than a drop in the ocean but your office, has, inexorably, a duty not to neglect the world's single greatest harm.",
