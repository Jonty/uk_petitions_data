            "background": "Teachers in the primary sector are expected to work many hours at home, without any extra pay. Which other industry expects this of a workforce? If all teachers withdrew this goodwill, the government of the day would face a real crisis in education. It's morally reprehensible to expect teachers to have liitle home life simply because of the marking that has been done that day, or the preparation that needs to be done for the next day! If parents knew that teachers had to do all of this work themselves (ie not teaching from government prepared schemes which were fully resourced) they'd be shocked. No wonder the education system is in such a bad way. Teachers don't have the energy to teach after all the extra work is carried out. Shame on all governments for not taking this issue seriously.",
