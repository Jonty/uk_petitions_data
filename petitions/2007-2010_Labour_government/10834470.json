        "background": "A building society is a mutual organisation. This means that instead of having shareholders, it has members who collectively own the business and are also its customers. The main examples of this type of organisation in the UK are co-operative societies, mutual insurance companies and building societies. Members have the right to vote for directors regardless of how much or how little money they have with the society.\n\nEach building society invests its profit back into the society\u2019s business. Unlike banks, mutuals do not pay dividends. In other words - your money works for you, not the City. This enables the building society to offer competitive rates of interest on both savings and mortgages. It sets the rates it pays savers at just less than the rate charged to borrowers. This margin gives the society a profit. Many analysists believe this offers customers a much better deal.\n\nGiven a crisis of confidence is at the heart of the current crisis, we are calling on the Prime Minister to actively support a trustworthy system of building and mutual societies which can support home owners and encourage a viable property market.",
