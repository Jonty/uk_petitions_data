            "background": "All packaging\u2019s must, where ever possible be made from the same standard recyclable material. This will cut the costs and energy used to create and recycle this (standard) material. \nUsing one type of material for packaging would have many benefits. The most obvious being that the time and energy used in the sorting process and reconstitution would be dramatically reduced.\nAs standards are set out in chemistry to help with measurements they can also be applied to recycling. We urge the prime minister to promote the idea and practice of the above, not only within the UK but also within the European Union",
