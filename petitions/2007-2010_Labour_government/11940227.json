            "background": "Local councils who install road humps as a means of traffic-speed control are more inclined to do so, rather than alternative forms of speed control such as speed cameras, because they are not paying the full cost of the road humps, which is more than just the cost of the tarmac.\n\nThe full cost includes:\n\nCost to the environment - by causing cars to repeatedly accelerate and brake, there is a cost to the environment that would not have been incurred had an alternative such as speed cameras been deployed.\n\nDamage to cars - Badly-designed humps can cause damage to car-suspensions, tracking, tyres etc.\n\nDamage to people - People could suffer injuries or medical problems related to the jolts on their bodies caused by the humps.\n\nThe environmental cost of the humps could be assessed by a panel of experts, and paid into a carbon-offset scheme.\n\nThe councils who choose road humps as a means of speed control should keep an ample supply of road-hump compensation forms, so that people may claim compensation for damage to themselves and their vehicles arising from the road humps.",
