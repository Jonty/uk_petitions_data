            "background": "The government wants to charge each household that has a landline approximately six pounds per annum to upgrade the communications lines in the UK. This is an unjust method of doing this. Also there has been no mention of how long this tax would remain in effect. The original lines were paid for by the tax payer and after privatization the taxpayer did not receive any compensation for this. Further more has been charged ever since to use these lines, we the undersigned feel that these companies are responsible for their own infrastructure and as such should be responsible for doing the upgrading of it. What the government is proposing is for the people to pay to have the upgrades installed and then for them to pay to use them? These companies should be forced by the government to put a percentage of their vast profits into upgrading infrastructure and not ask the public to do this.",
