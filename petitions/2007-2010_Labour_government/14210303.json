            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The decision by the English Football Association to include Milton Keynes in the World Cup bid for 2018 is a mistake and is likely to cost England the chance to host the tournament.  Ever since Milton Keynes stole a football team from another town they have been an embarrassment to English football.   The negative publicity generated by the inclusion of Milton Keynes will reflect badly on English football world wide.   FIFA/UEFA have already made clear their opposition to franchising of football teams (re: Granada/Murcia case in Spain) and yet our FA wish to reward our franchisers with a world cup stadium.  Taxpayers/lottery buyers should not be forced to contribute to Pete Winklemans half-finished concert venue.  Block the bid!!!",
