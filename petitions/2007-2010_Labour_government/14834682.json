        "background": "Mr Brown is accused by Mr Rawnsley of bullying staff and actually hitting people. The accusations, taken in length as written, are a heinous reflection on a senior politician. Mr Brown has refuted the accusations. A serious issue of credibility arises here. Only one of them can be right. If it is Mr Rawnsley, then Mr Brown has an anger management problem and his ability to lead must be in question. If, however, Mr Rawnsley is exaggerating what is perhaps only very  strong character then Mr Rawnsley should be held to account. The Prime Minister should give example of his strong character and bring the matter to a head in a court of law.",
