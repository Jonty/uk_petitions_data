            "background": "The government should limit the duty payable on fuel when prices increase. After all, if crude oil prices rise, then the tax generated rises and the government thereby raises additional funds.  \n\nDuring sudden and large price increases, the government should reduce the duty payable by the consumer. If there is a shortfall in tax revenue, then the missing tax should be raised from the supplier of the fuel, in order incentivise suppliers to hold down their  prices.\n\nIn other words, the government should act to prevent the persecution of the general public by greedy companies rather than joining in with them as they do at the moment!\n\nThis approach could also be applied to Gas, Electricity, Heating Oil etc.",
