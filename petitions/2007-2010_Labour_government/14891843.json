            "background": "Prime Minister to look into charges that Liquidators take from businesses going into liquidation often from no fault of their own, as its usually a ripple effect. There seems to be no ombudsman to regulate their costs or control their charges.\nAs money comes in from customers that owe you , then it's not right that the Liquidators claim most of it leaving none to pay your debts, including the bank.\nAlso having a personal gaurantee over your business the banks charge you a high interest on what you owe them, making it more difficult to ever pay them off, as the Liquidators have taken it. Also its not right the Banks charging small businesses these rates when their isn't enough money from the liquidation, surely these costs should be stopped or capped as well allowing people involved in insolvency to at least have a fighting chance to pay off what they owe without incurring any more charges. Example: Liquidators charged \u00a322,400.00 for 112 hours. \nBanks charging 3% interest on money owed to them through insolvency.\nThis is greed on others misfortune.   L.Y.Harper",
