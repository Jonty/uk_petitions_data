I have done two projects so far but was hoping to improve my knowledge and skills by learning new  techniques,please do not let my hopes be dashed. Peoples giftings and talents should not cheaply be disposed of.  Closing the centre will only make the recession seem much worst (no hope for the future). Not every one has a full-time job, so people need to feel motivated and inspred by attending such courses in their local community. Please let us not create lazy  and idle minds that will create the devils workshop, let us give hope to the young ones coming. United we stand divided we fall. Thank you",
