            "background": "The UK Met Office not only predicts the weather but as an esteemed scientific institute of worldwide renown it represents the UK face of science.\n\nFor the last nine years the UK Met Office has been making predictions of global temperature and in each and every one of these forecasts the actual temperature has been higher than the 50% confidence interval.\n\nThe chances of getting 9 forecasts in a row too high by pure chance is less than 0.2%. There is clearly a systematic error in the Met Office world temperature forecast which causes them to estimate a temperature higher than actually occurs.\n\nWe ask the UK government to use its influence to ensure that the Met Office investigate this systematic error and stop making forecasts which quite frankly bring the good name of UK science into disrepute.",
