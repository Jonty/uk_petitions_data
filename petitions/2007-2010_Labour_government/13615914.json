            "background": "We believe Royal Mail worked better for the centuries in which it was the only postal service in this country than it has in the recent years in which is has had competition forced upon it. Competition has only harmed Royal Mail and has caused it's current problems. Before the most recent decades the Royal Mail was the envy of the world, the best post service the existed; now, due to the competition forced upon it, it has sunk to what it now is, which poor service and forced to cut back on jobs. Its also unfair that Royal Mail is forced to let all the other postal companies use Royal Mail postmen to deliver it's mail and parcels, this isn't simply competition but forcing Royal Mail to help it's competition.\n\nWe believe it would be far better to let Royal Mail once have a monopoly and let it get on with what it's been doing for 350 years.",
