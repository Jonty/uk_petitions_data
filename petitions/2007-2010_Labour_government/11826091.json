            "background": "The Criminal Justice & Immigration Act 2008 came in to effect in January 2009, and Section 49 of the Coroners and Justice Bill is currently being reviewed. \nBoth of these Acts could impact on the creation of comic books and how they are sold, both have the potential to land innocent people in court, on the sex offender register or in jail.\n  \nWe ask that the PM and the government as a whole respect the concerns of artists, writers, publishers, readers and retailers all over the UK and include a specific clarification in the law that ensures that no innocent comic creators or owners of comics can ever be prosecuted unfairly by a mis interpretation of the current laws.\n\nBy comics we mean all forms of the medium, including newspaper strips, web comics, Graphic Novels and serial comic books either imported or UK produced.",
