            "background": "Worse than the criticisms of the special preparation of meat being hijacked by persons with racialistic and sectarian views of hatred, the distinction between against a country's, China's, policies and the hatred of the (ethnic) Chinese as a race are artificial and are virtually none and non-existent. Many pro-Tibetan demonstrations at London upon the sixth of April are themselves White, which funnily and interesting enough would otherwise be condemned and not be tolerated at all, had the subject been India or Israel or Pakistan. Tibet or not, surely this country cannot simply dismisses and writes off over one or even two million of British-resident Chinese and loyal ethnic-Chinese British persons, both resident and expatriate, and their sensitivities and feelings as if there WERE some Act of Exclusion (of Political Rights)? Are we not men and brother (and sisters)? What about Equality and Fraternity? Why being so divisive? Why force at least a million to choice sides of loyalties?",
