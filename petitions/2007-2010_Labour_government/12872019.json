            "background": "The cost of VED for both a car and mid sized motorcycle can easily exceed \u00a3250 per annum, when many of these machines are for pleasure only these costs can become unreasonable. It is unfair to require car owners who have a motorcycle to pay road tax on a motorcycle after they have already paid it on there car. When it is only feasible to use one vehicle at a time, it cannot be justified that an individual is required to pay twice.",
