            "background": "The government takeover of National East Coast Express franchise is likely to be only in the short term. Nationalising this line permanently would allow the government a chance to compare Operators pricing and performance against a benchmark, as well as assessing how ticketing is managed. Current regulations are inflexible and the complexities of ticket pricing mean that customers have an imperfect knowledge of the market (as the ORR has previously suggested). \n \nThe railway industry is not a competitive market because of its x-inefficiencies and should therefore not be run so. For example, the only main train Operator on this line is National East Coast Express with minor operators such as Grand Central charging the same price for tickets (more like an oligopoly than a competitive free market).\n\nThe Operator bidding process is short-termist as companies running a successful operation can lose out on a franchise renewal if another over-stretches itself and comes in with a higher bid that is unrealistic and as a consequence has to hike prices to keep up with payments. This is passed on to the customer.",
