            "background": "Everyday children as young as ten years - or below - are starting to drink caffeine based products.  Largely these are Coca-Cola and many other fizzy drinks available.  The caffeine contained within these drinks are highly addictive and the main reason why people become addicted to them (it's not the taste, but hidden ingredient of caffeine!).\n\nThese products are being aimed primarily at children, which makes them become addicts and can have a very lasting effect for years to come.\n\nIt can take around 21 days of constant caffeine drinking to become addicted and, once hooked, it is a very hard struggle to come off it.\n\nI had my first can of Coke at about 10 and 22 years later i am still addicted.  I've spent many thousands of pounds on their products and my health has suffered dramatically because of it.  If someone had warned me (or my parents) back then, this may never have happened.",
