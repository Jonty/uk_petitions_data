            "background": "The 1921 census was the last taken before the commencement of the second world war.  Like its predecessor there was no guarantee of the 100 years closure.  This census would allow Family histroy researchers the chance of locating family members who survived the great war but moved into different areas.  \nThe information contained on this census is not likely to breach the Data Protection act and would be made available under a Freedom of Information request as was the 1911 information and it seems financially better for the country to allow access immediately with the chance for a commercial company to index for internet access.",
