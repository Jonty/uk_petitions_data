        "background": "We should rationalise tax. This means we should not have the percentage of tax increase as your wage increases. It should stay at a set amount - 22% has been worked out to be feasible. That is just over half of what you will pay if you earn 35K a year, who pay 40% tax.\nWe can give a substantial amount less to the government as there will be no need for more money, because we wouldn\u2019t employ people to work out the taxes as they can be simply worked out.\nThis will still be enough for the government, and will pay for everything that tax pays for now \u2013 except for the extra needless taxmen.\nThis will also save us money on accountants working out our tax. This is a fairer system as we will all pay the same percentage.",
