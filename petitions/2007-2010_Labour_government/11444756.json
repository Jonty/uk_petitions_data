            "background": "Salvia Divinorum is a highly potent hallucinogen which is not currently covered by the UK's drugs laws, which remain silent on it.\n\nSalvia divinorum, when taken properly, can be more potent than LSD, a Class A drug in the UK.\n\nSalvia divinorum is becoming popular among drug users who would otherwise use drugs such as ketamine and LSD because of its lack of illegality.\n\nBy not banning Salvia Divinorum, there is a huge double standard in the UK's drug laws which should be rectified, and I hope to bring awareness to the UK government of this drug and the law's silence on it.",
