            "background": "Scottish contituancy MP's can vote on purely English matters but English MP's cannot vote on Scottish matters because Scotland has its own parliament. This is absurb. Our Prime Minister can enforce rules, using the whips, that affect English people but not his own constituants. This is not democracy. This is dictatorship. Whatever happened to idea that the tax payer has a say in his/hers national politics? If it were not for the Scottish MP's votes many statutes would not be in place e.g. student fees, old age care, proposed free prescriptions for Scotland but not England? It is time for a national debate and vote on who we want to be governed by...the Scots, Brussels or ourselves?",
