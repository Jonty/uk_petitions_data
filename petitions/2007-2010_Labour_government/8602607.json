            "background": "Discrimination against minorites, based on sexuality, gender, race, religion is banned and quite rightly so.  Many government agencies including the Police and Fire Service have targets on recruiting from minority groups and appear to discriminate against the majority in order to meet these targets.  Recently, Avon Fire Service held five open days for potential recruits only one of which was open to white males, clearly a discrimination at odds with its own aims and as fundamentally wrong as disregarding someone based on being female, gay or of another ethnicity.  \nThis is not a petition to dilute the rights of any minority, it's a petition to treat every person as an individual regardless of whether they can be placed in a certain category.",
