        "background": "It is the QUALITY of a relationship, and NOT its STATUS, that is important.  Who is better off: a child whose parents might be married but who still abuse him/her emotionally, and/or physically, and/or sexually; or even if they don't do that have such a bad relationship that the child has no emotional security at all?  Or a child whose parents may not be MARRIED but who give him/her the 4 minimum emotional supports every child needs - love, emotional security, confidence and high self-esteem - and who also have a loving relationship themselves?  You might ask why they don't get married; one partner might have left an abusive relationship and be unable (or afraid) to get a divorce or they might simply be against marriage on principle.",
