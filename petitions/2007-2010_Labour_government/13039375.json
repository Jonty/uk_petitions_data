            "background": "With the credit crunch upon us and childrens school holidays being far too long now (they dont need to be six weeks anymore they dont help with the harvest! due to new Health and Safety laws)Parents are struggling to afford to pay for even a simple holiday in the uk as the prices double in some cases as soon as the summer holidays start. This should be unlawful. This produces the scenario of only the very wealthy children getting a holiday surely this goes against Labour and all it used to stand for.  Can you not do something about this or is Labour in the pockets of the travel companies as well?",
