            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recent change in Immigration law has stunned many families in the country regarding the increase in age of acquiring a marriage visa. This change has been made without sufficient consultation with families being affected by these changes and shows the lack of communication between society and Government. Also it has caused widespread distress in many Asian origin families who think that it is unfair discrimination against them only. They think of it as social engineering aimed at breaking the family bonds between the country ethnic minorities and their families abroad. If it were a genuine attempt to combat forced marriage then the minimum age set for acquiring UK marriage visa for European citizens should be the same as for the rest and not to discriminate on the basis of race. All young people have the right to marry at the legal age set and this piece of legislation is a clear cut violation of the UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARTICLE 16(1) and the EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ARTICLE 12. We deeply appreciate your efforts in combating forced marriages but genuinely married couples waiting to get together should not have to go through these difficult times.",
