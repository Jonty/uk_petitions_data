            "background": "The government is pressing ahead to open the provision of general practitioner services to private companies by  encouraging and collaborating with them in developing new alternatives to traditional surgeries in polyclinics and alternative personal medical services health centres. Diversion of funding to such untried and untested centres is likely to seriously impact upon existing practices, which may be forced to close or reduce services. We call upon the government to guarantee continued levels of funding for existing services, to allow their budgets to grow in line with NHS funding, and to co-operate with existing general practitioners in developing and improving the services they offer to patients rather than trying to develop a parallel service which may seriously impact upon patient care.",
