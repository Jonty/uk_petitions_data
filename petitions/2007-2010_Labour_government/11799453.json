After announcing record profits the Oil giants are again raising the cost of fuel at the pumps, up 3 p in the last  week.  As the elected Government you have a duty and responsibility to bring this mass exploitation to a halt.  You did nothing during the last sharp petrol rise and I would urge you to take action now before further damage is done to the economy.  High oil prices are one of the main driving forces behine the recession.\n\nYou have a duty to act in the interests of the Country, you are failing in that duty.",
