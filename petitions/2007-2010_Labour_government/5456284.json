            "background": "Please sign this petition to have smoking banned where food is served / consumed, including outdoor areas.  Banning smoking indoors will see smokers moving outside. Simon Clark is Director of Forest, an organisation that campaigns for smokers' rights has said \"There will be lots of consequences when the ban comes into force. For a start, there will be lots of people outside smoking . . .\".   Non-smokers are still being limited to where they can eat  smoke free.  Before there was the chance of a smoker lighting up during your meal, if you were outside, but now that chance is higher.  Non-smokers will have to choose to sit inside to avoid this, but have no way of escaping the smoke wafting in if the areas aren't separated by a structure.",
