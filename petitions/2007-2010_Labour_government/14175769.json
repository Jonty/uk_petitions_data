        "background": "The 3 main Party Leaders have all stated that cuts in public expenditure must be made. In reality only front line services ever get cut. The real savings can begin by getting rid of all those self serving MPs who have helped themselves to funds from the public purse unjustifyably. They should all be banned from standing in further elections for life as they have consistanly betrayed the Public trust and refuse to bend to the public will as is common practice among the oligarchs of a dictatorship that serves its self at the expence of the Nation. lets keep the Pigs from Gorging whilst the people live in need. George Orwell was right",
