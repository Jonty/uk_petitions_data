        "background": "From Manchester to York is approximately 57 miles.  From Manchester to Bacup is approximately 20 miles. Yet despite the difference in mileage it takes roughly ten more minutes on public transport to get between Manchester and Bacup than Manchester and York.  A train line running between the two locations would create jobs, cut down traffic, improve the environment and enrichen the local economy of Bacup.  It should also be noted that the probable finance required is a fraction of the cost of London's transport requirements.",
