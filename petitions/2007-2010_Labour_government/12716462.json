This additional \u2018upwards and sideways\u2019 development on the River Thames's floodplain at Kings Meadow, will take away the open character of the meadow and add another visual blot to the town\u2019s precious riverside landscape.\n\nPlease don't let this happen. It is vital that we preserve the tranquillity and freedom of the riverside.  Sign this petition now.\n\nThank you.",
