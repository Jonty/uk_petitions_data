            "background": "The government proposes to implement a new generation of average speed detection cameras, to enforce a new lower National Speed limit, covering most of the country\u2019s roads.\n\nWe all know safe speed of travel varies with the conditions. Inappropriate speed kills \u2013 not speed itself \u2013 but appropriate speed and safe driving techniques needs to be learnt.\n\nHow often do we see people on motorways hogging the middle and overtaking lanes or using fog lights all the time? This is because people are not educated about this and think it is acceptable. What happened to the public information films on these very subjects?\n\nHas the government investigated whether driver education would save more lives than enforcing speed limits with cameras? Not doing so and forging ahead with the proposal invites the obvious accusation of being motivated by reasons of revenue collection.\n\nCameras should not be introduced and instead a policy of driver education be implemented.",
