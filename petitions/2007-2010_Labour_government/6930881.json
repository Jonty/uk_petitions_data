            "background": "Turkish ministers are debating a motion to send troops into northern Iraq to oppress Kurdish rebel forces based there. Northern Iraq is one of the most peaceful and stable regions of Iraq and sending an army is going to cause death, destruction and suffering on a scale comparable to the rest of Iraq. The Turkish army have been battling with Kurdish rebels for over two decades and undoubtedly harbour a vengful attitude towards the Kurds. If the army invades it won\u00b4t just be the rebels who are killed, it will be the ordinary men, women and children who have been saved from the chaos of the Iraq conflict by their regional, cultural and ethnic autonomy. SAVE KURDISTAN FROM DISASTER! Show your solidarity with the Kurds by joining this group. Turkey must show restraint and not invade the only stable region in Iraq, after everything that that country has been through!",
