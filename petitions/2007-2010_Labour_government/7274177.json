            "background": "The current act makes it illegal for any ambulance to carry patients without the operator, vehicle and driver being licenced by the local authority for private hire.\nCurrently the only exemptions are for funeral and wedding cars.\nNot only is this an insult to the emergency services to have highly trainned staff relegated to the status of Taxi Drivers, but also puts all operators in a position where if they are registered as private hire they then fall undrer two separate acts of parliament each of which contradicts the other, making the operation legal under one but not under the other.\n\nThis 2006 Road Safety Act was introduced without any consultation or impact assesment.\n\nA simple addition to the exemptions for any vehicle registered with the DVLA as an ambulance in accordance with current statutes is all that is required.",
