We believe that banning Israel from Eurovison this year would, because of its trivial nature and huge audience reach, be taken more seriously by Israel than any academic boycott or demonstration, however shrill. \n\nOf all Israeli exports, its pop music is the easiest to boycott as nobody cares whether they hear it or not. And don't say we're not being even-handed. We can't call for Palestine to be evicted. Palestinians aren't allowed to take part in Eurovision. Even though they live right next to Israel. Which let's face it is actually in the Middle East. Not Europe.",
