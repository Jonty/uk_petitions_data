        "background": "The recent political scandal caused by the disclosure and their reaction to such disclosure of widespread misuse of MP\u2019s allowances and expenses, has brought disgrace and shame to this country.  The damage done by the loss of confidence in the political system of the UK will probably never be overcome and the fact that this parliament will forever more be known as the \u201cRotten Parliament\u201d is well deserved.  \nIt is clear that the behaviour of the majority of the House members, disqualifies them from being referred to as an \u201chonourable\u201d member or a \u201cright honourable\u201d member.\nIt is requested that the Prime Minister reinforces his disgust in the behaviour of such members from all political parties in the House of Commons, by doing everything in his power to ban the use of these now inappropriate terms within the House of Commons.\nThis ban, if enforced, would ensure that this \u201cRotten Parliament\u201d, elected in 2005, would never be forgotten and hopefully prevent such a repetition of this shameful  obnoxious corruption occurring again.",
