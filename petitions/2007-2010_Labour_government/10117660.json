            "background": "there are over 10.000 seperated parents.( mainly males) who have been refused access to their chidren even though the courts have given instructions on access dates etc.  the offending parent (usaly the female) openly abuse the weekness of the courts to enforce this offence with a chail sentance.  my son is one who hjas not seen his son for over 3 yrs and has to find another\n\u00a3 5000 to go back to court( which he has not got) the mother states that the courts will not do any thing about it and if they instructed her to give access she would stick a one finger up to the courts. i suggest that if this happens then the offending party be chailed from Friday night tilll monday morning with the children passed onto the other paret for that weekend.",
