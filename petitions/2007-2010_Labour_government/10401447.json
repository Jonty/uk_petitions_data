        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe that supermarkets and not pubs are to blame for the continuing problems on our streets of drink related crimes due to the ease of buying multiple cans or bottles of beers and lagers. I believe that a higher tax is needed on supermarkets to stop selling 'cheap' beers and take drinking back to pubs instead of parks etc, therefore creating more responsible drinking. Please pass this petition onto as many people as possible.",
