        "background": "I think it is unjust and unfair that we have no choice but to pay a television licence to the BBC but they only produce 4 episodes of the massively popular soap 'EastEnders' per week. This is probably the second most popular BBC broadcasting after the news. It is almost unanimous national opinion that there should be a new episode aired on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, where there currently is not.",
