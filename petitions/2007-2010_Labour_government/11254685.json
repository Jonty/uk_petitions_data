For instead, every one is this country who has a job or have a company have to pay tax income. So, what do you do with these money, how is spending, where is go to, there are other income of the goverment that is coming from fine or tax road in order to have a good infrastructure which i do not seem we have at the moment, if we travel out of london or even around the city there are many black spot such no signals, road with holes, less maintenance.\nI will be happy that the money is deducted from my income as tax income will be used for increasing our standard of life with having social help or fund for vulnerable people such as old people, disable people and very joung child. These people need our support by having more house center in each borough.",
