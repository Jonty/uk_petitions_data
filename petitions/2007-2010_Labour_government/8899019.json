Repeatedly.\n\nIf a petition is seemingly offensive or inciteful, then surely it will fail to receive support and flounder helplessly. This is a true definition of TOLERANCE and democracy.\n\nA faceless administrator deciding what can and cannot be displayed just isn't cricket.\n\nSign this petition to allow REAL democracy to happen.",
