            "background": "Bank staff have threatened to walk out if they do not receive their 80% bonus. I think this payment is reasonable once the taxpayers money has been reimbursed. Considering many companies that fall into debt by the billion will go bankrupt, the taxpayer has paid \u00a3850bn to date in order to keep bank staff in a job and off the breadline. If each household received their \u00a340,000 rebate from the banks, many people struggling to pay their mortgage would be assured they will not default on their payments and lose their home, thereby ensuring equality for the bank staff demanding their 80% bonus.",
