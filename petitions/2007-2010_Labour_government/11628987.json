            "background": "We the undersigned believe that profit growth is only a small measure of the economic success of a country, and that our PM should shape the 'new economy' to ensure that financial institutions are ethical and that they measure performance in terms of positive impact they have on as wide a range of people as possible. This will help many of the problems in society and the world economy and stop the short-sightedness, greed and hunt for profits and rich/poor divide that has characterised the last 30 years.",
