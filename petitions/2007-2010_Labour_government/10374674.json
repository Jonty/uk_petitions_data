We, the people of England and undersigned, wish to make it clear that to provide a state funeral to the leader that supported the MI5 training of Ossama Bin-Laden and other terrorists, supported the regime of Pinochet, implimented the disasterous theory of trickledown economics which has led to the culture of credit and the current economic crisis in the UK (amongst many other offences) would be both hypocritical and hateful. We demand the withdrawal of this honour.",
