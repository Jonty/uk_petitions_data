She had severe mental health problems, and simply walked over the edge of the top floor of the car park.\nLooking at this car park, some of the areas were protected with wire mesh. Other areas (including an area where this lady jumped from) were left completely open with no protection. IT is not just car parks - cliffs such as those at Beachy Head, where suicide is a common occurance. Why are there no attempts at protection? How many deaths by suicide need to occur before a place will be considered \"dangerous\" to vulnerable people and therefore protected?",
