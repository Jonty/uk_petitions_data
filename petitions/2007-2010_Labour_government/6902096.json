            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This country is widely criticised as having poorer health than the rest of western europe, it is worth noting that we also work more hours then other european coutries, and that this may contribute to higher stress levels, less contact with children/parents, use of convenience foods with poorer nutritional value leading to health concerns such as cancer,diabetes and obesity, increased use of alcohol and recreational drugs, less opportunity to complete housekeeping duties, less opportunity to spend quality time with children and increases the need for multiple carers and inconsistent behavioural management. These factors contribute to the current problems around physical and mental health and crime.  To reduce the working week would enable more families to function more effectively to promote their physical and emotional wellbeing.",
