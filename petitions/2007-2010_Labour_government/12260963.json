They have not been brought to justice. If they do go to court (1 in 10 cases do not) they only get a wrap across the knuckles. This is dispicable. How do you know who to trust? And especially when you know that the law doesn't work in a victims favour. We want justice! Tougher sentences on these perverted people who destroy their victim, take away their innocence and their soul. Its something no victim will ever forget and it impacts their life forever!",
