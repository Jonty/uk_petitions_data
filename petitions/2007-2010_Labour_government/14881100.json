            "background": "To ensure that elderly patients are given the best possible care and treatment rather than applying cost cutting measures that are causing the unnecessary early death of hundreds of people. To ensure they are treated with respect, dignity by all the NHS Staff and given the extra nursing care and attention they need due to their age. Provide sufficient funds to provide for this care without charing the over 60's for their care.  The government have known for 60 years that they would need to provide for an increasing number of residents who have paid for this service already through their NHS contributions. Stop discriminating against them by asking them to pay again for a service they have already paid for.",
