        "background": "Rail fare has risen 100% since the mid 1990's.\n\nIt has been revealed that the rise in the cost of train tickets has led to the first \u00a31,000 rail fare.\nThe fare - of \u00a31,002 - is for a turn-up-and-go, first-class return from Newquay in Cornwall to the Kyle of Lochalsh in the Scottish Highlands. The trip would cover around 1,700 miles, with tickets available from the CrossCountry train company.\n\nA London-to-Manchester return, for example, has gone up from \u00a333 in 1995 to \u00a366.10, while a London-to-Newcastle upon Tyne return has risen 84 per cent to \u00a3105.\n\nThis shows just how pricey and complicated the fare structure is, and it is far too expensive. The Government should step in and review how they regulate fares.",
