        "background": "The Prime Minister has referred to the tolls at the Dartford Crossing as a form of 'congestion charge' and as such presumably all things 'Green' are attributed to this. How, therefore can it be Green to have up to 10 miles of queueing traffic on either side of the river be doing any good to the environment?\nThe London Congestion charge has shown how this 'tax' can be collected with cameras so why are we still having to pay at the toll booths.\nI urge the PM to either rid the crossing of the unfair tolls all together or use technology that will benefit all by reducing carbon emissions. STOP THE QUEUES!!!",
