This is unfair.\nSpain, a wealthy country, is the EU's principal net beneficiary.\nItaly, whose economy is roughly as big as ours and is as populated as our country, contributes 33% less than we do.\nFrance, whose populace is bigger (and let's not forget that the French economy is roughly as big as ours) is a net beneficiary because of the CAP.\nWe therefore demand that the Treasury ensures that we don't pay the EU more than we get for it.",
