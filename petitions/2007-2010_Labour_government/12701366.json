            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is widely recognised that a patient's mental health is mostly dependent on their physical health. Therefore I propose that legislation is enforced to allow all NHS providers of Mental Health Services to investigate diet and nutrition of their patients, advise on diet and nutrition and/or implement dietary changes where necessary.  This should also include the stipulation that any patient using recreational drugs including accepted drugs such as alcohol, caffeine and cigarettes as well as the illegals such as cannabis etc should be given all help to ensure they have a fully healthy lifestyle which does not include any extra curricular substances other than prescribed drugs. Routine regular urine testing at appointments and 3 monthly blood testing should be used to monitor drug use. If this is implemented the number of people with mental health problems is likely to decrease rapidly, freeing up NHS resources, creating a new work force and easing the pressure on the tax-payer funded benefit system.",
