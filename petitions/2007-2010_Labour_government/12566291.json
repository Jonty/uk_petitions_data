            "background": "Why, in the age of instant telecommunications, does it take Barclaycard three days for cash payments made at a branch of Barclays Bank, to be reflected on their customers' accounts? They should be made to explain why this is, and where that money goes to during the 'missing -three day' period. This is, in effect, forcing customers to give Barclaycard, and similar financial institutions, an interest free loan of three of days, with no apparent benefit to the customer. The government should protect our interests, and not allow its people to be exploited by the might of large corporations, especially in these times of financial privation.",
