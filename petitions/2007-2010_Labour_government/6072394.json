This is illegal under International law and contrary to The UN Human Right Declaration that The United Kingdom signed up too. Thus this upheld exclusion is: Immoral , undemocratic and unjust as regards to the law this nation subjected itself to. \n\n In the 21st century and especially in this nation were we hold democracy close to our hearts it is a historical abomination that this constitutional ugliness is alive and loyal British Catholic citizens of good character are barred form aspiring to serving there nation in the ultimate post.\n\n In the name of Christ the Catholic people of this nation and in the name of good moral values the none-catholic people of this nation plead with the Prime Minster to restore the beauty of our democracy by allowing the implementation of a Catholic Prime Minster, if the person is fairly and duly elected by there fellow citizens.\n\nThank you and God Bless.",
