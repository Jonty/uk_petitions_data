        "background": "Approve all plans for runways and increases in airport sizes for all British Airports Which WILL lower carbon admissions. Anyone who is in the aviation knows not approving an additional runway to any airport it is needed does not help decrease emissions, it increases it because them planes still have to take off and land. All this achieves is to make them planes wait longer to take of on the taxi ways burning fuel. Same as when they land, If the airport is not big enough there will be no stands available and they need to sit on the taxiways again burning lots of fuel waiting for a stand before they can power down. That is why these planes need to come thorough quick. Its a positive step in lower carbon, not to mention boosts the economy and creates millions of jobs.",
