Companies use 0800 numbers to make it easier and cheaper for customers to phone them. Not all 0800 numbers are charged - for example Childline and some networks make breakdown companies numbers free. Some people just have a mobile. It will be only fair if the networks start making calls to 0800 numbers for free.",
