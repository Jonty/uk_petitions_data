            "background": "currently there are many families with transgender partners that would like to obtain their grc but are either afraid too or find it difficult in many ways including financially to consider applying for it due to current law stating that we must annul our marriage before applying for civil partnership.  It would be alot easier and less stress-full for all concerned including any children that may be involved if the marriage certificate could be transferred over to a civil partnership one. It would certainly cut out alot of hassle for both the familes which it applies to as well as the courts who i'm sure would rather get on with other legal duties than having to deal with an annulment of marriage due to transgender re-assignment only for the couple to re-marry again under the civil partnership. let us beable to finally cut out the middle man and allow us to finally get on with our lives as love intends us to do.",
