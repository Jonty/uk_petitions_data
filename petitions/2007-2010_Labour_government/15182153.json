        "background": "In Particular, all types and components of ESA, JSA and Incapacity benefit, including claims under \"youth\" rules.\nMany of us in work and paying tax have to undergo drink and drug testing to maintain our employed status, including those working in some of the most arduous conditions, HM Forces, Oil Industry, Merchant marine,etc.\nIf the working taxpayer is required to remain within the law, sober and drug free to maintain our employed status we feel it is reasonable to expect those who are in receipt of benefits to remain equally within the rule of law i.e. not using illicit drugs and being sober during normal working hours. \nThose on benefits for the reasons of Ill health could reasonably be expected to remain sober and drug free. There are clear indications that drink and drugs are detrimental to health and therefore might delay recovery.\nThe phrase \u201cavailable for and actively seeking work\u201d would seem to preclude any person spending \u201cnormal working hours\u201d in a state affected by drink and or drugs.",
