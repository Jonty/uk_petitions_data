Were hoping to get as many people to sign this petition as possible, agreeing that self-harm needs more awareness raised. Then, of course when sucessful, to personally hand into Gordon Brown [as new PM].\nHopefully this can be the starting point to get self-harm into P.S.H.E lessons at schools, educate more people and have programs and documentaries like 'The Cutting Club' aired more frequently. \n\nWere hoping this might help to get the message about self harm across to those unaware and educate the public.\n\nSo, PLEASE! if you agree with this, sign below. Thankyou. x \n\n1. Cait \n2. Misha",
