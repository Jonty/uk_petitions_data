            "background": "Housing is fundamental to every part of a child\u2019s development. Shelter research shows that living in overcrowded housing harms the health of children, makes it more difficult for them to study, and causes depression, anxiety and stress in the home. It is estimated that over one million children in England are overcrowded by modern day standards, but most of them are not overcrowded in the eyes of the law.\n\nThe 1935 Act which defines overcrowding is woefully outdated, with children under ten counted as half a person and some kitchens considered suitable places to sleep. The result is that families with children must endure quite extreme conditions before they fall within the legal definition of overcrowded. With parliament soon to debate new space standards for poultry, it\u2019s time to update this definition too.",
