            "background": "Since the year 2000 my local authority has wasted millions of pounds of tax payers money on projects that serve no visible purpose. As a tax payer I feel that the government has a responsibility to put in place a system that allows residents a say in how local authorities spend the money that on our behalf. I feel that this is a basic requirement to stop this waste of public funds, when there are much better uses that they could be put to. Instead of using these funds to pay for art centers, pretty glass canopies that keep train passengers dry so long as they don\u2019t go onto the train platform and failed plans to relocate county hall. The money should be spent on repairing the failing youth service, widening the range of educational services for adults and offering rehabilitation services for vulnerable people who fall into the trap of drugs and alcohol. These are areas that are always struggling to find funding, and the fact that they struggle while money is wasted on frivolous projects is simply not acceptable, and if the public had to be consulted I believe that money   would not be wasted on these projects and would get to the areas that really need it.",
