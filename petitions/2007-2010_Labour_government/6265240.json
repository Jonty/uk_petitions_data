            "background": "Please help stop the closures of WHEC! Wester Hailes Education Centre is the only high school that offers a young mums unit. They deserve an education to better themselves as much as anyone else.\n\nAlso, WHEC not long ago, received a healthy living award. This was received on what the school had to offer. If it was not for WHEC the students that have left, just sat standard grades, ints or highers, would not have the outstanding grades they have.\n\nPlease sign the petition and help save our school. Don't tear the heart out of the community, and don't let the community suffer educational inequalities. Thanks",
