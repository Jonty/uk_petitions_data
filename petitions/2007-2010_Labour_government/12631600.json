        "background": "Whilst the Prime Minister has promised strong action on the MP's expenses claims, if an employee in business had made some of the claims that have been accepted, they would  be investigated and prosecuted under criminal laws. Why should the MP's who have made fraudulent claims be any different? All claims should be investigated by the police with a view to criminal charges regardless of whether the MP's have reimbursed the taxpayer (already an admission of guilt)",
