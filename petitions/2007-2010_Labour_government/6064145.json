            "background": "At present only parents who are on low incomes can claim the childcare element of working families tax credit. \n\nThis does not create a level playing field, and, is unfairly advantageous to people with low levels of education. \n\nI believe that 'affordable childcare' should be either the right of everyone (non-means tested) or no-one. \n\nThere is no incentive to work hard at school to get good qualifications and a good job when you leave education because uneducated, low income people end up with the same amount of money at the end of each month. \n\nEQUALITY PLEASE.",
