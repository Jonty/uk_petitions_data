        "background": "In the wake of yet another case of an innocent and law abiding father and husband being murdered by a gang of cowardly teenagers, is it not now time for the Government to stop making excuses and passing the blame on to the police, schools, parents and alcohol. \nThis government has over the years taken away every deterrent against anti-social behaviour. \nThe need now to allow parents to discipline there children with reasonable force is even more relevant. For schools to be allowed to use the belt / cane to control the classes. For the police and the judicial system to be allowed to award corporal punishment, like the cane, birch and the cat of nine tails for violent and anti-social behaviour. \nIn the case of blatant malicious and cowardly murder, then a life for a life must surely be the only way forward.\nThis is not an out and out call for a police state or the use of corporal punshishment for all crimes, but a wake up call for any would-be thug to see and think about there actions and know there is a real deterant for use against them.",
