            "background": "My Cousin Andrew sadly took his own life on 4th June 2009 aged just 26 years old leaving his beloved girlfriend and stepson. He had been taking the tablet Champix in a bid to stop smoking after being prescribed them by his GP.He had been suffering from nightmares on the run-up to his death and we believe that these tablets had a direct link to his death. The side effects of these tablets include: diarrhoea, gingivitis, chest pain, back pain, dizziness, anxiety, depression, emotional disorder, polyuria (excessive urination), menstrual disorder, and hypertension. \nAndrew had only been taking these tablets for 13 days and was due to go back to his GP the day he died for a review of the tablets. We believe that these tablets have been linked to other suicides and also that they have been banned in Australia due to the same reasons. We are now calling for a ban in the UK to stop other families having to go through the pain that we have suffered losing a close family member.",
