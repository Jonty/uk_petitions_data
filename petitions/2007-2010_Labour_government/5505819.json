        "background": "I would not need to have a degree in Security and Psychology or have been in the SAS to pick out 50% of the public traveling through airports to see who was going on holiday with their family and who posed a risk to the public. The security people on El Al are probably the best in the world at profiling terrorists. Why don't we do more  profiling instead of taking away milk and bottle water from kids and lipstick and purfume from females. Surely we have better expertise than that. Lets get real and stop being so politically correct.",
