        "background": "Parrallel with the decline of British identity has been the rise of addressing this country as the UK rather than by the more emotive title, Britain.\n       Some may feel that the abbreviation \"the UK\" is modern and global, but in reality, it has a soulless air and more of the appearance of a company logo than the name of a country with an unqiue identity, a long history and which is not an abbreviation of a country.\n      Therefore, to enhance Britain's identity, I suggest that the government encourages the return of addressing Britain as Britain.",
