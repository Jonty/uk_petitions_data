            "background": "As a responsible adult and drinker, which most of us are, i think government plans to get rid of cheaper alcohol deals in supermarkets are unjustified.  It will only add extra to our weekly shopping budget with only the suppermarkets gaining. I agree alchol is a problem in anti social behaviour but it can be tackled in other ways such as raising the age limit to 21 as in the US or removing the 24hr purchase laws. We are already being hard hit by the credit crunch and this is not going to help the average family.",
