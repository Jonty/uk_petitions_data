            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Britain cannot compete as a global superpower because it simply does not have enough people or resources when compared with other nations (such as India and China), and yet our government seem to think that they can keep squeezing these resources in an attempt to remain individually powerful. The net effect of this is that British people suffer and are expected to work harder for a smaller return, they are taxed higher and see their benefits gradually stripped away. Britain itself will be systematically destroyed as the government try and cram more population into this small island, concreting over the countryside and creating more social tension in an attempt to be more economically viable.\n\nIn the long term, this is a position that Britain cannot maintain and we must gracefully accept our position in the world or we will be dragged down into a spiral of social, economic and cultural decline, the evidence of which we are already starting to see.\n\nThis petition asks that the government stop destroying Britain and allow British people to start enjoying and respecting what they have, like so many other small nations are able to do.",
