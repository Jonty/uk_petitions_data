        "background": "The current timetable for digital switch over means that some areas of the county will not be able to receive any digital changes and some current analoge channels for up to 5 years. Given that 84% (Oct 2007) of households already have the ability to receive digtal broadcasts, the currect timetable could be reduced without major impact. This would also enable broadcasters to bring forward the HD rollout on freeview for the 3.7m people who have purchased HD televisions. Who at present can't use these TV's to there full extent without paying large amounts to subcription services",
