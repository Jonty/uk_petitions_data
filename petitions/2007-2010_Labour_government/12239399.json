            "background": "Here in the UK, there is already far too many incidents involving knives and guns. Most often, this will end up in murders and the killers being sent to prison. At the moment,prisons are operating at maximum capacity,often beyond this.\n\nCurrently the British Armed Forces are roughly 1200 infantry men short. This probably could quite easily be solved by making it compulsory for the knife crime convicts to participate in Military Service. \n\nThis most definetley seems appropriate as the convicts seem to like playing with weapons.",
