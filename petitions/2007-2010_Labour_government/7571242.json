            "background": "the amount of money people are spending on insurance is insane, you spend \u00a31000's on insurance and if you dont have an accident then all that money you have paid for insurance disappears, i think you should cancel insurance for cars and motorcycles and if they have an accident its down to them to pay for the damage they cause.\n\n17-21 year old males pay at least \u00a31000 per year just to insure thier vehicle, then they have to pay for a car/motorcyle, then tax and m.o.t it every year, if anything goe's wrong with it you can't claim on insurance for it, so you have to pay out even more money...\n\n\"EQUAL RIGHTS\" where does this come into car insurance? well basically insurance is sexist, female's get cheap insurance just for aparently being safer drivers, well thats not equal to males at all, insurance should be the same for everyone if we have to have it.\n\nthanks for spending your time reading this.",
