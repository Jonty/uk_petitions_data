        "background": "In urban cities crime rates are not good and gang cultured violence is on the rise, as it is all over the country.\nI have created this petition because as the Government have renamed and re-branded the Department for Education and Skills to \nThe Department for Children, Schools and Families I think that the Government should incorporate children schools and families in the fight against gang crime and other youth related issues. \nThis petition could help to do this if the government agreed to creating a youth government and electing 1 person/Member of Youth Parliament (MYP) from each borough to advice the government on how to make our life\u2019s as young British citizens much more educational, fulfilling and successful.",
