            "background": "New Build Barratts homes are now sold with a convenant that restricts the use of 'For Sale' boards on their developments 'in perpetuity'. This means that they are prohibiting anyone ever placing a board outside one of their homes, even years after the development is complete. Why should this be allowed? Surely, such a condition is unfair and unworkable... If it only serves to make it easier to sell new homes on a new development, why have no time limit? The permanence of the restriction is not shared in advance so nobody knows - this cannot be right and must be changed.",
