            "background": "Many people, who's public conscience and pride in self sufficiency, have spent their working lives devoted to saving for future retirement without having to soak up public funds. \n\nPersonal savings have recently reduced by over 60%. This is equivalent of  someone on \u00a324k reducing their salary to \u00a38k pa.\n\nMany savers will be forced to return to work to support future income. Unemployment figures are already out of control. Do the Government want to increase the burden by forcing retired savers back to work?\n\nI am suggesting a tax cut on interest on savings of up to \u00a3500k to 5%.\n\nThis figure would exclude the people with higher wealth, who would not add to unemployment figures,  leaving job vacancy opportunities available for young people who have been forced into further and higher education in the hope of securing their own future.",
