            "background": "Car alarms have a negative impact on the urban environment whilst having a questionable preventative effect, as they are constantly going off and hence ignored by all. Arguably the use of car alarms constitutes an anti-social behaviour, by adding to noise pollution and affecting the quality of life of local residents. Moreover it could be contended that the now widespread use of CCTV and other technological developments have superseded the car alarm. We propose that all new car alarm devices be fitted with a timer mechanism to turn them off after an acceptable period of time and that government should, in consultation with the police service, reexamine how much of a deterrent car alarms really are.",
