If I get 2 in a week, that is nearly 1/3 of my total money per week.\nSome, not all retired have savings in excess of 100s of thousands of pounds, and ex beatles and Rolling Stones members are entitled to free prescriptions purely because they are over 65, yet are very wealthy, some reputed in excess of 100s of millions.\nSo I plead to decency to make ALL benefits means tested, its illogical and unfair for people with millions to claim free charges, whilst some with little have to pay.\nFor a fairer society this MUST happen",
