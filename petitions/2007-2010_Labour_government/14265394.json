They have never been prompted to do this but have represented the feelings of the majority in this Country.  The Queen knows how worrying it can be having had her Grandson out in Afghanistan.\nThis town should know just how grateful this country is and a way of doing this would be for the Queen to rename this town 'Royal Wootton Bassett' in honour of their continuing deeds.",
