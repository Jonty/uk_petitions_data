This is now subject to consultation. A previous consultation in 2003 identified substantive policy reasons against a move to GPT. Weight had also been given to the considerable uncertainty and economic difficulties facing the sector at the time \u2013 factors which have only become more pressing in the intervening six years.\nCombined with the global economic deterioration, the smoking ban and structural unintended consequences of the Gambling Act 2005, the gaming machine sector continues to face uncertain and difficult market conditions. A change to GPT will make these problems worse.",
