        "background": "In order for democracy in the UK to work the people must be allowed to present their arguments to their MP's and MP's to vote according to what the people want. If the govt does not withdraw the whip it is constraining true democracy - the government is imposing it's will on the country rather than allowing a free and democratic process to occur.\n\nEncourage democracy give people a voice in the house of commons.\n\nI believe this petition is different to others currently submitted on this website because I am addressing the issue of democracy rather than conscience.",
