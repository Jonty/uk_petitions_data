            "background": "The current leasehold system gives far more rights to the landlord and management agency than tenants.\n\n-As the majority of management companies charge a management fee as a percentage of costs it is in their advantage to spend the maximum amount possible.\n\n-This results in unnecessary works being completed and no incentive for the management company to reduce costs.\n\n-Refusal to pay unreasonable costs can lead to the tenant forfeiting the lease therefore risking eviction.",
