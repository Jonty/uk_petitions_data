            "background": "The historic Folkestone Harbour branch line and station is under threat of closure and demolition. The station was the embarkation point for many millions of soldiers in both world wars. I ask that the line be retained as a viable link to the harbour and incorporated into any redevelopment plans for the area. Closure of the line, which has huge tourist potential, would result in increased volume of road traffic with associated pollution, and result in the destruction of unique infrastructure including the viaduct and swing bridge.",
