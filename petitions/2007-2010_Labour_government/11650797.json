That all people are led from darkness to light untruth to truth. \nTherefore politicians should never lie to the public in a democratic state. Lieing to the public by any state employee including the P.M. office should be treated as a crime against the people and should be treated as bearing false witness and the politicians sent to prison, No matter who or what the motivation.",
