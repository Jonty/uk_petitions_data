        "background": "After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) lacked the guts to recommend that any action be taken against the police, the beacon of British justice that is the Old Bailey has shown that even the police are not above the law, and must be held to account.\n\nSir Ian Blair must resign or be dissmissed, The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, has gave him her support. She is showing herself as Incompetent and unsuited to the role. She should insist that he goes, and push him if he wont, has not been the job long and supporting Sir Ian is a wrong decision. I am guessing that she will not remain the post much longer.",
