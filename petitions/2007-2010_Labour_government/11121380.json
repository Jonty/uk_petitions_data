            "background": "It is illegal to provide air traffic control feeds from within the U.K. due to an antiquated law that dates back to 1942.\n\nThe antiquated law states that although it is not illegal to sell, buy or own a scanning receiver in the U.K., it must only be used to listen to transmissions meant to be broadcast to the general public.\n\nOFCOM has stated on numerous occasions: \"It is an offence to listen to any other radio services unless you are authorised by a designated person to do so.\"\n\nThis means that it is illegal to listen to anything other than general reception transmissions unless you are either a licensed user of the frequencies in question or have been specifically authorized to do so by an authorised person.\nLet us see if we can get this changed.",
