            "background": "TfL has 9 zones, so why aren't they used? Why just stop at the ordinary 6? Place stations like Cuffley, Potters Bar, Hatfield, Cheshunt, Broxbourne, Welwyn Garden City etc in the zones! \n\nWouldn't it make sense to place Potters Bar in Zone 7, Brookmans Park, Welham Green and Hatfield in Zone 8 and Welwyn Garden City in Zone 9? Therefore, the Oyster PAYG extension on National Rail to zones 1-9 would therefore be useful. Why stop at Zone 6? \n\nEven though there are additional costs travelling outside Zones 1-6, it's worth it. Oyster is affordable and easy to use, hence why it's being expanded on National Rail. Shame we're not placed in the zones.\n\nFurthermore, even though we get First Capital Connect/National Rail services, can't our buses have Oyster readers on too? Even if it's pushing it a little, placing us in a zone is simple.",
