        "background": "If you ever see the video, you must be aware it's the most horrifying you will ever see. It shows excruciating violence. If we don't protect animals from this type of brutality, we become accomplices:  with a hidden camera, animals were filmed being SKINNED ALIVE!!!  They say it's done to get a more perfect 'cut'.  Afterwards, the carcasses are tossed into a pile, still alive, and for up to 10 minutes you can see their hearts still beating, in agony, their eyes still blinking, and the puppies little paws still shaking. There was one pup, that still lifted his head and gazed at the camera with bloodied eyes.  And I've not even mentioned the treatment they get before this happens to them. For further information, contact People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).\n\nPlease sign and ask all your friends too - this has to be stopped!!!  And perhaps a letter to your MP might also help.",
