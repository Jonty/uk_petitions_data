            "background": "The British Medical Association opposes an idea to introduce a new NHS doctor grade (below consultant). Responding to the Sir John Tookes report on Modernising Medical Careers, the BMA said a sub-consultant grade was not necessary, wouldn't improve the quality of care, and wouldn't save money. So why do it ? Although promising, nurse banding, with Whitley Council and Agenda for Change, only brought internal politicking, strife and conflict over pay - it had the potential to improve nursing structures, but effectually was just as ad hoc as the system it was designed to replace - don't politicians ever learn from history's mistakes and heed the advice of professionals ? Training to upgrade skills must be welcomed - but at grass roots, these jobs are being off loaded. Dr Jonathan Fielden, chairman of the BMA's Consultants Committee, said this would not be beneficial to the doctor or the patient. Why deny our brilliant young academics the opportunity to fulfil their potential to the benefit of the professions, scientific inquiry and the public whose health needs they ultimately serve ?",
