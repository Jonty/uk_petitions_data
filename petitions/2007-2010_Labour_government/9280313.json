If you are a parent and wish to make people stop and listen to the views of parents and improve things for children.  We want to lobby both local and national government to stop and listen to parents before we loose our special schools, before our children are put into units/mainstream school.  We are not against inclusion if it is properly resourced, qualified teachers, nursing staff, hydrotherapy pools, speech and lanugue; correct teaching materials and understanding staff, plus much more.\nWe want parents of mainstream children to understand children with additional needs don\u2019t mean to disrupt there child\u2019s education they just need proper understanding and proper teaching methods and control methods in place. We are asking for better consultation and the government to stop pushing inclusion until ALL parents have been consulted across the country with regard to inclusion both mainstream/special school parents.",
