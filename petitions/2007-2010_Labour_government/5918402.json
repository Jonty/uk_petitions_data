            "background": "BT Wholesale has introduced a \u00a333.75 (excl VAT) Cease Charge on broadband end users. Without clearly notifying the public,this has been introduced! This means that whenever you disconnect your Broadband internet connection from a BT-owned line (regardless of who your ISP is), you will be charged! This also applies if you change phone numbers, like when moving. This is an outrageous (stealth) fee and must be stopped. No one should be charged a Disconnection fee. The Government must stop BT from charging this unethical fee which is virtually unknown to the users of the internet. This new fee was introduced in mid 2007 and may be hidden in fine print in your internet service provider's legal information if you look carefully.\nMost ISPs just pass this new cease fee on to their customers (not even notifying existing customers of the new fee), as it is a fee that has been imposed on them by BT Wholesale.",
