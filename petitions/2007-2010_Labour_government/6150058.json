            "background": "This is due to the numbers of people that insurers and banks and other organisations use outside the UK, as cheap labour to give around the clock service. I would like to see that no details of any people resident in the UK as needed to be seen by outsiders. Also there is a case that the employment of people inside the UK has been effected by large companies closing local offices to have there overseas call centres. In my trade of insurance there is a major move by compaines to use offshore call centres and then make the staff working at the local offices redundant, this should not be allowed to happen.",
