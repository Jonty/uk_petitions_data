            "background": "It is being proposed to move the Gynaecological Surgical Cancer Care Unit from Derriford Hospital in Plymouth to Treliske in Truro.  If the proposition is successful women living in the treatment area of Derriford needing Gynaecological Surgery would then have to travel to either Exeter or Truro for this aspect of their care.  A stay in hospital post op can be approx 1 week so added to the trauma of the diagnosis and surgery, the patient would also have the stress of journey times for visitors \u2013 if indeed they get any visitors because of transport and travel cost issues.  The skill of the surgeons in Derriford at present is excellent as I\u2019m sure is the case in Treliske but I believe the continuity of care with the same local team is equally important to recovery rates for this type of cancer (as is earlier detection & GP awareness).  Please add your name to the petition to support keeping our own surgical unit in Derriford.",
