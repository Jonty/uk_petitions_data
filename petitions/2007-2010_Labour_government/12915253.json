            "background": "Many secondary schools and even some primary schools insist on a school uniform which has the school badge on everything.  Parents have no choice but to pay the ridiculous charges for these.  The costs are much higher than what we would pay elsewhere or indeed expect to pay.\n\nWe should be able to buy the colours of the uniform from any supplier we choose.  Ties for a school are understandable but the others are insane. \n\nParents are struggling to cope with the pressure of paying for things, yet we are forced to pay these.  What happened to our rights to be able to find cheaper alternatives as we all do for electricity, clothing etc? \n\nEducation is meant to be free in the UK for children but it's not, when, if you don't buy the school's overpriced uniforms directly from the school, then your child will not be able to attend.  This infringes on our consumer rights as well as the rights of our children to an education that is meant to be free.  \n\nAsda, Matalan and Tesco etc advertise cheap school uniforms?  We, however cannot take advantage of these low prices which is unfair and puts huge stress and financial strain on Parents.",
