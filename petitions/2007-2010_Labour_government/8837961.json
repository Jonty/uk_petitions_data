Yet they have charitable tax and rates status due to historic anomalies. They are unaccountable and pay very high fees and salaries to unelected Directors and senior staff. They are aggressively driven by profit not charitable service. \n\nThe substantial tax revenue they avoid should be used for the general good, not for the benefit of their Directors and senior management.",
