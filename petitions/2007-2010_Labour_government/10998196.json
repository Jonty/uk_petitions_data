            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "An excerpt from the HM Customs and Excise guidelines for VAT :  \u201cThe reduced rate of VAT (5%) applies to the supply of any sanitary protection product that is designed and marketed for the absorption or collection of menstrual flow or lochia\n(discharge from the womb following childbirth). Examples include: sanitary towels; sanitary pads; panty liners that are not designed as incontinence products; sanitary belts for use with looped towels or pads; tampons; keepers (internal devices for the collection of menstrual flow); and maternity pads for the collection of lochia.\u201d\n\nFeminine hygiene products are not a luxury so why are women taxed on them? They are a necessity for women of child bearing age - on average women menstruate 400 to 500 times in their lifetime how much revenue does that generate for the Government?  It is an injustice that women are forced to pay an extra 5% on a product that is a NECESSITY.  To tax women in such a way is discriminatory and it needs to stop now.",
