            "background": "Many people are amazed to learn that people who draw up Wills do not need any training or qualifications. Disgraced solicitors and financial advisers, criminals and people who were yesterday plying a completely different trade can (and do) set themselves up as \u2018Professional Willwriters\u2019.\nSince 1991 the Institute of Professional Willwriters (IPW) has provided a voluntary, self regulatory regime to increase standards within the sector. Members must pass examinations, have insurance and CRB checks and complete ongoing training.\nSadly, less than 25% of Willwriters have submitted themselves to the tests and standards of IPW membership.\nGovernment accepts there are problems with the sector and says that voluntary self regulation is the best solution. The IPW has provided voluntary regulation for 16 years and the issues still persist!!!\nThe IPW calls on the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor to regulate the provision of Willwriting services \u2013 just like most other legal or financial services.",
