        "background": "From November, any lone parent with a child of 12 will HAVE to go out to work instead of looking after their children, in most cases this means children of 12 will be completely left to look after themselves.\n\nLooking after children IS a full time job, that I for one would say is far more important than ANY other. If it isn't done right, the whole future is affected, and we're already seeing signs of that!\n\nOr the parent can stay at home and lose benefits, fall more into poverty.\n\nFrom 2010 the age is set to lower to 7!\n\nDon't we already have enough of a problem with feral youths? Yet the parents who DO want to bring up their children properly are having that right taken away.\n\nHuman rights are held dearly by our polititions... providing it's human rights for criminals etc!\n\nWhere are the childrens human rights, the right to a family life?",
