            "background": "As of 1/12/08, VAT was reduced to 15%. The flat rate scheme however was only reduced by 1.5%. For every \u00a31000 pounds invoiced net of VAT, small service companies availing of the Flat Rate Scheme at 13% (reduced to 11.5%) are now \u00a34.50 worse off.\n\nI quote \"Alongside the temporary reduction of the standard rate of VAT, the government will also amend the sectoral rates of the VAT flat-rate scheme in line with the standard rate reduction, allowing 180,000 small businesses in the scheme to benefit,\"\n\nIn fact, a service company turning over \u00a3150,000 per year will be \u00a3675 worse off. I propose that the PM and Mr Darling examine this and put in place changes to the Flat Rate percentages so that they keep their promises. I also want any changes back dated to 1/12/08.",
