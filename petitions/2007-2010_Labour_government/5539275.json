            "background": "Key Stage Three children are often expected to complete homework from nearly all subjects over the curriculum and although it seems petty if they cannot reach these \"simple\" standards, a minority of children have recently informed me that they genuinely cannot keep up with the homework and constantly face homework detentions. These children are stereotypically are the more disruptive of the class but the children in question were genuinely hard workers who suffered only because of their home lifestyle. I am aware that action is taken when children are possibly from broken homes etcetera, but when those children have their homework amount decreased other children feel angered. I therefore ask that you will attempt to influence schools that they minorly decrease the amount of homework that is issued to keystage three, We understand it may not be possible to restrict homework from all schools so strong influencing would be strongly appreciated. Abolishing it completely is not what we seek - we simply want it decreased.",
