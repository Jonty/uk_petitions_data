            "background": "We, the undersigned, being residents of Llanfaes, Brecon, Powys, wish to object to the proposed Powys County Council (Off-street parking places) order 2009; in so far as it applies to the parking places in Orchard Street and Duckham's Yard, Brecon; on at least one of the following grounds, as indicated:\n1. We use the car parks for the purposes of residential parking, as there is either  no provision for parking or insufficients provision for parking on the street outside our properties\n2. Implementation of the order will push current residential users of the car park to use the already insufficient provision of on street parking on and around the proposed sites\n3. Increase in the number of cars parked in the street will result in increased hazards for road users and pedestrians alike\n4. People who use the car park to avoid the town centre parking charges will use the current available roadside parking during the day, or park in side streets off the main thoroughfare, causing further obstructions for local residents and motorists\n5. Patrons of local businesses may attempt to avoid charges by parking inconsiderately on the roads",
