            "background": "Under currant law all private hire vehicles which have the capacity to carry 8 or more passengers plus the driver fall under currant PCV legislation. There are aproximatly TEN THOUSAND Limos in this country that fall under this legislation. Less than ONE percent have the correct MOT, which is an offence Under section 47 of the road traffic act 1988, They also require a CERTIFICATE OF INITIAL FITNESS. If a private hire vehicle in this class does not have a COIF it is in contravention of the PUBLIC PASSENGER ACT 1981. it also voids any Insurance.\nI would like you to question both the police and VOSA as to why they are failing to inforce these laws. is it incomputance or corruption.\nI beleive the above is a case of Proffesional Misconduct\nand they are both failing miserably in there duty of care to the public. and putting childerens lives at risk",
