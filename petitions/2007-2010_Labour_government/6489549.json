            "background": "I would like to see a total review of planning policies in North Norfolk. More and more local people are being forced out of North Norfolk as they cannot afford to purchase a house on an average Norfolk wage and are getting no help whatsoever from local planners, where planning policy favours holiday homes over houses for local residents.\n\nFor instance, I would be allowed to build a garage and convert it to a holiday home but planning policy will not allow me to build a permanent home on a site that previously had OPP to build one on it under the old policy! Even the support of the Town Council and the local community has not made any difference as the LPA insist on following policy.\n\nI request that the Government review my case and policy, as to date no-one is interested, yet this policy is destroying local communities and family life in North Norfolk.",
