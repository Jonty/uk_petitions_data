The patronising act of \"registering\" disabled people and their details was thankfully rescinded by the Disability Discrimination Act, allowing disabled people to self-identify if they met the criteria. We should not introduce any card which disabled people will come under pressure to carry for fear of being deemed not really disabled, this is a backward step and the idea in trial should be dropped immediately as discriminatory and offensive.",
