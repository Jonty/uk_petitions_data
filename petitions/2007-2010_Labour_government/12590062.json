            "background": "With current housing prices it is very hard for a first time home buyer to get on the market.\nwith the real average working wadge being below \u00a320k per year its very hard for first time buyers to pull together a 10%-15% deposit to lay down on a property, but the real problem is trying to find real affordable housing.\n\nWith my experiance being a first time buyer looking for affordable housing it usually comes down to reposesion properties.\n\nThe big problem is with Housing developers, When i am trying to purchase a reposetion affordable house and offer the full asking price, i have been let down on mutlipul properties due to housing developers offering the full asking price in cash.\n\nSo for the vendor trying to reclaim lost monies they have always choosen the cash buyer.\n\nThe house then come back on the market a few months later at a price no longer available to a first time buyer.\n\nThe Proposal is to make all reposetions under \u00a3100,000 only avaiable to first time buyer looking to make a home.\nNot to housing developers just looking to make a profit.",
