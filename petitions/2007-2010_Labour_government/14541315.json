            "background": "The student loan repayments in past years have varied from 4.8% to the current 0% interest rate. Media portray this is a good loan rate but in fact it is another hurdle to prevent under privileged students from obtaining social mobility. At the highest point of interest on a \u00a314k loan this would equate to an annual interest payment of \u00a3672.00. On a salary of \u00a316k a year total repayments would be \u00a3270.00. On a salary of \u00a330k total annual repayment would be \u00a31350.00. The interest equating to nearly 50% of the annual repayments made. The debt level, total interest paid for the life of the loan and time to clear the debt is excessive and equates to a mortgage. No student will complain for repaying the loan but a fair and reasonable chance at it would be nice!",
