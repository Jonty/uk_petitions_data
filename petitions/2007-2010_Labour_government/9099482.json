            "background": "AOL today reports that,\n\n\"The proportion of assets pension schemes hold in shares dropped for the eighth consecutive year during 2007, falling from 62.7% to just 55.1%, according to BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.\"\n\nThe pensions advice I received was illegally misconstrued and I now am confused about my entitlements. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to isntill better regulation of ndependent financial companies, who advertise and advise without proper supervision, just to boost business, taking into account the following report, that, \n\n\"The fall was driven by schemes reducing their holdings of UK equities, with these falling from 34.4% in 2006 to 28.7% last year, but the proportion of assets invested in global equities was also down from 28.3% to 26.4%.\"\n\nInstead pension schemes increased their holdings in bonds and index-linked investments, after certain bonds surged in value in recent years.",
