            "background": "For too long now the cash cow for the government, that is we motorists have paid too much in taxes for very little in return just look at the state of our roads. So i feel aggrieved that we have to support the payment of criminal fines to compensate their victims. The victims deserve their money but not by punishing us motorists for someone elses crime. Surely the punishment is in the sentence and the criminal must be made fully accountable. Once again this government are trying to hit the easy target rather than face up to the reality that their laws are inadequate to hit the criminal hard if they don't comply. Even the magistrates are against this crazy idea and thy're the ones who deal with this day in day out. please support this petition.",
