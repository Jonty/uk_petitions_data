        "background": "It has been brought to my attention that the environmental lobbyists are petitioning for legislation to prevent the use and sale of carbon fibre goods in non essential circumstances. This would have a detrimental effect on the sports industry, affecting cyclists, racket sports, motorsport fans, especially F1, motorcyclists, and the sailing fraternity.\n\nWe are in the middle of a financial crisis, why is it that Politicians and pressure groups do not look at the bigger picture and see the financial benefit that Carbon fibre brings to the UK economy?\n\nWe request the that this legislation is not brought in banning the use and sale of carbon fibre for these purposes.",
