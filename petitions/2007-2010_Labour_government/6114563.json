            "background": "If bicycles were invented now, no sane government would allow them to be used. Unprotected bodies, travelling at speed on a 2-wheeled vehicle which can be upset by a wet manhole - any official would reject this idea out of hand. The only reason we allow bicycles is that they have been around for more than a century and we have all got used to them.\n\nBicycles are dangerous to all road users, are frequently ridden recklessly, and cause a disproportionate number of deaths and serious injuries. Their removal would benefit everyone.",
