        "background": "To give parents a tax refund at least equivalent to the cost of state education in order to boost the private education sector & ancillary industries as well as education standards.\nBritain's education standards should not be seen to be falling even below those of third world countries such as India.\nBy refunding those families who opt for private education, the government will be supporting private industry in these current times of severe recession. Also, Private education will then be encouraged to improve.\nAllow people, who opt for private education to have a rebate against their tax paid in respect of the cost of state education.\nThe government should not want to be seen to be supporting the erosion of state education & so would like to be seen to be happy to support private education alternatives.",
