            "background": "Under the current council tax system anyone who is working but wishing to live with friends who are still studying, often at Ph.D or MA/MsC level has to pay full council tax for a house of up to 4 or 5 people as all the students are exempted.\n\nThis is totally ridiculous and unfair.  In a rented property that is partly working people, partly students those working should only pay the percentage they would pay if everyone was working, e.g in a 4 bedroomed house one working person living with 3 students would pay 25%, or 2 working people living in a 6 person house would pay 16.7% each.\n\nThis is a much fairer system as otherwise a young professional who is probably not earning more than \u00a320,000 p/a has to pay a huge sum of money for a 4 or 5 bedroomed house.  The only alternative being to find other people to live with and not live with their friends as they wish which is a restriction on liberty and is also unfair.\n\nThis petition also calls to reassess other irregularities in the council tax such as the amount paid by senior citizens or other people on low incomes.",
