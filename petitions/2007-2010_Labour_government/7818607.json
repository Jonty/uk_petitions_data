            "background": "Ama Sumani is a 39 year old widow from Ghana who is terminally ill with cancer.  She has been deported from the UK because she over-stayed her student visa.  She was removed from hospital in Cardiff to facilitate her derportation, with the assurance that continuing treatment will be available in Ghana.  Korle-Bu training hospital in Accra, Ghana has requested payment of \u00a32,000 as a deposit for 3 (three) months' treatment.  Ama does not have this money, and the UK government has not made the funds available.\nThe actions of the UK Immigration and Nationality Department are effectively a death sentence for Ama Sumani.  As an act of common humanity, we call on the UK government to bring Ama Sumani back to the UK to complete her treatment.",
