            "background": "At present, the RSPCA is the only animal welfare organization that has the legal right to remove animals from cruel owners (not that they do a particularly effective job!). Carers working in other National Rescue Centres see a lot of neglect and cruelty but are stopped from doing anything about it apart from report it to the RSPCA, who usually do nothing apart from \"monitor\". That animal is still suffering!\nWe need the rights and the Law behind us to stamp out animal neglect as soon as we are aware of it.\nGive I.E. The National Animal Welfare Trust, The Dogs Trust, Cats Protection etc, the same right to enter a property and remove an abused, neglected animal as the RSPCA... Help ALL animal welfare organizations to reach out to abused, defenceless creatures legally.",
