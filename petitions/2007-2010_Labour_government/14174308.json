            "background": "Since this new system has been put in thousands of landlords have lost money. Including the one I work for. Our tenants even believe that the money should be paid directly to landlords as they say the do not want the temptation of \u00a3200 in there account every week.\n\nWhen a tenant leaves they use their LHA payments as a down payment on another property as a lot of our tenants do.\n\nThe councils that we deal with on a day to day basis are useless and the tenant has to be eight weeks in arrears before you can get direct payment so two months at least of no money for a property with commitments like mortgage payments and insurance and the new selective licensing scheme we have no money left.\n\nIts not fair on the tax payer that our money goes on new tv's for the jobless who even though live rent free find a way of swindling our money because it goes straight into their banks. \n\nDo not let taxpayers money fall into the wrong hands. \n\nSo please sign my petition to stop giving pocket money to those who do not deserve it lets save this government money.",
