        "background": "Greater London is suffering from a transport system designed 1880-1910, with most routes in and out of Central London, but very little across. In 1930's London Transport (LT), attempted 3 circle lines and the abundance of trams complimented travel. Backward looking cutting of trams will not provide sufficient vision for London, especially with 2012 Olympics. London needs a complete overhaul of transport with straight tube tunnels, fast trains and an overground network of trams (preferable to buses to get people from East to West etc).\nIn view of this, I want to ask the Prime Minister to encourage the London Mayor to restart the intended 1930's LT progamme which included\n1) four tunnels for each line (two fast, two stopping services, one of each in each direction)\n2) completion of 3 circular lines to enable people to commute around and across the city rather than just in and out.\n3) Even without the Olympics, London's transport system is ailing. It needs construction expansion now.",
