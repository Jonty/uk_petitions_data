        "background": "The real question here is: how much is safety really worth? I believe all buses should have seatbelts available like any other form of transport does. I believe they do not have seatbelts due to the large sum of money it would cost to have seatbelts added to the buses. Surely your child should be sent to school safely, and surely this means by wearing a seatbelt? How are you to bring up your child explaining they have to wear seatbelts and then stick them on a school or public bus that doesnt have seatbelts? I would feel safer on a bus wearing a seatbelt.",
