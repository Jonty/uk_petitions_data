            "background": "From looking at the NSPCC Website it it clear that more and more children each day are enduring online abuse from other people across the country.  The Government should in coherence with looking at domestic abuse of children try and do more about this issue as it destroys lives of so many young innocent children.  I believe that this type of abuse and any other type of abuse is unforgivable and should be dealt with as soon as possible before anymore lives are ruined.  When this abuse happens and children do not feel that they can cope with this then they take their own lives which in turn hinders any development to a country as these young people are part of the next generation.  I pledge people to sign this petition as it is an extremley important issue",
