            "background": "I feel that all bus routes need to be made more accessible for the elderly and disabled. This is because i am disabled myself and don't find it as easy as a person who is normal i.e who walks normally, to catch a bus that is disabled and elderly user friendly. All i feel needs to be done is all bus company's have hydrolics in the wheels to lower the bus to pavement height so the elderly can walk straight on instead of walking up steps and a built in floor ramp for disabled wheelchair users so the wheelchair user can get on the bus without any help, only help for lowering the ramps. Please make this happen as i and i am sure other people with this situation want more freedom and accessibility.",
