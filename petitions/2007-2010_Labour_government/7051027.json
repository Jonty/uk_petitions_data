            "background": "At the moment the law is very one sided and favours the masturbator. I believe that a man who abandons this habit can becomer keener of mind, and more determined. The heavy masturbator by contrast is sluggish and out of shape. I think that a change in the law, reflecting these observations, could help discourage the practice. I mean this only to cover male masturbation.",
