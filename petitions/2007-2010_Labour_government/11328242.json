            "background": "Many times I have read that other countries have designed and built infrastructure (ie airports, rail links, power stations) whilst similar projects in the UK can get bogged down by local planning considerations for years. We need major investment in our country, a status of National Project over-riding local planning considerations and all the \u201cNIMBY\u201d objectors for the benefit of the greater population should be brought into law. We need to deal with this known problem, the green energy industry needs empowering, there are new airport runways required, as well as new rail links and nuclear power stations. National Project status would allow these developments time to be undertaken in a realistic time frame.",
