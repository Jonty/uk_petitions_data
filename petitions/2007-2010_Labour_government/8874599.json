        "background": "On the A6, just south of Belper town centre, stand the magnificent Herbert Strutt School buildings. This petition is in support of a campaign by the people of Belper to ensure that the school site remains within the community and the original spirit of the Herbert Strutt Grammar School; a place of community and education is retained for the people of the area.\n\nThe school faces the main A6 at the heart of the World Heritage Site and is formed by a group of Grade Two listed buildings. The buildings themselves are of significance, but the history of the site and its link to the Strutt family within Belper increases its importance even further.\n\nA plea from the heart: if you have any interest in this building, its pupils, its history or the town of Belper and would like to help save this building for us all. Please sign the petition, for more information please use your favourite search engine to search for Belper Civic Forum and Strutts.",
