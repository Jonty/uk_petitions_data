        "background": "As an ex Family Caseworker I am shocked by the brutality of SS involvment in this couples family life. in 2010 surely SS should be providing love and all needed support to this couple to allow them at least the chance to try to bring up their new born son themselves? Is this not discrimination against mums with a disability? Please everyone who has a shred of horror at how it must feel to have your new born taken from you and then placed with an unknown woman and only allowed to visit for an hour per day, what must this poor mum do for the other 23hrs? This is not Britain as I wish to know it.",
