Is this not discrimination against mums with a disability? Please everyone who has a shred of horror at how it must feel to have your new born taken from you and then placed with an unknown woman and only allowed to visit for an hour per day, what must this poor mum do for the other 23hrs? This is not Britain as I wish to know it.",
