        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Staff who have served in the NHS over a considerable period of time seem to go unrecognized and their loyalty seems to be taken for granted, especially nurses and doctors who are expected to work and serve in the NHS after qualification, but porters, domestics, catering staff and all the other support ancillary staff are also taken for granted, because they work in the background in a supporting role are perceived as second class workers within the NHS, for a doctor or a nurse to do 30 years is one thing, but for a porter or a domestic to do 30 years service on low pay is commendable, there is no better time than this the 50th year of the NHS to recognise all those staff regardless of their social standing within the NHS with a medal for their loyalty,it could be named the Bevan medal.",
