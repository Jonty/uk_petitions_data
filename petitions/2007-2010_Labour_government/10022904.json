            "background": "Residents of the UK (and Europe) have seen the biggest rise in fuel for some time. Other nations bind together and rebel, but here, in the UK we stand back and watch. Now is the time for the United Kingdom to unite, to stand up and be counted for what affects every single resident of this country in one way or another. We must stand up, be counted and let the Government know that we will no longer be treated in this way. The rapid rise in fuel costs is not acceptable and now is the time for the UK to unite once more as we have done in previous times of hardship and join together in a NATIONAL STRIKE, throughout communities, across industries throughout the land. Only then will the Government realise that the members of this great nation really care about what the United Kingdom once stood for and stop ripping off the people that love this country. Please sign this petition and and show your support for a NATIONAL STRIKE ON Wednesday September 10th 2008",
