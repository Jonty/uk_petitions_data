Woolworths has been on our high street supplying the citizens of Britain for 100 years with everything they need for their household. It is where most start their working career as a saturday worker whilst at school and we feel that the government should help us keep it that way for the next generation. Please lets not add to the unemployment crisis by leaving thousands of Woolworths workers jobless, lets keep Woolies British!",
