            "background": "The Plain English Campaign was one of the successes of the NHS Modernisation Agenda, when literary experts became involved in helping the general public to find their away around public places, de - mystifying professional terminologies ... therapies, eutics and isms ... so useful in emergencies, when people are vulnerable, in crisis, away from home, disorientated and sometimes confused. But the sign - posting policy differs between hospitals. The petitioner is calling on the DoH to consider the above changes - whereby signs say Ward 4 - cardio - vascular and include a picture of a heart ... \nward 5  - paediatrics and a picture of a teddy bear, say. I think this would be a good idea in a multi - lingual society. Hospital staff should not assume everyone who walks in through the door knows where they are.",
