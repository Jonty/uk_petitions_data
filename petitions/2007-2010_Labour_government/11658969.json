        "background": "More in the current crisis than ever the consumer's right to choose should be protected. Many of us join banks,elect to use gas, electric or telephone services only to find when we contact the call centre number we are transported half way round the world and subjected to a less than proficient standard of English. While banks like Nat West promote their use of UK call centres many others keep quiet. I believe that everyone living in the UK has a right to know where their point of telephone contact will actually be before they sign to anything. This should apply to all advertising and be under the phone number. The consumer has a right to be able to choose to back Britain and the EU rather than support foreign economies.",
