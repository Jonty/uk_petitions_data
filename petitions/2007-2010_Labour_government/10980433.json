This disgusting display was paid for by taxpayers money, with Mr Ross's \u00a36m salary seeming obscene during the current credit crisis.\n\nWe demand a full investigation carried out by OfCom and the police, and that the BBC issue a televised apology to the nation for making us pay for this vile stunt.",
