        "background": "Once apon a time it was necessary to add value to the country and protect its citizens to be eligible for a Knighthood. The Prime Minister now includes the requirement that you actively support groups who conspire to murder its citizens.  Ted Kennedy throughout the 70's and 80's actively supported groups whose sole purpose was to financially support IRA families. This support enabled the IRA to continue its muder campaign against UK citizens for a longer period than would otherwise have happened and contributed to the number of deaths on both sides.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that the US Government would have rewarded people who financially supported the families of the 911 bombers - so why does the UK Prime Minister believe that we should reward similar people.",
