The undersigned urge Lafarge to spend some money on equipment to stop the factory belching that \"sulphur-like\" smelling smoke from the chimney. The Environment Agency has given Lafarge a number of warnings about pollution issues but does not seem to take action about the smell problem, we feel they should take action as soon as possible.",
