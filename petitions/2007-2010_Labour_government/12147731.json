            "background": "On Friday 13/03/09 PCS members at Deptford Jobcentre Plus were advised that it was likely that the Deptford Job Centre would close, as the lease is due to expire in November 2009. Lewisham Council have major plans to redevelop Deptford town centre and planning permission has been granted to build a restaurant and private flats on the site currently occupied by Jobcentre Plus. JCP have told PCS that they will continue to look for suitable alternatives in the Deptford area. However they also have a contingency plan, which involves moving work from Deptford to the Lewisham and Forest Hill Job Centres. Jobcentre Plus and LSTrillium must be made to find suitable alternative accommodation in the Deptford area, in line with their contractual obligations. The last thing people in Deptford need is the closure of their Job Centre. PCS will be campaigning over the coming months to ensure that an adequate public service is maintained within the area and we firmly believe this means a permanent Job Centre, located in Deptford, providing a full range of services.",
