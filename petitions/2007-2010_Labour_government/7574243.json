            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As the only shareholder the government should make certain that the consultation period is not a sham and that the views of postal workers who have paid in to the scheme are taken on board.\n\nFor many workers it was compulsory to enter into the Royal Mail pension scheme and the trust deed guaranteed that the employer, would make good any deficit.\n\nAgainst the background of the Royal Mail board proposing to introduce an inferior scheme for the front line staff, senior Royal Mail managers have had their own pension scheme improved. With this in mind Postal Workers would expect similar respect for their future pension provision.\n\nIn conclusion, the current proposals are unacceptable and we expect the government to guarantee that Royal Mail will negotiate with the Communication Workers Union on any pension reforms. Any final agreement must be subject to a binding ballot of the members in the scheme.",
