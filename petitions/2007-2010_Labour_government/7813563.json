In addition  the case It is now to be held in at the International Dispute Resolution Centre at 70 Fleet Street, EC4Y1EU and not at the High Court.\n There are only 11 places for press and public. Entry is going to be on a first come first serve basis but it will be divided equally between the public and press.\n Passes will be issued separately for morning and afternoon sessions. This will mean that it is going to be impossible for one person whether public or press to get the full picture of the case.\nGiven the public and press interest in this case we petition the governhment to  hold this important trial in a venue that is large enough to allow adequate public access.",
