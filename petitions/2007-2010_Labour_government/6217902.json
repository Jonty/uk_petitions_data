            "background": "To reduce the levels of violence on our streets and deaths caused by teenagers in gangs. I suggest the re-introduction of a National Military service which will instill into our youth a sense of respect for themselves and others. To give them a sense of worth, pride and self esteem in what they do. Thus removing the attitude of NOTHING to do, nowhere to go! hanging around the streets and getting themselves and others into trouble. Causing mayhem to law abiding citizens. All of us can then be proud of our young citizens, more importantly they will be proud of themselves serving their Country.",
