            "background": "There is a closed season for fresh water fishing, so why shouldn't marine wildlife get the same protection?\n\nI am not suggesting that it should last for a long time, just a couple of months, at a well chosen time of year, would allow fish and other wildlife to recouperate.\n\nThis would not only help to ensure the protection of sea species, many of which have numbers that are already dwindling. But would also mean that anglers would enjoy better fising during the rest of the year!!",
