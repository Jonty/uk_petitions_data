I think that courts should have the power to stop an absent parent from seeing the child in question if no payment/commitment is made by the absent parent. I think its disgusting my ex gets the same rights and never pays a peeny and he works full time and also gets legal aid my husband defends our country i have a disabled son and dont get help/legal aid.",
