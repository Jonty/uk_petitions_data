He flew back to the UK on Friday June 5,but as the plane landed to re-fuel Taran collapsed and fell into a coma from which he never woke up again. Taran has been ommitted from the roll of honour, while also being snubbed by his home town who will not include him on their Mansfield Heroes memorial. I have also learned that Tay will not be included in the 4 Rifles fallen boards either. Our son died serving his Queen and Country and this is how is repaid.",
