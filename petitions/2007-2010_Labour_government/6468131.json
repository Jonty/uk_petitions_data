            "background": "The effective nationalisation of Northern Rock plc in September 2007 and the Bank of England's contradictory policy messages and actions in response to the credit crisis suggest political interference in the Bank's independence. This petition aims to highlight the risk of losing central bank independence in the U.K. under a Gordon Brown-led government. It invites the current government to makes itself publicly accountable in relation to non-interference with monetary policy.",
