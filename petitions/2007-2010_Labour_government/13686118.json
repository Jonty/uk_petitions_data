        "background": "Whatever valuation an agent originally gives should become the basis for a sale to that agent if they fail to sell the house within three months.\n\nIf the house in question fails to sell, the owner may then require the agent to buy it at their own valuation (less say 5% for admin costs) and, the agent would be required to complete the purchase within 1 month. This would take the marketing process to a maximum total of four months per property which is a sensible amount of time for vendors.\nIt would also encourage agents to keep \u2018their pencils sharp\u2019 when doing so-called \u2018Free Market Appraisals\u2019 instead of just bidding to secure more houses to sell.\n\nTo implement this all that is needed is an additional clause in the agency contract, setting out the agreed timescale for the agent to purchase.\n\nTrading Standards would police this.\n\nIf asking prices were to be correctly pitched, the whole house market would start rolling once more. It really is that simple.\n\nFor more info see the Property Match Blog.",
