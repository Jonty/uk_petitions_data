        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If more people knew that there were about 3 Ice hockey leagues in England and countless more in the UK maybe there would be bigger crowds at games. Then maybe more kids would want to play it and more money would put into it.\n\nTeam GB narrowly missed out on a bronze medal in the recent Euro Challenge. \nIf there was more funding for hockey that would mean better training facilities and better equipment.\n\nIn school they teach about diversity in life and part of life is sport so why not teach about diversity in sport? Ice hockey, lacrosse etc\nInstead it\u2019s mainly football, rugby, tennis and badminton.\n\nIce hockey might not be everybody\u2019s cup of tea but, if there was more funding available and Ice hockey was more publicised, I believe people would cheer on team GB and the other teams in the UK like their favourite football team.",
