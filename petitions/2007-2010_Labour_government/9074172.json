        "background": "We would like to change the law to stop discrimination in the workplace, based on appearance. \n\nThis includes people with visible tattoos and piercings (including facial, arms, neck etc) and hair colour. We feel that if it doesn't conflict with health and safety regulations, (i.e. facial piercings when working in close proximity with fresh food) or is offensive, (i.e. racist tattoos), it should be made illegal to refuse someone a job, based on the above descriptions.\n\nBritain is quickly becoming more modern, and now, a majority of people within Britain have at least 1 tattoo or visible piercing; but we feel that British law hasn\u2019t yet caught up.\n\nAs it stands, we are currently providing bigots with an excuse to be prejudiced towards people within certain subcultures. We already have in place, laws associated with disability, race and age within our working society. Please sign, to give people the fair treatment that they deserve.",
