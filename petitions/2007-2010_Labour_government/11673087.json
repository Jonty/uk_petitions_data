            "background": "Croft circuit (DL2 2PN) has lost its appeal against having to pay damages to three people who claim their lives have been affected by 'noise nuisance', leaving its future in jeopardy.\n\nA local family live within 300 metres of the circuit in Dalton-on-Tees for several years, but took a case to the High Court last year claiming to be victims of 'noise nuisance'.\n\nThe judge ruled in their favour, ordering the circuit's promoters Croft Promo-Sport Ltd to pay the family \u00a3149,600.\n\nNow, Croft Promo-Sport Ltd have lost their appeal to dismiss the order and have the damages, which include a reported \u00a3700,000 bill of legal costs, reduced. \n\nFurther research suggests that the action of the family is not due to the alleged noise nuisance but a way to extract money from the circuit, coincidentally a workplace of a family members former husband.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind the action, it is unreasonable and indeed immoral that someone is able to move in to a property within a few hundred meters of an established motor racing venue then complain about noise.",
