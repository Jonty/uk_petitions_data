        "background": "I would like to reccomend that the unemployed or people claiming Job Seekers Allowance within the UK get chosen to undertake \"Jury Service\". This would certainly solve the issues of complications with time off work for the full time employed and would assist the unemployed financially and in terms of social interaction. \n\nDue to the current economic climate I reccomend these comments are taken on board. I appreciate a complete cross section of people are needed for Jury service but unemployed should be considered and included first.",
