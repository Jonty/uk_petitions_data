I am outraged to think that those professionals who 'misread' his pain as normal behaviour may get away with a formal reprimand. Therefore, I believe that if there is evidence which proves that an individuals negligence contributed to a furtherance of Baby P's torture and agonising death, they should face criminal prosecution without delay. I don't want the people involved, however high up, to be shielded by a system which is so obviously flawed.",
