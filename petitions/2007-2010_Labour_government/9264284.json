            "background": "People who use 'only' the middle lane of the motorway (middle-lane hoggers) are dangerous drivers. They force people who are trying to overtake them into the outside lane (the fast lane). Sometimes drivers have no option other to under-take them. Most of the time, these people seem completely unaware of their bad driving. The highway code gives clear instructions on how to drive on motorways. These people seem uaware of this and should be penalised.",
