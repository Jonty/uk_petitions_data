            "background": "BT Wholesale has introduced a \u00a333.75 (excl VAT) cease charge on broadband end users. Without clearly notifying the public, this means that when you disconnect your Broadband internet connection from a BT-owned line, you will be charged! This also applies if you change phone numbers, like when moving. This is outrageous fee and must be stopped. No one should be charged a disconnection fee. The Government must stop BT from charging this fee which is virtually unknown to the users of the internet. This new fee was introduced in mid 2007, and may be hidden in fine print in your internet service provider legal information if you look carefully.\nMost ISPs just pass this new cease fee on to their customers, as it is a fee that has been imposedd on them by BT.",
