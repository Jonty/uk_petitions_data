        "background": "The death of Baby P was tragic, and should be thoroughly investigated. Anybody involved in his care found to have committed negligence or misconduct should face disciplinary action.\n\nHowever, we utterly condemn the witch hunt that has sprung up among the media and on the internet. Professionals, especially social workers, have been named and vilified before the investigation has even begun. This is wrong. \n\nIn some cases social workers had recommended that the child be take into care, but were overruled by their superiors. This has not stopped them from being publicly crucified for failings that may not have been theirs.\n\nSocial workers have a vital role in protecting children and vulnerable adults, and the social work profession needs talented, capable individuals to join their ranks. This kind of public witch hunt will act as a very real deterrent to anybody considering joining the profession.",
