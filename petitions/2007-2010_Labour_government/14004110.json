            "background": "Thousands of people, employed in the Financial Services Industry, can see the writing on the wall for the end of affordable Independent Financial Advice and the loss of skills and experience from our industry that will inevitably be the main result from the proposed RDR in its present form.  The same voices were raised with the regard to Stakeholder Pensions; we weren\u2019t listened to then and the results speak for themselves. Let us hope we are heard this time and the right action is taken.\n \nWe the undersigned implore the government to have an all party review of the cost to the industry in both monetary terms and lost skills and the detrimental ramifications to the consumer by a reduction in the availability of advice in an affordable format.",
