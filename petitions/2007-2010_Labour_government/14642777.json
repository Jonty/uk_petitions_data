All Gamekeepers should have the power to conviscate these materials but currently NO Gamekeepers are allowed to conviscate Poachers firearms. Gamekeepers should have the right to conviscate Poachers friearms, this is why I have created this petition in the request for Game Kepers to have more power.",
