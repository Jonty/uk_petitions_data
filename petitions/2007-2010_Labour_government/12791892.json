The British Public did not vote Gordon Brown as the voice of our nation!! It's as bad as Russia, just giving control to whoever has helped current leader the most( No, worse than Russia, because at least Russia does not pretend to be interested in doing what the public want!) What qualifies Gordon Brown to hold the highest office?(lets not forget HE WAS the Chancellor, it was HIS budgets and handling of money that have led US into the 'Credit Crunch'), and now HE will do the same thing to the country!( I wonder how long until HE signs US into the Euro Currency? Telling US that it is most economically viable in these financially dark days!)Did HE not sign away OUR liberties by signing US into the EU Treaty? Something that the man that WAS elected always promised us a Referendum on!! I think it Stinks!!",
