            "background": "The income tax is a form of slavery and is against the 10th commandment (thou shall not covet thy neighbor's goods).\n\nOur present course of ever increasing debt and economic growth, is unsustainable, scrapping the income tax and taxing consumption will help to put the country, and the world, on a more sustainable path.\n\nAlso, people will be given a choice as to whether they pay the tax, rather than being forced to pay it. \n\nThe income tax is a violation of human rights as a person\u2019s time is his or her own to spend as he or she wishes, whether at leisure, for pleasure, or to exchange their time and skills for money or material goods. Any tax on wages (the money a person chooses to exchange for their time and skill) is therefore, quite clearly, a blatant violation of their human right to spend their time here according to their own wishes",
