        "background": "You have tried to answer the basic request to scrap speed cameras but have totally ignored the rest of the petition, is this a sign of the new Brown government?\n\nYou state that speeding is a contributory factor in 26% of fatal accidents, can you please indicate what was the ACTUAL factor in these accidents - I doubt it was speed.\n\nYou give examples of what happens to a child at different speeds when they are hit by a car.  What happens to the child if they are taught and educated not to run out in the road in the first place - NOTHING as they are not hit by any car!  If they are too young to understand this then they must be restricted by the parents like my two children are.  Also what has happened to the Green Cross Code man??  \n\nWe need more traffic police on the roads, not cameras.  We need to stop all the un-taxed, un-insured, un-MOTed, un-licensed and banned drivers that are on our roads today.  When will the government wake up to the fact that cameras will not stop these people.",
