            "background": "Gary Barlow is one of the finest singer/songwriters in the history of British pop music. He has penned some of the finest songs of the last 20 years including 'Pray', 'A Million Love Songs' and 'Back For Good'.\n\nUnlike the majority of manufactured popstars of the present day, Gary is unique in that he writes, sings and plays piano- all to an exceptionally high standard. He is also an extremely underrated dancer and good-looking to boot. There are very few popstars, if any, that have such a wide range of talents. \n\nGary has always conducted himself with dignity and integrity. He has never been associated with the typical scandals that many popstars seem to be constantly linked with such as adultery, violence, drink and drugs. He is a clearly devoted husband and father and an excellent role-model for all his fans.",
