            "background": "Although the Veterans Badge is worn with pride by Servicemen and Women up and down the country (it is really not enough for many as a Formal Veterans Medal would properly recognise Military Service to the Nation as a proper and thought out substantive award). Many Veterans have served the country for many years with honour and would appreciate Formal Recognition for their Military Service to their Country.\n\nI ask all Veterans out there to Petition the Prime Minister to put pressue on those who initiate medal awards to request Formal Recognition by way of a General Service Veterans Medal for all of us who have given years of dedicated Military Service To Their Country.  \n\nA Veterans Medal for Military Service to the Country should never relate to cost, it should be about the recognition of sacrifices made by all past veterans. It would not undermine those who served in Combat Zones but be well received by Veterans up and down the country as a thank you from the Nation. Please sign this petition to request a Formal Military Service Veterans Medal Award to wear alonside the Veterans Badge or on more formal occasions such as Armed Services Day.",
