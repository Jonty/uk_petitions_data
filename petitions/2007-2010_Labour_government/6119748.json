            "background": "Many women find that from shop to shop the size of clothing they buy can be completely different. In some instances, different ranges in the same shop can have different sizes, for instance a twelve in one range can be closer in size to a 10 in another. This forces women to choose a garment one or two sizes above their real size. Some women can end up buying clothes from a range of shops spanning three or more dress sizes. This encourages low self esteem and faddy and irregular eating patterns as women strive to fit into a smaller size. It can also exacerbate existing eating disorders. \nWe want there to be a standard sizing chart to ensure that a size 14 really is a size 14 and not a size 12 with a label reading size 14. Manufacturers should not be allowed to mis-size garments.",
