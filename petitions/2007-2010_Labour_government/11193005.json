            "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to use his good offices with the Department of Industry, Ministry of Defence and BAE Systems to resurrect the TSR2 Strike Bomber.\n\nSince the demise of this project in 1964 the RAF have been denied a viable long range strike bomber.  The TSR2 was decades ahead of its time; with modern, lighter avionics and systems a TSR2 for the 21st. Century could be relativel cheaply built.  Indeed a lot of the research from TSR2 led to Tornador and Typhoon aerodynamics; retrofitting their modern type of avionics into TSR2 would extend range and capability, saving weight over the original systems.\n\nIts is realised that the Government is in straightened times; however, in a world of increasing instability a practical strike weapon is a necessity, and the existing surviving airframes and be remodelled with modern techniques relatively cheaply; the research has already been done.\n\nThe big  advantage is that it would be a home grown world class product for the RAF that would be a figure head project the nation can take pride in and look forward to in these dark times.\n\nGive us a symbol of national pride.",
