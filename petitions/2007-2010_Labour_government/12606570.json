        "background": "The actions of some MPs concerning their expenses is now clearly so suspicious, that if they were ordinary members of the public they would be investigated by the police for criminal deception and kindred offences. MPs have stated on many occasions that they are not above the law. I therefore cannot understand why they are not being investigated by police for obtaining property (money) by deception, fraud, false accounting and misconduct in public office etc. In the interests of justice, democracy and public accountability they should be investigated by the police and criminal charges brought in appropriate cases.",
