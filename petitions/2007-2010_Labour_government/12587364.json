If that is the case, it is right to give them the opportunity to make suitable financial restitution to the taxpayer. Whether or not individual MPs avail themselves of this opportunity, it will not be unreasonable thereafter for electors to asssume that the consciences of all MPs are clear and that they are content to be judged at the ballot box on the basis of their record on expense claims.",
