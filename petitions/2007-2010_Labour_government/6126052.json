            "background": "According to publicly produced figures the crime rate is steadily falling. However It does seem that these figures maybe misleading as they rely on crime being reported in the first place. By definiton, if there are less crimes reported detection rates will be higher and overall crime figures will be down. It seems that \"petty\"  crimes are slipping through the net in many cases. A particular story in a newspaper details noise distubance, vandalism, drunken behaviour, underage drinking, racing of motorcyles on public roads by children, drug taking on numerous occasions. The response from the police force that there is nothing they can do for one reason or another. Hopefully taking petty crimes more seriously will stop these groups turning to crime as a way of life.  Experiencing this many times myself I urge you to sign this petition if you have felt let down by your local force, their response to your issues and feel a better way of crime reporting would reflect the true state of crime in the UK.",
