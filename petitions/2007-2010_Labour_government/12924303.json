        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many college students drop out of college before the end of their course.\nTax payers money is wasted and the student does not pass!\n\nIn other nations everyone has to pay for courses which means they are more encouraged to do well. Here is a way to encourage our students.\n\nWhen a student drops out of college when the course was free they should be given a fine. This money can go towards improving education further. It could possibly help make university courses free to those out of work. If that was  to happen the same principle should be used for those who drop out of free university courses.\n With this system I have thought of there are many benefits. Listed below!\n\n1, Better course pass rates.\n2, Better jobs come to our country.\n3, More money is brought into the education system.\n4, The tax payers pocket will be happier.\nLast but not least 5, Better motivated students.",
