        "background": "Banks in the UK offer you around 1% for your savings and charge you 8% for loans. Despite this, many have still been driven into the ground by greedy executives. Some of the worst of these (Sir Fred Goodwin being the latest and best example) actually walk away from this disaster rewarded for their incompetencies. This culture of bank and banker greed must stop. Our taxes should not be lining the pockets of the already wealthy, professionally incompetent fools responsible for the credit crunch.",
