            "background": "At the end of February 2008, the ORR announced it was to fine Network Rail \u00a314m for the New Year disruption caused on the West Coast Main Line. Network Rail is essentially a public company with no shareholders, meaning this fine simply reduces the amount of money available for investment in the railways. We call upon the Prime Minister to return this money to the railways, if necessary preventing its use as bonuses for senior management.",
