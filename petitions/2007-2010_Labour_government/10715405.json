        "action": "Create a state owned energy supply authority using windfall taxes from the profits of existing energy suppliers in the UK.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current situation in UK is that our Energy Industry is virtually controlled by foreign Companies, the purpose of privatising Gas and Electricity supply was to create competition and choice for the British consumer. \nWe now have a situation of crippling energy prices but continued massive profits for the suppliers.  \nI urged this Government to take action and tax the profits of the suppliers and use the proceeds to establish a state owned energy supplier that will invest in renewable energy systems for the benefit of giving the British consumer a more affordable alternative. DO YOU REMEMBER THE THREE DAY WEEKS AND POWER CUTS OF THE 1970's IF WE DON'T ACT NOW, HOW LONG BEFORE IT HAPPENS AGAIN.",
