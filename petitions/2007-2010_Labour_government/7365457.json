            "background": "In the US there is more than 1 taser attack per day by police and security forces, on citizens, with Taser weapons. In many cases the citizen is innocent and it seems that the weapon is being used in many cases to gain compliance. There was about 450 attacks last year and quiet a few resulted in death. The frequency of the unjustified attacks is scary\n \nIf we let our police force have these weapons we open the door for this kind of behaviour. Its one thing having special response units, but it\u2019s a dangerous path to let every police man and women carry them.  \n\nI think it would be prudent for us to deny our police the right to carry taser weapons.",
