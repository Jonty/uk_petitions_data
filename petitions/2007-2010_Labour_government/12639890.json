            "background": "Major Supermarket chains, in creating massive Superstores, have the effect of destroying the small shops which are the heart of many British towns.\nIn an attempt to prevent this, Local Councils often oppose the plans. \nThis refusal is then appealed, a long and VERY expensive process. If the refusal is still upheld, the Supermarket will continue to appeal. \nThis battle of attrition carries on until the Council can no longer afford to use Council Tax Payers' money to pay the enormous legal bills.\nThus, the Supermarkets eventually manage to get their own way, regardless of local opposition  and in the process killing local town centres such as Dartford in Kent, which has been under the threat of a Tesco superstore for nearly a decade.",
