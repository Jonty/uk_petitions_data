            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The aim of this petition is to give families of homicide victims the legal right to formally challenge false information published as fact about homicide victims at the hands of convicted murderers and irresponsible journalist by amending the UK defamation legislation to include families of homicide victims.  The P.M, Gordon Brown stated in a letter dated 11 02 08, that due to 2 complaints before the EU Court by the Times Newspapers Limited against the UK government, submitted in 2002, the government was unable to publish its promised consultation paper in 2007. We contacted the EU Court, who informed us that no date has been set to hear the Times complaints. We have been informed that the Times complaints have nothing to do with defamation of homicide victims. While we are delighted the government is introducing legislation to prevent violent offenders profiting from selling their accounts of their crimes for publication (Criminal Memoirs) which was hard fought for, we demand they fulfil their promise to amend the current defamation legislation to include families of homicide victims.",
