            "background": "We the undersigned petition the prime minister to restrict the number of holidays and teacher training days to a more acceptable level. Is 7 weeks necessary for a summer holiday, 3 weeks at christmas, 2 weeks at easter, and more in the year with training days? We believe that the disproportionate amount of days lost to each and every child's schooling in the unnecessarily long holiday breaks and teacher training days adversely affects children's education. This ultimately causes severe damage to the continuity of education resulting in children experiencing loss of confidence in school subjects particularly english and mathematics, which end in bad exam results. Working parents are caused untold amounts of stress, in not only seeking funding but additional childcare costs. Should the government see fit to continue with such absurd long breaks, then we believe that suitable free childcare facilities at each school in the country should be provided in these long term breaks, offering games, sporting and educational activities to help alleviate the current problems.",
