        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "While there are many obscure courses taught by our universities, an important science is not taught in a single one.  Volcanology (the study of volcanoes and volcanic phenomena) is only ever briefly taught as a small unit in a geological course.  Minerology (another area of geology), for example, is a course.  Even though there are no active volcanoes in the British Isles, there are extinct ones (eg. in Edinburgh) providing areas for study.  Training volcanologists in the UK could help work out a way to predict volcanic eruptions, potentially saving many lives.  Volcanology is a popular area of geology and many people would rather study this more specialised area, than the whole of the geological sciences.",
