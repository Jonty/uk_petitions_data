            "background": "Shepherds Arms is the first public building to have been built in Cwmaman, built in 1850 to service miners in the pit. Located literally in the centre of village the pub, today is a meeting place for people who come together to talk about wildlife, music, fishing, mechanics and all sorts of stuff. \nShepherds Arms is now under threat of being demolished despite the protests of local people. The organisation behind the proposed Shepherds Arms redevelopment project is Cwmaman Institute - a community owned venue. However the community have not been consulted about the future of Shepherds Arms. Through this petition and other campaigns we aim to preserve the important role Shepherds Arms plays in village life.",
