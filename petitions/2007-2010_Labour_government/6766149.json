            "background": "The bus fare, in Manchester at least, has nearly doubled from 40p to 70p for a child in the last 2 years. If Gordon Brown is expecting us to use public transport, he should at least lower the fares rather than raise them as he as done so. Many of us live at least 5 miles from our schools, so therefore there is no way for us to walk. So, to be 'environmentally friendly' as many people suggest, we must take the bus, and pay 70p for the privilege.",
