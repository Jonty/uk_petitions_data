        "background": "Banning things has caused more upset than good throughout the british way of life, and many think of these things as just another stab at their freedom of choice. I for one feel that some of the decisions made in recent times have completely blighted my own. A certain petition to ban the use and sale of motorcycles has triggered my anger today, and I feel that to make sure this particular idea is never even contemplated, it's right to make it government policy to STOP banning things, Unless there is a REAL public need, reguarding anti social youth, and other overwhelming situations that require DRASTIC action. This latest one is just insane. If the government take it seriously, I may just move to the states. I would honestly feel safer under President Bush's rule!",
