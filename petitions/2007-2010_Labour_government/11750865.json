            "background": "I propose that cannabis is a very safe and perhaps even healthy drug. The recent BBC documentary \u2018Horizon: Cannabis: The Evil Weed?\u2019 is very informative and shows the lack of reasoning behind the class B status it has been assigned, and also the dyer need for more research into the benefits of the drug . It suggests that cannabis only has harmful effects to the developing brain when it is exposed to high levels of THC over a long period of time. It also explains that stronger forms of cannabis such as \u2018skunk\u2019 that are higher in THC and lower in CBD is what has given cannabis a bad press, and that these are detrimental to our health. If cannabis was properly researched and legalised it could be taxed and also ensure that only safe forms of the drug are made available to the public. Not only this, surely it should be our right to consume something we can grow on our windowsill?",
