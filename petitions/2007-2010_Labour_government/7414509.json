            "background": "Science is a major driving force behind social development.  It underpins almost every aspect of modern British life, from sanitation and power production, to medicine and mass communication.  Our understanding of the natural world is constantly refreshed in a dynamic approach to ameliorating the daily struggles every human faces.  Unfortunately there is a distinct public distrust of science and its proponents, a distrust which stems not from science itself but from the way it is portrayed in the media and taught in schools, and for which ignorance is ultimately to blame.  Genetic modification, stem cell biology, and nuclear power are all examples of controversial areas of scientific study which could one day be safely and efficiently utilised to cure innumerable diseases and provide manageable, clean energy sources.  Science however can only help where it is supported by the public and it is for these reasons that awareness of the profound role it plays in everyday life needs to be raised.",
