        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The rule that abortion should be legal up to 24 weeks should be changed. it is digusting to think that if a lady was pregnant with a baby and was 6 month pregnant she can just decide to treminate a baby. A baby that is developed enough to survive if it was born prematurely. i myself was born at 24 weeks and survived and i am fine. People out there need to understand that at this stage thebaby is manily fully developed and shaped.\n\nIt is disgusting to know that people do have terminations of the child at 23 weeks. This baby could survive and should have the chance too. \n\nAt the end of the day, if a pregnancy is unplanned or a result of rape shouldn't the woman be ble to decide they want a termination well before the 20 weeks that means that the woman will ahev missed around 5 periods and i think by then something should be ticking in their brain that somethings wrong.\n\nThey should not be able to leave it six months before deciding to have a termination.\n\nYou need to change the law from 24 weeks to 20 weeks.",
