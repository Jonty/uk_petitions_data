        "background": "Between Amesbury\u2019s Countess roundabout in Wiltshire and the Podimore roundabout in Somerset the A303 has 4 short sections of single carriageway. These sections cause severe congestion as the dual-carriageways converge into 1 lane. Furthermore, on 3 of the sections there are speed cameras at which drivers slow disproportionately, further exacerbating the congestion.\nIn December 2007 the scheme to tunnel past Stonehenge was cancelled on cost grounds. Whilst there have been competing aspirations regarding this section it is now time for the Government to govern and direct the Department of Transport to upgrade the carriageway.\nThe bottlenecks should be removed by constructing a flyover at the Countess roundabout; widening to dual carriageway at Stonehenge; removing the Wilton roundabout and bypassing the villages of Winterboune Stoke and Chicklade. This will improve traffic flow for industry and tourism whilst reducing atmospheric pollution and noise pollution in the villages.",
