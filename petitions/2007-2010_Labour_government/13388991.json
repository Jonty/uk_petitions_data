        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "we need serious responses as a Muslim community leader in Essex was abducted by racists, and recent incidents include attacks and fire bombings on mosques in Luton and Greenwich; and Islamic Relief offices in Scotland; and arrest of a Mosque bomb plotter amid growing threats to the Muslim population from the far right with no attention to these cases in the media. British citizens need to be informed. This coming after we learn of the murder of Ekram Haque  Tooting last week. Police are treating the crime as racist.  Write to your members of parliament and ask them to give this serious and disturbing trend their utmost attention. We should not lose sight of our initial concern, the pervasive rise of anti-Muslim hate crimes",
