            "background": "People should be allowed to change their names without official permissiom, it should be their right. They should'nt have to ask or apply for this to be done.\nThis petition has been created by myself as i have witnessed this first hand. My good friend Edward Beef has an English mother and an Indian father by the name of Gias Uddin Choudhury. He has never met his father but he wants to embrace his Indian heritage. He has tracked him down but Mr Choudhury will not speak to him as he has an English name, my friend wants to change his name to Edward Choudhury so his father will accept him. Time is running short as Mr Choudhury is suffering from Bennett Jones Syndrome, this is where you have to wear glasses and your front teeth grow out of control and you forehead doubles in size. Edward wants the chance to go sailing or digging on moors with Mr Choudhury, please i ask you sign this petition so Edward can have his dream come true.",
