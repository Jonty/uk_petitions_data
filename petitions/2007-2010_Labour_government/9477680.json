            "background": "Nexus, who control the Tyne and Wear Metro system, have created a new ruling which means that mobility scooter users must be accompanied at all times. This is effectively trapping many disabled people in their homes as some do not have anyone to accompany them. Add to this the fact that scooter users are not allowed to use local buses or trains and the subsidised taxi-link service is being withdrawn and replaced by a service that users have to pay full price for with only a 2.50 subsidy. Despite a massive amount of complaints, Nexus do not want to take any action to rectify the situation.",
