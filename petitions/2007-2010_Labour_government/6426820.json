            "background": "Reducing Waste & Recycling\n\nAn industry has been created out of waste management.\n\nThatcher put the scrap dealer [and his horse] out of business by introducing an expensive licensing scheme.\n\nOnce sorted, perhaps cleaned or repaired, your cast offs could become another\u2019s heirloom. Think eBay or FreeCycle.\n\nWe have been able to create biodegradeable starch based food wrapping since the 1980\u2019s. Why use plastic? It is a legislative requirement to have separate wrapping on organic foods.\n\nIt has surely always been illogical to use landfill as a means of waste disposal. Now we dump in Third World.\n\nThe solution is simple.\n\nLegislation should be introduced to make it possible for all consumers to return non-biodegradable or non recycle-able packaging to their immediate point of origin.\n\nWe welcome the return of deposit paid returnable glass containers; independent scrap dealers; & the withdrawal of all food related plastic packaging.\n\nMore food outlets should be encouraged, through tax incentives rather than fines, to design re-useable containers. \n\nThis is not a difficult problem. It has simply been managed from the wrong perspective for too long.",
