            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We must stop importing cheap meat from the continent, that doesn\u2019t meet welfare standards practised in the UK. The cheap meat comes from factories belonging to huge corporations such as Smithfield\u2019s, which are the cause of swine flu. This is due to the fact they force animals pumped with antibiotics, namely pigs, to live in horrendous conditions, never seeing sunlight.\nPlease, we the general public have the power to stop this, as these multimillion corporations are corrupting many governments. DON\u2019T buy meat without being assured by labels it didn\u2019t come from a factory. Support your local farmer, while they are still there. It is a small price to pay for saving communities, stimulating jobs and the environment.\nJust as many independent farms were forced to close due to the big demand of cheap meat, we can force the factories to close by demanding quality meat. Together we can put a stop to the cruelty. Do your part; don\u2019t let them get away with killing off our traditional, humane farms.",
