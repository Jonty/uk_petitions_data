            "background": "In 1965 the UK government committed the country to the metric system. Since then successive governments have moved us along this route, sometimes at the request of trade organisations, the EU and other interested parties. Since 1973 all school pupils have been taught in metric only meaning that anyone 40 years or younger should be familiar with metric. In many areas today people deal only in metric. The time has now come to set about completing the process through the establishment of a metric converison organisation within govrnment to plan and carry out the final stages of metrication. These include areas of health, advertising and roads. The UK and US alone are considered by many to be the only countries still using imperial measurements to a large degree. It is amazing that in the uK metric road signs are illegal, we are the only country in the world to make illegal the use of a worlwide standard or distance measurement, even the US permits ans sometimes uses metric road signs.",
