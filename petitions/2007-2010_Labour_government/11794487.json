The inherent recommendation to equate the pain and suffering of \"perpetrators\" with that of \"victims\" has caused widespread anger and disbelief across the community.\n\n\"We the undersigned will not buy into any process, which would result in an amnesty being given to ruthless terrorists nor will we support a \u201crecognition payment\u201d being made, which equates; \u201cterrorist\u201d experiences with that of the innocent victims whom they perpetrated crime against.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe call on the Westminster Government to kick the report into touch and begin to address the cries of innocent victims who up until now have been denied truth and justice.\u201d",
