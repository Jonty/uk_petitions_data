            "background": "I think parking permits should be issued in baby pack on the birth of yor child?  Then, like disabled parking bays, you would need a permit to park in parent and baby spaces.  \n\nSome places thankfully provide larger parent/baby spaces in their car parks but they are not policed in any way.  They are there for a reason.  Its very difficult to get your child in and out of car seats without the room to open the car doors sufficiently.  Car seats are now law - so therefore making it easier to use them should be.\n\nIts very frustrating to see someone without children using these spaces and there's nothing that can be done about it.  The issue over disabled parking bays has been in the press a lot recently.  Parent/baby spaces should be treated in the same manner with the same respect!\n\nPlease bring in new laws in relation to parent and baby parking spaces",
