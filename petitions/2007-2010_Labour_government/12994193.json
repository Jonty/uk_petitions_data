            "background": "There is a real problem in this country with the goverment saying one thing and companys saying the other.\n\nThe goverment say you need a hgv licence to drive a truck.Companys say you need that and 2 years experience.\n\nI have just recently passed my hgv test and can't get a job because of this.There are loads of jobs on the job centre website,but i can't get one because of lack of experience.\n\nWell the obvious question is \"How do i get experience when i can't get a job\"?.\n\nThis is not just a problem with hgv driving but alot of other jobs as well.\n\nI think companys should be forced by the goverment to take inexperienced workers on,as this is partly the reason why alot of young people are out of work !",
