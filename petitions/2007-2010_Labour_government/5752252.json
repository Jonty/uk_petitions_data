This is a problem that affects someone close to me and after contacting social services about my concerns I was shocked by the response that I got. My family have to monitor the situation and report any concerns we have but social workers can't really do anything about it without proof and evidence meanwhile a baby who is less than a year old is forced to live in chaos because the parent can't put on a good act! I really want something to change as these innocent children are suffering so much both emotionally and physically. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",
