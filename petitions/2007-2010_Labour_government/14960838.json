        "action": "introduce a fair, environmentally conscious policy for historic and classic vehicle road taxation",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current system for vehicle excise duty rates are unfair for historic vehicles due to the fixed cut-off date and are disproportionate to usage as most 'classic' vehicles are well-maintained and cover low mileages. Whilst we recognise that the Government use VED as a means of bringing environmental factors into consideration when people choose to take ownership of a car, the current system has little relevance to classic cars as there is no incentive for their owners to reduce emissions on these vehicles other than to encourage owners to declare SORN. In order to support a fair, consistent, environmentally conscious approach, VED should be reduced for vehicles over 25 years old, on a rolling basis rather than a fixed date. Such vehicles, which are subject to a limited mileage insurance policy, should be free of VED and vehicles without such restrictions on mileage should pay the starting rate (presently \u00a335). This would be consistent the Government's overall policy intent, which is to give VED rates an environmental focus as it would encourage limited use of classic vehicles, whilst at the same time preserving their value to the economy and our heritage.",
