        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Golden Valley line, which runs between  Gloucestershire and Swindon, is currently single track between Kemble Station and Swindon. This severely Limits the capacity of the line to a maximum of 3 trains per hour in both directions. Network rail drew up plans for redoubling, but the office of rail regulation refuses to include it in its 2009-2014 investment plan, even though the estimated cost-benefit ratio is 9.6!\n\n It is the main route from Cheltenham and Gloucester to London, and demand for rail travel from these two cities is growing, but the demand cannot be catered for as the line is running at capacity. Delays are frequent as one late running train holds up the next train at this bottleneck, which in turn holds up the next train.\n\nThis line is also a major diversion route for London-South wales trains when the Severn tunnel is closed, so on those days the extra capacity redoubling would provide would make a noticeable difference. Demand for rail service is growing in the north suburbs of Swindon, and a station here could be provided if the line were to be redoubled.",
