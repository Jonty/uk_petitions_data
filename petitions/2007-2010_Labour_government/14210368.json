            "background": "The amendment to the Financial Services Act would provide for the registration of decisions by the Financial Services Ombudsman at County Court and therefore enforceable in law. Currently, this procedure is only possible for the decisions of tribunals such as Employment Tribunals. The amendment would stop the abuse of the system by financial institutions such as banks, insurance providers and FSAs who manipulate the system by failing to abide by the ombudsman's decisions or prolonging settlement by vexatious appeals.",
