        "background": "Having worked for a Personal Search company for 3 years I was shocked to find that much of the info they (& most of the other P S Agents)provide on searches for HIPS is knowingly false. If people were aware that the HIP report they paid a fortune for was not worth the paper it was written on they would opt for an honest search compiled by the local authorities. Sign this petition to stop fraudulent Personal Search Agents and to enforce proper checks on this dishonest industry to protect property purchasers. I reported them to Trading Standards, OFT and the Police - who all said there was nothing they could do. Thank you",
