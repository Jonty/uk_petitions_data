            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We think that it is extreamly unfair that people with cars manufactured before 2001 that have a 1.0 litre capacity or less should have to pay \u00a3120 per year. Whether old or new, a car with a 1.0 litre engine or less is not going to produce much more C02, its very marginal. Tax for cars older than 2001 with a 1.0 litre or less capacity should not be the same amount as a car that has a 1.4 capacity as the fuel consumption is far lower and these cars are far more efficient and economical, running for almost 2 weeks on 35 litres of petrol, even in town traffic. We ask that this be recognised as some of us possess older cars with small engines for the economy of it then we are stung for \u00a3120pa for tax, and most of us cannot afford to buy a new car to benefit from lower road tax.",
