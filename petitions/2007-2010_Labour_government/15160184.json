            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently the surrogate mother is the legal mother of a child born from anothers egg. We the undersigned want it to be changed so that the legal mother is the biological mother . A woman/girl that is born with eggs cherishes her young/eggs from the day of her birth. From her early years she is planning for her motherhood. She eats food from the earth so that her young can survive, and establishes contact with her surroundings and environment to plan for the events ahead. Some women plan well and others do not plan at all. A womens heritage are her descendents. The current system allows a womens heritage to be stolen because it is too easy to steal another womans eggs. If an egg is stolen the current system says that the baby once born is the legal property of the thief. There is nothing that the biological mother can do to get her baby back. Men are currently using surrogate mothers to have children from stolen eggs so that the biological mother cannot claim it as her own. The current system is saving men a fortune on divorce bills because they do not need to marry women any more to have their children and get their genetics.",
