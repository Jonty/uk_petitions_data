        "background": "We propose that the name of the Bank Of England be changed to reflect its status as the central bank of the United Kingdom.  The continued and prominent use of its current name does much to unwittingly peddle the myth that England and UK are interchangeable.  Moreover, if a name change were to happen, this would release the name Bank Of England for retail use in the same way as Bank Of Scotland.  We suggest Reserve Bank Of The United Kingdom.",
