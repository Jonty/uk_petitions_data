            "background": "To ensure the United Kingdom of Great Britain file all claims necessary with the UN (or any other interested body) to secure more than 350,000 square miles of sea bed exploration rights to extended areas of the sea bed around the Falklands, South Georgia and the British Antarctic Territory under a United Nations convention that allows rights to areas that are a continuation of their territory's continental shelf.  The British Government has until May 2009 to file its claim.\n\nRecently Argentina has expressed its intention to assert its sovereignty and claim all the natural resources around the Falkland Islands using military force if necessary.\n\nThis claim is necessary to prevent Argentina from claiming the rights around the Falkland Islands for themselves 25 years after the invasion of the islands by Argentina and subsequent recapture of them by Great Britain which resulted in the death of 258 British citizens.",
