The man is obviously out of control reacting badly to criticism from his colleagues and political adversaries within his own party and needs to be reined back.  Paying political activists out of public funds should be illegal.  If he wants to employ people to bolster him and tell him how good he is and how well he is doing then they should be paid out of party funds and NOT by the taxpayer.",
