            "background": "This petition is to ask the government to introduce or encourage a \u201cPavement Shopping\u201d day each month.  On this day everyone can put out any unwanted household items for others to take away and use.  People could place unwanted items on the edge of their property, or if possible without blocking rights of way, on the pavement.  Anyone passing would then know that the items are unwanted and free for anyone to give them a new home.\n\nThis would vastly increase the amount of household items that are reused instead of been taken to landfill sites.  It would also reduce the amount of fly tipping and save local councils the cost of removing and disposing of those items. \n\nThe signatories of this petition believe the introduction of a \u201cPavement Shopping\u201d day each month would be a big step towards reducing the amount of unwanted household items going to land fill.  It would take very little time and effort to introduce, some publicity and making sure the local councils adopt the idea and don\u2019t harass people for putting out household items on this day.",
