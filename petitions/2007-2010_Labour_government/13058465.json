            "background": "Tanning salons cause skin cancer.  That is now official.  People who use tanning salons to cause skin cancer should not then be able to obtain treatment free on the NHS.  Nobody who self inflicts any condition requiring medical treatment should receive treatment on the NHS.  Taxes paid into the NHS should be reserved for people who contract medical conditions naturally - we already have enough of those, without taking on responsbility for everybody who makes an active choice to damage themselves.",
