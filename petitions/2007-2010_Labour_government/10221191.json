            "background": "The Road Traffic Act already requires that vehicle horns shall not be excessively loud or strident. Yet, many industrial operators are fitting reversing- or other warning sirens to vehicles which are of such piercing quality thay they cause noise nuisance for up to half-a-mile from the site. Operators are ostensibly doing this for safety, but it is hard to see how this promotes safety when it leads to sleepless nights for hundreds of surrounding residents.\n\nThe issue is not the use of warning devices per se, but the unsuitable nature of the sound, which results in its 'carrying' over very long distances.",
