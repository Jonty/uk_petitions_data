        "background": "Apparently plans for this exemption are afoot (via the Civil List).  Why on earth should the royal family be exempted from this?  Their personal wealth is astronomical; if anything they should contribute more to the public purse.\n\nI realise, as I'm sure everyone does, that cuts will be necessary once the recession is over (though I still feel, very strongly indeed, that the banking executives whose actions caused the situation should be forced to rectify it).  In my very strong opinion these cuts should fall on those most able to bear them; and that includes the royal family.",
