            "background": "This known terrorist has already cost tax payers \u00a31.5m in costs and this figure is set to soar after his appeal to to the EU re his \"human rights\" being breached after Law Lords approved his deportation. He is also set to receive \u00a32.5k in compensation for Britain holding him illegally. We petition for this pantomime to stop and have this man removed with absolutely no compensation whatsoever regardless of what the EU dictates to us about what we can or can't do in our own country with criminals. His \"human rights\" are not as important as the human rights of the millions of Brits he could harm if he stays. The good of the majority should prevail.",
