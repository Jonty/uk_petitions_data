            "background": "How much money does the Government get in fuel duty and road tax? How much of this is ploughed back into the upkeep of roads? How many times are roads checked for potholes? Main Roads should be checked for defects every 72 hours and minor roads on a monthly basis. We have had incidents in my home town of repairers fixing one pothole and leaving another one, less than 10ft away, in disrepair when the 2 could have been done together. Potholes and road faults are dangerous and serious accidents resulting from them should have the onus put on those responsible for road upkeep. Councils take an eternity to make even the slightest repair. The average pothole can take up to 2 years or more to be repaired.\n I think that responsibility should ultimately be removed from councils and a specific governmental department be set up to handle all repairs using money from the revenue achieved from fuel duty, road tax, motor fines etc.",
