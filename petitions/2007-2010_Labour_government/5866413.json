            "background": "In Canada, as a warning to motorists approaching a light-controlled traffic junction, a single amber light, placed over each traffic lane and set a few hundred yards/metres ahead, starts to flash a few seconds in advance of the junction lights turning to red.\n\nIf this were introduced here, the increasing habit of motorists to jump traffic lights within the first few seconds of turning to red should be eliminated.  There would be no excuse for anyone to say that they were unaware that the lights were about to change, and road safety should be greatly increased.\n\nWhile such signals may not be suitable for all junctions, they should be installed on all roads, urban highways, ring roads, etc. where there is sufficient road room to make such lights effective.\n\nNote: This concept is already in use on the railways: early-warning amber lights are used ahead of a red signal.",
