The people of Iran set out in a peaceful and intelligent manner to protest and ask for a re-count and for their voice to be heard. The government responded to peaceful protest with murder, torture, kidnapping and extreme violence. The people of Iran are being murdered whilst  UK and USA take a 'neutral' stance. That was 100% correct up to point but now we wish the UK to formally condemn in the strongest manner possible the actions of the Iranian government and to explore any and all ways supporting and helping the democratic movement in Iran.\n\nWe do not ask for intervention, we certainly advise caution, but we expect  our government to speak out when such crimes against humanity and democracy are being committed.",
