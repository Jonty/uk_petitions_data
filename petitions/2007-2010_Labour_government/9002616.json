            "background": "As central government extends the provision of nursery entitlement to 3 hours per day, many of the councils benefiting from this are using the situation as an excuse to end free full-time nursery places.\n\nThis runs contrary to the purpose of HM Government's additional funding and is effectively syphoning the funds for additional nursery education away from it's intended use.\n\nThe cabinet should clearly instruct councils that removal of entitelement in this way is an abuse of the money being made available to them and is in no way in the interest of the children and families that they have been elected to serve.",
