The courts say the payments should be made.\nMAKE THESE PAYMENTS NOW stop trying to default. My mother is 92 years old and has been crippled by MRSA from Warwick Hospital and has had her allowances stopped although assurances that they would not was given. It shames the UK my mother paid in all her life working until she was 70. My dad did too, a war hero.",
