            "background": "At present, Government Funds are being spent on the Jobcentre Plus Personal Advisor Service and on Outsourced Training Schemes designed to teach service users how to look for and secure a new job.\n\nThere is little point in schemes of this ilk since the jobs simply are not out there.\n\nFurthermore, if 3 million people apply for 3 hundred thousand jobs, employers will take the best 3 hundred thousand applicants.  And if the government give 'job application training' to a subsection of the 3 million applicants, employers are still only going to take the best 3 hundred thousand applicants! \n\nIn addition, investment in academic and professional training is not going to have a major impact on employment - just look at all the new and unemployed graduates!\n\nThe creation of New Industry, New Enterprises and New Jobs is the only way forward. \n\nWe the undersigned therefore petition the Prime Minister to take strong proactive measures to ensure the creation of new jobs, new business start-ups and new industry as this is the only way forward for jobseekers during a recession.",
