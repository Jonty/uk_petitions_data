            "background": "Your driving licence is automatically revoked if you build up six or more penalty points within two years of passing your first driving test. This includes any penalty points you had before passing the test, which are still valid. You\u2019ll have to reapply for your driving licence as a learner driver and resit your driving test.\n\nThis Act is out of date and a waste of time. There are so many speed cameras, traffic light cameras and generally a lot of other methods to improve road safety. Road deaths have not reduced as a result of this Act. \n\nThis Act is costly for young people and just for two minor speeding errors one's licence can be revoked. This is wholly wrong and flawed.",
