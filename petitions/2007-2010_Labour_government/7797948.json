            "background": "Braintree District Council have banned Gt Notley FC from playing on the Village Green. The Club is run by 35 volunteer coaches and managers and helps over 300 children out of a community of 5,500 exercise, learn a team sport and enjoy themselves.\n\nThe Club accepts it's responsibility in the community and does everything it can with traffic cones to prevent inconvenient parking etc., however, a petition by 30 residents has motivated Braintree Cuoncil to ban the club from using the Green much to the boys and girls dismay.\n\nWe believe a petition with the majority of the 5.5k residents of the Village will encourage the Prime Minister to pressure BDC to apply common sense once and for all and allow use of The Green indefinitely in the hope that we can supply some quality youth players for Raith Rovers but also sustain a healthy, active and vibrant community.",
