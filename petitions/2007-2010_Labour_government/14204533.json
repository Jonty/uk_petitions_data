The burglar,with over 50 previous convictions,walked free from Court. To help restore a modicum of faith in the British judicial system,we call upon the Government to order the immediate release of the Hussain brothers and to replace them in jail with Walid Salem (the multiple repeat offender who is currently free to attack again) and John Reddihough (the treacherous Judge who turned his back on the British public and gave violent criminals the green light to carry on offending).",
