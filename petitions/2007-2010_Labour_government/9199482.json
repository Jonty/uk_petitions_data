            "background": "The increasing number of traffic lights on our roads are not helping with the flow of traffic. \n\nThe stop start motoring also means an increase in the amount of fuel used and additional noise to local residents caused by stationary cars at junctions. \n\nHow many times have you been sat at a red light with no other traffic in sight especially at night? Nottingham city centre is especially bad for this.\n  \nI would urge the government to undertake a review of the traffic laws and the operation of traffic lights.\n\nMy suggestions are;\n1. The ability to turn left on a red light - As used in the USA\n2. Traffic lights to switch to flashing amber late at night to enable drivers to pass through the lights as if it is a normal non-traffic light junction - as used in the USA\n3. Traffic lights to be intelligent and react to traffic volumes rather than having a set program of operation.\n4. A general review to ensure each set of traffic lights work to help traffic flow, not hinder it. \n5. More part time traffic lights.",
