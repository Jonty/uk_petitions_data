            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I believe that most people would be willing donors if prompted and incentivised. Free participation in a weekly draw to win \u00a350,000 would incentivise most people to register and the weekly publicising of the draw - and winning registered donors - would act as a continued advertisement to register. I believe that this would be particularly true where young people are concerned and the young tend to make the best donors. Whether you support this petition or not, please do register as a donor online. Most of us would take an offered organ if we needed one - let's all be prepared to give one if the time comes.",
