            "background": "Jeremy Guscott was a reasonably good rugby player, but that most certainly doesn't mean he is any good on the television. He is one of the reasons behind the segmentation of Great Britain because every 6 Nations he gives the Scots and the Welsh even more reasons to hate us (and I'm pretty sure he gets up the noses of the Irish, French and Italians too).\n\nMost recently he confidently predicted at least a 20 point win for England against Wales, coming over as sneering and arrogant.\n\nThis man needs to be stopped before he does more damage.",
