            "background": "The British media is very anti-Israeli.  They go into far more detail about what Israel does in response to attacks upon Israeli citizens.  It talks about the Security Wall being bad etc etc. But they never talk about the deaths of Israeli citizens in the same detail, never show the blown up Israeli children, the rockets being fired by Hamas etc from Public buildings or the fact that many other countries, such as Saudi Arabia and even America, have built Security Walls to keep out people these countries don't want coming in.\n\nI would like to see some new laws to stop biased reporting, as the media like to vilify Israel, but never show things from their side of the story.  They should also show the good that Israel do, scientifically, medically and through charitable works.\n\nThe ITC aren't able to do much when it comes to companies such as the BBC, and I don't agree with paying a TV licence to a company that can't be more fair in their reporting.\n\nThere are many video reports that show what the terrorist groups do, but if you speak about them on the Media's forums, you get banned.",
