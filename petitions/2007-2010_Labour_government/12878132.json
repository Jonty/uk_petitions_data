        "background": "In the 1950s, the Kenyan Mau Mau rose up against the British Empire to fight colonial rule. Suspects were interned in concentration camps. The soldiers who guarded the camps allegedly indulged in depraved sadistic violence include the following:\n\nDetainment without trial, frequent beatings including genitals beaten to the point of destruction, whipping to death, sodomy with broken bottles and castration with pliers. Many of those who survived are crippled for life.\n\nSeveral are at the Royal Courts of Justice trying to get redress. The claimants law firm and historians have uncovered detailed archival research which they claim makes clear that far from being the acts of a few rogue soldiers, the treatment of Kenyans during this period resulted from policies which were sanctioned at the highest levels of the British government by the then Colonial Secretary.\n\nI would ask that the government not contest the case and to honourably address their grievances and hold those involved to account.",
