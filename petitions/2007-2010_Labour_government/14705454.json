            "background": "a website gives the impression the films they show are for family entertainment when it is a porn site they also give the impression that the films are free and the credit card number will not be used if a person refuses to give their card number they then send a self activating  email which activates in approx 15 seconds and then claim the person set up the account which they have opened without that persons authorization and send them a bill. so a ten year old could open an account for porn films although the oft would fine a shop they are letting this website operate. I would like the law changed so i can challenge the oft and have this website banned if it is illegal the oft said it is only free for three days but the first time i was able to talk to anyone was eight days after they opened the account without my consent",
