            "background": "September 1st in New Zealand is not just another day, it is Random Acts of Kindness Day. A day for people to brighten up the world by helping other people with acts of kindness. \n\nWe think that as a nation a day like this could help brighten up the world and take our minds away from all the violence and misery that we hear about on the news and in the papers. \n\nIf it can work for New Zealand and it can work here in the UK for just one day each year, then it can and will bring out the kindness in everyone and make the UK a happier place.",
