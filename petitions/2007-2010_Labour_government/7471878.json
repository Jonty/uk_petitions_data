        "background": "Believe it or not, the legal speed limit on motorways is 70mph unless otherwise specified. However, everyday there are mass displays of civil disobedience with many drivers openly flouting the limit.\n\nIt is a proven fact that the underlying cause of accidents is not excessive speed but the speed differential between  vehicles. On a motorway, this is evident   at junctions when vehicles join slowly and when vehicles overtake those going slower.\n\nThere are two options to mitigate the speed differential issue; one is to permit lorries to travel at 70mph and the other to lower the speed limit of cars to 60mph. In either case, the speed limit needs to be enforced.\n\nI call upon the Prime Minister to consider a single upper speed limit for all vehicles using the motorways AND ENFORCING IT!",
