        "background": "Call on the government to put a stop to the import of meat. We are capable of rearing our own pigs, sheep, cattle and poultry and should not import it. We as a nation should be supporting the British livestock industry and boycott all foreign meat. British animal welfare standards are the best in the world, yet livestock farmers are losing out to cheap foreign imports. Chickens from Brazil, Pork from Poland and Romania, Sheep from France and Beef from Germany. I say we boycott the likes of Tesco and support our local producers, before it's too late, when there will be no more livestock in the fields of Britain. HOMEGROWN is what we want on the supermarkets shelves. If you agree then please sign this petition.",
