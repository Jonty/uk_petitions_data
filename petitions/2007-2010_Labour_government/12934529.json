            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We often hear how hard it is to keep British beaches clean, and how much the government is willing to spend in doing so. And yet there are no rules that state that you have to keep your animals from of off British beaches. And yet more often than not you will see a dog owner walking along the beach with their pet dog along side of them or running around or in the sea. \nWith some dog handlers if their pet fouls the beach they can be seen collecting the dogs waste in plastic bags, but in most cases the dog waste is often left on the beach, and I feel that this is a recipe for disaster if you have children. Not only is dog waste disgusting, certain elements in it can be harmful to young children and adults. I feel that allowing pet owners to take their dogs on to British beaches is wrong, disgusting, and dangerous. So I say keep our beaches clean, and stop dogs fouling our beaches.",
