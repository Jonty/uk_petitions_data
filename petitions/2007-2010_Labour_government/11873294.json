In 2008, there was to be a General Election to choose a new Prime Minister, where-as Mr Brown would have more than likely been voted in.  Mr Brown failed to hold his promise of the election.  We, the people of the United Kingdom, demand a General Election to be given the chance to make our own minds up who we want governing the country, and not someone who is just taking advantage of the situation.  The people of the UK know their rights, and we are now demanding justice.",
