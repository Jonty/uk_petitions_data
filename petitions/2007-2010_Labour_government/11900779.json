        "background": "To my certain knowledge Sir Fred's signal honour was awarded for his \"Services to Banking\", any services (not gazetted) such as those to charity would most likely have followed by virtue of his being Chief Executive of a major PLC and for no other reason.\nOne could reasonably assume that these \"Services to Banking\" would have carried on at least until his (natural) retirement, whereas they clearly have not.\nSir Fred can, in retrospect, be seen to have presided over a complete and utter debacle of such magnitude that to \"strip\" him of his title is the only way of maintaining the dignity of the Order of Chivalry he currently holds and debases.",
