This information loss could be cut by not allowing any such information being taken out of government buildings, using a more secure method of communicating between departments instead of the Royal Mail and some one actually losing their job over the loss instead of a white wash. The government may be losing this information to normal theft or it could be that government information is being stolen by unfriendly governments.",
