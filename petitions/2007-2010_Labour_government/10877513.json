            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Icesave is licensed to operate in Britain, but its compensation scheme means savers must rely on the Icelandic state scheme for the first 20,887 Euros, with only the balance of \u00a350,000 guaranteed by Britain's Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The possibility of the state of Iceland becoming bankrupt through a systemic failure of its banking sector appears not to have been considered. Icesave should not have been licensed with such a possibility omitted. The British government therefore has a clear political and moral obligation to ensure that small savers do not suffer. As matters stand, savers with more than 20,887 Euros would be compensated in the event of insolvency; those with less would not.",
