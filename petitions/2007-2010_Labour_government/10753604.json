            "background": "If you live in the rural areas of the UK, then you are discriminated against when it comes to emergency health care. The DoH has set a target that states that 75% of 999 calls to the ambulance service must be reached within 8 minutes. The clock starts when the call is taken in the control room. The only way they can reach this is to place their few resources in or around larger towns and cities. The rural areas just don\u2019t count. They are to be served by fast cars with a single paramedic on board. He/she can\u2019t transport the seriously ill or injured. They will have to wait for a vehicle to come out from the city. But the car will get there in the time and the target is met. This leads to all kinds of tricks to meet the target. This in turn leads to crews having to drive under emergency conditions to calls that are just not justifiable (such as a fall non injury, needs a lift off the floor). This means that crew is not available to deal with real emergencies.\nThis standard is unrealistic and should and must also be based on clinical outcome and need.",
