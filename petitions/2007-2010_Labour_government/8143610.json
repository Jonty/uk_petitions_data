Using they designs will take away Britannia from our coins.\n\nBritannia is a symbol of our nation, of our history and of ourselves.  Keeping the Britannia on our coins would allow us to keep our national identity, whilst new symbols would not.  We urge the prime minister to keep Britannia on all of our coins which hold her now.",
