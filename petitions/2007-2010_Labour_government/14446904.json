            "background": "Absent parents who did not pay for their children should be penalised.  The CSA is not consistent and not harsh enough in enforcing the absent parent to pay on a monthly basis.  Absent parents should be paying for the day to day finance of bringing up a child not  the government.  Parents who give up their careers to care for their children should be reimbursed by the absent parent if they are still in employment! Even if an absent parent is on benefit they should be made to pay a percentage of their benefit.  I think if there were harsher penalties people would be more responsible and would think more seriously about contraception.",
