        "background": "In response to millions of e mails into my in box, promising me millions of pounds, none of which has been forthcoming, the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to examine the legitimacy of these companies. Does the UK govt bother to prosecute these syndicates if they break contractual company law - why do they do this ? I am from an IT generation, but older people could easily be tricked. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to use recent parliamentary bills in relation to internet use as well as media attention into database confidentiality and online security to address the legality of these businesses since they promise cash only after receiving personal data. What does the rest of the nation think ?",
