            "background": "I am actually only 16, but I feel like many others that children get away with far too much. Children run rings around parents, teachers and police because if they punish them by hitting, the traditional cane or any other form of corporal punishment, they can be prosecuted, but in a time where ASBO's are more common than hot dinners something needs to be done, give them a smack, tap them with the cane, teach them respect. I am not saying child abuse is right, as it is wrong but a smack, for being 'naughty' never did my parents or grandparents any harm, why should it affect me? Or anyone else? \nLets do something today, BRING BACK CORPORAL PUNISHMENT!",
