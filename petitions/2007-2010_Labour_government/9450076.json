        "background": "Benefit fraud, remains a crime, but there is no place in a parliamentary democracy for witch - hunts. The govt would do well to conduct a cost - benefit analysis of where and how govt. funding is being made to support, not demonise British citizens from the cradle to the grave in a truly caring welfare state. A lot of the newspaper reports seem to breach confidentiality guidelines laid down in the Caldicott Report and the administrative scandal over lost database information seems simply to be symptomatic of the malaise.",
