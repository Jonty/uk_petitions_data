            "background": "I cannot see the point in allowing fireworks in this day and age. I am deeply saddened by the distress caused to domestic pets and wildlife, not to mention the danger to the public when using the fireworks. We speak volumes about our environment and preventing noise and pollution but why is this matter ignored totally? I'd also like to know why the so called law about no loud fireworks has not been put in force! Ask the police for help they will tell you it's not their concern, and to contact the local council! You hit a brick wall so the law is never enforced. I want urgent action taken NOW and this whole thing stopped. I am not putting up with fireworks day and night any more.Please sign this petition and get our voices heard. Thank you so much",
