            "background": "The TV License Fee needs to be abolished with immediate effect.  The BBC must be made to function like any other business instead of just being given over 3 billion pounds a year by the British people.  It is simply madness that we are made to pay a fee to the BBC and have no imput into the programmes that are made.  It is also wrong that the BBC produces TV output with license payers money, then sells these programmes abroad for a profit!  \n\nCancel the License fee and let the BBC self fund itself with advertising.  Unlike other business, the BBC is totally immune from any economic slow downs as we all have to pay the license fee by law, regardless of our circumstances at the time.",
