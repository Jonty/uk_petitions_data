            "background": "The government should enforce a permanent ban upon the Co-operative for the 'Good with Food' advert. \nThe reasons for this are numerous; \n1) The voice over accent is increasingly annoying the more it is heard. It is impossible to ignore it. \n2)The voice over doesn't actually say 'good with food' he actually says 'Gud with Fooot' which only serves to increase the annoyance level of the advert.\n3) The advert is shown continually with no respite, there is no escape! We are continually subjected to this audible abuse from a whining Scots accent.\n4) The co-op actually are not 'good with food' maybe they should be investigated by the trading standards as being increasingly terrible with food. \n\nEnough is enough. Stop this insanity please before I have to unplug the television, visit the head office of the co-operative (with said television) and play a continuous loop of David Cameron trying to be sincere.",
