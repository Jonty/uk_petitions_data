        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I am eligable for a warmfront grant but I cannot have a boiler which uses wood pellets, wood or any other environmentally friendly or carbon neutral fuel despite the government stating that it is in favour of reducing fuel poverty and wanting people to reduce their CO2 emissions.\nWarmfront was happy to let me have \u00a34000 of grant to install a fossill fuel oil system which I couldn't afford to run, but refused to install my preference, which I *could* afford to run on scrap wood, and wood pellets produced in this country.\nSince this goes totally against what the government *says* it wants,I think that warmfront should be forced to supply environmentally friendly options if they are available.",
