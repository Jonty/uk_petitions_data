            "background": "Unemployment is currently rising. Many skilled building workers are currently unemployed. As a result of the current financial situation the country is in, many are facing homelessness. A massive increase in the building and provision of affordable local authority managed housing stock will create jobs, reduce homelessness, and, by increasing security and reducing accomodation costs for many families, will free up money which will flow back into the wider economy, thus helping to mitigate the effects of the recession.",
