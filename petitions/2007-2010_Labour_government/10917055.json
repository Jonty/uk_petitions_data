            "background": "During the recent credit crunch we were repeatedly told by the Utility companies that the exhorbitant increases in Gas and Electricity costs were linked to the price of oil.\nThe prices of electricity and gas were hiked accordingly . Now that oil costs have decreased by approx 40-50% we are are still being asked to pay the upper rates for electricity and Gas and I see no reduction! Why is this??\n\nGas and Electricity prices should be declining - if it is true that they are linked to the price of oil! I suspect they are not! back to where they were!!\n\n I demand that the Government requires the utilty companies to reduce the price of their products in accordance to the decline in oil price!!\n\nI await your comments forthwith. The continued high price of energy ...  allegedly linked to oil insults my intelligence\n\n Dr. Philip J.M Lowe",
