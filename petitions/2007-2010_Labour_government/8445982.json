        "action": "encourage the European Union to negate the need for new member states to belong to NATO",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is currently impossible for prospective members of the EU to have any hope of joining without being members of NATO. Only wealthy countries such as Ireland and Austria are able to belong to the EU and not to NATO. For countries such as Ukraine this is not an option. Why should Ukrainian citizens be forced to fight in an illegal war in Iraq for another country's oil? NATO requires member states to commit troops in times of crisis. Just because British, French, Spanish, Italian people don't want to see coffins come home from Iraq, it doesn't means the coffins should instead be going to countries like Ukraine. There should be no operation in Iraq and no coffins coming home to any European country. Democratic progress in Ukraine is something both the UK and US want but it cannot be achieved without membership of the EU. This should not require membership of NATO.",
