Reduce the cost of Care Proceedings brought by Local Authorities and other professional bodies to a minimal amount\n \n3.    Health Visitors/Social Workers and all professionals involved in child abuse cases to have an automtic right of entry.\n \n4.    Children to be removed from abusive or potentially abusive households immediately pending investigation (rather than investigate then remove).\n \n5.    Where more than one person is involved in the child abuse and will not admit to the ultimate culprit then ALL should be dealt with severely and not be given lighter sentences because none will admit to their actions.",
