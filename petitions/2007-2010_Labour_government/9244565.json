        "background": "I am absolutely livid that parking permits have been increased from \u00a352.00 a year to \u00a375.00 for the first car or \u00a3120.00 for the second car in your house hold!\nThis is an absolute insult to honest working people who quite frankly cant afford such prices on top of extortionate road tax and petrol prices.\nEspecially when we cant even ever get parked outside our own houses.\nMoney wasted on nothing!\nIf the government want us to carry on working, and earning TAX then they need to appreciate that we need our vehicles to get to work (as public transport is awful, and overpriced!!)and in order for us to keep our cars, we cannot afford prices like these.\nThis had not been done, as far as i can see, to become a more green country, it has been done to make more money out of innocent people! Please sign this petition if you can empathise or even sympothise with what i have said! Thankyou for your time",
