            "background": "Nurse Margaret Haywood, at the Royal Sussex Hospital could not stand the way elderly patients were mistreated. She complained to management but nothing happened. So she helped the BBC expose the malpractice. This has led to a national campaign to help elderly and defenceless patients.\n\nFor her public service, she has been struck off the register. \n\nAs surely as she has done a necessary and proper thing, the council that struck her off has harmed patient care.  She must be reinstated and the council reformed to ensure tha it does its job properly.",
