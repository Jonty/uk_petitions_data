            "background": "This petition is to ask the government to remove or relax the current PPS14 statement in Northern Ireland in order for local people to build much needed homes in rural areas. The conditions contained within this new policy are much to restrictive and the abandonment clause should be removed. Property prices have risen in N Ireland at a much greater rate than anywhere else in the UK over the last 2 years and it has to stop now. Our young people are having to leave the areas in which they were born to seek out affordable property elsewhere. Its true we all have a responsibility to look after and protect our countryside but this blanket ban is totally unnecessary. Thankyou and please sign this petition.",
