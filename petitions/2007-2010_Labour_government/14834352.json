        "background": "For those of you wondering why you would want to see animals stopped being sold in pet shops I suggest you have a look into where pet shop animals are sourced. Many of us know that pet shop animals originate from rodent farms, much like puppy mills which people look onto in disgust. They are kept in tiny cages where they are bred from again and again until they are of no use, and when that time comes they will be killed as they are of little use. No thought is put into their care, what temperament they are likely to have, whether or not illness runs through their lines. Nothing. Yet it\u2019s still legal for animals to be sold in pet shops.\n\nPet shops themselves aren\u2019t much better especially the smaller businesses. Many of us have been into pet shops and seen the animals unwell, in mixed sexes, lacking care, the people working there giving out wrong information etc. We want to help get them out of there but by buying we are only supporting the business and allowing for more animals to take their place. So what should you do? Sign this petition and have your voice heard in that you fully support the banning of all animals, small or large, warm or cold blooded.",
