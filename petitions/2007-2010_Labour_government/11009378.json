            "background": "The FSA have raised the required capital ratios for banks which has forced them to raise additional capital at short notice. As a result, banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland, LloydsTSB and HBOS have had to obtain funding on harsh conditions from the Government, and Barclays has also been forced to raise very expensive capital. The Government has in addition encouraged LloydsTSB to merge with HBOS as a way to rescue the latter from an uncertain future, to the disadvantage of LloydsTSB shareholders.\n\nShareholders will be affected by:\n\n1. Reduction of earnings per share by equity dilution and the high interest rate of 12% on the preference shares.\n\n2. The bar on ordinary dividends for five years as a term of these agreements.\n\n3. The Government gaining effective control from the new shares issued to them. \n\nBank shareholders\u2019 income and capital have been devastated as a result. No recognition of the interest of shareholders as equal stakeholders in these companies with depositors and the general public seems to have been taken.",
