The programmes they show are below standard with many repeats even at prime viewing time. In the past they have claimed that a licence fee must be paid so that they could provide a first class service. This is obviosly not the case. With the inception of phone in competitions the company now make millions of pounds off you the viewers every year and in the process commit blatant acts of fraud as has been widely covered in the press with their none existent prize winners. It is now time to show them that we the people are fed up with paying the ever increasing fees for this white elephant.",
