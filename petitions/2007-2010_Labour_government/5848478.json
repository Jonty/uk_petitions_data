            "background": "The murder of Alexander Litvinenko in November 2006 by poisoning with radioactive Polonium 210 has raised public awareness of the very real dangers of alleged Russian agents entering the UK with dangerous radioactive material, and the risk this poses to the health and lives of UK citizens. This petition calls on HM Government to take active steps to prevent the entry into the UK of persons carrying radioactive material, by introducing testing of all Russian citizens entering the UK, either directly from Russia or via a third country, for possession of radioactive materials.",
