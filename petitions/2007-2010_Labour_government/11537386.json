            "background": "A funeral is already a stressful enough event in itself, without having to worry about whether you are going to make it on time due to traffic. Therefore i strongly feel funeral processions should be allowed to travel in convoy indicated by a black flag on each car. The use of the black flag allows other people to acknowledge and give way to those in convoy. The black flag should allow use of bus lanes and give other drivers a recognition that they should give way to you. These facilities would take the stress out of an already sad and stressful event, it would give those involved peace of mind that they will be able to efficiently and respectfully make it to the funeral on time. Anyone tail gating and abusing the facility of the black flag should be penalised to the full penalty of the law.",
