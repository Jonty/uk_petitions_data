Money Central suggests that the Government truncate the phrase into the more manageable term: \u201cQueasing\u201d. As Carl Maxim, a reader of The Times who originally came up with the shortened version suggests, \u201cqueasing\u201d is much easier to pronounce and carries with it the slightly queasy feeling that one naturally feels when trying to save the economy from imminent collapse.",
