            "background": "As we are constantly denied the opportunity to have a referendum on the TV Licence Fee the only other opportunity is The Broadcasting (Television Licence Fee Abolition) Bill 2008-09 ( http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2008-09/broadcastingtelevisionlicencefeeabolition.html ).  If passed it would see an end to the TV licence, end the unfair monopoly and advantage that the BBC has had over every broadcaster in the UK.\n\nIt would also put an end to the bully boy tactics of the the BBC's enforcement arm - TVLicensing and their hired thugs at Capita.\n\nHowever each time it has been tabled for debate it has been \"postponed\" due to time constraints.  If we the people are not allowed a say on what we are taxed then our elected representatives must make time to debate it on our behalf.",
