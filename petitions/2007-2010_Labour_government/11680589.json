            "background": "At the moment the age at which children must be in formal educations is the term after their 5th birthday. \n\nFor many children this is too early and continuing with play based Nursey education would be of far more benefit.\n\nFor many children who are born in the summer months, being the youngest and least able in a year group is educationally and socially damaging. \n\nGiving parents the choice about their child's year group (and more flexibility about when they start formal education) would allow parents and schools to give children the education that they need, when they need it.\n\nThere is no reason why children should be in school at age 5 (although some children and ready for it and should not be prevented) but there is too much evidence of low self-esteem for children starting too early and failing for this to continue. Studies in Scandanavian countries have proved that children who start later suffer no detrimental effects.",
