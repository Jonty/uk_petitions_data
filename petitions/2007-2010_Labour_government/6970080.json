        "background": "On 17 Oct. 2007, the BBC announced plans to axe up to 2500 jobs and cut the budget for news and factual programmes,  because of a smaller-than-expected licence fee settlement. \n\nFirstly, there is the human cost to the employees who will be made redundant and their families. \n\nSecondly, there is the cost to our society - the dumbing-down of a  British institution that is respected  throughout the World. The UK taxpayer helps fund the BBC World Service through grant-in-aid;  the BBC's reputation depends on the whole of its output rather than the World Service merely.To diminish the quality of that output is to diminish the effectiveness of the World Service.\n\nThe BBC's Public Service Broadcasting  remit is to produce high-quality  programmes.  The public good must come first, and the BBC should be protected so it can fulfil its Public Service Broadcasting duties.\n\nThis is a petition to the British Government to intervene to:\n(1) save up to 2500 jobs at the BBC and\n(2) protect the high-quality news, documentary and factual programmes \n\nby ensuring that the license fee is used in ways fit for purpose rather than on extra tiers of management.\n\nSign the petition today.",
