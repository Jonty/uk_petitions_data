            "background": "Professor David Nutt was sacked on the 30th of October 2009 by Home Secretary Alan Johnson. One of the main reasons for this was his opposition to the reclassification of Cannabis from class C to class B, a decision make against the will of the government appointed drugs advisory body, the ACMD. Another reason for his sacking were his comments that LSD, Ectasy and Cannabis were more dangerous than alcohol and tobacco, a statement which is largely agreed with among doctors. I hope this error of judgement is corrected and the government reinstates the professor, as advisors should not be sacked based on  advice which is not to the government's liking.",
