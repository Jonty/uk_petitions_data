            "background": "Using the roads, whether as a motorist, cyclist or other is becoming increasingly difficult, confusing, frustrating and often dangerous, due to continuous restrictions on freedom of movement and inconsistant, non centralised traffic legislation and so called calming measures. Speed bumps are perhaps the most intrusive and contradictory,causing ineficient use of motor vehicles,damage to vehicles, increased pollution and a potential danger to both road users and padestrians,(due to where they are often sited). Relentless and unjustified local authority use of cameras to fine for trivial traffic contraventions is also spiralling beyond all reason.",
