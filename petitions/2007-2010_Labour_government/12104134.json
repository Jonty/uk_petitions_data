            "action": "Stop OAP FREE bus travel from crippling the public transport industry and causing driver redundancies",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Ever since the government introduced FREE concessionary bus travel for over 60's the british bus industry has suffered a lack of income resulting in increased fares for paying passengers and decreased income for the companies that provide that free transport. The bus companies are not paid the full fare for every pensioner that travels on a bus without paying. Instead they are paid around a third of the registered fare, this is in some cases causing small bus companies hardship which in Swindon in wiltshire is contributing to a bigger problem that is resulting in reduction in services and therfore driver requirement. Please sign the petition to remove free concessionary bus travel to those who are able to pay and only give free travel to those who are unable to walk a reasonable distance to shops and servies. \nI must state that I am not saying that nobody should be allowed free bus travel, the infirm and disabled that are unable to pay or have no other means of transport should still be allowed to travel for free but those who have the means should pay the half fare which was in place before this free travel rule came into force.",
