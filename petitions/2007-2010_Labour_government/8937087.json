        "background": "As an employee of the N.H.S. I believe hospital car park charging should be scrapped nationwide. It is unfair on staff who work very hard to look after patients. It is unfair on local residents who have to put up with their streets being choked with parked cars. Worst of all, it penalises patients and their loved ones at a time when they need it least. Patients should not have to pay for being ill or injured.",
