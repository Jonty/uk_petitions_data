        "background": "The DVLA should not be allowed to sell data to companies without first properly validating the claim, which would include a case presented by the company and a case presented by the individual.  I realise that the DVLA is not a court, and may not have the expertise to mediate such a situation, but at the the moment the indiscriminate selling of public data without sufficient merit must be considered a breach of the data protection act, and thus illegal.",
