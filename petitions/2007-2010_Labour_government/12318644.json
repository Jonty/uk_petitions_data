        "background": "Most debt collection is now being undertaken post sale of debt. The original creditor has ceased to be a \u2018client\u2019. People are now transactions, a name and an amount. \n\nDebt purchase is speculation. Peoples\u2019 lives are being traded like junk in a car boot sale. These speculators then take a gamble on enforcing \u2018debts\u2019 that they paid a pittance for. Money is their engine. \nI am a writer with personal and professional interest in the care of the mentally ill. I have seen and experienced first-hand the methods employed by debt collection agencies and am well aware of their tactics. In my opinion (and my own experience) they are driving people to suicide.\nSuch speculation and inhuman contempt for the welfare of others has no place in civilised society.",
