        "background": "The use of satellites to deliver fast internet services would be a much better option than landlines for rural communities, albeit more expensive, but then why should all UK users of telephones (many of whom may not even have a computer, let alone internet access) have to pay for rural broadband? Most of it will be used for entertainment purposes, notbusiness or essential use.",
