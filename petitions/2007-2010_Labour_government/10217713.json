        "background": "Drinking license work pretty much like a driving license, where at age of 18 you can apply to get one no check should be done besides making sure you are of the right age, it also should be free. After you receive your license you can purchase alcohol anywhere in the UK, without it you can\u2019t. You can also get points in your drinking license; if you are caught drink driving you lose it for few months and depending of the offence get sent to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse or something like that. Buying alcohol for under age children can also give you points or loss of the license. Drunken driven violence can also make you lose your license there are endless ways that this can help people. You can argue that this is not good but I see it this way, if you don\u2019t have a license on you it means two things one you chosen not to drink (which it\u2019s fine we respect your choice) or you lost your license duo to misuse of alcohol.",
