            "background": "Viewfield street in Stirling is very unsafe due to a CCTV blind spot. Cars are having their wing mirrors kicked off constantly in this street and nothing can be done as their is no evidence of this happening due to no CCTV coverage. Residents of Stirling should be able to park their cars and have peace of mind that they are safe and will not be vandalised when they come to collect their car. As viewfield is located right beside a busy stirling nightclub it makes sense to have full CCTV coverage in the street as it gets busy in the early hours of the morning.\n\nThis petition is to have CCTV installed so that viewfield street(FK8 1UA) can be safely monitored.",
