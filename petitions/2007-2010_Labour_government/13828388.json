            "background": "Some motorists are regularly driving whilst disqualified thereby causing more accidents. \n\nTo prevent this, police must receive a monetary bond when disqualified, so that if they risk driving again the motorist must pay for it or they can have their private car confiscated. If they use someone else's vehicle, as a Named Driver, the owner of the vehicle must be financially responsible for not letting them use the car. Too many disqualified motorists have access to the car keys and it encourages temptation.  Some motorists have been banned for drunk driving but caught driving after a couple of hours.",
