        "background": "The Government and local councils have tried in vain to advise and enforce individuals to clean up the mess left by walking dogs in public place. This has been largely ineffective and I feel that a total ban in dogs in public spaces should be imposed. In the 21st century it amazes me that while walking down a street I constantly have to be vigilant and avoid dog litter",
