            "background": "That the Prime Minister Gordon Brown communicate transparently with the British People the fact that The Copenhagen Treaty is not simply an ecological agreement between nations as it has been portrayed, and that if he signs it, it will put the British People under the rule of an unelected and unknown 'Global Government' that will have the power to dictate social and economic policy in the U.K., and the British Government will be legally powerless to oppose any policies that this unelected 'Government' (whoever they may be) chooses to impose upon us. I believe that the British People are and always should have been entitled to transparency on the very serious matter of maintaining our Sovereignty and control over our own affairs.",
