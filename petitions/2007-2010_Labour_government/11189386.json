        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Diesal costs less to produce than petrol and is more environmentally friendly, thus assisting in government targets to reduce emissions from vehicles.\n\nThe cost of diesal is now 16p per litre higher than petrol (over 70p per gallon).  It is now becoming uneconomic to run diesal cars and many who bought such vehicles to reduce emissions are likely to consider reverting to petrol vehicles, a worrying step in view of the government's targets on emission reduction.\n\nThe high costs also add to all delivery costs of supplies, adding to the cost of living.\n\nFuel companies should be forced to reduce the price at the pump to the same as or only slightly above petrol prices.",
