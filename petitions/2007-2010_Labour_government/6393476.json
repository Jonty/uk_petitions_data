            "background": "We urge the government to invest in the following 2 studies (which would be of very great interest and possibly benefit to the country (and world)):\n1. What will be the consequences if we do nothing about \"global warming\" - it may be that we will lose a couple of major cities worldwide, then re-locate now.\n2. What would the cost be for scientists/corporations to use technology to neutralise \"global warming\" - it is possibly a lot less than current green tax proposals worldwide.\nIt appears that green taxes are yet another knee jerk reaction, and governments retaining the \"climate of fear\" without considering alternatives.\nThis petition applies equally to all political parties and is not, therefore, criticising specifically this government.",
