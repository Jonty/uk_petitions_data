            "background": "Re-think and re-inburse the full 20 million so that the TA can train as normal. By cutting the TA budget you will cripple it for many years to come. These people volunteer to serve there country, there country should be there to serve them. The one Army phrase that has been fuesed between the regular Army and the TA will be lost. The TA has worked very hard these last few years to support it's regular brothers in arms on over seas deployments, the weekend warrior status has been dispelled and the TA has knitted into the Regular way of life very well but by making these cuts you force a wedge between them again. By April of next year the TA will have lost a large percentage of it's man power where serving personnel will leave during the cut. Re-think and  \nRe-inburse !!!",
