            "background": "We request that legislation be passed to ban all shops from opening on Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Day and on all days given in lieu when the holiday falls at weekends. There is no need for any shop to have to open on these days. Shop staff should be able to spend the festive season at home with their families and friends enjoying the holiday season and should not be forced into having to work just to satisfy greedy shop owners. People can easily wait for 2 days without the need to go shopping.",
