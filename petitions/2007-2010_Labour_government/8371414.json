            "background": "After a government review, new DWP guidelines allow people with more than one spouse to claim additional benefits for each spouse.  Bigamy and polygamy are illegal in the UK, and yet the taxpayer is to fund those who have entered into polygamous marriages abroad, and who then choose to live in this country.  It is submitted that this is an inappropriate use of public funds, and we call upon the Prime Minister to reverse this policy change.",
