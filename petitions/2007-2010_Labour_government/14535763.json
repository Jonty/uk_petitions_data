        "background": "The national drone plan being developed with BAE Systems and hoped to be introduced in time for the 2012 Olympics presents a massive infringement of civil liberties. They are intended for the apparent \"routine\" monitoring of antisocial motorists, protesters, agricultural thieves, fly-tippers and for covert urban surveillance. As well as presenting large capital costs there has been talk of personal data being sold to private companies without individuals permission, a clear breach of human rights.",
