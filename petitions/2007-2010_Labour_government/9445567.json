            "background": "I petitioned the government last year to make the DSA Taxi Test compulsory instead of it being left up to local authorities to chose whether they ask taxi drivers to take the test, the government are saying this is still the case and have no plans to change this currently. This lack of action is putting lives at risk as my husband was killed by a private hire driver, I firmly believe the government needs to reconsider its policy on this issue as this would improve road safety and prevent other families from having to go through the pain of losing their loved ones.",
