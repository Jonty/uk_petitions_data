            "background": "In order to reduce the number of power stations being built and help reduce carbon emmissions I would like to petition the Government to make it compulsory for all property developments to include in their plans a sustainable, renewable energy source that equals the projected energy requirements of a building.  Guidelines could be developed around the occupancy levels etc to come up with a formula to convert this into consumption figures for a building - an energy source equal to the average estimated consumption should then be compulsory.  \n\nGrants to householders with existing buildings should also be drastically improved if this Government is serious about climate change and reducing emmissions.",
