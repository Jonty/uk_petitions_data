            "background": "Why must we suffer 24 hours a day of droning HGV's thundering along on one of the noisiest sections of motorway in the country? You have been asked each year for funding by Carillion but although promising it at one point, it has been rejected every year, 2007 included. My windows have to stay tightly shut, day and night , regardless of the weather as the noise is intolerable. You waste millions of of pounds of our money every year, so please do something constructive with some of it and resurface this ONE mile remaining!! (Before you are LEGALLY obliged to do it in line with EEC directives - 2009!!!)",
