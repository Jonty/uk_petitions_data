Can you stop this abuse, please?\n\n     We need to have an investigation on our immigration file as our\n     status is wrong. If we can\u2019t stay in your country, please can\n     you help us find another one.\n\n     We are not intentionally homeless and we don\u2019t have any\n     documents (passport of any sort) Our position in your country\n     is very suspiciously.\n\n     My family are a victim of terror. \n\n     Yours sincerely Mrs.Alla Madison",
