            "background": "A recent consultation document issued by Kensington & Chelsea Primary Care Trust (PCT), on behalf of all London PCTs, proposes that from April 2008 onwards, the 'indicative allocation' for all gay men's HIV prevention commissioned, by the NHS, on a pan-London basis will be up to \u00a31,145,960. \n\nThe maximum proposed budget of \u00a31,145,960 for HIV prevention serving gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) represents about \u00a37.64 per year, per man in the city (assuming there are 150,000 MSM resident in London). This would mean that London PCTs will invest less in the prevention of HIV infection in 2008 than they did in 1998, when the precursor to the current London Gay Men\u2019s HIV Prevention Programme (now LGMHPP, previously called 4PI, 5PI and 6PI) invested over \u00a32 million per year in HIV prevention with gay men.",
