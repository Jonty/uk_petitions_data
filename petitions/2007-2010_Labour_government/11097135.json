            "background": "I am horrified at the repeated failure of professionals charged with the protection of children to recognise that an innocent child was being tortured to death. The idea of accountability is that people admit responsibility for their actions, or in this case, inaction. Whether people have a hard job or not is irrelevant, the fact is they failed to do the job they are paid for. This cannot be dismissed and we cannot be told this will not happen again. A mistake is not a mistake when it happens 60 times. Agencies cannot be so incompetent when it is people's lives they are dealing with and cases like this should not be covered up by those individuals who choose to close ranks.",
