            "background": "There are over one million people in Britain with sight loss, many of whom are elderly. Services such as emotional support, low vision provision and rehabilitation are often not offered until the latter stages of sight loss, in some areas, not at all. Blindness is not a minor inconvenience and people should be actively offered help in the early stages of sight loss. Helping people to remain independent saves the nation money and maintains dignity for the individual.",
