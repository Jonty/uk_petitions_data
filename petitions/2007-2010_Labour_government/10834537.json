The details should include whether this has been done through the individual Member of Parliament or via an intermediary investing on their behalf.  If found to be involved in the underselling of shares (either personally or by an intermediary) which has resulted in them profiting from the current situation, disciplinary action should be taken and the results made freely available to the UK public.  This petition does not relate to MPs' disclosure of expenses for constitutional duties.",
