        "background": "It has become apparent to us that the main cause of Islamophobia in Britain today is the lack of knowledge on the subject of Islam, coming from supporters of the BNP and other such organisations. We do not believe that most of their followers are bad people. Because of this, we believe that with a state-sponsored media campaign to educate the British public on the true peaceful message of Islam, the negative campaigning coming from the far-right may be subdued.",
