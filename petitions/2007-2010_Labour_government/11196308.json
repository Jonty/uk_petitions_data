            "background": "We live in France pay our taxes in the UK but are not paid the winter fuel alowance because we live overseas.  We have no option but to pay our taxes in the UK as my husband was emplyed by local authority. We still have to heat our home from our pension.  Many people who live in EU countries who were paid winter fuel allowances before leaving the UK are still in receipt of the payment.  Why because we live abroad are we exempt and discriminated against but have no option but to pay our taxes in the UK. There is over 55 million pounds unallocated fuel and insolation money in the UK Government coffers but we have no access to it.  Mr Brown you are using our taxes but not being fair to us and many many others in the same situation.We ask you to change the governement policy to allow WFA payments for overseas residents.",
