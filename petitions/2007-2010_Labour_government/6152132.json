Is there anything the you can do to prevent this disgusting penalty from occurring? Surely pressure can be brought to bear economically, anything to stop this barbaric practice? I hope you can stop this appalling sentence as soon as possible - please can you help? I have very little idea of whom to speak to next but perhaps you can wield some influence? Yours sincerely Rachel Ruffles.",
