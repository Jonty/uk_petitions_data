        "background": "The treatment of Pernicious Anaemia in the U.K. centres on the patient receiving an injection of Vitamin B12 every three months.  Many sufferers of Pernicious Anaemia need more frequent injections in order that they can enjoy an average quality of life.\nSome sufferers lead a normal life for the first month after their injection but live in a 'fog' for the next two months.  A great number of such patients have suffered needlessly for forty years.\nIt is impossible to overdose on the Vitamin as it is a water soluble protein that is excreted in urine.\nThe undertreatment of patients is therefore unecessary and is the subject of most complaints and enquiries to the Pernicious Anaemia Society.",
