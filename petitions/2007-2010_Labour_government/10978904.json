            "background": "EMA is currently only available to students over 16. I ask that this is changed, because it is unfair on students who have been moved up a year (therefore are 16 while in the first year of higher education). We are doing the same work, yet we are not eligible for EMA. Please change this.\n\nI also ask that EMA is not awarded on the basis of Parent's earnings. Simply because parents earn too much for their son / daughter to receive EMA, does not mean that the student has access to the equivalent amount of money from their parents.\n\nThe EMA also does not take into account how many people there are in the household. A house with five students in may earn too much for EMA, but the money is not sufficient to provide for all of them.",
