            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "CB Radio on both the UK and European \"CEPT\" channels are now free to use without a license. However, users are legally restricted to 4 watts. 27MHz is not a particularly good frequency to use due to interference, propagation, building penetration and noise levels. 4 watts of power cannot travel very far on a hand-held radio.\n\nWe have PMR446, also license free. This is a great improvement, however, the power output is minimal at less than half a watt. The range is too short.\n\nWe would like to see a VHF/UHF CB allocation, license free which permits:\nMore power (5 watts or above).\nModes other than FM.\nChannelised operation.\nAbility to use external antennas.\nAllows encrypted data and voice.\n\nThis will allow a reasonable range for communication not offered by the existing CB and PMR446 specification. The allocation can be UK only (like the UK specific CB frequencies) so we do not need to be harmonised with the rest of the EU.\n\nFrequencies freed from the Digital Switch over will be ideal for the new service. 10-20 channels will be enough, and to save frequencies, OFCOM can mandate a the use of a digital mode.",
