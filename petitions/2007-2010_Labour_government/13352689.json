        "background": "I would like to petition the government to increase wages country wide to reflect the cost of living.\nPeople in this country are tired of never being able to get on top of the basics, then the following year all the costs go up but most wages stay the same and rarely reflect the increases.\n\nIncreased wages would ensure more ability to spend and support the retail market, decrease the instances of credit cards being used to pay day to day basic bills we can all no longer afford to pay out of just our income.\nAlso if the wages were higher there would be more insentive for people on benefits to get a job and improve their standard of living. Getting a job should not mean your standard of living drops.",
