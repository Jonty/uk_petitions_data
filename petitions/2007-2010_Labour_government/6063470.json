            "background": "The central aim of this group is to reduce carbon emissions around the globe. By eradicating footprints, we aim to make the world a better place. To achieve this central aim, we have four daily tasks we\u2019d ask you all to perform:\n\n1) If car use is essential to your daily routine, (i.e. nipping to the post-box, picking the kids up from school, popping out to grab a pint of milk) we would encourage you to put your bicycle in the back of the car.\n\n2) Try to hold your breath for 30 secs each day, this will save a significant amount of oxygen and therefore allow more trees and animals to flourish.\n\n3) Burn any non-recyclable items. i.e. tyres, aerosol cans, and fridges. We cannot over-emphasise the importance of this \u2013 re-using only postpones the problem.\n\n4) One simple way to reduce your carbon footprint is to walk around on tiptoes.\n\nIf you are able to achieve any of these tasks please take photos and add them to the group to encourage others to participate in these essential activities.\n\nWe've imagined a different world, can you?",
