            "background": "The bodies of the returning war dead are received at either RAF Lyneham or Brize Norton. They are given a police escort by the Wiltshire Constabulary to the border with Thames Valley Police. It would appear that Thames Valley Police do not provide an escort from their to the coroner\u2019s Office in Oxford. The photographs of the progress or lack of it, of the hearses in the media recently were quite distressing and indicated a complete lack of respect and dignity for the war dead.\n\nWe ask the PM to ensure that due respect and dignity is shown to our returning war dead by putting regulations in place that provide for a police escort to be in attendance when such bodies are in transit within the UK.",
