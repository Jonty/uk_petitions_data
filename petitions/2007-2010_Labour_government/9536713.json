Unlike Exeter\u2019s GPO in Bedford Square, it is not upstairs and therefore it is the only post office in the centre of Exeter to be accessible to the elderly, disabled, and mothers with push chairs. The staff could not be more friendly, helpful and indeed, they provide something of a community service. Despite the huge profits it has made the government has announced that it will be closed by Aug 2008. We have the chance to change this. We need your signatures.",
