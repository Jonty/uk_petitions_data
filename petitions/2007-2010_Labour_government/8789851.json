            "background": "Brook Street was declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) more than two years ago after it was discovered levels of nitrogen dioxide would exceed national and European standards by 2010.\n\nThe council came up with a nine point plan of action drawn up in November 2006, but has failed to take any further action to date. In the mean time, many new homes have been built in the surrounding area, making congestion worse, and using up the remaining green areas in the town. \n\nPossible solutions include traffic management to keep cars moving along the road and the possibility of banning heavy goods vehicles and buses, while innovative paint which can soak up noxious gases may be introduced. The council seem to have decided that the best way to stop people from suffering the effects of poor traffic management is to remove people from their homes, rather than deal with the traffic as they are supposed to do.",
