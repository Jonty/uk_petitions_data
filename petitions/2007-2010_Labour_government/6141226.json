        "background": "Recently I have read of motorists sitting for hours waiting on the carriageway of amotorway after it has ben closed due to an unforseen incident. When this occurs a procedure should be put into operation as fast as possible to allow traffic to turn round in a controlled manner and leave the motorway shepherded by police controlled convoys. \nCurrently there are families, children, invalids, businessmen and others who are expected to sit for 4  or 5 hours maybe in considerable distress or discomfort for the motorway to reopen. This is unacceptable and can easily be avoided. There should be a maximum delay set as a target for clearing the motorways under such circumstances.",
