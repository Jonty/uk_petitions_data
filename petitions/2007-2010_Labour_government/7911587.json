        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Every day we dispose of thousands of consumer goods that are less than 2 years old - kettles, toasters, electronic gadgets etc.  The disposable society is here, driven by the desire for lower prices at the point of sale at the expense of the environment.\n\nWe call upon the government to provide incentives to manufacturers to sell products that last, and suggest reducing the rate of VAT as the length of manufacturers warranty increases.  \n\nThis would begin to reflect the cost to the environment of consumer goods that quickly fail and end up in landfill.",
