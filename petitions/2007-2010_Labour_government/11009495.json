            "background": "More and more people are being drawn into fuel poverty because of rising bills from utility companies recording huge profits. \n\nThe winter fuel payment was introduced to help the elderly on fixed incomes meet the cost of keeping warm. Yet while some retirees who can afford to winter abroad on warmer shores are still eligible for the allowance, low-income households, including those with sick children and the disabled, are not eligible. We are calling on the government to make the system more equitable and to make payments available to those in most need.\n\nWe also urge the government to provide a way for those who feel they don\u2019t need the winter fuel payment to return it so it can be given to those whose need is greater and also to ensure the energy companies extend the uptake of their social tariffs.\n\nMake heat fair. Together we can make it happen.",
