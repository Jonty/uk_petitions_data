            "background": "Crewe lies at the heart of 6 major railway routes, and vehicular routes into the town must cross the lines by single-carriageway roads using Victorian over- and under-bridges.  The resulting traffic flow already strangles Crewe at peak periods and often throughout the day.\n\nA major rebuild for the town centre has been given planning approval and is scheduled to start in 2008.  With emphasis now towards more \u201cgreen\u201d travel, this could provide a great opportunity to build a light-rail system to link all parts of the town.\n\nThe infrastructure has been in place for 170 years and would only require the creation of hop-on and off stops, with occasional minor branch lines.  The system could provide a viable alternative to the car, especially if services could be provided to the nearby towns of Nantwich and Sandbach, with stops provided for intermediate villages where practicable.\n\nWith government intervention, inspiration and vision, Crewe could become the green-transport town of the 21st century.",
