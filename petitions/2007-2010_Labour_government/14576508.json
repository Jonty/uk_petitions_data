Do you know what they call alternative medicine that's been proven to work?\n\nMedicine.\"\n\nAs highlighted by the recent 10:23 campaign, organised by the Merseyside Skeptics Society and other skeptical organisations nationwide, the NHS is spending millions of pounds each year on so-called \"medicine\", which has no basis in science.\n\nNot only do these \"treatments\", \"remedies\" and \"therapies\" fool patients into believing that they are receiving proper medical treatment - often whilst their condition deteriorates - but the NHS funding spent on Complementary and Alternative Medicine could be put do better use elsewhere.  \n\nFor example, this money could instead be used for research into promising drugs, or supplying drugs that are deemed \"too expensive\".\n\nWe hope that the Prime Minister will see the sense in reducing public spending on these ridiculous, pseudoscientific treatments.",
