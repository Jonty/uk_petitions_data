        "background": "We have had enough of the scandalous loss of laptops and data storage devices in questionable circumstances.\n\nLet there be a legislation to make it unlawful for anyone to walk the streets with peoples personal data in Laptops and any storage devices.\n\nThe encrytion solution suggested by Cabinet Secretary is good but not a sound solution for professionals like me. \n\nI petition the PM to call on the Parliament to legislate that all personal data should be held in secure centrally managed database system with access granted to those who use them outside the office through remote internet access to well passworded and firewalled central system.\n\nThat way no personal information is held in the laptop and no storage devices are required. So if stolen no personal data will be lost.",
