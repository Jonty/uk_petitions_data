Last year 2 million people died from AIDS in sub-saharan africa.\nOne of the major reasons for the spread of AIDS in this area is unprotected sex.\nThe catholic church has great influence in the area, and yet it continues to denounce the use of condoms.\nThe use of condoms in this region could greatly reduce the further spread of AIDS.\nMillions of people have died because of the catholic church's actions, and millions more will in the future.\nThe blood of millions of people is on the hands of the catholic church, and they should answer for it.",
