            "background": "The Japanese are a tad weird in feeling the need to kill intelligent creatures such as dolphins and whales as part of \"culls\" and \"scientific research\". Everyone knows this is complete bunkum yet no one does anything about it. We think that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland should put its nuclear weapons to good use and bomb the Japanese if they cease to desist in this vile and unwarranted slaughter of our marine animals.",
