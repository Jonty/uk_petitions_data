        "background": "The BBC has already announced its intention to transfer the Casualty programme from Bristol to Cardiff as part of its efforts to increase the amount of network programming produced in Wales from 2.5% to 5% of the total.  The transfer has the potential to enable the BBC to develop a drama centre of excellence in the Cardiff area with year round work for all involved from the cast through to the crew, set designers etc.\n\nIt is clear that this is an unsettling time for everybody involved in Casualty which is why we believe the uncertainty should be ended immediately.\n\nIf Casualty is not transferred, we do not see how the BBC will be able to deliver on its pledge to double the network programming produced in Wales.\n\nIn addition, Cardiff is currently the second most significant media hotspot in the UK behind London.  This position is threatened by the developments in North West England at Salford Media City.  Cardiff wants to develop its media offer and grow it so that it continues to be seen as the number two location in the UK, thereby attracting jobs and companies to South Wales and creating business opportunities for those based in the South West of England.",
