            "background": "The current legislation allowing the police to take DNA samples, even from innocent people, breaches a fundamental principal - that your body belongs to you.  The state ignores this truth and decides it has a right to take material from our bodies to be catalogued and used against us.  If the state gives itself ownership rights over our bodies then this is effectively politicianry - the ownership of other beings - and politicianry is both abhorrent and illegal under international law.\n\nWe call upon the Government to recognise it has made a mistake and to denounce any power it may think it has to take DNA from people.  Even if it thinks it has the right it is wrong.",
