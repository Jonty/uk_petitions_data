            "background": "Millions of low paid workers will be worse off following the abolition of the 10p tax band, whilst higher earners will be better off. The Prime Minister claims that despite being worse off due to this latest change, Labour have made the poor families richer from other measures. Whilst this might be true \"giving with one hand and taking away with the other\" is hardly a policy for making the poor richer. Moreover, not all low paid workers are married with kids and are not,therefore, eligible for family credit.  How then has the Labour government helped them? Perhaps they do not think they need the votes of the low paid workers.",
