This is censorship.\n\nObviously hate legislation should be in place for those people inciting murder, rape, beatings, discrimination etc, but there should be no corporate body or religion (man-made or divine) above criticism.\n\nWhen religions start to become protected from criticism, then we move into an era  where freedom of speech will be denied.  \n\nThe West has grown due to individuals taking a stand for what they believe in.  Current legislation allows such individuals to be censored.",
