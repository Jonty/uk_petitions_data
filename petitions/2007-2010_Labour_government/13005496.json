            "background": "To bring back pride, and to let our children know of history of the country that they were born into and live in.\n\nI feel that the national anthem should be taught and sang everyday in schools within the country.\n\nI also feel that national service should be reinstated for all 16 year olds on completion of full time education. This would soon instil discipline and the possibility of respect between all cultures in the current teenagers.\n\nI'm sure it would also stop them hanging around on street corners, stabbing and fighting amongst each other!!!",
