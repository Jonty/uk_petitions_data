Future Governments to be formed from successful business people, entrepreneurs, and leading captains of industry showing leadership, inspiration, innovation, and real values.  These to be seconded at whatever cost their parent business demands, for a limited timeframe of not more than 5 years following which they return, and new people nominated by the public to manage and run UK Plc properly as a business.  Two successive terms maximum.  Political parties may continue, and influence but not form, Governments.  The only criteria to be UK taxpayers, voters, citizens, and proven achievement of success, on any scale.  They must have a history of successful management, in any field of endeavour that inspires and enthuses our tired and very cynical nation to achieve greatness again.  Anyone found or deemed to have any political aspiration whatsoever to be automatically disbarred.",
