            "background": "Do you really know who your mortgage lender is? \nThese securitisation companies are now in the repossession business (as contrasted with the mortgage business). Thus, they will force you into 'alleged' arrears through excessive charges and then repossess your home. The public need to get wise to what has really happened to their mortgages and need to understand that what's happening is the result of your mortgages having been securitised.",
