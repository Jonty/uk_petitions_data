            "background": "Road safety would be improved immeasureably if we all had to retake our driving tests every so many years.  It's ludicrous that we can take our driving test at 18 years old and are then let out on the road never to be re-examined - it's no wonder there's so many traffic accidents and bad driving habits.  The retests could be every 5 years or every 10 years or at certain ages and ESPECIALLY, say, every year after you reach the age of 65 or 70 etc.",
