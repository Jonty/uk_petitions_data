            "background": "The BBC has sacked Arlene Phillips from Strictly Come Dancing because Jay Hunt (the BBC 1 Controller) says the programme needs 'refreshing' - Arlene Phillips is a trained dance professional and replacing her with Alesha Dixon is viewed by most as a cheap tack to compete with the ratings on the ITV X Factor that runs at the same time.  I urge the PM to step on to the dance floor and support this petition for Arlene to be reinstated as a valuable asset on the Strictly judging panel",
