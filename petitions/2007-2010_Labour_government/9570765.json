            "background": "GBL has been widely available in the UK and is used on the club scene (predominantly on the Gay club circuit). GBL creates GHB in the body, a drug that is already banned in the UK.\nGBL is addictive and can effect the mind of the user. It has been known to cause symptoms not unlike Paranoid Schizophrenia and will end eventual suicide. For the casual user it can be fatal - causing the user to \"fall down\" or \"go under\" into a brain protecting coma. If mixed with alcohol this can and usually is fatal. These deaths, whether suicide or accidental death are generally labelled as \"unexplained\" as the chemical CANNOT be found in the body by the time of investigation.\nWe would like to see the sale of GBL (commonly available dressed as Alloy Wheel Cleaner or Nail Polish Remover) illegal ASAP.",
