            "background": "An increasing number of telecommunications companies are charging customers for receiving hard copies of their phone bills. The companies reasoning behind this is that paper bills are bad for the environment. Once they impose this fee, a percentage of the charge will be passed on to a third party to'plant a tree'. They wish customers to pay online and therefore forgo this additional charge. This charge penalises those with no access to the internet, I.T. equipment and those less well off in society. This thinking is effectively companies levelling their own corporate 'green' tax! Companies should leave it to customers decide which good cause, if any their money should go towards. They should only charge for the cost of the service they provide.",
