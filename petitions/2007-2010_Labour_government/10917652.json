            "background": "The Student Loan Company has the power,under the law to demand a full years' payment back immediately, if the deferment deadline is missed.Often this deadline has been missed due to clerical error, not the fault of the former student.If there are other loans for other years these may continue to be deferred, under the rules.If someone is deemed unable to afford to pay due to low income, how can they be expected to pay a years' money? The Student Loan Company operates under the law, so we demand this law is changed to stop unecessary hardship of low income people.",
