        "background": "At present, some of the lazy energy suppliers (such as npower) dont bother to take meter readings for up to 2 years. \n\nThis can have the large side effect on the customer - the customer can unintentionally be using excessive energy and by using estimates is not in a position to make course adjustments in their energy consumption. \n\nThe energy companies buy their electricity at 5p/Kwh from the generators and sell it on at up to 18p/Kwh. Its time they provide some customer service for this large mark up.",
