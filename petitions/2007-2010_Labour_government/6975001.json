            "background": "The DSA intend reducing the number of Test Centres in the UK focusing the public into Multi Purpose Test Centre\u2019s (MPTC). The MPTC are heavily bias towards motorcycles, and do not offer the required facilities for the local public, who within the Midlands Area will only have 19 Possible centers, therefore forced to travel a greater distance to test centres \u2013 this has an adverse affect on the MPTC\u2019s local surrounding with such an increase in road use and the driving instructors capacity for lessons, for which an increased costs will need to be recovered. \nThe Shirley Test Centre offers a excellent central location for the local public, and other DSA test centres are simply not adequate or able to deal with such additional capacity.",
