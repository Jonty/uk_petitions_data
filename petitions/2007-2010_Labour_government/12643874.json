When you've got people using it to feather their own nests, that makes about as much sense as a 75 year old man claiming maternity allowance.\n\nI propose that, like any other form of benefit, the ACA becomes means tested and becomes what it should be; a way to incentivise those from poorer backgrounds to join without financially suffering.\n\nAnyone earning more than their ministerial salary through any means (investments, after dinner speaking, consultancy, owning their own business)should have their ACA reduced accordingly.",
