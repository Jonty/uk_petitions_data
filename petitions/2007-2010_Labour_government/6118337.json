            "background": "As housing becomes more and more expensive, preventing 1st time buyers from getting on the property ladder and finacially crippling those that do, there needs to be a limit introduced on the number of properties that individuals can own in order to bring down house prices. Is it fair that currntly half of new housing in central london is not even lived in as people treat these as investments? is it fair that people can not find housing in their home towns as wealthy people buy \"holiday\" homes? Also there should be some form of rent control introdued in london to make it more affordable for key workers and the public in general to live in the Capital and enable us to enjoy a better quality of life.",
