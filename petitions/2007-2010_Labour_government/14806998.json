            "background": "Properties which are repossesed by Banks and Building Societies are marketed through Estate Agents. Even if an offer is made by a buyer at the asking price, the Bank or B.S. will accept a higher offer up to the point of exchange of contracts. This is encouraging the practice of gazumping, which the Banks discourage their own clients from indulging in, whilst at the same time actively practice themselves.",
