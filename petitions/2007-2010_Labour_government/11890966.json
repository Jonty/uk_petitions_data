            "background": "All are touched by Jade Goody's Cervical Cancer fight. \nMany women have been put in this situation the \"doctors research\" showed under 25s were less likely to get. \nIf this was a man's problem would we have this debate?! The last petition reached just over 13000 we need to increase this by at least another 100k. \n\nCervical Smear testing must be reduced to at least 18 years old, we can  COMPRIMISE to reduce to 20. One of the virus' that causes the disease is highly active in our teenage girls,England has a high non protected sex rate - education will assist in this as generations go by.\nWe need action NOW. \n\nTeenage girls grow up usually with no knowledge they have been infected with anything that could be cancerous - the HPV virus doesnt normally show symptoms, so unless you have caught another STD why would you get tested - until they reach 25, have smear and find its too late...\n\nCome on you Professors, doctors and medics- show us we are right to be concerned - why do we have to petition and shout before anything substantial occurs. On occasions us women are right to nag and shout!! \nPLEASE PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION FOR THE FUTURE OF ALL YOUR DAUGHTERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS.",
