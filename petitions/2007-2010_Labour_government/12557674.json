            "background": "Hello, My Question is why the Government continues to imprison/fine citizens for personal use of cannabis, it is clear that cannabis has health risks but this  contradiction of the government protecting our health does not apply to alcohol when this is a clearly more harmful drug. Alcohol costs the tax payer millions of pounds each year in medical, vandalism and deaths each year. When cannabis has no recorded deaths, could the PM give the people a logical reason for the continued ban of cannabis.",
