        "background": "Adults who suffer from Rheumatoid Arthritis have to pay full charges or pay for a pre-payment certificate to obtain the medication they need to have a relatively pain free existence. If medication is stopped a flare up is extremely painful and also costly to the NHS if the sufferer has to go into hospital for treatment.\nMany sufferers have at least 5 or 6 items a month and many have a lot more, and to have to pay for them is unfair, when other diseases qualify for free prescriptions because they need them to be able to have a quality of life. Please support the people who suffer in silence with an almost invisible disease to be able to afford their medication.",
