        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Even though bigamy is a crime in Britain, this decision by ministers means that polygamous marriages can now be recognised formally by the state, so long as the weddings took place in countries where the arrangement is legal. Benefit Departments are getting ready to pay them. The Government should beware of unintended consequences. This should be stopped immediately as it is an affront to sanity and to the sensibilities of the majority of hard-pressed taxpayers in this country.  This is yet another divisive dilution of the British way of life. Those that want multiple wives must be prepared to live in those countries that consider it legal.  They must never expect that they will get any state support for the consequences of having more than one wife in Britain. To allow these changes will only encourage the belief that separate laws and justice can be tolerated in Britain.  Say no and mean no and our communities will be more integrated and the stronger for it.  We expect our prime minister to protect the British hard won way of life and to uphold the bedrock of Britain\u2019s laws, justice system and social values.",
