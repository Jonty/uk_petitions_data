            "background": "Ballroom dancing is a lost art in this country and something that nobody should be embarrassed about admitting to liking.  Some of our best athletes are Ballroom Dancers.  Some we know about, such as Darren Bennet and Ian Waite.  And others, such as the 2007 world number 3 couple Christopher and Justyna Hawkins.  Because of the rising popularity of Ballroom and latin dancing in this country, with the ever popular 'Strictly Come Dancing', it stands to reason that we should make this an olympic sport.  After all, like football  , it was once an olympic sport, then it was scrapped.  So I ask you all to bring this sport back.  Make ballroom/latin dancing an olympic sport!",
