        "background": "It must be obvious that any individual who is suffering from an illness or disability which can be relieved by a drug created for the purpose, but who does not receive this drug, will be less able to care for him/herself than would be the case if he/she was prescribed this drug.  In many cases this means he/she requires help of some sort from Social Services; this obviously costs something, probably quite a lot, so the cost should be factored into any decision about prescribing the drug even if we, as a society, lack the compassion to prescribe it as a way of improving the individual's quality of life.",
