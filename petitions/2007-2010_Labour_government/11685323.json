Why when the cost per barrel seems to have settled at between $43.00 to $48.00, do we see increases from the petrol companies of between 4 to 6 pence per litre on both petrol and diesel within a ten day period. Also to look at the area pricing differences that are found on forecourts and are they fair to the consumer.",
