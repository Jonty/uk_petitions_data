            "background": "The London Olympic Village has recently been bailed out by public funds due to a lack of private investment. Following the 2012 games it would seem sensible to use a proportion of this accomodation for MPs whose constituency lies outside what could be considered reasonable commuting distance (50 miles). This would effectively mitigate the requirement for second homes and associated \"mistakes\" with regard to filing of expenses claims.",
