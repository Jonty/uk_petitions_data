            "background": "At the present carers of the above have too pay full council tax, even those whose only income is Carers Allowance.  I provide more than 35hrs pw care for my child and only receive Carers Allowance and DLA.  These are not substantial payments and only cover a some of the costs of care.  Add to this the cost of Council Tax, when carers of other parties who do not reside with the people they care for are exempt or offered discounts.\n\nThis I belive to be discrimination and unacceptable in a modern society.",
