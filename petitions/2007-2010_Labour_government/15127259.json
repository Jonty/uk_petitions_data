            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We are calling on the Government to acknowledge the value of repair in lowering the carbon footprint of information and communications technology (ICT) by abolishing VAT on the repair of ICT hardware such as servers, routers and telephone systems.\n\nIn order to help businesses reduce their e-waste and carbon footprints, the Government should consider providing a tax incentive that allows businesses to take a greener approach to the maintenance of ICT equipment, rather than solely supporting investment in new \u2018eco-friendly\u2019 technologies that don\u2019t always deliver the environmental benefits promised.  \n\nWhile newer products may consume less energy during their working lives, they are actually produced via extremely energy-intensive manufacturing processes.  Consequently, any energy savings realised by the new technology are merely absorbed by the growing footprint of manufacturing it in the first place.\n\nBy eliminating VAT on ICT repair, the Government would be taking a huge step towards lowering ICT\u2019s carbon footprint, helping businesses adopt a far more sustainable approach to ICT.",
