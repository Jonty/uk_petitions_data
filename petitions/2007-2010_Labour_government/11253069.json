        "action": "raise the tax freshhold up to \u00a310000 a year instead of giving more money to banks.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This move would be the equal of taking those on minimum wage working 35 hours  a week out of tax banding.\nThe cost would be 40 billion pounds.\nThe next bail out to the banks would be \u00a350 billion.\nBanks will not make this new money available to customers as they will need to recover their liquid assets.\nTo further pay for this measure the vat cut should be reversed immediately! No additinal spending is resulting from the measure and all that is happening is the Government is losing revenue from goods and services that people have to buy anyway. \nThe change in tax freshold will create a significant difference between those on benefit and those in work and should encourage more people into lower paid work even in a tempory measure.",
