            "background": "Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand are the victims of an hysterical witch hunt encouraged by the media and the Daily Mail in particular. Their tasteless actions would have received very little publicity and the hurt caused would have been very much reduced had this campaign not got under way. This bandwagon is now overloaded with the figures jumping on it, from the Prime Minister, to deflect attention away from the economy, to the various media personalities trying to advance themselves or deflect attention from their failures in this. Its roots lie in jealousy and spite over Ross's reported salary and the wider debate over the BBC funding. They are both talented presenters who made a hideous mistake which could and should have been nipped in the bud by the BBC producers, whose job it is to check content before broadcast.",
