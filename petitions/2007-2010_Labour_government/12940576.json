Available for free, or at a low cost;\n2. Permanent or cover a generous time period; \n3. For up to 1500 people - to cover normal community sized events;\n4. Linked to the organisation such as church, club, WI or community group, as opposed to an individual;\n5. Flexible, allowing multiple small events at short notice, not just for a specific event.\n\n\u2022 Enforcement would simply involve the license being immediately withdrawn were it misused. \n\nLets *encourage* people to hold community events rather than put them off through fear of law-breaking, fines and/or jail!",
