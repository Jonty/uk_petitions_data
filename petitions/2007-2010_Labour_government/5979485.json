            "background": "SOME MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT ARE ABUSING THEIR POSITION AS MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT BY TAKING PART IN TV ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAMS.\nI BELIEVE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HAVE A DUTY TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO FOCUS ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK ONLY. THE EVER GROWING PROBLEMS FACING BRITAIN BOTH SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND THIS REQUIRES GREAT COMMITMENT.\nBORIS JOHNSON AND GEORGE GALLOWAY ARE TWO TYPICAL EXAMPLES OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO REGULARLY APPEAR ON TV AND RADIO ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAMS ACTING LIKE BUFFOONS. THIS COUNTRY NEEDS MP's OF THE HIGHEST CALIBRE AND NOT THOSE SEEKING CELEBRITY IN REALITY TV SHOWS ETC. I ASK EVERYONE  TO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS PETITION TO HAVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FORBIDDEN TO APPEAR IN ANY ENTERTAINMENT TV SHOWS ESPECIALLY THOSE NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THERE WORK AS MP'S. AFTER ALL, ITS US THE PUBLIC THAT PAY THEIR  WAGES.",
