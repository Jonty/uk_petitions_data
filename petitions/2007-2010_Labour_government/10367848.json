            "background": "So we have heard that Gordon Brown is putting aside \u00a33 million to give Margaret Thatcher a state funeral. WHY?? This woman all but closed Scotland down, privatised much of industry causing closures and strikes, took the country to war where young lives were lost needlessley, unemployment was at an all time high, she also took us into a recession. As far as I can see did little to improve the country as a whole. WHY is millions of taxpayers money being wasted on a state funeral. The health service and education are crying out for money, as are other areas. I would rather see this money being put to a good cause where the needy will benefit rather than this ludicrous waste of public money. Please support this petition.",
