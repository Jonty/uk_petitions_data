            "background": "The French governement on many occasions has failed to stop blockades by French farmers and French fishermen at Calais casuing an impact on our already strained transport, fishing and farming industry. These blockades have a direct and material impact on our industry. Blocking ports that are a gateway to Europe and vital for the flow of imports and exports to and from Britain is illegal and is inacceptable in a Economic Free Trade Area. We demand the Prime Minister stands up for Britians rights and submits a request for compensation from the French government.",
