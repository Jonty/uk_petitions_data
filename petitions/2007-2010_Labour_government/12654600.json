Those few MPs who have so abused the system will not resubmit inappropriate claims whereas the majority who have not can be swiftly reimbursed.  Resubmitted expenses should be in the public domain and reviewed swiftly by an independent panel but it is likely MPs will 'self police' their revised submissions.",
