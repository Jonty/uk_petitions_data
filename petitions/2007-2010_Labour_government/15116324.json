            "background": "We, the school children of East Dunbartonshire, are most affected by the council cutting our school buses. We are the ones who have to walk up to six miles per day, across busy roads, and through parks, to get to our schools and when we reach the school gate, have to negotiate even more parents' cars. The extra fumes can't be good for the environment either. \nCan't you please do something to ensure our safety, Mr Brown?",
