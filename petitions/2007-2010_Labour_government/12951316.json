            "background": "Reregulation of bus companies across the UK should mean that the prices of bus fares will fall.  The bus prices in London are significally lower than fares charged in the rest of the country; and I believe that this is directly linked to the fact they are regulated. I believe that the original idea of buses being deregulated would mean more competition and lower fares is completely wrong as it seems that as soon a one bus company puts up fares the others follow suit soon after. I also believe that if bus companies are reregulated then fares will come down and more people would use them; which would be of an environmental benefit. I also fear that at the current rate of fare increases it will not be long before it is just as cheap to travel by car and much more convenient.",
