They say they will be contacting me by the end of the week and they don't. When phoning them up to see what's going on, they don't want to know. If employment agencies did their job, I could have started a job a month ago and in the past, a couple of weeks before I actually started. Over the years, I must have lost about 10 weeks of pay because of their laziness. What annoys me on a couple of occassions, people registered after me start a job before me!  There are many employers that state on their websites 'please contact your nearest 'Bob' recruitment agency. It is impossible to find a job without using them.",
