            "background": "During 2008 the village of Spofforth in North Yorkshire commissioned a Parish Plan. One of the main issues that villagers raised in the Parish Plan questionnaire was concern over both the volume and the speed of the traffic through the village. The village located on the main A661 Harrogate to Wetherby road can have over 10,000 vehicles a day passing through it. In addition to this the physical nature of the village lends itself to high speed as people travel to and from the recently upgraded M1. Thereafter it was decided to set up an action group to see what could be done to improve the situation. A small number of villagers volunteered to join this group and have now met several times. To hightlight the problems caused by speeding and the fear that villagers have whilst going about their daily lives we have decided to creat an e-petition on this site. Hopefully you will join with us and make your feelings known.",
