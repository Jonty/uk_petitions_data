            "background": "The problem we face now is due to the  greed of brokers and traders and lack of due diligence by bankers. They have been dealing in dodgy mortgages and loans as collateral. We need to know that our bankers are taking reasonable precautions to avoid excessive bad debt.\nThat is the area where regulation is required. Mortgages and loans must not be allowed to be packaged into \"structured financial products\" and sold or bought without anybody knowing what exactly they contain. Perhaps if there were more personal accountability this would happen naturally.",
