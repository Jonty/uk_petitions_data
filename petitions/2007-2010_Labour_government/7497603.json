            "background": "Following the Police Arbitration Tribunal recommendation of a Police pay award of 2.5% to be back dated to 1st September 2007, the Home Secretary has refused to abide by the recommendations. Instead the Government will implement the increase from 1st December and therefore giving police officers an effective pay increase of 1.9%. This is an outrage and an insult to police officers who have been effectively robbed by the Government of money which is rightly theirs.",
