        "background": "Police officers risk their lives everyday for our saftey yet they are assaulted by criminals who know that they will only get a slap on the wrist. We feel that it is time to introduce a law which will give a mandatory whole life sentance to anyone who murders a police officer. This will send a strong message to all those criminals who go out armed and offer the police a degree of protection which is not currently offered to them.",
