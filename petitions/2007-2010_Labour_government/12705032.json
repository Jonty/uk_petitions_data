            "background": "I suggest that MPs are allocated unused military quarters and issued with the same basic furniture and crockery that our service personnel are issued with. This will then negate the need for expenses being put through for mortgages and rent etc.\nif the quarters are good enough for our serving soldiers then they are good enough as a second home for our MPs. That way the quarters arent left to go to rack and ruin and expense claims will be reduced",
