            "background": "WE THINK THIS SMOKING BAN HAS NOT BEEN THOUGHT OUT ENOUGH, TO BAN SMOKING ON BUS STATIONS FOR PEOPLE WAITING FOR A BUS WHICH THEY KNOW THEY CANNOT SMOKE ON,AND TO EXPECT THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE BUS STATION TO HAVE A SMOKE, WE THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS, OUR FATHERS AND GRANDFATHERS FOUGHT WARS TO STOP DISCRIMINATION AND DICTATORSHIP, WE FEEL VERY STRINGLY ABOUT THIS,WE ARE MOT AVERSE TO PUBS AND RESTAURANTS BEING SMOKE FREE BUT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE MANAGERS, IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED BEFORE WHEN THERE WAS SMOKING AND NON SMOKING ROOMS. PLEASE REMEMBER SMOKING IS LEGAL SO HOW CAN YOU BAN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AROUND HUNDREDS OF YEARS..WE THING THAT WE ARE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, YOU HAVE DISCRIMINATION LAWS SO WHY DOES IT NOT INCLUDE US SMOKERS. MR.BLAIR STATED IT WOULD BE A PERTIAL BAN BUT AS USUAL HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND DID HIS USUAL U TURN.",
