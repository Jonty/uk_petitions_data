This is being done at a time of recession, hardship and high unemployment.\n\nThis is an illustration of the lack of patriotism, pride in our country and loyalty to our citizens shown by the current government. Once these jobs have been lost to cheaper labour overseas, they will be nigh on impossible to recover. \n\nThe Civil/Foreign Service should be staffed by British workers serving the British Government.",
