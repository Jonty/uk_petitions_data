            "background": "Uncontrolled hunting hounds are allowed to rampage through private property whenever it pleases the hunting fraternity without permission or redress to the landowner for the slaughtering of domestic pets and animals.  The hunter believes that a vague apology and the offer of small sums of money to the owner is sufficient to compensate for the trauma of seeing their pet ripped apart and the grief experienced by the owners by the loss of their beloved pets.",
