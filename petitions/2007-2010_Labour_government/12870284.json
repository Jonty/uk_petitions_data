            "background": "We request that the 5 bed unit be kept open so that 24hr nursing care can be given to any disabled, vulnerable special needs children in the area. The unit provides excellent nursing care for those children under 18 who require it. These children are our most vulnerable and parents who care for them are worn out and need some respite on a regular basis. The potential closure is due to take place in April 2010 which could result in many families being left without residential respite from that time. Please sign below and show your support for these families who so urgently need this service. Thank you.",
