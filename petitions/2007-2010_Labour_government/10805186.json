However, the current position of the UK government is to treat Romanian nationals differently from other EU citizens. Under its current ruling, Romanian citizens are only permitted to work in the UK in the agricultural and food industry sectors. We believe this measure is discriminatory as it denies Romanian citizens their basic human rights under EU law. We therefore urge the UK government to rescind this discriminatory regulation at the earliest date possible and restore to Romanian workers their legal right to mobility across EU borders.\n\nThank you,\nIonela Flood,Romanca Society,London, UK",
