            "background": "When a child has a very high temperature and parents are very worried that the child might have, say, meningitis, they used to be able to get a visit at any time by their GP, or at worst, a locum. Now, GPs earn considerably more yet no longer do night calls. Indeed it is impossible to contact one's GP out of surgery hours. This change in NHS policy whereby the GPs effectively \"held the government to ransom\" is intolerable. GPs have an ethical responsibility to ensure adequate care for patients as well as a duty to manage health risk amongst the patients on their lists at all times as used to be the policy. The Government should ensure this, particularly for children under 16.",
