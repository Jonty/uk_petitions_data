            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Government is proposing to add a tax {levy} to farm plastic to pay for its recovery once used.  There is NO requirement for this as the UK Agricultural Industry has market driven hundreds of its own collection/recycling schemes over the past 3 years.\n\nThese schemes are more environmentally friendly and come at a much cheaper cost to the farmer.  They will also produce better long term recycling targets, as the plastic is collected cleaner, which makes it more attractive to UK recyclers who can innovate new products from it as already demonstrated.\n\nA similar Government scheme in Ireland has failed both to deliver a good service to farmers and get a recycling route for all its heavy contaminated material.  Like the UK Government\u2019s proposal, the Irish levy scheme charges a tax {levy} up front when selling the new plastic on to the market.\n\nNow thousands of tonnes of used farm film is stockpiled in Ireland awaiting a home for recycling.",
