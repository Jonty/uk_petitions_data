        "background": "Energiekontor has lodged an application for up to 10 wind turbines over 100 metres high that sit within a mile of this totally unspoilt East Yorkshire village. The proposed development would dominate the very rural landscape and damage the abundant and often rare wildlife. Whilst we understand these windfarms are a renewable source of energy, this is a totally inappropriate place to site one. Notwithstanding the fact that Withernwick has already agreed to a gas storage facility in the area which will shortly be built, if the windfarm is approved as well, it will turn our beautiful landscape into a commercial desert.",
