            "background": "Making sense of the economic meltdown! Democracy/Capital State or are we all a load of mugs\n\nJust read the BBC report on B & B being nationalised. \nI have seen the BBC report explaining how Abbey have taken over the savings part for a sum of \u00a3612m, but in return have been given \u00a314.6bn and \u00a34.5bn adding up to \u00a319.1bn I cant see a risk in this. So my question is why give away this side of the business with very little risk (the worst that can happen is a run on the bank!!!) why not merge this with the already acquired Northern Rock. \n\nIf there are any more of these offers coming to the table can you keep me informed I am quite good at maths run the tea club at work and on the above figures could do no worse than the city is at the moment. \n\nSo my petition is to be given some straight forward honest answers explaining why you would give away the potentially still profitable side of a business but keep the risky volatile part.",
