        "background": "At the end of Southdown Avenue in Lewes, there are two bus stops, one on either side of the road. They are used predominately by the elderly residents of the estate and care home opposite, who often have trouble crossing the busy main road. We therefore ask that a zebra crossing be put in to allow people to cross the road safely.",
