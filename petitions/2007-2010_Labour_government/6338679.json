            "action": "Abolish the law that allows higher earners to pay only 1% national insurance contributions when everyone else below 39k has to pay a lot more, even if you are in part time work and earn only 5-10000 per annum.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At the moment High earners only contribute 1% of their salary towards National Insurance. This means that a manager/executive earning \u00a3150,000 a year would pay considerably less National Insurance contributions than a lower earner. Even a company CEO on a multi million pound salary would pay a lower rate of National Insurance This is grossely unfair. The government wants more people to work but there are no incentives to do so. Many lower income families are much much better off sitting on benefits than they are working. This is a vicious cycle as we are taxed even more to pay for their benefits. We should equalise the National Insurance contributions so that at the very least everyone contributes the same percentage, irregardless of their wages....or modernise the system and take higher percentages of national insurance from higher earners.",
