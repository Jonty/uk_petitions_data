        "background": "Noone really likes new houses being built or added to their area, but many accept that in these days of supposed housing shortages, these developments are a necessary evil. \n\nBut constantly adding houses and flats to areas without sorting out issues like potholes in roads, congestion, schooling issues, leisure areas, local amenities and shops is a consistent problem with these developments. All that seems to be the focus is meeting targets for how many homes are built, with little or no focus on the living conditions of residents after they are built.\n\nMore focus needs to be placed in these areas to benefit all in the communities that these homes are being built in.",
