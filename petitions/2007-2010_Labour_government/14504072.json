            "background": "BBC has been given provisional approval to apply DRM to restrict what devices an play back the Freeview content.\nThis will increase the cost of boxes, restrict manufacturer competition, and will limit recording and transfer to portable media players and other playback devices, and so is a highly undesirable way to be spending taxpayers money.\nIf this was for commercial channels then this would be fine but this is for a channel funded by mandatory TV licences, and the licence payers should be able to make full use of this content as a result.",
