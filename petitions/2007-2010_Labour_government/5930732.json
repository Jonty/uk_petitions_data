            "background": "I find it disgraceful that in the eyes of the law a child is a child until the age of 18, yet in the eyes of holiday companies a child is a child until the age of 14, sometimes 12. How is it possible that this is even allowed? If I want to take my children on holiday, I have been informed that even though they are not 18, I will be expected to pay a full adult price for each of them, yet they are not entitled to the adult amenities once they are on holiday as they are not in fact 18. This surely is abusing the law? A child is a child until the age of 18 and should therefore be charged as such. Please stop the holiday companies from manipulating the law in this way.",
