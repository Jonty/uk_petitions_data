            "background": "The average cost of a journey by train in most parts of the country is comparable to the cost of driving in a diesel car. However add to the rail cost the car park charge at the train station and the cost of travelling by rail far exceeds that of the car. Based on a 90 mile round trip by car the equivalent journey by rail would cost over \u00a3700 more per annum including car parking at the station. Given that the country is being driven towards environmental preservation, surely travelling by rail should be considerably cheaper than car!. Removing car parking charges at railway stations would be a major step towards enticing people to use trains as an alternative to the car.",
