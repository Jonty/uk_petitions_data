            "background": "It is commonly known in the medical profession that too much salt in our diets' can contribute to high blood pressure and increase the risk of heart attack. However, this is not well known by the general public. I propose that the government increase funding into the area of salt awareness campaigns. These campaigns should pay attention to the excessive levels of salt in breakfast cereals, which often go unnoticed by the consumer.\n\nBy bringing this matter more into the public eye and creating more pressure on food manufacturers, we can expect reduced salt levels in our food in the future and better health for many of us as a result.",
