            "background": "Passport renewal facilities have recently been withdrawn by the British Foreign office in Switzerland forcing Brits resident in Switzerland and surrounding France to refer to Paris! This is seen as a blackmailing tactic to force Britain into the EU! To disprove this believe, we petition Gordon Brown to re-open passport renewal facilities in Geneva thus enabling British citizens to renew their passports without the hassle of referring to Paris. Switzerland appears to be the only European country without such facilities.",
