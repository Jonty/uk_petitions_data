            "background": "The EA, at present, issues a full course fishing licence that covers the use of 2 fishing rods. This is unsuitable for most variations of course fishing. The millions of match anglers rarely use more than 1 rod and the millions of carp anglers generally use 3 (or 2) rods. We ask that you urge the EA to begin issuing licences that cover the use of 1 rod; and also licences that cover the use of 3 rods, along with the current licence that covers 2 rods.",
