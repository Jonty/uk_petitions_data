But another part of society no less worthy   are living on the breadline. \n\nWe believe that those people at the very bottom of the social scale, during a time of the incredibly steep rise in energy cost's should receive a payment similar to that which pensioners already enjoy. The cost could and many believe should be raised by a windfall tax on the unbelievable rise in profits by the energy suppliers.",
