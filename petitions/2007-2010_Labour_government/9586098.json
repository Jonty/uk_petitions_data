For hundreds of thousands of golfers, this is the course where they learned the game. Once the most-played public course in Europe, Beckenham Place Park is the only public course in the \u2018inner boroughs\u2019 of South London. In addition, it has in recent years assumed a leading role in bringing the game of golf to the youth of the district with a thriving junior academy introducing this splendid game, with its emphasis on fair play and etiquette, to players as young as 8 years old. \n\nIn 2007, ironically the centenary year of the original golf course on this site, we learned that Lewisham Council was evaluating options whereby the course would be reduced from 18 to 9 holes \u2013 as the council attempts to off-load its responsibilities towards the upkeep of the park, its listed mansion and the golf course.",
