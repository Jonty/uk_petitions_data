            "background": "Now that Linux is not just a tecchies toy and a fully fledged Operating environment that is every bit as good and easy to use as Windows or Mac in functionality. I think it's about time that it should be given an opening in education now that big companies are using it. This can be confirmed by entering 'companies using Linux' on cerain search engines. Versions like Ubuntu, Kubuntu and edubuntu amongst others are freely available on Live CD to try without installing on to a PC and if you like it you can install it for free. Compiz Fusion is now installed in Ubuntu as standard and is setting benchmarks for other OS's to follow. Many companies and organizations are cutting cost dramatically by using it so a bit of knowledge of it is now getting important.",
