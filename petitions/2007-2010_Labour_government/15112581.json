            "background": "this is unfair on dogs and also owners. why should a well trained dog and a good owner have to put a mussel on there dog just to please the law. its ridiculous. also why should we pay more money to get a different insurance on a dog as well as getting papers?? if dogs are brought up correctly and are trained like dogs should be then why change there routine. not every dog is nasty, there are more trained, nice dogs then vicious ones, i think this is very unfair",
