There has been outrage that the Inspired Science Museum project at Wroughton Airfield in Swindon has been ommitted.  The Wroughton site holds 92% of the total Science Museum exhibits and would have put all of these on display to the public for FREE.  This matter has already been taken forward by Swindon South MP, Ann Snelgrove, so please lend your support and get the Science Museum reinstated - otherwise this is a massive blow to history, heritage and childrens education",
