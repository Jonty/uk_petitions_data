        "background": "The behaviour of photographers in our country is getting worse.  It seems that a select group will go to any lengths to get 'reaction' shots of celebrities.  There has been incident's of wreckless driving and all manner of confrontational acts.  The problem is that photographers can be offered huge sums of money for the right photograph.  The greed is what drives them and that is why they take risks.  I propose that this issue should be looked at in detail.  Maybe capping their earnings is a solution? The issue does not just lie with the photographers - the newspapers and magazines that buy these photos should also be investigated. I propose that there should be 'strict' warnings for those individuals that will go to any lengths for the 'perfect tabliod' photo.  Their behaviour can only be described as 'stalker' activity.",
