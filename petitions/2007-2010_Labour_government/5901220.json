            "background": "I think it is time for the BBC to compete for audience figures like every other tv company . Recent incidents featured in the news, shows that having a liscence fee does not ensure that we have good quality , honest tv productions and news . In addition , why should we send people to jail for not having a liscence fee ? Its like sending someone to jail for not paying a parking fine ! Its ridiculous !",
