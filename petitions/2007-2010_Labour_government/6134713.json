She has now been told by council bureacrats that she must stop unless she gets a license, wears a fluorescent jacket, carries and places 3 signs in the road, and has a permanent lookout with her. Failing this the plot will be tarmaced. Officialdom gone mad.  Click on link for more info http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/6939840.stm",
