The facts is we do not sentece these people to murder.. they do that themselves.\nThose who argue must be harbouring Murders seeing as they are eager to protect these people.\nIn some cases there would be exceptions be it medical or whatever.\nBut in All other Cases Murderers should recive the Death penalty.\nExcuse my Poor spelling & Grammar =]",
