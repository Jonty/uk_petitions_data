        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The truth is that European ships have been illegally fishing those waters and, in another part of the region, have been dumping toxic waste including nuclear waste.  The so-called \"pirates\" have been attempting to stop this from happening which is entirely justified.  They are NOT pirates - they are ordinary fisherman and call themselves the Volunteer Coast Guard of Somalia.\n\nThis government should stop deceiving the people and tell the truth.  Furthermore, it should intervene and prevent the illegal fishing and dumping from happening again.",
