            "background": "When John Smeaton saw what appeared to be a terrorist atrocity taking place before him on Saturday 30th June 2007 at Glasgow Airport he acted as we would all like to, if only we had his courage.\n\nHe moved  in to support the police and to protect his fellow man. Without any consideration for his own safety he got 'stuck in' and ensured the dentention of the suspects. \n\nJohn is typical of the unsung heroes we have in our society, who act postively to protect our democracy by actions, not words.\n\nFor this act of heroism we seek a knighthood for Mr Smeaton.",
