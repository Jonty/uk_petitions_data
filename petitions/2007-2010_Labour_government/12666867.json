            "background": "The BBFc has awarded 12A certificates to several films which any rational responsible parent would never allow any under 12 to see. Recent example is \"Angels and Demons\" which featured branding, mutiliation , bleeding to death , sadistic shootings and burning to death. YOU cannot assume that every adult is responsible enough to review if a 12A is suitable for their 8 year old.If it's a 12 A then it cannot be suitable for an under 10 but this is not policed. I know parents that happily send their 10 year old round to other peoples houses clutching the Game \"Grand Theft Auto\"- certificate 18 .  This 12A classification serves only the film distributor who pays the BBFC to classify his film. Signing this petition also states a vote of NO CONFIDENCE in the BBFC for their current methods of classification.",
