            "background": "The government taxation system uses cross subsidies to fund areas of spending that are not connected with the area in which the taxes were raised. This results in unfair prices to the consumer in the areas in which the taxes are being collected. There are EU directives which limit the use of cross subsidies in certain industries, so why shouldn't this apply to the taxation system? Reduction of tax revenue cross subsidies will reduce the cost of collecting taxes, simplify the taxation system, be fairer to the consumer and make UK plc ltd more competitive.",
