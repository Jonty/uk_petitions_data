        "background": "Increasing globalisation and greater computer usage has brought about a problem that is becoming increasingly prevalent. Historically in the UK we have always used the following date structure DD/MM/YYYY  but across Europe and North America it is more common to put the month first and I have even seen instances where the year is the put first.  When we were an insular society this was never a problem as Johnny Foreigner could never organise anything but now with global communications, often confusion arises when the day is 12 or less.  I therefore propose that a mandate is set to change our system to reflect how the majority of the rest of the world operate and we adopt MM/DD/YYYY as the norm for our date structure.",
