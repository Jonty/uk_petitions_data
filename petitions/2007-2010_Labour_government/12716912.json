The Prime Minister must also publicly acknowledge that to not invite Her Majesty the Queen to the 65th Anniversary Commemoration of the D-Day Landings was a gross error of judgement. The vast majority of patriotic people in this country are appalled at the decision, and would remind Her Majesty's government (note the title) that no one person's ego should be allowed to get in the way of the express wishes of his electorate.",
