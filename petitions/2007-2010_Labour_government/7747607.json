            "background": "I think since the government has the power to decide on the annual pay rise given to public sector workers, they should be bound by the public on their own pay rises.  The salary of a MP is high enough and I feel that that most MPs have abused the right to decide there own pay rises for sometime.  I want the employers (the public) of the MPs to decide on their performance via the acceptance or rejection of the pay rise request.",
