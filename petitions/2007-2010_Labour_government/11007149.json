He helped to raise the stature of the European Tour and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2002. He  won the British Open in 1969 and then won the US Open the following year \u2013 the ONLY Briton to have ever won the latter trophy.  He then went on to transform the fortunes of the , now European , Ryder Cup side leading them to a narrow defeat in 1983 but then winning in 1995 and again in 1997. \n\nNick Faldo , is the greatest world-class golfer this country , or Europe , has ever produced.  He won six majors and was instrumental in the transformation of the European Ryder Cup team\u2019s performances in the 1980s and 1990s. He has done much to promote the game of golf amongst youngsters with the creation of his Golf Institute.",
