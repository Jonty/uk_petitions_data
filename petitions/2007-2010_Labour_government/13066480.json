These buildings will generate thousands of HGV and other traffic movements both day and night, creating untold noise and pollution locally. Permission has already been refused but they are now trying to take advantage of the new Wiltshire Unitary Council.  This development will be highly visible from the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, what a welcome to visitors from all over the world, especially with 2012 on the horizon.",
