            "background": "Every day, the emergency services go about their business to make this world a safer place for you and me, some rushing to save lives, some to protect lives, and some to protect our liberty and human rights. Too often you see drivers who are oblivious to the presence of the big red fire engine or the shiny white police car or the big yellow ambulance, with their sirens blaring and lights flashing, either because the driver is not driving with due care and attention, or because they believe that they are the most important person on the road, and will not move out of the way. Any which way, it is inconsiderate driving and should warrant a serious penalty.",
