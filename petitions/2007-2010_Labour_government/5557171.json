            "background": "This court case is over the CVA and the offer of 1p (revised to 8p) in the \u00a31. However this court action is forcing the club into liquidation which would cause football to lose one of its biggest names, and meaning a zero return for creditors. Leeds United is the sole professional football club in Leeds with a much wider catchment area throughout Yorkshire. There is therefore a huge potential for Leeds United to overcome its current difficulties and return to the Championship and then the Premiership.  This would give HMRC a better long term return than any proposed court action.",
