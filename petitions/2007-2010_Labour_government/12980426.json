            "background": "Put a stop to the outrageous discrimination which prevents people with epilepcy from gaining employment in the NHS. At present work practices within the NHS (13 hour shifts in nursing) means that people with epilepcy, are unable to apply for these posts. Even when they hold the neccessary qualifications.Even though the Equal Opportunities legislation states that employers are required to make adjustments for Disabled people, this does not happen in the largest employer in the UK the NHS, an organisation which claims to be an equal opportunities employer.  It is time that a stop was put to this practice",
