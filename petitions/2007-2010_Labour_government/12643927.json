Our ancestors fought in wars so that we can vote and run our country freely. MP's do not seem to understand this. Too many MP's see this as an opportunity to line their own pockets!  We want MP's who have the integrity and compatence to run this country properly! We want a Prime Minister capable of leading this country through what are the toughest times some of us have witnessed! Sadly, the Prime Minister and MP's are letting us down! We are fed up with the amount of red tape and legislation holding back our public servants and businesses. We are fed up with being lied to by this Government! Nothing will change unless a General Election is called!",
