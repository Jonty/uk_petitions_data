            "background": "The extent of functioncreep with regards to goverment policy is almost laughable. With police given access to Londons Tfl network and anti terror laws used against ordinary crimes. While the police being given more powers of surveillance is debatably a good thing, the use of goverment legislation and property to perform functions they were originally intended for is a cop out way of clipping civil liberties. The paralell of a thought police to the extreme pornography provisions is substantial. The creation of vauge laws to close loopholes in exsisting ones is a threat to the freedom of artistic expression.\n\nTo these ends i propose that all those concerned with the creation of goverment policy should read 1984 as a grounding in what to avoid when debating the creation of morality and surveillance legislation.",
