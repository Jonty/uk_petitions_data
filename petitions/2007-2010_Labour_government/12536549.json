But why should someone who has been welfare dependant be as well off as someone who has worked their entire life and made NI and TAX contributions? We demand something extra for those that have paid into the kitty.  Anyone who has not contributed should be on the bare minimum. free TV licenses should be reserved for those that have contributed.",
