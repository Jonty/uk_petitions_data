        "action": "Instruct the Minister for Education to review the AQA Biology Unit 4 A2 examination on 25/01/10 and to take necessary remedial action to address and correct the flawed examination papers.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is currently in the National news that thousands of students are extremely distressed as a result of a biology unit 4 AQA A2 exam paper which did not reflect the syllabus studied by nearly 20,000 who sat the paper. The consequences of this flawed paper is that thousands of students relying on the outcome of their exam are now in jeopardy of not acheiving the required grades for university placements; therefore having a huge impact on future careers. The main outcome I wish to see from this petition is the opportunity to retake the exam prior to summer retakes without financial penalty. In addition AQA exam board must ensure that the revised paper reflects the syllabus. The Government say that they wish to engage young people in the democratic process - now would be an ideal opportunity to demonstrate this commitment.",
