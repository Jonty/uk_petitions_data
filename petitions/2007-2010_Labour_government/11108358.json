            "background": "I urge the Prime Minister to consider rewarding drivers seen to be displaying good habits (Perhaps the sending of vouchers toward Road Tax or MOT fees)This would provide a 'carrot rather than stick' mentality. It would encourage good habits, rather than just penalising bad habits. I believe this could save money by avoiding costly accidents.(Both in human and financial terms).  It would show real government commitment to road safety. This would counter-balance the popular image of a government using technology to raise revenue from any traffic violation, minor or serious. Obviously it would need commitment to policing by humans not machines. \u2018You were seen driving well on (date/place) followed by a description. Please accept this token of thanks\u2019. The result, less accidents, reduced costs and encouraging responsible social behaviour.",
