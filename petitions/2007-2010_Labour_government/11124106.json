            "background": "Many children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders and other communication issues cannot function in places that are densly population.  This proposed amalgamation of special schools on the Wirral will create a 'super school' that will be untenable for many of these pupils.  These 'super schools' go against recent research by Manchester University 2008 and Baroness Warnock 2005 white paper which suggests that they neglect aspects of duty of care to these individuals who have communication disorders.  Even if the classes remain small the communal areas will be too busy for many of these children to thrive in and the link between denser population numbers and mental health in communication disorders individuals has been proven. \nWe ask the Wirral LEA to reconsider this motion and allow a place to exists in their school system for these children, in the form of the existing schools of Meadowside and Foxfield",
