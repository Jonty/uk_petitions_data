        "background": "sharks are valued citizens of oceanic eco-systems. They are both predators and scavengers, and these roles they play contribute to eliminating diseased and genetically-defective animals and help to stabilize fish populations.\nThe fins are dried, stacked, and sold, mostly illegally. The buyers extract the collagen fibers, clean them, and process them into \"shark fin soup.\"\nThis soup has no flavor and absolutely no nutritional value. It is a dish served only for prestige purposes, selling for anywhere from US$50.00 to US$400.00 per bowl. \n\nAlready 18 species of sharks have been listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nHuman beings are skilled at justification. Every year humans slaughter over 100 million sharks yet we depict them as vicious and blood-thirsty killers.\n\nThe fins are highly prized. The fishermen catch the sharks and slice off the fins, unmindful whether the shark is alive or not. The bodies, most of them still alive, are tossed back into the sea to bleed to death or to be attacked by other sharks or fish.",
