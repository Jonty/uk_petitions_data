        "background": "We petition the government to first downsize and then remove the taxpayer-funded network of CCTV cameras and manned control stations in the Greater London area.\n\nWe consider it an infringement of government upon our sacred civil liberties to be caught on camera up to 30 times a day, regardless of what we are doing, and a caricature of a traditionally authoritarian government to be the city with the greates CCTV/citizen ration(by far) in the world. \n\nThe deconstruction of this system and the labour and capital used to construct it could have been more adequately placed in the recruitment of more police officers or better maintenance of police stations, if the original intent of the CCTV network was indeed to curtail criminal behaviour.\n\nThe potential for misuse of the system by less democratic institutions in the future is too great for the citizenry of this city and this country to tolerate.",
