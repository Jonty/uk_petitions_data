            "background": "The prime minister has signalled a possible intention to reclassify cannabis as a class B drug, following several studies highlighting the increased risks of mental illness associated with it. These studies are exclusively based on 'skunk' (by far the most commonly available type of cannabis in the UK), which is selectively bred to contain a high content of THC. If such a reclassification does take place, it should leave other types, such as 'hash' (resin), at their current class C classification. Hash contains less THC than skunk, and is therefore less harmful. The two are very different in appearence, and so easy to distinguish between. Furthermore, a difference in classification would surely affect the market and lead to less skunk being available on the street.",
