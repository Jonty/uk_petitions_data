        "background": "I was appalled to read in my paper today (14/2/09) that such an exorbitantly vast sum has been spent on the search for just one child.  I am NOT minimising the anguish, and acute anxiety, which Madeleine's parents must have been suffering for the length of time she's been missing but is she, really, the ONLY British child who has been missing for a similar length of time; either currently or in the past? \n\nI assume this \u00a3500,00 is IN ADDITION to the money raised by the Madeleine Fund; in my opinion the existence of this Fund should have meant LESS public money spent on the search for her.  I really don't understand why, right from the time she disappeared, HER disappearance seems to have  been seen as so much more important than the disappearance of any other child!",
