This means the creche facilities available to parents who attend adult learning courses will no longer be free. \nParents need to do these courses to be qualified for jobs. Creche prices are too expensive which means parents will not attend these classes, will not get qualified and will not be in jobs. \nWe need to put a stop to this now, else parents will be unemployed for even longer....and we all know the government do not want that!",
