        "background": "Even after over 15 years since she was toppled from power Margaret Thatchers name still strikes fear into the hearts of hundreds of thousands of people whose lives were destroyed by her actions, not content with bringing the working classes to their knees and riots to the streets with the hated 'Poll Tax' she also carried out a personal vendetta against the unions and 'ground them into dust'.\nHer government encouraged the culture of greed and put millions of people out of work and into the benefits system with no hope of employment.\nMuch of her governments work is to blame for the social problems of today and spending millions of pounds on a state funeral would be rubbing the noses of her victims in the dirt.",
