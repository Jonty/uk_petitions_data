            "background": "As a trained Chef, i am a highly skilled member of the workforce, work long hard hours for little in return.  We are expected to keep standards paramount, to ensure that we do our job in such a way that we provide for our customers, prevent risk of food poisoning, work anti-social hours in a high stress environment, all a majority have to look forward to is a 4 hour sleep, a bottle or 10 of alcohol, cigarettes and in some cases narcotics and we do this for a mere pittance.\n\nnow with current financial climate, hours are being cut, no bonuses, earning less than expected, it is not right! and something needs to be done about it.\n\nwe are an under-appreciated trade, more to the point an underpaid trade. Take action and force employers in the industry to pay their staff better wages.",
