            "background": "I saw a homeless man asleep under the subway on my way to work the other morning and it angered me that we are SUPPOSED to be such a rich country with a such a fantastic way of life yet we have our own people sleeping on the streets hungry and cold because there is no help for them. Instead of spending so much of our tax money on benefits on immigrants which we can not afford to keep since there are so many coming into country now why not put a temporary stop on the amount of people coming in from other countrys and help our own people first if there were more shelters and support out there they would have a chance of a second go at life instead of dieing on the streets. homeless people cant get benefits or a job because they have no postcode yet if there were shelters set up for them to sort themselves out in which would provide a postcode they could get a job. so please listen and stop the poverty in Britain!!!",
