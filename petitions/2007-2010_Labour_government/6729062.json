        "background": "A statue of the Buddha is being displayed at the St. Giles Street Gallery in Norwich that has been modified to include a banana and two eggs depicting what the artist has considered as \"comical genitalia\".   This is crass, insensitive and extremely offensive not only to the millions of Buddhists worldwide but also to non Buddhists.   It is a senseless piece of so called \"art\" which has no meaning other than to cause offense and to potentially incite violence.    The offending item should be removed immediately, destroyed as ut us a tactless and insensitive display.",
