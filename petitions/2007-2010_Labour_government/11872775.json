        "background": "It is now generally recognised that flights are a significant source of CO2 and various unpopular taxes have been introduced to curb the growth of air traffic.\n\nA large budget carrier keeps reducing its costs by reducing the level of service offered, including no check in desks, no seat allocations and now, potentially, a lavatory charge!\n\nI petition the prime minister to make a minimum level of service manditory. This would require, as a starting point:\n\nManned checkin desks.\nAllocated seating.\nFree Lavatory.\nMinimum 20kg checked baggage allowance.\n\nThis would keep seat prices a little higher and reduce passenger frustrations. This would be a benift to the travelling public.",
