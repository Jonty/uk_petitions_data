        "background": "Videogame violence has been a major issue in British and indeed international politics recently, with a great deal of talk surrounding increased censorship for the artform.\n\nHowever, all this talk has been unfortunately confined to Parliament and the tabloid newspapers. \n\nAs the PM, who ordered the Byron review, and other politicians have so far chosen not to talk directly to the games media, the debate has become one-sided and marred by misinformation, political agenda and emotional blackmail.\n\nTo that extent, this petition requests that politicians invloved with the debate on videogame censorship and the Byron review actively seek out dialogues with the games media on the subject, to help paint a better picture of what is happening to the millions of people who make up the British gaming community, to help clear up any factual inaccuracies or just missing information in arguments made, and to make the MPs more accountable for their comments and actions in Parliament.",
