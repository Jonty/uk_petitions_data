It's in the governments best interest to reduce the amount of duty they take when you fill up your car; and bring petrol proces back down to an acceptable level. The cost of oil is increasing at a rate that before long there will be problem on Britian's roads, strikes and grid locks especially.\n Reducing the duty will put some confidence back with the government and aid our economic re-build.",
