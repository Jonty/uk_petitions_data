        "background": "Parents who leave domestic abusive relationships to protect their children are being forced by CAFCASS & family law courts to hand over their children for contact with the very people they are trying to protect them from, therfor placing them at risk.\nThey are putting the rights of the abusive parents before the needs and rights of the child that needs protecting, often without even doing the relvent checks on the abusive parent. Why is this being allowed to happen? It must be stopped now, before yet another child becomes another sad statistic! Please help us parents who had the courage to leave an abusive relationship, protect our vulnarable children. An abusive parent is NOT better than no parent!",
