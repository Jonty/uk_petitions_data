        "background": "Alan Johnson has announced the imminent mass fluoridation of Britain's water supply. Water should be a pure resource that is completely unadulterated. Its abscence in the water supply is not responsible for tooth decay - it is diet and dental hygiene and this has got nothing to do with level of income and everything to do with poor education which is the government's responsibility.\n\nFluoride is a substance that has been linked to malfunctioning of the Thyroid gland and Dental Fluorosis (pitting of the teeth), and which is commonly sourced from industrial by-products. The type of fluoride used has been classified as a \"Part II poison\" - even the instructions on tubes of toothpaste warn against using too much.",
