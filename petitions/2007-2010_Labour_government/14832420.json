            "background": "By their actions over recent years the banks have shown that they are unable to operate in a way that supports the UK economy. Instead they are driven only by their own greed. \n\nWe petition the UK Government to nationalise all the UK banks with utmost haste and use their influence to encourage all other countries to do the same with their banks.  \n\nIn this way the profits from banking operations will accrue to the taxpayers whose money underwrites the banking system, rather than those individuals who by luck and/or design find themselves employed or holding shares in the banks.  \n\nThis petition is deliberately simplistic; however it should not be beyond the wit of man to find ways to bring about this goal. The status quo has shown itself severely lacking; we believe it's time for radical change.",
