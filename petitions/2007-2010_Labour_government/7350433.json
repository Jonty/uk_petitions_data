            "background": "The number of prison spaces required could be reduced with the introduction of 2 proceedures :-\n1. Transport all immigrants who commit a crime and are found guilty back home instead of imposing a prison sentence. A one way ticket would be cheaper than a week in prison. Close checks would have to be carried out to ensure the culprits do not come back.\n\n2. Lock home grown minor criminals to posts (pillories or stocks), or in barred cells in the town centres. The public can then impose their own form of punishment.\nWouldn't adoption of both of the above policies be far better than letting convicted criminals walk free after being found guilty in court?",
