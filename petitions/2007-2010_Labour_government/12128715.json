        "background": "This is a campaign to get traffic lights on Calne road (A3102) after 2 accidents at the zebra crossing. \nA few others and myself witnessed an accident on Friday 20th March when a bus hit a van, which had stopped at the Zebra crossing to allow 2 women to cross. \nThe van hit the woman sending them flying through the air.\nLuckily the women suffered only minor injuries, but I'm sure it will take a long time for them to recover emotionally. \nThe Swindon Gazette and Herald newspaper are helping us to start a campaign to get the traffic lights. \nThe council told our local Policeman that until there was a fatality nothing was going to be done after he asked for traffic lights.\nThis is a main school route for hundreds of children and everyone in Lyneham uses the crossing. \nMany times it has been witnessed cars trying to overtake at the crossing, cars failing to stop as they are legally obliged to and vehicles screeching to a halt. \nWe are starting a petition for this cause and I hope that no one else will be injured in the meantime.",
