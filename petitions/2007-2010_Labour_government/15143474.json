            "background": "Ban sex-fuelled music videas that degrade women and focus on sex before 9pm.  They make young boys grow up thinking that women are sex objects and young girls have little other ambition than to be a sex object.  It makes a mockery of equality, is damaging to children and sustains a culture of violence and disrespect.",
