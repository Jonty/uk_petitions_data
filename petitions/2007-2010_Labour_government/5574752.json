            "background": "The Scottish parliament has rightly devised a system where old people in care homes only pay for food and accomodation not their personal care.-This is not a  means tested benefit, so does not penalise thrift and means old people are not forced to sell their homes to pay for long term care as is the case in England\nEqually Scottish students receive free university tuition,whilst English students are forced to take out loans and get into debt.\nEnglish taxes paid by English citizens are subsidising the people in Scotland, whilst English people are denied what should be a basic human right in both cases.",
