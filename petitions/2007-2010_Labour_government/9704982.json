        "background": "British Rail was reliable, run for the people, by the people and wasn't all about making profits. Just a service for the public, also like the CEGB that also was privatised. Now train prices are astronomical due the profits margins desired by TOCs. Privatised in the late 80s and early 90s by the Government in an attempt to save money. Please do this to repair our broken railway network. Just look at the German, french and Belgian Rail Networks, they run much better than ours, less confusing and CHEAPER JOURNEYS!!!!",
