            "background": "In my town of Stevenage and elsewhere everyone including vulnerable people have to bid against each other for a council or HA property whether it be by transfer application for existing tenant or new tenant.  This bidding process can be very stressful and confusing for those members of society for whom special accommodation is reserved ie sheltered schemes, flats and bungalows designated for the over 60s or disabled and it can be very unfair to really urgent cases.  I ask the Government to make it law that where a Choice Based Lettings scheme exists these properties for the more vulnerable members of society should be excluded and allocated in the old and trusted way where housing needs officers can personally assess who really needs the property as points are only part of the story.",
