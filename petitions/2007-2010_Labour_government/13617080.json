            "background": "Support the call for the Anglo Saxon treasure to stay in the West Midlands.\nThe collection of 1,500 gold and silver pieces was found on a Staffordshire farm by a man using a metal detector.\nThe exhibition would be accessible to all of Britain, not just London, if it stayed in the West Midlands.\nAnd an exhibition of this importance would bring in tourists from around the world to the West Midlands bringing new job opportunities.\nHelp us to keep our treasure where it belongs - in the West Midlands.",
