        "background": "Dr David Kelly contradicted the 'evidence' of the government on the Iraq 45 minute weapons of mass distruction.  Had he been listened to we would not have been able to invade Iraq legally.  It has now been ruled by none other than Lord Hutton, he of the biaised Hutton inquiry, that the records on Dr David Kelly's death be sealed for SEVENTY YEARS!!!  This is despite the inquest results being questioned by the very doctors who conducted the post mortem on Dr Kelly who say his death was indeed suspicious.  Having our Government manipulate, cover up and then seal for 70 years what in effect is a criminal act needs to be revoked immediately and thos responsible held to account!",
