            "background": "For the past 2 years, I've been monitoring the word 'banned' and how the severity of the word comes across relaxed and lame. I've been looking at many alternatives to which way the word banned can be presented to the receipent more forthright.\n\nMy final decision to much thought is adding the full-stop slap bang next to the d, and to capitalise the word.\n\nSo Mr. Prime Minister my overall proposal to you is to change the word 'Banned or banned' to a more sterner looking 'Banned.' - as you can see the full-stop sits watertight to the d adding a more fierce look but at the same time a fair look.\n\nThank you.",
