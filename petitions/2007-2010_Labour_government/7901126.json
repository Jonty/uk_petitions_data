        "background": "Not only the CAP continues to operate, it also continues account 46% (acc. to the BBC)) of the ENTIRE EU budget, meaning that in 2008, 7 years after the 21st century began, the EU STILL wastes half of its budget on subsidies for a sector that employs 4% of its workforce and gives it 2% of its GDP while millions of Africans suffer because of tyrannic EU tariffs. Instead of reforming the CAP (Continentals insist that the CAP has been saved), which has nominally GROWN since 2005, the govt. has surrendered a leverage that the rebate was.",
