        "background": "Condoms should be able to be bought by anybody, regardless of their age. Yes, I agree that underage sex is wrong, but it is going to happen, whether or not it is within the law. Therefore, the chance of getting STIs is increased at a lower age. The only possible way to stop this is to allow children from the average onset of puberty, 11, to buy condoms at a low price, low enough that they could ask their parents for money and be able to say that they are buying sweets, or not asking at all.",
