        "background": "Gurkhas have fought for the British government for 200 years. They gave their lives for this country and in return they are ignored when they retire.\n\nAmazingly, those soldiers that retired before 1997 do not even receive automatic residency or pension. Those that retired after 1997 get around a third of the pension given to British service personnel.\n\nIs this the way to thank people who risked their lives for our country?",
