        "background": "Many pensioners have relied on their savings interest to supplement income but with the scathing reductions in interest rates pensioners have suffered badly and will almost certainly have to use their capital to cover everyday costs.The government have sympathised with people who have mortgages but have totally ignored the plight of pensioners who are still being taxed on unearned income.This is quite wrong and unjust.Sign this petition to remind politicians of the problems caused to pensioners.",
