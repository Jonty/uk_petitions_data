            "background": "In 2008, Blackburn's popular local arts festival was axed in favour of a sub-standard event which has not been popular with it's residents. We, the undersigned, would also like to join the 'Arts in the Park' festival with 'Mela', another local festival aimed at the ethnic minorities living within the area which was axed. We believe this will help break down social barriers and stop the segregation which is happening in our town between it's people.",
