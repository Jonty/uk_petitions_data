            "background": "We the residence of Tavistock, Devon and the residence of its outlying districts and road user\u2019s who commute through the town, call upon the British Government to force West Devon Borough Council, Tavistock District Council and the South West Highways Department to reinstate the former road layout at the Sir Francis Drake roundabout within the town.\n\nIt is our belief that the current new road layout is a cause of greater danger to road users and pedestrians alike. That it causes even great tailbacks of traffic and longer delays than previous, and that good road management is about easing congestion not making it worse, particularly in an area of such historic importance.",
