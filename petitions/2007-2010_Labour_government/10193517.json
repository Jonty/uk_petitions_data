            "background": "The recent spate of Post Office closures seem to target post offices serving small, rural communities with few or no other facilities. This forces them to travel further afield for the key services that small post offices provide.\n\nThe undersigned petition the Prime Minister to first admit that the closure program is, at the very least, severely detrimental to rural communities, secondly admit that small sub-post offices promote a closer community (everything is dealt locally by a helpful post-masters who know and deal with small businesses and pensioners in the area) and reduce the carbon footprint of the residents (key services are provided within walking distance of the home and/or workplace), and finally stop the post office closure program by any means available to him.",
