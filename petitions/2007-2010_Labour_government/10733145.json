        "background": "Fuel prices have increased however approved mileage allowance payments paid to civil servants when using their own vehicles for work purposes have NOT changed since 2002.  They remain at 40p a mile for the first 10,000 miles each year and 25p a mile thereafter.  The rates do not cover the standing costs of all cars, especially when a civil servant can claim only 25p per mile after 10,000 miles.",
