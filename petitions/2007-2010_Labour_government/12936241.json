            "background": "We all face different circumstances which may force us to move. Subletting offers greater opportunities. At the moment you have to try and find a mutual exchange, which from my experience is a very, very lengthy process. If subletting is allowed for a reasonable rent for that particular area or even if the rent remains the same as the tenant would have been paying, then this allows for many more people to have the freedom to move where they actually need to be. I live in Greater London but if I was offered a job in Manchester, I would have to either, try and find a mutual exchange, which could take months or give up my flat, which is not a great option. These should not be the only options open to those in social housing. I strongly believe that my choices are extremely curtailed by not being able to sublet the whole of my flat. Scotland allows it, why not England? This is an opportunity to allow and to regulate subletting. Why not let us sublet?",
