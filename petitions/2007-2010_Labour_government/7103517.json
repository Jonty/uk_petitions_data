            "background": "Baliffs should be regulated by a governing body to ensure that charges are moderate and fees set so that debtors are aware of exactly what and what cannot be charged for.\nBrochure formatted.\nAlso a complaints body (like the financial ombudsman scheme for banks...)so when a debtor needs to complain or enquire about baliffs they can.\nAt present it seems to be that the baliffs are setting their own rules. People who employ them refuse to communicate further, baliffs refuse to respond to letters/emails and the tension for debtors mounts.\nThis is hardly fair and as the government have implemented IVA's to help ease debt, surely this is another area that could be governed better to prevent excessive baliff charges causing further debt to those who can ill afford it. \nOften the baliff fees are as much as the debt itself.\nThis can't be right. \nIf we could afford baliffs, we could afford to pay our bills to begin with!",
