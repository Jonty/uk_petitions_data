        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The supporters of this petition believe that it is unfair that full time students are forced to pay for prescribed medication, as they have no source of income. Their situation is in many ways no different from those receiving benefits from the government in lieu of a sustainable income and therefore they should not be expected to pay for necessary medication.",
