        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The proposed closure has brought wide spread and cross-party condemnation.  There have been two Westminster Hall debates (May 2007 and March 2009) that have exposed the \u201cdeficits in the consultation process\u201d (Hansard 81WH) and undermined the supposed HMRC savings as having no documented evidence.  The PCS submission \u201cChange we can believe in\u201d included costed proposals producing real savings while maintaining the public service and keeping local jobs.  The PCS proposals appear to have been ignored (Hansard 80WH).  No such costed savings have been provided by HMRC, despite repeated requests from PCS and MPs.\n\nSignificant real savings can be made without removing over 100 jobs from the high unemployment area of Great Yarmouth in to the relatively affluent city of Norwich.  The cuts disproportionately hit part time workers and women with caring responsibilities and could force experienced staff out of employment.\n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to accept the PCS proposals and instruct HMRC to keep the Great Yarmouth office open.",
