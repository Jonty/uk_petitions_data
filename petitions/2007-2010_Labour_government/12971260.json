            "background": "Employment and Support Allowance was launched last October for new claimants, starting with long-term claimants in 2010.  The allowance tests if people are unfit for work using a number of point-based criteria.  The higher points someone scores the 'less fit for work' they are declared. \n \nIf only it was that straightforward!  The process for judging this for people with learning and mental health difficulties is very challenging and their condition can vary from day-to-day. But they are presented with a 28 page form to complete that is very ambiguous and very often doesn't have a suitable answer for them to choose from. Eg: Can you manage your daily life safely?  \n\nThe possible answers are \nUsually\nIt varies\nNot very often\n\nThere is no explanation of what the difference is between 'it varies' and 'not very often'.  'Never' is not an option.  \n\nWe would like the form to be reviewed to make it more straight-forward for people and their carers to complete without ambiguity, so that they are fairly assessed for the Allowance.",
