        "background": "I smoke so this has nothing to do with anti-smoking. I live next door to a social club who have accomodated its smokers at the rear of the property and I don't see why I, and anyone else who lives in a similar position should have to put up with groups of people outside my house drinking and smoking till the early hours of the morning 7 days a week. When you add live entertainment Fri, Sat and Sun and the language that some people seem to think is acceptable, this is unacceptable and infringes my rights under the legislation.  My message is simple \"Fag off back inside\". If people want to drink and smoke then they should go to designated establishments that can accomodate the activity. How would the Prime Minister like it if this was going on next to his back garden every night?",
