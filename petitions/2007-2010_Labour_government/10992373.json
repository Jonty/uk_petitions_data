            "background": "The Department of Health (DoH) currently has a policy of not allowing homosexual men and or men who have sexual contact with other men to donate blood.\nThis policy is not morally right. Many homosexual males want to donate blood but are denied this right because of their sexuality.\nAll blood received by such departments are tested and therefore the risk of contracting HIV from the blood is extremely unlikely; not to mention the fact that male/female sexual contact can also create AIDS.\nThis policy needs to be reviewed.",
