            "background": "I am on disabledment benefits. However not on high enough rates to be able to get free brand new car every 3 years with Tax etc paid for.\nI have to pay for an old car, tax, insuance, MOT etc. \n I am having to give my car up as my husband needs one for work (there is no bus service near to his place of work). I am sure there are many in a simular position as me.\nAll of the simular petitions for reduce Tax for disabled drivers are just asking for removal of TAX for the disabled driver they do not state for those on lower benefits or for passengers. Some disabled people can not drive and rely on others to do so for them. Some even just talk about the more senior disabled drivers. Young people can be disabled also. I know there are other petitions like this one but none state every disabled person whatever the benefit rates they are on.",
