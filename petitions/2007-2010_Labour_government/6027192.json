            "background": "I've been hearing for the past year rumours about Beckham being knighted for services to football but what about Tony Carr??? \n\nTony Carr has nurtured the players of the future for over thirty years and some of the top English players at the moment were discovered by him. Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Michael Carrick, Joe Cole and numerous others have been nurtured by him.\n\nEven after 30 years he is still finding the brightest new talents for West Ham. With the likes of Anton Ferdinand and Mark Noble already breaking through into the first team, the likes of Collison, Stokes, Ephraim and Tomkins are still to feature.\n\nIn my option Tony Carr is one of the reasons why West Ham are regarded as the Academy and I believe he should be recognised.",
