            "background": "Our Government are considering proposals for an NHS Consititution,   \n\nIn the media there were suggestions that certain aspects of health care may be denied to people who smoke & drink etc., ie:- \n\n\"Government officials have admitted the new constitution would mean patients would need to look at their lifestyles and take more responsibility, and make sure they turn up for appointments.\"\n\n\"If you are smoking too much, should you be entitled to an operation?\" a Department of Health representative told a national paper.\n\nNo 10 have since said,  \"No such proposals exist\"  \n\nOur taxes, from whatever source\nincluding those levied on alcohol & tobacco etc., contribute to our NHS \n\nTherefore, I urge  Citizens' to sign this petition so that Government are aware of the people's feelings, in respect of maintaining our rights to free health care at the point of delivery.",
