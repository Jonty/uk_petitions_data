Every day another MP is forced to come clean about their expenses - all paid for from the public purse, ie you and me. The only way to sort this sorry mess out is to allow the public to have its say! Therefore, we are calling on the Prime Minister to seek the Queen's permission to disolve Parliament and call an immediate General Election. The public who voted these people into power will then have the opportunity to vote them out.\nWe need MPs who are there to serve their electorate, not line their pockets at our expense. This will be the wake up call every politician of every party should take note of.",
