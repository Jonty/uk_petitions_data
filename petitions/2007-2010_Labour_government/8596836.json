            "background": "I would like to see some sort of Insurance that Cyclists & Horse Riders Have to Pay for using the roads, like we have to with cars.  It should not be rules for one & rules for others.  If passing a horse, & it was accidently startled, & kicked out & dented your car, you could not claim for anything.  As they don't have any sort of insurance for using the roads.  I would like to see this changed.",
