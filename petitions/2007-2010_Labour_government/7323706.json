            "background": "The Law for when sidelights, then headlights, should be used is clear & adequate.  Unless in SERIOUS rain/fog then headlights outside half-hour after sunset to half-hour before sunrise is hazardous, as is use instead of merely sidelights in well street-lit 30mph zones.  They (i) distract, (ii) obscure vision by extreme contrast & glare, (iii) make distance & speed of offenders hard to judge, (iv) mask indicator lamps, (v) make rear view mirrors useless (vi) increase pollution by the extra engine load, and (vii) daylight headlights on motorways merely dazzle oncoming traffic & distract those ahead via rear mirrors.  If headlights were \u2018safe\u2019 we\u2019d have them as bright as the sun front AND back \u2013clearly nonsensical!  Calls for more headlight usage above the already irresponsible & \u2018bling\u2019 or poseur inspired level today are surely only advocated by those with defective vision who rely on bright lights to avoid collisions.   Such drivers give themselves away as unfit to drive.",
