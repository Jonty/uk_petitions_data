            "background": "It seems quite apparent that this country's desire for exotic fruit and veg is not going to go away, despite any wish of ours to reduce our carbon footprint.  Although our climate is said to be warming, we cannot yet rely on it for growing these products.\n\nUntil that time, surely we could put money into subdising the production of exotic fruit and vegetables in this country, under glass or in polytunnels?  I would be interested to see research into this carried out, to see whether its introduction on a large scale would be viable, and to know if such a project would be cheaper, as well as greener, than the large-scale import of food from abroad which exists at present.",
