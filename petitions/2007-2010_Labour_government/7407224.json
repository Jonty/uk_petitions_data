            "background": "The conditions are appalling.  Lorries are crammed with horses so there is no room to move on journeys from Poland and Romania to Southern Italy.  They travel vast distances in unbearably hot lorries without water and without a break. When they do stop they are treated brutally.  They are all ages - little foals and pregnant mares. Sick horses fall to be trampled on by others who cannot move out of their way. This atrocity must be stopped",
