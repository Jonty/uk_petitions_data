            "background": "To implement a system involving payments of benefits into accounts that can only be used to pay by a dual card system:\n\nThe Red Card would have the basic benefits paid into it, including child benefits and can only be used to pay for necessities: food, cleaning materials, etc.  This would not include cigarettes, alcohol or withdrawal of cash.\n\nThe Blue Card would be for earned benefits, amount defined by previous National Insurance contributions, and can be used like any normal debit account - without an overdraft.  This could just be a payment directly into a personal bank account.\n\nWe will keep you fed, warm and sheltered.  We will not finance laziness and your unhealthy or unnecessary, habits.",
