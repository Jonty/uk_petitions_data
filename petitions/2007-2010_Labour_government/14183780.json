At present these services are easily accessed as The Whittington is uniquely positioned on arterial routes able to serve our diverse local communities effectively.   These services are crucial to the health and safety of our communities in N. London with all its attendant inner-city related problems.  If services are cut, this will mean patients and their relatives travelling further at greater risk and also put unacceptable pressures on paramedics and medical professionals in other hospitals.  A&E is the \"aorta\" of the hospital  -  this vital and essential service should be nurtured.",
