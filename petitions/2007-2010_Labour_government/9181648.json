            "background": "We supposedly live in a democracy, yet the church of England remains Established despite for example Catholicism having overtaken it in numbers of adherents. We suggest that  the state religion should reflect the people(including Humanist or Atheist) equally. This needs to be addressed because the current situation is likely to lead to tensions, especially if for example Islam overtook Christianity as the dominant religion in the UK, and yet still remained dis-favoured. It is unfair that the CofE remains in a position of power within our nation   when it is not the Dominant denomination   . Therefore we ask you Prime Minister to introduce a regular public referendum on the position of Established Religion of the UK.",
