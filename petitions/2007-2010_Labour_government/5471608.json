            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Abolish road fund licensing in favour of increased fuel prices and the introduction of an environmental levy.The existing system rewards high mileage users and penalises low milage and certain vehicle type users , an average motorist covers 15000miles per annum consuming 375 gallons of fuel using a vehicle which averages 40 mpg ,by increasing the cost per litre by 10p or 50pence a gallon the average motorist would cover his road tax ,however those who do the most milage would obviously pay more and the infrequent user less, which would seem a fairer system.\nThe environmental levy being applied at present is to unfairly tax 4x4 owners,a Levy of 2p per litre or 10 pence a gallon for which the collection mechanism is already in place and therefor reduced costs of collection.This would allow an auditable amount of monies to be collected which would then be accountable to the public to ensure it is used on transport systems. A person who drives 5000 miles in the highest emission 4x4 certainly creates less pollution than a Hire vehicle which travels 50000miles per annum. Please let us look at alternatives but not be puniative.",
