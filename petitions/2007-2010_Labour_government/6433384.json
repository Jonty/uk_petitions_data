        "background": "We note that the UK does not require work permits for nationals of  \nany EU member state prior to 1 January 2007, and request these same  \nrights of access be granted to Romanian citizens.\n\nIt is clear from its eight months of operation that the worker  \nrestrictions have proved complex, costly and counter-productive.  We  \nnote that the system of restrictions cannot be administered  \neffectively by the Border and Immigration Agency; that it will cost  \nthe British taxpayer at least \u00a33m in 2007; and that it drives  \nRomanian workers on to the black market, so forcing them into unsafe  \nconditions and making them targets for exploitation.\n\nIn light of the very low numbers of Romanians coming to the UK since  \n1 January 2007, we urge the government to end the discrimination of  \nits work permit regime now, and allow Romanians the same chance to  \ncontribute fully to the UK economy as are afforded to other EU  \nnationals.",
