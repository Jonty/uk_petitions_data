            "background": "Surely with the current concern about climate change and the ever increasing production of rubbish and waste it makes sense to encourage people to repair household appliances rather than buy new ones. After all the energy required to make the spare part is far less than a completely new item and by repairing say a washing machine or TV it stops one more item going to landfill.",
