            "background": "Please find below my suggestion for fixing Britain's economy. Instead \nof giving billions of pounds to banks who seem to be very reluctant to lend to the public under the current economic climate, use the following plan which I believe will help tremendously. You can call it the Patriotic Retirement Plan:\n       \nThere are currently about 20 million people over 50 in the work force. As long as they have worked for 10 years or more, pay them \u00a31 million apiece severance for early retirement with the \nfollowing stipulations:\n\n1) They MUST retire. Twenty million job openings - Unemployment fixed.\n \n2) They MUST buy a new British CAR. Twenty million cars ordered - Auto \nIndustry fixed.\n \n3) They MUST either buy a house or pay off their mortgage - Housing \nCrisis fixed.\n \n4) They must send their kids to school / college /university - Crime \nrate fixed",
