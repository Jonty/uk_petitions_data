            "background": "the uk is far behind other countries when it comes to protecting natural habitats and so has paid the price, once most of the uk was covered in forest and now their are only very small fragmented patches dotted around\n\nThe uk has also lost most of its heathland and wetland, and we have very few wild rivers most of which have been developed or altered\n\nBut there is hope, we still have large areas of land not developed in which we can increase woodland,wetland,heathland which would be great for both wildlife and ourselfs\n\nThe last few years we have had serious flooding causing havock to millions of people but there is a great solution, \nallow large areas of undeveloped land to flood this will then in the case of a flood take up most of the water, we could also increase petland on hill tops which soaks up the water as it falls and preventes it from running done towards villagers so benifiting humans and wildlife as these are great areas for birds and other wildlife\n\nbasically all it requires from the goveremnt is to give back to nature what was once hers",
