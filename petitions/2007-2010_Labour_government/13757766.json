            "background": "Please stop making parents and carers pay 6 times the cost for disability items as \"normal\" items are not this cost, and are tested to the same standard for example a car seat for a child can cost between \u00a3120-\u00a3300 but for a special needs child can be up and over \u00a31000, this is taking advantage of parents and carers whom have had to stop working to look after a disabled child and are now on a low income.",
