            "background": "In 1972 the Shrewsbury 24 plus thousands of construction workers were fighting to improve terms and conditions for all construction workers across the country. They were fighting for better health and safety standards and to get rid of the so-called 'lump' (which is cash-in-hand payments). These picketers paid a heavy price for winning the national strike by being imprisoned. These picketers included the famous actor Ricky Tomlinson (of the Royal family) and infamous Des Warren. We are seeking the truth. These picketers were fighting for the ordinary people & their rights and it's time to right the wrongs and not to forget. To show your support and strength of feeling sign up and support the cause.",
