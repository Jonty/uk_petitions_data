            "background": "Following the deep concerns and suspicions that too many political party donors have been receiving peerages and other honours, I am petitioning for the creation of a committee of thirty members of the public to determine future awards. These members of the public should not be engaged in politics and should be drawn from a cross-section of society including fair representation of gender, and also the inclusion of minorities. The members should be drawn from a wide range of jobs, including teachers, nurses, bankers, farmers, and others from various careers including those in catering, manufacture, communications, retail, and caring. The aim of the committee should include the close scrutiny of any possibility that a recommendation for an honour could be seen as linked to donations or loans to a political party. It should also include an effort to recognise more of the unseen low-profile individuals who significantly contribute to the well-being of our community. Thank you for reading this petition and I hope you will consider signing it.\n\nRichard Henderson (teacher)",
