            "background": "The government are currently discussing secret plans to create a \"transporter\" which will allow anybody of the Muslim faith to be instantly transported back to their home country.  It is designed to allow any Muslim that feels persecuted in the current terrorist climate to be instantly transported home to avoid any kind of racial discrimination.  Plans regarding the method of transportation are currently unavailable but a close Government source reveals that it involves \"22nd century\" technology.\n\nSurely the money behind this project would be better spent on caring for British citizens through investment in the NHS or other training facilities?\n\nPlease sign this petition to stop the madness!",
