            "background": "The housing market has practically come to a stand still and is causing suffering to a large group of people. Property chains are unable to move because there is almost a complete lack of first time buyers to start the process.\n\nThis is creating problems and unemployment for estate agent, solicitors, surveyors, furniture stores, builders, tradesmen and any one connected to the housing market.\n\nThis petition asks the Government to stimulate the market by providing help to first time buyers.\nThis help could be in the form of:\n\u2022\tLow interest loans of up to \u00a320,000 to first time buyers to enable them to bridge the gap between what the mortgage companies will provide.\n\u2022\tA cash grant to first time buyers.  (Similar to the scheme operated in Australia)\n\u2022\tA return to the MIRAS scheme where tax relief is allowed on loans for homes.",
