            "action": "reform the payment of all state benefits (including state pensions and the minimum wage) so that those living in London and the South East and the rest of England are paid much higher rates in the light of both higher living costs and the recognition that England is the main wealth generating and the only net tax paying home nation in the UK.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The existing UK schemes for paying state pensions and other benefits, as well as the setting of the minimum wage, ignore the huge disparities in the cost of living across the UK.  \n\nSo, for example, the present minimum wage of \u00a35.35 per hour for those aged over 22, might be more than is required to live in Wales and Scotland, but does not deliver an acceptable standard of living in England, especially for those living in London and the South East.  \nThe petition's proposals would also go some way to modify the extreme unfairness of the existing \"Barnett\" formula whereby so much of England's tax revenues are diverted to the other home nations of Scotland, Wales and NI.\n\nThe pensioners in all of England - but especially those in London and the South East - ask please for recognition of their higher living costs now.",
