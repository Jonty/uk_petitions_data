            "background": "I propose that the PM directs UK agricultural scientists to help the Afghan population of heroin farmers to convert their poppy crops to fields of biofuels.  This will give farmers money for a product we can use without unbalancing world food supplies.\n\nAround 90% of the worlds supply of opium comes from Afghanistan. The excuse given for its perpetuation is that '...if we take heroin poppy crops away from them - they will either starve or turn to the Taliban'.\n\nHowever, if the UK Chief Scientist were to lead a team of researchers to ensure that appropriate biofuel plants matched to the Afghan climate in Helmand and other areas - were planted on a biofuel crop-heroin replacement basis - field by field - then money would still flow to local farmers - they would not need the Taliban - the world would thank them for producing a useable eco-friendly product and other countries would not need to use up their current food-crop fields for biofuel crops.  Israeli and Libyan desert rotational watering systems could be put in place to ensure good harvests from deep acquifers.",
