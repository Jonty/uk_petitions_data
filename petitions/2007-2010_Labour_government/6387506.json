            "action": "accept a recent invitation sent to Prime Minister Gordon Brown from a member of Slough Borough Council and to visit the town and to actively consult with local councillors towards overcoming difficulties with regard to presently disputed local population figures when calculating necessary levels of local government funding, so that a proper and mutually agreed level of funding from Central Government will be achieved as a matter of urgency.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The local press in Slough recently reported that Prime Minister Gordon Brown was 'too busy' to visit Slough and that he has turned down an invitation to discuss the borough's urgent funding needs. The Leader of Slough Borough Council is reported to have issued a second invitation to Prime Minister Brown and is seemingly awaiting a reply. He is reported as having said that,\"I am hoping he's going to honour the pledge of his predecessor [Tony Blair], who promised Slough would get the extra funding it needed.\" Tony Blair apparently previously made a promise to address Slough's funding problems when he was put on the spot during a radio interview earlier in 2007, prior to Gordon Brown becoming Prime Minister. The Council has long argued that the borough's public services will suffer unless the government recognises that Slough has an 'invisible and growing population'.",
