That petition is available here under the name \"autismrights\" and the response simply cited the disability discrimination act.\n\nThis does nothing for those of us who are not disabled, and thus we the undersigned request that the government look again at this question. We request that the government grant minority rights protection to the social minority group of autistics in the same vein that homosexuals need not identify as suffering a clinical disorder in order to get protection from discrimination. Autistic adults who suffer no disability may still receive prejudiced treatment and the DDA offers no protections",
