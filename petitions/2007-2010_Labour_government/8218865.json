            "background": "For several years people have complained about the M6 bottleneck between J5 and J11.  The road haulage industry has always demanded either M6 widening or additional road building, and hence, the Birmingham Northern Relief road (M6 Toll) was conceived.\n \nWhen the Toll opened it cost \u00a32 for a car to travel the entire road. Since then, fees have more and doubled and for HGVs it costs \u00a39.  As a result, fewer motorists are now using the toll, with a reported 10% drop in daily use during recent months.\n\nThe solution to traffic jams on the M6 has already been built in the form of the M6 Toll. The government should complete a compulsory purchase of the M6 toll and open it up for free use by all motorists.  In Scotland toll roads have been outlawed and the same principal should be set in England.  Allowing free use of the M6 Toll would save millions of pounds lost in delays on the M6 and environmentally, thousands of tonnes of CO2 could be saved by cars not sitting in jams on the M6 every day.",
