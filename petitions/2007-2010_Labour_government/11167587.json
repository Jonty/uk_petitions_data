            "background": "To oppose the proposed closure of Woodchurch and Guinea Gap Leisure centres and many other leisure facilities from 31st March 2009.  Our concern is for Woodchurch and what it means to our club.  We have a membership of almost 200 children, in addition council lessons at Woodchurch alone teach up to 400 children per week, schools from around the area also use the pool. The closure of the centre and its facilities to other users would be devasting for swimming and other sports on the Wirral.",
