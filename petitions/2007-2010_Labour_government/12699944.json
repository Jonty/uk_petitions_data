            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Atmospheric particle pollution has been linked to a number of health issues and is thought to be directly responsible for a reduction in the life expectancy of a person living in the UK by an average of 7-8 months. Road transport is a major source of atmospheric particle emissions, particularly within urban areas. Current legislation has only focused on reducing emissions from the exhaust pipe of the vehicle. New studies have shown that other unregulated vehicle related emissions, such as non-exhaust emissions can equal or surpass exhaust contributions. Non-exhaust emissions such as resuspended road dust and tyre, brake and road surface wear can contribute 10-90% of the total atmospheric particle emissions. The health impacts of these emissions are also unknown, suspected carcinogenic compounds have been found in brake dust and worn tyre particles. Please sign our petition to lobby the Government to support research into non-exhaust emissions and to create appropriate legislation based on the findings of this research to improve air quality and reduce the effects of non-exhaust emissions.",
