        "background": "Prime minister, we desperately need your support to try and retrieve our deposit with KSF (IOM).  Most depositors like me, are expatriates who have worked abroad for a number of years and have made savings for retirement.  This saving is in grave danger and although the onshore branches of KSF seem to have been saved by the treasury, we (IOM deposit holders) do not have any substantiated assurance to hope for.\n\nWe understand if the company is wound up by liquidators on 24 November then there is less chance of return of full savings.  Even with the island\u2019s protection scheme which is apparently increased to 50,000 it would take over a quarter of century to recover the savings, by which time many of us will be gone.  Can you do anything for us?",
