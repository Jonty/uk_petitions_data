        "background": "I believe that the time is now right to pose the question of ensuring people who are convicted of the most heinous crimes against the person to be sentenced to death. In the most recent case of \"Baby P\" we are told that the maximum sentance his three murderers \"or abusers\" as the law would put it, is 14 years. As a decent citizen and caring parent, i find that absolutely disgusting and merely one other example of how our laws are completely inadequate for our modern society.",
