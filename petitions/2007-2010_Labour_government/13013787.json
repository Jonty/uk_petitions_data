            "background": "The Teletext service is scheduled to close down in January 2010. This has caused a lot of distress to a great many people, some of them vulnerable, elderly, housebound or disabled. Teletext is a companion to these people, it puts them in touch with a wider community and they see their fellow texters as friends. Some of these people do not have or want computers. Since the announcement TV Talking Points on Teletext p.138 has been printing 40 - 45 messages per day, all expressing disbelief and sorrow. Certainly these are only representative texts; many more will not have been shown. A Facebook group has been started and is steadily increasing its membership. Public feeling is that Teletext is a loved institution which must not be lost. Please save our Teletext.",
