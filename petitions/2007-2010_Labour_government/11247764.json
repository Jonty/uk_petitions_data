            "background": "My concern is regarding the rollout of these shock guns to untrained police officers without  understanding the danger signs. I am epileptic and any form of shock received to this level is dangerous and can , I am sure, start a fit, and the same for any one with a heart problem. The police are not medically trained therefore unable to judge as to whether a person may be having a seizure, blackout or plain drunk and disorderly. \nI would like this \"plan\" to be properly re-viewed on medical reasons and the dangers established as the figures from the USA are very scary ! There seem to have been a large number of fatalities due to the use of these guns.",
