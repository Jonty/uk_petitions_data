            "background": "For many years selection to our existing Grammar schools has been largely dependent on the results of Verbal Reasoning tests taken at the end of Primary Schooling. Schools are urged not to coach pupils in the format of these tests to keep the tests fair and open. Schools subscribe to this request, however many aware parents and pupils avail themselves of the practice tests and guidance notes on sale in book stores to help them improve their performance. Some Home Tutors also make a living assisting children to attain higher marks in these tests. The C streams of many Grammar schools contain pupils who might have been able to scrape through these tests, but lack sufficient academic abilty to take full advantage of good teaching and a rigorous curriculum. A proportion of academically gifted children are therefore being denied access to these excellent schools. Selection to Grammar Schools requires a wider selection process, including assessment of  pupils' abilities in all aspects of English and Mathematical reasoning.\n\nI urge all political parties to consider a revision of this process, and ask the government to make a reassessment of current procedures.",
