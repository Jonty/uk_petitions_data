She is an example to us all. not just for her fostering marathon, but she is also know as a bit of a Child Whisperer, for her nack to tame wild and unruly kids, by just using her good old family values.Fostering here in The UK is in real crisis with the lack of new fosterers coming forward. 10,000 are needed. By Gordon Brown awarding Doreen Roberts, Somerset Wonder foster Mum a Nighthood. would show The Goverment do value this very underrated public service, and show Doreen her true value to the State! Remeber she has been changing nappies for well over 54 years daily and has no plans yet on stopping giving a home to children in need",
