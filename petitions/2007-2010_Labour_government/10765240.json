As one of these type of people I need hot water and heat all the time for my medical condition! My heating and hot water are supplied by a combi boiler which is oil fired and fitted to give me more control over the heat in my house not realising that the cost of oil would go through the roof!\n\nPlease help your Disabled members of the population!!!",
