            "background": "Season tickets can only be purchased in increments of 7 days thus including weekends. However, the majority of us only commute 5 days a week and with the introduction of home working it can be less, so season tickets are not cost effective. With all the attention around greenhouse gases and the efforts to reduce car travel why not utilise the technological capabilities the new ticketing systems and offer us  appropriate ticketing that is cost effective i.e. tickets covering only 5 days a week, tickets allowing 20 days of travel, tickets charged by use (like Oyster), etc. This will reduce congestion, greenhouse gases, fair-dodging and dissatisfaction with the train operators.",
