        "background": "In times where the number of Pupillage places are decreasing and the number of BVC places increase, places those finishing the BVC and those seeking a career at the Bar under stress both emotionally and financially.Students are aware of the difficulty of gaining pupillage but this is made worse by the recession and the funding cuts made by the government. Furthermore, those who have completed their studies are facing difficulty in finding work that will help launch careers again because of the funding cuts in crime and family. The BVC is only valid for five years after completion and where there are cuts, this could be a wasted qualification as the number of pupillages have decreased. There is simply no support and urge the government to strongly look at this serious situation as they are neglecting future talent.",
