            "background": "For those who do not have BT phones lines, the cost of these 'local rate' calls are extortionate, especially if you are only able to use a mobile telephone.  It is invidious to have to pay a premium (effectively a stealth tax) to report a crime, to seek medical attention or information, to find out where a missing benefits payment is, etc.  All such services should be available on geographic telephone numbers only.  It is bad enough having put up with automated systems that keep callers hanging on at a cost until calls are answered without having to pay a premium.",
