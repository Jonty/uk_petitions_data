            "background": "Congrats to the British govt. for addressing one of society's main grievances, it seems, rightly or wrongly, to do with everything : immigration.\n\nTighter rules for skilled and temporary workers are long overdue. But, having seen last night's news, where employers are being prosecuted, the petitioner is calling for clarification - should non -Uk citizens be working or not ? It seems that the system that allows individuals to gain illegal access is the fundamental flaw, rather than those employers who innocently become embroiled. \n\nI thought the whole point was to encourage people, once here, to be independent and self financing.\n\nIf the objective is to manage migration \"in the national interest\", then surely this involves non - reliance on welfare state benefits ?\nThe proposed new schemes - known as Tier 2 and Tier 5 - would replace a number of routes to the UK, including the old work permit system. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to ensure this includes a points reduction for a criminal record and non - English ability. But the real action requested in my petition is to share responsibility for helping others.",
