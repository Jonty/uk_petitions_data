I was surprised to discover how many other posters, from the UK and the rest of the world, were  on forums when they were at work. When I challenged them about the theft of time from their employer, the usual excuses were that they were bored, or they would make up the time later! Some of these posters seem to spend most of their working day on forums if their post count was anything to go by! I  wonder if forum and chat room use may have contributed to the financial crisis the world is in?",
