        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The M53 motorway spur should be extended further west to West Kirby from it's present terminus at the end of the Upton by-pass, Moreton. It's capacity should be increased from 2 lanes to dual 3 lanes in both directions for the entire length of the spur. \nJourney times from West Kirby/Hoylake to the M53 motorway can takes as much as 30 minutes beacuse all roads are single lane with 30mph restrictions. North West Wirral is really lacking a primary road that connects to Birkenhead and the motorway network. There is a great need for the M53 motorway spur to be extended further west, it is feasible to do too because it's all fields.",
