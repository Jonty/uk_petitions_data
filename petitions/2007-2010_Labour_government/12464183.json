The international community including the UK needs to recognize and acknowledge the human rights violations that still exist in Ethiopia, specifically targeted at the Ogaden people and the Oromo people.\n\nYear after year, clear reports have been filed against Ethiopia\u2019s horrific human rights violations by the US Department of State, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and many other institutions.\n\nWe urge the UK government to condemn what has been going on for decades and will continue to go on for longer if something is not done soon. Ethiopia\u2019s current leaders need to realize that their actions are not acceptable and will not be tolerated. \n\nWe urge the Prime Minister, to be the first to publicly denounce these Human Rights violations that the Ethiopian government is knowingly committing.",
