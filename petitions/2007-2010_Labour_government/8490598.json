            "background": "The English premier league has put forward a plan to play a 39th league game in an overseas city, this is unfair to the clubs in the league and defeats the object of having 1 home and 1 away match against every team in the league. It also insults the English football going fan, this is a ploy to make more money from global fans, at the loss to the home football going supporters.\nPlease add your name to this petition so that we keep english football in the reach of english fans.",
