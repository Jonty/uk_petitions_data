These failures spill out into violence on our streets and we are literally being kicked to death by a youth culture which has no fear of authority.\n\nThis petition has started with the following aims:\n\n - To impose a curfew of 9pm on all children below the age of 16 on public land unless accompanied by a responsible adult.  Patrols, fines and custody will enforce this.\n\n - When a minor is found guilty of a crime, their parents should stand trial alongside them for their responsibility in that crime.\n\n - More police acting pro-actively in our communities with a visual presense to prevent rather than follow up on criminal activity.\n\nIf you support these aims, please sign this petition and bring the misery to the attention of those people who don't see it on a regular bases - those protected by high walls and deaf ears.  We need change.",
