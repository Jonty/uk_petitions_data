            "background": "Train operating companies are currently only required to offer compensation for delays of 30 minutes or over. This does not recognise the disruption caused by cancelled services; particularly on busy commuter routes, a single cancelled train at peak hours can cause severe overcrowding. In extreme cases, this means that commuters are unable to board a service and are therefore delayed by 30 minutes or more reaching their destination, even though each particular service may run less than 30 minutes late.",
