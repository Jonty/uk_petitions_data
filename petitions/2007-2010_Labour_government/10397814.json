        "background": "Electricity pylons are existing eyesores spralling over the countryside, and are here to stay. I believe \"small\" wind turbines should be erected on these pylons, and the energy produced could be fed directly into the National Grid, using the cables that are already supported by the pylons. Turbines with vertical cylindrical rotor blades would not need to be rotated to face the wind, they would catch the wind from any direction. This would increase green energy, without the need for additional large developments of windfarms",
