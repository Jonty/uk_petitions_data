            "background": "Despite the fact that we continually hear about how we are headed for a recession, councils are still trying to introduce new controlled parking zones.\n\nAn example I know is Bushey in Hertfordshire. The local council has been trying to create a controlled parking zone for almost 3 years, and every time its been blocked by local objections.\n\nYet the council has recently decided to continue with the zone anyway. There is no leeway for the local workers. This means that workers who commute in will have to pay \u00a3400 for a permit. This would be less of an issue if it was permit parking, but the parking would still be pay & display as well, so you could pay for a permit for a carpark where you never get a space. \n\nAnother issue is that the car parks were donated to the people of Bushey in a local residents will. \n\nSo in a time of recession, when the government are trying fiscal stimulus packages in order to release funds to small businesses, how can councils continue apply new charges to the public?",
