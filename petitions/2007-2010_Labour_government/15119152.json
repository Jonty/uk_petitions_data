        "background": "The road haulage industry is on the verge of collapse due to the enourmous taxes on diesel fuel. We in Britain have the cheapest diesel in Europe before tax, but the most expensive after tax. This cannot continue. Economic recovery requires a strong haulage industry. Without that the country will never recover.",
