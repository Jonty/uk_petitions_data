            "background": "This petion would be great in banning this stupid argument from being tought, which in turn would make moral philosophy students at university or A Level feel very greatful as the ontological argument is such a bad one.\nThis argument caused my whole moral philosophy A Level class to feel depressed for a day as they could not understand how someone could be so stupid and make up such a ridiculous argument. It would be very much appreciated if Anselm of Canterbury would be wiped from the syllabus as myself and many other students dont think that his ontological argument deserves any recignition at all. If I could I would request he was wiped from history but that would be impossible. PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION.",
