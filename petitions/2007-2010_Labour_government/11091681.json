            "action": "increase the copyright term for performers from 50 to 95 years.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Do performers deserve copyright on a par with other creators? We think so. So does the European Commission. So does the French government. So does the German government. But the UK government is not supporting the legislation to put this right.\n\nThe copyright term for performers is limited to 50 years after release, about half the length of copyright enjoyed by other creators. The draft Directive on the term of protection of copyright and related rights proposes increasing this to 95 years, on a par with the USA and closer to the life plus 70 years enjoyed by composers, authors, photographers and other artists.\n\nYet, the UK government is not backing this Directive. Despite having the biggest music industry in Europe, the UK government is not supporting its own musicians.\n\nThe draft Directive is currently being debated in the European Council of Ministers, attended by John Denham, Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. There is still time to persuade him. But we will need to act fast.",
