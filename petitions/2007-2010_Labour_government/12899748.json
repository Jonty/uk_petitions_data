            "background": "Re-franchising of the east coast mainline would betray (yet again) the british travelling public and the beleagured staff working in all of the rail franchises in the uk.\nThe Government should undertake to place the east coast mainline under a not for profit organisation similar to the Network Rail Model.\n The Government should evenually seek to place the whole rail network under the a not for profit arrangement ending the ridiculous dogma that the ony model for the railways is through franchising.\nRail franchising is a flawed and discredited dogma that largely benefits only the greedy and disadvantages the British People through ever increasing rail fares and ever decreasing service levels.",
