        "background": "Mr Brown, why can`t you add vehicle excise duty (road tax) on to the price of petrol / diesel and abolish it?? \nThe more you drive the more you pay, no escape from road tax.\nEven the man next door who has no car, only a lawn mower will pay a little tax.\nIt works in other eu countries, why not the uk??\nIt makes sense and is not rocket science, you fill your tank, then you pay excise duty.\nIf anyone agrees with me please sign.\nMany thanks",
