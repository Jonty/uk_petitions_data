This includes simple drawings which  harm no actual child. This would mean that if a child in Primary School drew a sexual act for fun, it would be a criminal offense.\n\nDrawn images which in no way harm children could provide a release for pedophiles. Taking away this release could drive them to getting REAL child pornography which harms children, or drive them to molestation.",
