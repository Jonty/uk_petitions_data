            "background": "Many musicians, sound engineers and producers can suddenly find themselves out of work for a multitude of reasons often ending up living in poverty, feeling ashamed, and excluded from society.  Employers from other industries deem them unemployable despite these people being highly professional, creative, and hold a number of transferable skills. The music industry is rampant with ageism and many find themselves simply not cool enough to be employed in the industry anymore.   Job centre careers advisors are simply not skilled enough to deal with this group and job agencies are not interested.   Musicians from all backgrounds have contributed massive taxes revenue for this country even those that have not had hit records.  The government needs to set up a support service which could help this untapped highly skilled and talented group.   All over the country there are teachers in schools, colleges and community projects with no real world experience of the industry and often their skills are totally inadequate but they know how to work the system and find lucrative positions.",
