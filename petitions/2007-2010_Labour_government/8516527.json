            "background": "x breed puppies are now being exploited, some even being sold for as much as \u00a3600. They come with new fancy names i,e labradoodles, huskamutes etc. Cross breeding dogs is no 'accident' its a trade. There's no back up, no accredited breeder scheme. People are breeding any dogs purely for money. This should be made illegal, and any 'accidental' puppies should be given away to decent good homes, or handing in to a rescue centre.",
