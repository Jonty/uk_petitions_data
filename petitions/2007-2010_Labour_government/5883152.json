            "background": "Canadians have demonstrated their desire for independence through repatriating the British North America Act and enacting the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982.  In the minds of most Canadians, Britain reliquished soveriegnty over Canada a quarter century ago.  Still, the British Monarch retains her position as Head of State in Canada.  Through her representatives she wields power to affect the course Canadian history though her actions are secreted by the Leiutenant Governors and Senators.\n\nDuring the last 15 years and for the next decades to come Canadian territory will be reorganized through a system of annexations.  Nunavut and the Nisga'a Nation are examples of wide territories that have been annexed into Aborginal governance without the broad knowledge or consent of Canadian citizens.  In order to fairly express the interests and aspirations of all Canadians, a democratic system with transparent governance and fully elected representation must be created and is our right.  \n\nGive us our Freedom to make our own destiny.\n\nSigned,\nCanada",
