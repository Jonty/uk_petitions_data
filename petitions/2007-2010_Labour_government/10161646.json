            "background": "The Climate Change Levy may or may not have been a good idea when it was introduced but the fact that the price of energy has risen so much since, negates the need for it now. After all if the levy was genuinely about getting businesses to think about and cut their use of energy and not just another tax raising measure, then the massive rise in energy costs is doing that now to a far greater extent.",
