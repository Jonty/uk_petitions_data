        "action": "Bring in legislation to require private landlords to make the properties they rent out energy efficient and to sanction those who refuse.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "So much help is given out by the Government to help home owners living in 'Fuel Poverty' make their properties energy efficient so they can make savings on their winter energy bills but no help is given to tenants who are living in private rented accommodation. I believe that the Government should bring in legislation to a) Ensure that Landlords make the properties they rent out meet a required standard for energy efficiency and b) To give financial help to tenants who live on State Benefits (Incapacity Benefit / Severe Disablement Allowance) and whose landlords do not make improvements to their properties the same help that is given to pensioners to help with winter heating costs.",
