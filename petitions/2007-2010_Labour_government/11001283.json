There is widespread indignation with the way that the BBC is run culminating in various recent examples of disgusting behaviour by people who are paid vast amounts of money funded by the license fee.It is unacceptable that we should be forced to pay for the license under pain of prosecution.This tax is now wholly discredited and must be brought to an end.Three years will allow time for other arrangements to be made.",
