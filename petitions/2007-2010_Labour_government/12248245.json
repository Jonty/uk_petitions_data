We do this as one too many people have lost loved ones to this drug and also have to watch loved ones very slowly choke themselves to death on this despicable drug. This drug should be made illegal to prevent further self harm, psychological abuse alongside physical and above all more deaths due to smoking this drug. Why should this drug be left on the shelves for more people to cause self harm and potentially death to themselves",
