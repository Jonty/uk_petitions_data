It's not fair that as a single parent you can claim income surport long after your child has started school. All parents should be given the chance to look after their children- it should be seen as a job-they could make weekly visits to the health visiter conpusory or partenting classes. I've seen women break down and cry when they have to go back to work. Come Gordon make it a job to be a mom and you'll free up jobs for other people and all those moms \"working\" you'll have fab job figures!",
