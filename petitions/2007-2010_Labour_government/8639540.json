        "background": "The financial Services Ombudsman is accountable to no-one. It is funded by the very businesses consumers complain about. There is a huge disparity between  the way in which the FOS presents itself to the public, i,e. 'impartial' and its actual subjective and bias behavior. The FOS maintain they 'don't have to ask for evidence' or even explain themselves. Internal service review complaints about the FOS are stonewalled and/or dismissed  but the FOS are not even obliged to publish details in relation to these internal complaints. They are an affront to any notion of consumer rights and merely add to the misery and suffering of those injured by unethical and unscrupulous financial organisations. The FOS should be abolished.",
