            "background": "This could potentially save large sums of money at a time when the demands upon tax revenues are significantly increased. \n\nThe aim is ensure that were alternative suitable open source software options exist, then public bodies should be mandated to use it rather than continuing to fund commercial products unless just cause can be shown, especially when the revenue for such purchases largely goes to US firms. A suitable example being the OpenOffice software suite. \n\nIf there is no open source alternative then public bodies can buy the commercial product, but by mandating that open source must be evaluated, then the decision to reject open source software can be made open to public scrutiny under the Freedom of Information act and thus the public sector can held to account and challenged for it\u2019s software purchasing decisions.",
