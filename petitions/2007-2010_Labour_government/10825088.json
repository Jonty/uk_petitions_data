        "background": "1. Population growth is accelerating and the Earth's resources are finite. This is an untenable situation that at the very least will lead to increasing environmental damage and possibly conflict.\n2. Public money spent on IVF could be put to good use in saving existing lives, perhaps by buying expensive cancer drugs.\n3. Couples that are desperate to have children can adopt, thereby benefiting themselves, the child, desperately ill NHS patients (by saving NHS money) and the wider community by enabling adoption and reducing environmental pressure.\n4. Couples can opt to pay for private IVF treatment.",
