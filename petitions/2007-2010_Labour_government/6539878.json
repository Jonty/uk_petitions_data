            "background": "Market Sellers in Brixton/Dalston markets are selling Giant African land Snails as food on their stalls. These snails have no food to eat or water to drink and are kept in piles in baskets. Most die from starvation/dehydration. \n\nThis is unacceptable and extremly cruel so we the undersigned petition against the selling of these snails on the market or AT LEAST the living conditions of the snails made acceptable. Obviously stopping the sale would be FAR FAR better.\n\nSide Note: As well as the cruelty to the snails the fact their are dying snails around shouldnt be allowed for health reasons as well in a market where other food is being sold. Its extremly un-hygenic!",
