        "background": "Petersfield town council has elected to introduce cycle tracks in the centre of the roadway between lines of parked vehicles in the town centre car park. This means that cars reversing from their parking places will be in great danger of backing directly into the path of the cyclists.\n\nThe cyclists will be deceived into thinking that the cycle track is a safe haven.\n\nThese tracks are total nonsense, extremely dangerous and should never have been authorised.\n\nThose who authorized them should be personally liable for the cost of making the tracks and also of removing them",
