            "background": "Shisha/Hookah pipes have been a cultural pastime for hundreds of years in the middle east and have gained a popular following in the West. They pose very little to no threat to health as it is essentially smoking flavoured steam which contains no tar, no carbon monoxide and 0.1% nicotine. There are many lebanese/arab bars throughout the country offering this social pastime but have to be smoked outside with the harmful cigarette smokers. As the electric cigarette is now legal to smoke inside (which is more harmful to health), with proper licensing and restrictions, this could be a new thriving industry within our already diverse culture.",
