            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There is a petition to erect traffic lights at this junction due to the amount of accidents that occur here. However, traffic lights are not the answer. The council need to firstly renew the stop bold white lines at the junction (badly faded) and erect a junction pre-warn sign at least 200 yards prior to the junction when approaching from Reddicap Heath Rd. The council also need to move the 30 mph signs at least 100 yards back from the junction when approaching from Oxley Hays Rd (other side of junction). There is no need for traffic lights that will cause congestion that it not necessary here at this junction. Once the road signs are renewed and some driver decides to flout them and cause an accident then that driver should simply be prosecuted for driving without due care and attention and imprisoned appropriately. I am  professional driver, not a scare monger or attention seeker that doesn't know how the highway code works or how people should driver according to the current test",
