            "background": "I think for most of us it has gone beyond a joke now at how little control we have over our own country.Our so called Democratic Representatives do very little to represent the true concerns of most UK Citizens and instead replace real concerns  with Edicts, Dictates, Policies and Directives Delivered down and for the sole benefit of Big Business .Who i can only assume are the true Paymasters of our so called Peers .Is it unreasonable for all of us collectively to expect a return to true Democracy or do we have to watch whilst our Government denigrates the memory of the Brave Men and Women who lost their lives during two world wars so that we may have Freedom of Speech and Freedom of thought .I personally no longer knows who is in charge of the UK but i have a good idea it is no longer the British Government or UK Citizens .Please sign this Petition so at least we can get a few answers",
