This would therefore create a much better service.  \n\nThis request comes in the light of the fact that some companies in the Watford area have now not have any postal deliveries for over one week.  This is unacceptable.  \n\nAs Royal Mail no longer appear to offer a postal service (in Watford) what is the point of having them?",
