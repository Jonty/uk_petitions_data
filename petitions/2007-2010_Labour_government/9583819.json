            "background": "Developing, and having the state support, and re-instate our manufacturing base and heavy industries within in the United Kingdom, will help re-develop many of the communities which became disenfranchised, when many mines, steelworks, and other heavy industries were closed down.\n\nIn addition to this, we would also ask the Prime Minister to see a greater development of our farming and fishing industries, as we have seen a large decline in these in recent years,\n\nThese types of industry, have also been proven to help re-form, and re-empower people both physically and mentally.\n\nWe feel that today, that to many of our youth, which would have been involved in heavy industry, have been lead astray by factors of life, they would have not encountered, had they been based in heavy industry, which gives them a secure community, good values, support and stability. \n\nThis will give the youth of today, a greater aspiration to take pride in what they do, themselves, their work, and also their communities. In addition to this, this will also develop a greater sense of responsibility, co-operation, commitment, understanding, and the need to take responsibility for life, amongst them.",
