            "background": "Garry Mckinnon is facing extradition to the United States for hacking into the US computer system while searching for evidence of UFOs. Mr Mckinnon suffers from Asperger's syndrome and yet his appeal was turned down 3rd April 2009.\n \nWe believe that Garry Mckinnon should not be extradited to the US but dealt with within the legal system of the UK.  He is being dealt with under legislation designed for the extradition of terrorists after the atrocities of 9/11. Mr Mckinnons treatment is an abuse of that legislation.",
