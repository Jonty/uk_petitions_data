            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There is not enough time taken, and research done for safer less expensive long-term alternatives of dealing with our waste, the proposed incineration facility is a risk to our local community and is seen as the easy way out. The councilors in our council are no chemical experts how-ever they have the power to decide,this is not just a mobile phone mast we are dealing with here, of course contractors will say it is safe and no evidence is found of increase of health problems in areas near incinerators. What we do know it will take up to ten years for cancerous illnesses or asthma to develop and infant mortality to increase. It does not mean that what they are doing in Europe is ok here. Emissions from these incinerators are not monitored for particles smaller than 2.5 microns, more and more negative evidence on health effects are available but getting ignored. A proper debate in Parliament is needed for a long term solution on our waste and recycling laws. Landfill is wrong but this does not mean air pollution is the answer. What we do need is an answer to give to our future generations.",
