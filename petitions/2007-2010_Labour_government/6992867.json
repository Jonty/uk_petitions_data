                "details": "Defra is currently working with the dairy industry to identify ways to reduce the environmental impacts of dairy production and consumption.. The recent media reports regarding the encouragement of an increase in consumption of UHT milk and a reduction in methane emissions relate to a draft discussion document which contained several potential mitigation measures for further discussion, development, or dismissal. Defra was asked to produce the paper by the industry-government Taskforce working on this issue to promote discussion. The document does not represent Government policy and was never intended to. The Government is not and will not be telling people what kind of milk to drink. People need to make their own decisions. The Government's role is, however, to provide the facts to help people make informed choices based on a range of considerations, one of which is the need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is no firm evidence that we are aware of to show that UHT milk is substantially better for the environment. A paper setting out how we intend to reduce the environmental impact of dairy production and consumption will be developed jointly by Government and the dairy industry in the coming months and published in Spring 2008.
