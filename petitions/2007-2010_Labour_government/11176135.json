            "background": "Londonmidland are withdrawing the popular Walsall to Wolverhampton railway service as of December 2008.  This service which takes no more that 15 minutes to complete it's journey is a preferable, quicker and cheaper option to the alternative 529 bus service and only requires a single railcar to operate.  We urge the PM to subsidise London Midland to operate this service so that the environment, passengers, passenger travel expenses and road traffic levels will all feel the benefit.",
