        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is our belief that during the course of sex education in schools children should be taught the importance of regular screening and checks for cancers, especially those of the breast, testes and cervix.  Simple personal examinations and tests can reveal the presence of potentially deadly disease early, resulting in its swift treatment and possible cure of this disease.  Basic information about the importance of self checking and smear tests could be conveyed quickly and easily during the course of sex education and could potentially save many lives.",
