            "background": "The extremist islamic group Islam4UK has recently stirred up a hornest nest in the British public (and beyond) with their intention on marching through Wootton Bassett carrying coffins. The reasoning 'used' behind this is for support of the Afghanistan people that have lost their lives. However with this protest are far wider ramifications of them trying to incite and incest the British Public and stir up an unwarranted hatred towards general Muslims.\nIt is known that this group arose from a previously band islamic extremist group, and therefore the end goal is well know too!\n\nThis planned march would not only be an insult to the British Soldiers that have paid the ultimate sacrifice, but also to the the wider public of the UK.\nModerate Muslims are also in full agreement this should not be allowed to take place!",
