Current salaries would never be approved by voters if a national referendum was held. They are simply out of all proportion. In summary; J Paxman receives \u00a31M per annum, J Ross has a stagering 3 year deal worth \u00a318 million, G Norton has a woping \u00a35M contract and T Wogan earns \u00a3800k per annum. C Moyles receives \u00a3630k per annum. These salaries for public service are out of proportion when considering their actual talent.",
