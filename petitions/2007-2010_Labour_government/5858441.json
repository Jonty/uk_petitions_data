            "background": "In 02/07 the UK signed the Declaration of the Oslo Conference on Cluster Munitions, which seeks to \u201cprohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.\u201d In violation of the spirit and terms of this declaration, the UK has since defined M85 submunitions manufactured by Israeli Military Industries as a \u201csmart weapon\u201d and intends to retain them in the UK armoury. There exists substantial evidence that the M85 is a lethally indiscriminate weapon that, like all cluster munitions, must be banned. (see for instance the reports of Landmine Action, Human Rights Watch, Mines Advisory Group, Amnesty International, and the UN Mine Action Coordination Centre in South Lebanon) Innocent civilians should not fall victim to political loopholes. Even if the dud-explosion does beat the odds, there is nothing \u201csmart\u201d about blowing off the leg of a child. The UK must honour its commitment to the Oslo Declaration and ban M85 submunitions.",
