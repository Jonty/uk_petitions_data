            "background": "Overseas workers, like all people in contact with children, vulnerable adults or those working in high security positions, are required undergo a CRB check. However the CRB currently only covers time spent in the UK and does not highlight any criminal record acquired before entering the UK.  Currently any further investigations are not compulsory and it is up to the employer to liaise with The Overseas Information Service to obtain a background check in the person\u2019s country of origin.  It can safely be assumed that this additional diligence is not widely taken up, as it presents an extra investment of valuable time and resources to employers. The current situation has deeply troubling implications for health care and airport security sectors.  The current situation is wholly unacceptable and I would like the government to make it compulsory for companies to contact the overseas information service as a matter of course, in order to check the background of employees who have not lived in the UK since birth.",
