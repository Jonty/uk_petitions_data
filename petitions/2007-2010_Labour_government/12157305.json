            "background": "In his book The Way Of The World, published last year, the American investigative author Ron Suskind alleges that MI6 established secret contacts in January-February 2003 with Saddam's intelligence chief Tahir Jalil Habbush. According to Suskind, these convinced MI6 - and Tony Blair - that Saddam Hussein had no WMD. This story has not been directly denied. Its implications are profound. The British people - especially those who have suffered direct loss in the Iraq war - are entitled to know whether or not it is true. They should not have to wait for a general inquiry into the Iraq war, which may take years.",
