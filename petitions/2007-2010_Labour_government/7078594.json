            "background": "Perhaps the reason for videos and video-games enciting violence is the consumer, not the product. As an intelligent teenager, I feel I would be able to see the videos that I wished including '18's, is the age limitations were based on mental age. Also, those who are disturbed by such '18' video or video-games would not be allowed to purchase them, due to their mental age being lower. I urge you to consider this petition which could stop videos and video-games getting into the hands of those who might not be able to ahndle the content, and allow those who can to view them at will.",
