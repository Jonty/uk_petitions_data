        "action": "return home test match cricket to the list of sports which are shown free of charge on terrestrial television",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At the end of the Ashes series in 2005, English cricket was at its zenith. Yet, four years on, there is no cricket whatsoever on terrestrial television. Cricket is far from a minority sport in this country, it is one of the main team sports along with football and rugby. So why, when England matches are ring-fenced and kept on terrestrial television in the cases of football and rugby is cricket shunned in this way? Imagine the outcry if no football was free-to-air?\n\nNo-one can deny that Sky Sports do a good job. But the fact remains that in order to receive the cricket, you have to pay twice over for the privilege (once to Sky, then extra for the Sports package). There is no reason why Sky cannot have the rights to other forms of cricket, One Day International and Twenty20 matches, and away test matches, not to mention domestic cricket. If the terrestrial stations cannot afford it, then the Government should provide financial support.",
