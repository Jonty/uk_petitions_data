            "background": "The jobcentre doesn't meet the needs of the unemployed and exists only to cater for the needs of the staff who happen to be predomenantely female. They offer no help beyond CV writing courses and spelling tests. The staff go out of their way to stop benefit at the slightest excuse, are incapable of providing accurate information and exhibit contempt for the unemployed. I call upon the Prime Minister to abolish the present system of jobcentres, allowing the out of work to make fortnightly declarations on the internet or by mobile phone. The money saved on wages electricity and mantenance could be used to increase the Jobseeker's allowance which is far too low and money from the sale of buildings could be used elsewhere.",
