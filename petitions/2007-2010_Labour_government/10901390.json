If I couldn't see her, what could she see?\n\nIt's about time the govt introduces a law where a minimum height is required to drive certain cars. It's very dangerous if drivers cannot see at all or through the gap between the middle and the top of the steering wheel.\n\nIf they do wish to drive such cars, the cars need to be adapted at the dealership",
