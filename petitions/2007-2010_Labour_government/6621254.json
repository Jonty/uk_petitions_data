            "background": "Biodiesel emits 78% less CO2 than mineral diesel; in a time when CO2 emissions are causing global warming there is still no allowance in the system vehicle taxation or road duty. \n\nVOCA stipulate that tax bands are differenciated by the vehicles fuel source and CO2 emissions - yet there is no facilty for biodiesel which meets EN14214 to be certified into this system in order to reward those who are doing what they can to reduce the impact of their motoring. \n\nWe would like to have biodiesel tax bands integrated into the extisting system for carbon management in road transport.",
