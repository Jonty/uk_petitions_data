            "background": "We are seriously concerned about Government\u2019s decision to repeal exemptions set out in the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, which mean charitable groups and other not-for-profit organisations are not required to obtain a music licence from PPL (Phonographic Performance LTD) if they wish to play recorded music.\n\nThe Government\u2019s own figures suggest this change will cost voluntary and community organisations up to \u00a320 million more a year. This is an incredible amount of money, which can only be met by funds earmarked for charitable purposes. \n\nThis is also likely to affect a broad array of community organisations: village halls, churches, care homes, charity shops, youth clubs, scouts and guides associations and bingo halls.\n\nWe call on the Government to maintain the current exemption.",
