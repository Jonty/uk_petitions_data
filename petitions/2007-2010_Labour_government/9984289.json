            "background": "If road fund licences were abolished and replaced with a slightly higher duty on fuel, this would mean that everybody who operates a vehicle which runs on petrol or diesel or LPG would pay towards the revenue and this would mean an end to people avoiding paying road fund licence fees; and in turn would reduce the need for fines and the paper work as well as the costs associated. This would be a much fairer system.",
