        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Just over three years ago the government  reversed a decision that would have allowed SIPP investment in residential property. Currently investment is allowed in commercial property such as offices and shops but not in residential.\n\nGiven the current difficulty in obtaining housing finance and the slump in the housing market a residential SIPP option may now be prudent. I am 50 years old and have a small pension fund of \u00a340,000 that will provide very little in the way of pension. This fund would better serve my needs if residential investment was allowed. Dear Mr Brown please reconsider this option as soon as possible.",
