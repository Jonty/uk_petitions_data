The U.K government is quick to bail out Banking establishment's to the tune of billions of pounds,well lets see them do the job that they are supposed to do and that is to look after the people who elected them.Its about time the politicians realized they are there to serve US! I say free heating for pensioners particularly in the winter months. No More pensioners freezing in there own homes!",
