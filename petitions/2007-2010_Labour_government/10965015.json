            "background": "Employment agencies are being used to circumvent hard earned employee's rights. They allow for unskilled workers to be used a chattels and discarded without legal redress. It is immoral for large companies to use agencies in this fashion. Tighter regulation will encourage companies to invest in employees as assets. The use of agencies by large companies is perpetuating an unskilled workforce, enriching undeserving intermediaries , and adversely affecting the lives of thousands of workers who are without any kind of financial security and few legal rights.",
