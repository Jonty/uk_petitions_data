Yet for many it remains un-identified or hidden, for fear of humiliation or a sign of weakness. \n \nAlongside the staggering figures that suggest 40% of the prison population are dyslexic, there are an over propionate amount of dyslexics in the unemployment, homeless and mental health statistics.\n \nOur text based education system puts dyslexics at a major disadvantage. The vast majority struggle at school with self esteem affected into adult life. Teaching style should match learning needs. We need multi-sensory teaching.\n \nWe the undersigned call on the Prime Minister to tackle the issue by introducing better screening and support in schools, colleges, job centres and prisons.\n \nThe new Disability Duty slogan that reads \u201cnothing for us without us\u201d needs to become reality. We request the Prime Minister to make certain that more dyslexics are involved in policy making and ensure that appropriate support services are put in place urgently.",
