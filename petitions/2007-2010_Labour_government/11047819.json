They could never afford to get a job that would pay their rent on these properties so why give them a luxury home. Child benefits should be limited to just 2 children and welfare given no greater than you could get if you earned the minimum wage.  Those who don't want to work should be re-located from London to Liverpool where rents are cheaper because they have plenty of empty homes.",
