            "background": "In most areas children under 16 pay half fare but once they turn 16 they have to pay full adult fare, whereas over 60s get free travel.  This puts a heavy burden on families to get their children to and from school college etc.  To encourage the use of public transport and to help poorer families and students please support this petition for free travel for all young people under 18.",
