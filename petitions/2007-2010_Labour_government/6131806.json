I strongly feel that British troops should come out of Iraq and Afghanistan?\n\nAs a new incumbent, Mr Brown, it is time to ASK and listen to the British public about the above issue.\n\nWe are not helping the situation and we are losing good young people. To keep faith with your promise when you took the job: Ask now before too many more are lost or scared for life.\n\nThe nationals of Iraq and Afghanistan to not want us in their countries.\n\nThis is the most fundemental issue of 'faith' in your Government, as far as I am concerned.\n\nBlair never listened!\n\nAlan Jones",
