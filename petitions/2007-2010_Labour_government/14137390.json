If you change it, You once again cut out the \"Fourth Service The British Merchant Navy\" Who lost 32,000 + Men & Women in WW11 alone. Sure have an Armed forces day but not June 27th, I and my members will support that all the way. Please support my Petition and thank you all in anticipation.\n John D Meadowcroft.",
