        "background": "Not necessarily financial.\nMale circumcision is unwanted, it is needless destruction of a helpless babies sexual organ.\nIn many, if not all cases, it was performed, without asking, and chance in the future to repair the damage that was done, both physically and mentally.\nIndeed, how many of those who had it done, would have chosen it, if they were  adults.\nParents do not have the right to give consent to surgically alter a baby, indeed, playing with sex organs is child abuse, so why should routine circumcision be different.\nThere have been petitions to ban this appalling practise, and not before time.\nHowever, what about the victims of this abuse?\nSo this petition calls to make available surgery for genital reconstruction available to all who ask for it.",
