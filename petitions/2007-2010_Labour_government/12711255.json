Further, any current MP no longer standing for re election should now only be paid at the national minimum wage and travel expenses only. it is also required that an independent body seek to establish a completely transparent and new set of guidelines so that any financial benefits to MP's are agreed and sanctioned by the electorate.  All Mp's currently found to have fraudulently claimed expenses should now be prosecuted and given the same treatment as the general public.",
