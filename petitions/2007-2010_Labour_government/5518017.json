In fact they are given the lowest possible Civil Service grade (admin Assistant).  As a world leader in Search and Rescue this is diabolical. Coastguard staff have been involved in many High profile incidents: Piper Aplha, Braer, Green Lily, Sea Empress, Morecambe Bay, Boscastle, Carlisle and more recently the floods in northern England. Last year Coastguards assisted 27,922 people.",
