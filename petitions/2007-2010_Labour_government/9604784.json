            "background": "If every nation worked WITHIN NATO frameworks and the bodies of the UN, rather than attempt possibly to manage national govt WITHOUT uni - lateral input, then victims would not so acutely feel the worst effects of crises.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the British govt, as a G8 member, to lead the way - what disaster areas need is not MORE people, but to contain the situation - possibly with technical experience. Please look at a proxy management team for co - ordinating these kinds of global efforts.\n\nThe UN has estimated of the 2.4 million people affected by the storm, about 42% had received some kind of emergency assistance. But of the two million people living in the 15 worst-affected townships, only 23% had been reached - this data is testimony to the need for an initative like the petitioner is suggesting.",
