            "background": "support workers and mental health support groups are essential to stabilising mentally ill to reduce admittance to psychiatric hospital. These are under threat from the nhs in order to reduce their budgets they are downgrading to careworkers who are not qualified in mental health. this will mean that mentally ill people will not receive the support they need in order to remain in the community. therefore the object will be defeated by these people being readmitted to hospital which will mean more expense to the nhs. surely it would be cheaper to keep the support workers where they are needed.",
