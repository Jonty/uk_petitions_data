            "background": "Providers of Gas and Electricity to the british consumer have formulated their pricing policy to the price of oil.This has resulted in the enormous increase in  energy costs which has spiralled out of control during the last twelve months. It is widely expected that oil prices will double the current price  to approximately $200 /barrel by december 2008. If the energy suppliers are allowed to continue their current policy, annual gas and electricity bills will exceed \u00a33000 for the average household.This energy crisis must be averted by direct action from the government",
