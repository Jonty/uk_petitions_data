            "background": "The Honours List is to recognise merit in  terms of achievement and serivce.\n\nAll too often these are handed out to people in the public eye - footballers, cricketers, actors and musicians.  All people who no doubt work hard, but are being paid and rewarded for doing a job they clearly love.\n\nThis year, someone in the public eye has been through such a traumatic time in the line of duty that he simply must be recognised in the next Honours List - that man is the BBC journalist Alan Johnston.\n\nA war correspondent's life is not an easy or a safe one, but they stick to their task in order to tell the tale of life for people in these incredibly difficult locations.  Alan Johnston's kidnapping has only highlighted and emphasised the dangers journalists face.\n\nThe conduct of both Alan Johnston and his family and friends has been exemplary both while he was in captivity and since his release, and I feel this is deserving of the country's recognition and appreciation in this way.",
