            "background": "In this time of massive inflation on retail food prices and despite British farmers claims that they are receiving very low financial returns for their produce, I suspect that the major supermarkets will still announce even larger profits this year. The major supermarkets method of calculating their published low retail price inflation is achieved by including items that are not necessary weekly purchases - I petition the Prime Minister to watch the situation and consider imposing a wind-fall tax on their profits if their \u2018food profit\u2019 is higher than the governments published inflation figure.",
