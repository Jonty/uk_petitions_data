            "background": "Service charges can amount to a large annual sum, paid to a managing agent for the upkeep of communal areas relating to a property. This makes them an important factor when considering affordability of a property.\n\nCurrently it is only law for service charges for a leasehold property to be included in the property HIP. This requirement is not in place for freehold properties.\n\nFurther, estate agents are not required by law to include information on service charges in the particulars for a property. Many don't even know what they are when asked.\n\nI would like the government to make it a legal requirement for service charge information to be included in both freehold and leasehold property's HIP and particulars.\n\nThis will enable potential buyers to make informed decisions about the affordability of a property before they pay for conveyancing, valuations and searches.",
