        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Ofcom has, today, imposed a fine of  GBP50,000.00 upon the BBC Licence Tax payer because of 'editorial mistakes' made during a live Blue Peter competition which went wrong.  'Editorial Mistakes' are made by editors, not by BBC Licence tax payers therefore Editors and NOT BBC Licence tax payers should pay this fine.  The population of this country becomes criminalised when it does not pay the BBC Licence Tax (even when it does not watch BBC transmissions (unless, of course, you are already a convicted criminal serving a sentence in one of our jails when you enjoy the benefit of watching television without having to pay the BBC Licence Tax - something which CANNOT be enjoyed by the innocent part of the population) and for the BBC Licence Tax payer to held liable for 'editorial mistakes' puts everybody in the BBC above the law because they will NEVER be held financially responsibility for the bad judgement or bad decisions which result in legal action against the BBC.  This cannot be allowed to continue.",
