            "background": "just a note,say to the camaroony and to the public,I DO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for my advisor and his foolishness has cost him his job,your questions should be,why a advisor speaking to one other person in e mail text about a matter that was never meant to go into the public domain-has lost his job whether it was fishing for ideas or not it was totally out of order but if any public person had been emailing his freind over ideas would he not wonder more about the person who got his private conversation out!!!! I will not apoligize for something i did not advocate and had no knowledge off,i feel sorry for the person who got this information out to ensure politics are weakened by words that ashould not be given subsiistence  like tittle tattle behind someones back it only becomes a issue when the tittle tattle is leaked and for what reason you may say thankyou people.",
