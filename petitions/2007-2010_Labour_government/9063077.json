            "background": "The future prosperity of the U.K. depends on new business start ups. Research has shown that new businesses started by college graduates have better than average growth prospects. \nIf graduates have debts of some \u00a320K from their university years, it is hardly going to encourage them to take risks. We are very concerned that this is deterring a lot of entrepreneurial graduates from going into business by themselves, thus preventing the establishment of wealth creating businesses.\nTherefore, we propose that all graduates who wish to start their own businesses should have all their student loans written off so that they are given an incentive to set up in business. We are confident that the cost of such a measure to the Treasury will be recovered several times over by the  enhanced economic growth that the establishment of more successful graduate businesses will generate.",
