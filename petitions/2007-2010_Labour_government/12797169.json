        "background": "The attack on the Gaza Strip by the Israelis and their continuing demands with the aim of eliminating Palestine highlights the need for Britain, one of the leading democracies in the world to stand up and help the Palestinians, who we owe a duty as one of our former colonies. We can not stand by and watch an aggressor abuse their power upon a poor demoralised country who have been abandoned by the United States. Although we should have acted when Israel invaded the Gaza Strip and took it upon themselves to destroy everything in sight, I have no doubt that the Foreign Secratary played a part in preventing the Prime Minister from doing so. He is unsuitable in his position and is biased with his beliefs and therefore should be removed by the PM. \nMilitary assistance should be provided to the Palestinians and the PM should warn Israel that if they take action against Palestine again they will face the full force of Her Majesties armed forces!!!!! To not do so would be going against everything that Britain stands for.",
