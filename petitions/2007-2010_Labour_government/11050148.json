        "background": "Eight years after the tragic death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9 there's another death of a child in the very same borough, Haringey, where Victoria died. Baby P was only 17 months old and died an horrific death after months of suffering torture from three people who were investigated more than SIXTY times. Yet, the baby was not removed from danger and died after living a very short and painful life.\nAnd Sharon Shoesmith, chair of Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board, who was responsible for the safety of 'at risk' children in Haringey refuses to take responsibility.\nHow many more deaths of innocent children will happen before something will be done? Sharon Shoesmith has to be removed from her position with immediate effect.",
