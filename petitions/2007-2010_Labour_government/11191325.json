            "background": "To make the offences relating to vehicles not being insured an offence of which you would automatically face some length of prison sentence to act as a stronger detterent for this offence. As a victim of an accident involving uninsured drivers we discovered that due to the high number of uninsured drivers currently on the roads the prices for all insured motorists are much higher than neccesary which is grossly unfair. These people are endangering others lives often fleeing from accidents for fear or being caught out. They should face a lifetime ban from driving and a spell in custody.",
