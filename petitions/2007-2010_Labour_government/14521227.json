            "background": "Current and planned sentance rules are allowing criminals(first and repeat offenders) to escape prison sentances. these rules only appear to have been put into place to help statistics appear better, i.e. we are now in the 7th year of falling crime, say todays goverment. I disagree, i believe that crimes have been recatigorised and statistics are being continually manipulated. I would like an independent review of how and why \"crime has fallen\" for so many years. I would also like to know why crime only seems to be taken seriously when it is committed by a public figure or by someone who has lived with out ever having any problems, yet repeat offenders are given every chance, because they have made poor decisions, i.e. drug dependence.  What happend to being accountable for your actions.",
