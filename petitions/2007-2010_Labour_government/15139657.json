We spend our taxes on keeping them alive when they have killed innocent people. New identities are given out to protect them, and a jail sentence for life isn't enough, their lives should be stopped just like of their victims.\n\nSome names just to mention:\nPeter Sutcliffe,\nIan Huntley and Maxine Carr\nPeter Tobin\nRobert Thompson & John Venables\nPeter Chapman\nSome of the murderers in the UK still currently alive after murdering innocent people.",
