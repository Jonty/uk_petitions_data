            "background": "When Jerusalem wasn\u2019t controlled by Israel (before 1967), Jews were denied access to the holiest place in Judaism, Jewish holy places were destroyed or desecrated, Jews were expelled from the city, and Christian population figures fell by more than half. Since Israel took control, Christians, Muslims and Jews have all been granted full religious and cultural freedom in Jerusalem, and Arabs living within Jerusalem\u2019s municipal boundaries are offered Israeli citizenship.\n\nThe Palestinian call for Jerusalem as their capital breaks with the established pattern in the Islamic world where holy cities are NOT capital cities (e.g. Riyadh in Saudi Arabia \u2013 not Mecca/Medina; Baghdad in Iraq \u2013 not Najaf; Tehran in Iran not Qom/Isfahan)\n\nIsrael has upheld its moral and ethical obligations to the people of the world and has earned the right to retain sovereignty over all of Jerusalem, according to the present boundaries. Israel's decision, as a free and democratic nation, to designate a united and undivided Jerusalem as its capital, should be respected and recognized by the entire international community.",
