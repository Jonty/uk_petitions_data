        "background": "DVLA are currently running an ad about driving bans and points lasting 11 years.\nThe ad refers to 'so many metres of facial hair', kilometres and so on. Stop trying the drip-drip' approach of metrication. We don't want it. If you continue with this approach the UK population will be a nation of numbskulls who can only divide or multiply by ten.\nMany so-called 'metric' countries use inches, psi, lb, and so on. The government should ignore EU edicts on metrication !\nBritish measurements are as accurate as foreign measurements.",
