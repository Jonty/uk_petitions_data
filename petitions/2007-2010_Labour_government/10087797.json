Stop trying the drip-drip' approach of metrication. We don't want it. If you continue with this approach the UK population will be a nation of numbskulls who can only divide or multiply by ten.\nMany so-called 'metric' countries use inches, psi, lb, and so on. The government should ignore EU edicts on metrication !\nBritish measurements are as accurate as foreign measurements.",
