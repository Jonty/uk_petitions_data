            "background": "The specialization of A-Levels limits a young persons opportunities. This petition calls for the replacing of A-levels with a more broader British Baccalaureat (BB) that would give students an opportunity to learn a greater number of subjects in less depth. By studying more topics the students widen their career chances and become more rounded individuals. It is positive to see that the baccalaureat (or bac for short) is already being considered by educationalists as a model for UK schools and I hope this will not be forgotten on the back burner. The baccalaureat is already widely used in France and respected around the world.",
