        "action": "put up the Winter Fuel Payment paid to over 60yr-olds to reflect increased costs of fuels. After all, this money was judged as required by older people in order for them to keep warm and eat proper cooked meals? We are grateful for this help, but the amount is way out of date.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Surely the Government must be aware that the costs to householders of fuels for heating and cooking have increased vastly in recent years.\nThis would, surely, indicate that the \u00a3200.00 existing Winter Fuel Payment is now only worth \u00a3100.00max in comparison to the value of it when it was first introduced. \nThere are, probably, a large number of recipients of this out-dated, though welcome, payment who would agree.\nThe sooner the amount is increased in line with current costs of fuels, the better.",
