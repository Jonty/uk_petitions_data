No Spanish citizen under retirement age who has been resident in the UK for two years or more should receive ANY (including emergency treatment) medical treatment free of charge, which is the situation which obtains in Spain with regard to UK citizens who are under retirement age and who have lived there for two years or more",

It is not right, nor is it anything to do with EU law, that Spanish citizens living in the UK should be treated differently, as they (along with ALL OTHER FOREIGNERS) are currently, whereby they ALL receive treatment free on the NHS, which is paid for by people like me, someone who would NOT be entitled to free treatment if I was to go to their country!",
