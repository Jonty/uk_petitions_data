            "background": "We live in a country where Farmers work out of duty and not so much on financial gain. Does anyone realise that bottled water in most stores costs more than milk regardless of brand, fat content or type. You are more likely to spend more on purchasing a branded cereal and leave the choice of milk to chance. The 1st of March would see an appreciation of the white stuff, education of it's nutritional value and a drive to keep our industry strong in Europe. We owe it to Dairy Farmers in the UK.",
