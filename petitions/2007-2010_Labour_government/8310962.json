It would learn the criminal self respect a trade and discipline. this should overall help in the reduction of the crime rates and also be used as a deterrent for peoples to commit the crime in the first place.\nAlso ensuring they receive payment below or in par with basic minimum pay and the difference could then be used for improvements to the justice system and compensation for third parties.",
