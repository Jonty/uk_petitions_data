Although the Speaker does her utmost to keep order, the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to examine the timing of interspersions, fair play in parliament and look at how govt communicates with the public - televising debates was in my view an advance, holding those who represent us to account, but what about adding sub titles ? I think it makes grown up professional people look silly party politicians rather than statesmen and there is no place in parliamentary democracy for public humiliation, ridicule and bad manners.",
