Ministers have admitted privately that they are preparing to evacuate settlements on the east coast within the next 30 years because it is not \"cost effective\" to save them.\n\nAll this while Holland is defending every square inch we are intending to give up large acreage of land which we desperately need for food security as well as really significant numbers of houses. This can not be allowed",
