            "background": "Previous Governments have baulked at the cost of installing the American system, used effectively on the USA/Mexican Border in which lorries park on a sound pad for 3 minutes and listening devices pick up the faintest heartbeat (even that of a mouse), in order to irradicate the problem of people smuggling and illegal immigration, instead opting for the cheap option of threatening lorry drivers with fines, an option which has clearly not worked, given the amount of illegal immigrants currently forecast to be in this country.\nIt is now evident that this system would have paid dividends in combating this plague of illegal immegration and threat to our national security. \nI urge the Prime Minister to install this system on major ports without delay.",
