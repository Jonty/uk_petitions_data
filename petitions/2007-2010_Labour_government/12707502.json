            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\nFor many years I have been a member of the Labour Party [membership card no. B005155 Labour International] and have been paying direct debit.\n I  was advised that I had to have my British passport[109207899] cancelled. Ridiculous as it may seem as a citizen of Britain has an inalienable right [unable to be taken away or given away]\n This was shocking as I have never used it for travel to or from Kenya upon advise from authorities in the UK. \nI was further advised that Parliament has decreed that persons such as me [born and lived in the UK of solid English stock have to pay UK pounds 200 plus for an abode stamp to be issued so I can visit my home in Manchester. Everyone in the [UK and Abroad] whom I have contacted agree with me that this is an insult and disgraceful. \nI find that I can no longer support the Labour  Party.  I doubt very much that Labour will survive unless it has a through overhaul . Labour should withdraw support of all those MPs who have besmirched the good name of the Party.\nI finally ask Prime Minister , why are Britons who live Abroad so poorly treated by their Government ?\nSincerely\nRoy Lawrence.",
