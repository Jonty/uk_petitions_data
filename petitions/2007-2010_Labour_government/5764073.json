            "background": "With the new European treaty taking legal precedence over even more aspects of British law it is time for the people of the UK to have a vote. The Prime Minister was elected on a manifesto that promised a referendum on the planned European charter yet now insists that we have not got the right of a free vote. The new treaty is a siamese twin of the old one, with just a few names changed. The outright lies of the government ( and the BBC ) cannot convey the anger felt by many in this country and we demand that the Prime Minister stick to the pledge in the party manifesto.",
