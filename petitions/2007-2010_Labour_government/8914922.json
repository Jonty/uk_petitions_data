I believe all cyclists should have to undergo training, pass a test, pay a small tax (\u00a310 possibly, in comparison to what cars pay, it's nothing), then if they want cycle paths, that can pay for them, but they also know that if they don't obey the laws of the road they will also be prosecuted. Too many run red lights, cycle dangerously on both pavements and roads. If you want your space, and your safety, you should pay for it as every other road user has to.",
