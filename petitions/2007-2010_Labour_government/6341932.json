        "action": "introduce free bus travel for all children of school age everywhere in the UK and not just in London.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "During the school holidays there is a very noticable reduction in the volume of traffic during the morning and afternoon \"rush hour\". Parents not having to take their children to school is the reason for this.\n\nThe number of cars one sees dropping off and picking up children from outside the school gates is increasing every year. With so many cars vying for non-existent parking places our children are put at risk from accident, and pollution from so many vehicles puts our children's health at risk also.\n\nIf bus travel for all children of school age was introduced nationwide this would reduce the number of cars on our roads at peak times and at the same time reduce the amount of pollution we all have to breathe. Not only our children would benefit but the environment also.\n\nSingle parents and families on low income would benefit financially, as it can cost more than \u00a35.00 per child per week to travel to school by bus at present.\n\nSo Prime Minister we ask you to help our children, low income families and the environment by supporting the petition.",
