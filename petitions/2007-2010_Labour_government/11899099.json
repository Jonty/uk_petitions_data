If a doctor or lawyer fails to act in an ethical fashion as well as the intertests of his client he can be punished.\nThe people at the centre of our near economic collapse, the bankers and heads of city institutions including the FSA have not had to answer sufficiently for their actions. I propose that rather than (In Sir Fred's case) just asking for pensions to be sacrificed, we seek criminal charges of wreckless endangerment and negligence. Their actions will result in deaths and suffering caused by the stress, poverty and anguish of this time - why should they get away with it when any other public servant would not?",
