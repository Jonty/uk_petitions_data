        "background": "As someone of a younger generation i feel that it is completely unfair that we should be left to sort out the global warming and climate change problems that the generation before us have left behind in ignorance.\nI feel that a way in which we can help contribute to the conservation of the planet is that we can use it's own destructive power to help power our needs.\nAs the threat from super volcanoes and earthquakes loom, instead of just ducking for cover we could create energy captures that would be able to channel the massive amounts energy that will be release when these situations occur and to transform it into safe and ecofriendly energy that would be able to fuel our needs during the fallouts of these cataclismic events. Using the Earth's own destructive power we could actually save it from a plight that we have created.",
