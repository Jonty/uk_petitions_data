        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This is a low cost improvement to reduce the obvious congestion present every morning and evening which adds 1 hour to the commuter's typical working day as well as holding up commercial vehicles which adds significant costs to the economy. Now that running on the hard shoulder has been proven as an effective and safe method of reducing traffic congestion it should be put into effect on this stretch of road because about one third of the traffic joins the A1(M)at Stevenage going south in the morning and leaves the A1(M) going north at night there is no risk of the congestion simply moving further north or south.",
