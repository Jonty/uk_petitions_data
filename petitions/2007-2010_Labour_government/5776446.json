        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sheesha, or hookah, as it's also known is a water-based version of smoking. For mainly Asians and Arabs, smoking a sheesha whilst socializing is a heavy cultural pastime.\n\nWith the aid of this petition we aim to create an exception, allowing sheesha smokers to be allowed to smoke in these specialized houses. The legislation ruins businesses that work solely to provide sheesha and host customers in a specialized smoking environment. It does not affect the general public in anyway, and people who come to Sheesha lounges understand that there will be smoke there. We ask that sheesha is legalized in a public places as it has no effect on anyone else if the businesses were to run as per normal, if anything it would help thousands of businesses all around the United Kingdom.",
