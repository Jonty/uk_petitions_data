Maintain the ban on the LTTE\n2. Ensure that Members of Parliament are not supporting pro- LTTE groups and to challenge them if they are doing so.\n3. Actively listen to the views of more moderate British Sri-Lankan groups who are promoting peace across all communities in Sri-Lanka. We often feel the establishment is not listening to other Sri-Lankans in the UK who oppose the LTTE\n4. Oppose the creation of a seperate Tamil Eeelam state in Sri-Lanka based on ethnic nationalism.\n5. Support the creation of a federal system in Sri-Lanka based on multiculturalism and community cohesion",
