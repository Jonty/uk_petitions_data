Actively listen to the views of more moderate British Sri-Lankan groups who are promoting peace across all communities in Sri-Lanka.

Oppose the creation of a seperate Tamil Eeelam state in Sri-Lanka based on ethnic nationalism.\n5. Support the creation of a federal system in Sri-Lanka based on multiculturalism and community cohesion",
