            "background": "Ospreys supporters hold Tommy Bowe in extremely high regard and he has become a great favourite. By staying in Wales he will be acting as a valuable ambassador for Ireland (and Northern Ireland) and help to promote better understanding and friendship between the two countries. While at the team he has developed into a world-class player and by staying he would have the opportunity to work with one of the most innovative attacking coaches in world rugby and a squad with a number of other outstanding players, many of whom were recently also fellow Lions tourists. He has become an indispensable player and it would be a huge disappointment to Ospreys supporters if he were to leave. We urge the Prime Minister, a rugby fan, to do everything he can to ensure that Tommy Bowe stays at the Ospreys.",
