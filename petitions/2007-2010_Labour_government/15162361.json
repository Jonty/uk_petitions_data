We have wrote letters to our local PCT and they have refused to give us funding even though we appealed this decision and then was still refused, but when I went to a different hospital in the area they said I could have the funding from the NHS but I would have to move into the area. which confussed me as it seams to be  \u2018post code lottery\u2019 we feel we have been treated very unfairly and are rather upset as without  IVF  we are unable to have a child of our own that we hope for.",
