            "background": "We do not trust this company to carry out the role with the required level integrity needed & we believe the confidential information given for the 2011 census will be uploaded to FBI,CIA and other \"Septic\" databases. The Canadian Govt. were forced to cancel Lockheed Martin, despite being its chosen operator, because Canadians were prepared to boycott the census entirely rather than submit to Lockheed Martin's key data processing. Canadians were quick to realise that a \"trojan horse\" could be covertly written into the software allowing a subsequent illegal upload to USA Government databases.",
