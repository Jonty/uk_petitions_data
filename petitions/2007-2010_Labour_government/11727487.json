            "background": "I would like to make it known that to live near a Racing Circuit is likely to be on occasion noisy due to the very nature of the Circuit. To complain or claim damages for that noise level is not only ridiculous it is incredible that the complaint was even made let alone upheld in a court of law. I would like it to be made legal that you cannot complain about the noise level from a racing circuit when the circuit is in use. If it is that detrimental to your health then you should move a more suitable distance from the circuit. It is no different to if you live near a farm you live with the smell...If you live near a circuit you live with the noise....",
