Four of cousins are prop forwards\n2. How big my big brother is\n3. Another two are SAS trained\n4. Another big big brother is in newspapers\n5. How pissed off I am about the management of one of my PhD assignments, media attention and lack of copyright law and confidentiality that your administration has paid \n6. How pissed off I am at the harrassment from Lloyds I am receiving \n7. How little confidence I have in Cheshire Constabulary response to my complaints of death threats against my life  \n8. Should any of this go to court, I shall probably have some of the best legal representation in Europe\n\nDo you wish to settle this out of court ?",
