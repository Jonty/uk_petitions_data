            "background": "Northampton Borough Council have recently increased Hackney carriage & Private hire licensing fees by 13.33% for vehicles, by 13.7% for drivers and by up to 400% for Private hire operators, This at a time when inflation stands at -1.2%APR.\nAll of this has been adopted without the support of verifiable evidence of increased costs from a designated Taxi accounting system and as such cannot satisfy sections 53 & 70 of the miscellaneous provisions of the 1976 Local Government Act.\nIn essence the fees that the 1976 Act allows are hypothecated in nature and as such must be used for the purposes specified in the Act, in most councils this is not the case with an endemic \"Ultra Vires\" atitude towards the legality of their delegated powers being the norm. It is time for reform of these powers in the interest of democracy.",
