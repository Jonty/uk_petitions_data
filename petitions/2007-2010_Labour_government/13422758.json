            "background": "Let us 'Make the punishment fit the crime' where malicious accusations are exposed. The penalty for making or wilfully supporting a malicious accusation should be no less than the penalty the victim would have suffered.\n\nMalicious accusations are becoming more and more frequent. They have a damaging effect not only on the lives of the victims of malice, but on Law and Order in general, by making it much harder to detect the one genuine crime out of the numerous false charges.  \n\nA key area of concern, it appears that special legal dispensations are being granted to persons in 'vulnerable' categories such as psychiatric patients, the disabled, children, the aged, etc. to make accusations without any proper evidence. \n\nEven when malice is exposed, the penalties are laughable -\u00a380 for a false rape charge.\n\nThere is also concern over 'crusader' officials who wilfully support malicious accusations. (e.g. Orkney 'Satanic rituals' scandal) Such officials are often immune to prosecution.\n\nLet's change this situation.",
