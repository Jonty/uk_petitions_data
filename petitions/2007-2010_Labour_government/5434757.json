        "background": "I wish to raise this petition for the government to make it illegal for companies such as Sky TV to charge customers a \u00a34 monthly administration charge if you do not wish to pay by Direct Debit. Some people do not have a bank/building society account or they either dont have a direct debit facility on thier account, i believe the charge to be unfair and is wholly un-jusitified. This has become law in Southern Ireland and i would like the UK Government to consider making it illegal.",
