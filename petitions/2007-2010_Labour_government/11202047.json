Each design communicated a  simple message in a bold format which would allay uncertainty but the one with the slogan \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" was held back, only to be issued in a time of acute crisis and in fact was never fully published. \n\nIts bold design and exhortation to maintain \"phlegm and fortitude\" in the face of adversity under the watchful eye of the crown resonates strongly in our current troubled times.\n\nSurely it is time for GB our current PM to take on the mantle of WC, our great wartime leader, and battle across the fields of financial fire to a safer harbour, and to do so armed with an appropriate mantra?\n\nThere can be no better candidate for the saying which will guide the nation than \"Keep Calm and Carry On\".",
