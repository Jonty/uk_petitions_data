            "background": "Current plans to abolish happy hour in our pubs and ban alcohol promotions in supermarkets will do nothing to combat binge drinking in this country. \n\nBanning cheap alcohol will not stop people from drinking, it will simply decrease the amount of money they have to spend on other things, worsening the effects of the current economic climate on everyday citizens. In this time when many businesses are going under, this legislation could have a massive detrimental effect on our pubs, causing many establishments at the heart of society to close.\n\nThis legislation is just another attempt to make some quick money and the fact that it completely contradicts 24 hour licensing proves that this government is not interested in the nations health or social welfare.",
