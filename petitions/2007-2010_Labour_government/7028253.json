It has been open about its nuclear programme. It has a right to develop a nuclear programme. Iran has repeatedly said they are not developing nuclear weapons.\n\nIt is time that the UK stopped following the demented policies of the Bush/Cheney regime which has lead to a debacle in Iraq that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands and caused millions to be displaced.\n\nThe world needs peace and the current US regime totally corrupt and engaged in war for the sake of war and profits for big business . .. Britain has to stand up and say NO to the US!",
