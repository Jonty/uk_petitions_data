            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Some recent cases reported in the press regarding incursions on to the operational railway resulting in injury, death, or otherwise severe disruption and damage to the railway, we petition the Prime Minister to increase the minimum penalties for both intentional and unintentional incursions on to the railway, where it can be proven that a railway crossing was working correctly, or the instructions on how to cross are not adhered to, or the person(s) accessed the railway in a manner other than at an authorised point.\n\nWith the railways at their busiest in 40 years, the disruption caused by an incursion resulting in a collision or near miss has the potential to disrupt thousands of travellers with an immediate cost to the economy. Furthermore, recent cases where incursions have resulted in collisions with trains, the penalties applied by magistrates/judges have been disproportionately lenient in comparison to other motoring offences and further disproportionate to the damage and disruption caused to infrastructure and passengers.",
