Training is having to be called off, units are having to be scrapped and vital purchases delayed.  The Army cannot meet its supply needs, the RAF is having to scrap active squadrons and the Navy is trying to operate with less than the minimum number of ships needed for operations - and still more cuts are demanded.  This must stop.",
