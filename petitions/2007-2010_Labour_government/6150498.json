According to some reports they were drunk - yes, our country is the only in Europe where it's cool to be drunk as a teenager. Even some start as young as 7/8. Innocent people are becoming the victims of many crimes due to teenagers walking round in packs and some are afraid to leave there house. Prime Minister, you think you are doing enough but clearly there is a big problem that needs tackling.",
