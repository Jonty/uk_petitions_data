            "background": "We are writing to you to protest the proposed Sale of the New Legion Club in Cheadle Hulme. \nIt beggars belief that an active, vibrant and profitable club, which in tandem with the local Branch supports and assists the ex-service community in the local area, is marked for sale. \nIt seems to us that with a club membership of some 525, an increase of 133 on the previous year, the RBL benefits from membership fees of \u00a36,825 per annum the majority of which, I suggest, will be lost if the club is sold. Multiply this by the other 8 clubs and that means the Legion will have to expend further effort and more importantly finances into fund raising to make up the shortfall in income from this short-sighted measure.The club has an increasing membership, is profitable and has in place health and well being events that the members can participate in.",
