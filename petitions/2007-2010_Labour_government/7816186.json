            "background": "External internet access to their management information system (MIS) should be rejected on the following grounds; the expenditure on such a system would be better spent on the education of students not replicating internal systems that already exist. Schools already send 1 statutory report to parents per annum and use modern communication methods such as the telephone when issues arise thus the system is unnecessary. Parents will have to be educated into the finer details of each schools personalised assessment system if it is to allow better communication with increased secondary costs. Training parents and educating them to follow data protection law and maintain updated strong passwords requires substantial additional resources and will incur significant cost. The hard to get parents are precisely that because they choose not to engage with school.  Creating an electronic way to communicate will not change this situation.  Discerning and concerned parents contact the school directly and arrange for face to face contact this will not change.",
