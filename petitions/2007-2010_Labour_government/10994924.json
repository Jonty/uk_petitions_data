        "background": "THE seven deaths on the M6 motorway in  South Cheshire, including all six members  of the Statham family, have shocked  everyone.  The Crewe Chronicle is urging our readers to  back our campaign for stronger safety  measures. It is now obvious to everyone that  something needs to be done about the  state of the M6 motorway in this area. At  busy times it is almost overwhelmed by  the sheer volume of traffic and serious  accidents are becoming more and more  frequent.\nThe widening of the M6 or the building of an alternative  road would, of course, entail massive expenditure and result in protests. But surely the authorities could  come up with some improvement? Rolling  speed limits like they have on the M25 are  one example already suggested by our  readers.\nWhat we do not want to see is a repeat of  the situation we had with the A530  Middlewich Road where it took a steadily  mounting death toll before significant  action was taken.",
