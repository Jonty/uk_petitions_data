            "background": "Jack Tweed attacked a 16 year old boy with a golf club. While on bail for this charge, he continued to break the law and attacked a taxi driver. His curfew was lifted so that he could marry Big Brother \"Celebrity\" Jade Goody which was already something that no other criminal in this country gets a chance of. To then lower his custodial sentence due to \"personal circumstances\" is taking abuse of Mr Tweed's public status too far.",
