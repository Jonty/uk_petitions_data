        "background": "We live in a country that is rapidly becoming a nanny state. The government is intervening more and more in family life. Whilst recognising that the government has a role to play in keeping law and order and protecting children from abuse, I respectfully petition that parents maintain their right to home educate their children if they so desire. Home education can offer children the opportunity to learn on a low student to teacher ratio and enable them to learn at their own pace rather than being forced to keep up with a class of 25+ students. Home education also provides a secure environment for children to learn as well as encouraging a strong empahsis on family values.",
