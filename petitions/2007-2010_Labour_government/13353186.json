            "background": "The world's climate scientists are warning that in our lifetimes, there could be five degrees of warming. Such a change would make our planet uninhabitable for the 6 billion people now populating our world.  Very few of us would be able to survive.  This December, there is a chance for us to spare ourselves this fate.  This petition urges the Prime Minister to ensure that in Copenhagen, when creating a replacement for the Kyoto Treaty, the world resolves to make substantial and binding cuts to keep our global ecosystem from collapse.  The EU Market mechanism of carbon trading, and so many other initiatives, have proven to be missed opportunities.  Copenhagen could well be our last chance, a final opportunity, NOT to be missed.  So please, Make Copenhagen Count.",
