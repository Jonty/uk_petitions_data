Burglars can check whether the items in your back garden are worth stealing and the people and children living in the house may have been photographed while in their garden or on a balcony and this will be displayed on the Internet.  \n\nGoogle is now starting to photograph private houses from street level for display on the Internet. This will show whether there is a burglar alarm, whether the car parked outside is worth stealing and many more people and children will be photographed going about their day-to-day business.  They could even be photographed through the windows while inside their own homes and this will be published on the Internet.\n\nThe government should stop Google from photographing the streets and ban these sites as they will be a joy to criminals and will seriously affect people's right to privacy in their own homes.",
