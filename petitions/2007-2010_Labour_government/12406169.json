            "background": "Thousands of UK holiday-home owners face losing a range of tax benefits under changes announced in the Budget 2009.\n \nFrom April 2010, holiday home owners will no longer be able to write off \"trading\" losses from holiday homes against their tax bill.\n \nCapital allowances and capital gains benefits that treat holiday homes as small businesses will also go.\n \nMany owners based retirement plans on the current tax rules for holiday homes.\n\nMy family was buying a holiday home in the Peak District until we heard about these changes. We were to employ local builders, joiners, plumbers etc. and spend tens of thousands of pounds to improve and furnish the property. Holiday makers would have spent money in the local economy.\n \nThe tax benefits would have provided a safety net had we ran into problems. Now the venture is too risky and we are pulling out of the purchase. \n\nThe memory of the time and fees we have lost will still be raw when the time comes next to cast our vote.",
