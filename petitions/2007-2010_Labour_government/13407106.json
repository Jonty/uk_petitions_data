Both of these principles have been undermined by the failure of the Attorney-General to resign following her breach of the law whilst in office, and the consequential breach of three of the Principles of Public Life \u2013 integrity, accountability and leadership.  The Prime Minister must request the resignation of Baroness Scotland in order to maintain the integrity of the office of Attorney-General and to maintain public trust in the law.",
