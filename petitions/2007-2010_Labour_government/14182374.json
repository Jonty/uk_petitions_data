Labour wont hold the referendum on their own because they of all parties have wreaped most of the benefits, plenty of examples of this are in the results of the past general elections, and the fact that Labour did not deliver on the promise of the referendum in 1997 shows their attitude that they are more comfortable in this flawed system",
