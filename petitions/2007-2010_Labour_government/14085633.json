            "background": "We believe that the practice of Police Officers hiding behind bushes or on bridges above roads etc is unfair and, especially with the latter, there can often be no way for the driver to confirm the speed he or she was driving (by seeing the read-out on the 'Speed Gun') before being issued with a fine. This requires the driver to take the Officer's 'word for it' which is unfair and goes against their Human Rights. At the least, any evidence should be supplied to the driver before a fixed penalty notice is issued and enforced. We believe that Traffic Police should be a visible deterrent, not a hidden punishment and finance gathering system.",
