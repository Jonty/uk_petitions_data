HELLLOOOO! has no-one thought that maybe we should set up an arrangement with the afgan government to buy the poppies? We get morphine, afgan farmers get cash, the drug barons are cut out in one fell swoop and the distribution of this stuff is controlled. Solves the morphine shortage (we could even earn some cash for the treasury), sorts out afgansitan and helps to squish the heroin problem across the world.",
