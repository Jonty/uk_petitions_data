            "background": "Why do we have Fireworks every night from Oct to New Year? No objections to 5th Nov or the nearest Saturday Night but why every night for months?  Why can I buy Gunpowder in a Sweetshop but have to answer 20 questions if I want to buy a Headache Tablet even though I'm 50+?  Why do Pets have to be scared out of their wits every night so idiots can be anti-social?  \n\nThere is a deadline of 11pm, \"Rubbish\" it can't be enforced, if you contact the police they have no chance of catching anyone, sound travels too far! We have had Fireworks going off till 1:30am yet again! They started 28th Oct, God knows when they will stop, they even let them off during the day presumably just for the noise!  \n\nWhere are the now \"Infamous\" Health & Safety, instead of banning morons with Gunpowder running amok till 1:30am, they ban a 5 year old from running with an egg on a spoon or playing conker's! Madness. \n\nThere are times, when I can't hear my TV for earsplitting bangs, when I really, really, wish Guy Fawkes had succeeded!\n\nI despair of Politicians doing anything sensible anymore - lets see if we can force them to prove me wrong. Please sign this petition & prove we still care about animals & peace / quiet.",
