        "background": "Amy is 15-years-old and lives in Wirral \nAmy \u201cmight\u201d have a rare strain of  cockayne Syndrome \nAmy is going to die young.\nNot just yet, though.\nThe likely first step is that Amy will first go blind. \nAmy will lose her ability to walk.\nAfter that, Amy\u2019s limited forms of communication will cease.\n Amy won\u2019t be able to breathe on her own\nThe UK\u2019s National Health Service couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t help Amy, and  mum Jayne approached her local newspaper, to see if they could help her to raise money to send Amy to the U.S.A\nThe results were  dramatic Amy has received physiotherapy and drug treatment;  \nher speech has improved incredibly. She stands, still slightly stooped, but so much less than before\nShe can walk unaided for longer.\nAnd she can bring her own food to her mouth with cutlery, a simple, but a near impossibility before doctors in Boston put her on a course of tablets normally taken by sufferers of Parkinson\u2019s disease\nFor Amy - and for the countless other children who also need help now and for those who will come after her.LET AMY & THESE CHILDREN GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED,THAT IS THEIR RIGHT",
