She stands, still slightly stooped, but so much less than before\nShe can walk unaided for longer.\nAnd she can bring her own food to her mouth with cutlery, a simple, but a near impossibility before doctors in Boston put her on a course of tablets normally taken by sufferers of Parkinson\u2019s disease\nFor Amy - and for the countless other children who also need help now and for those who will come after her.LET AMY & THESE CHILDREN GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED,THAT IS THEIR RIGHT",
