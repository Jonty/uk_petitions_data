        "background": "The suggestion that Sivertown be re-named \"Banglatown\" has generated much interest, often of a quite toxic and discriminating nature.  Might one, with the greatest of respect to all toxic parties, suggest - and as it is Liverpool's Year of Culture and one which celebrates all port-side culture - that \"New Guinea Lascarton\" might just strike a note with all contenders - and justly allow London in 2012 to demonstrate its ability to embrace foreigners?",
