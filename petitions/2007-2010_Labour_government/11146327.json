            "background": "To put money back into the economy & make us better off, lower the taxes, keep them low by not having to fund MP's lavish lifestyles. Make them spend there own money like us lower earning people have to do.  If they need to be in a certain area they should find there own way by either paying there own travel expenses to work or move closer (having only one home) buying it themselves, like the average hard working man/woman has to do.  Why should we (the average/below average paid worker) have to struggle when they sit pretty on a very good wage & have just about everything paid for them.\nWe would have more money if it was stopped.",
