        "background": "Surveys suggest that the public supports animal research providing a)it leads to improvements in human health, b)non-animal technologies are unavailable, c)it is not duplicated unnecessarily, d)it is not done for trivial reasons, e)it cannot be ethically performed in humans and f)suffering of laboratory animals is minimised. Animal experiments have been associated with important advances in medicine. However, uncertainties remain about their predictive value for human health and recent research has found serious inadequacies, both in the design and performance of animal studies. This petition calls for revisions to ensure that evidence-based research methods and training are implemented with the aim of fulfilling the conditions the public place on it\u2019s acceptance of animal experiments in a transparent and accountable manner. The experimental designs should use concealed random allocation, blinding and adequate sample sizes and systematic reviews should be performed to reduce bias and address questions about validity, alternatives and confounding variables e.g. genetics, species differences, feeding, housing and handling in the laboratory.",
