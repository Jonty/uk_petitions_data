How can they possibly begin to understand the problems and challenges that private businesses face, and propose policies which affect such, sometimes in a detrimental way? e.g. the recent Equality Bill.  Someone who has worked in the private sector for a good number of years will have a much better understanding of the problems and challenges that businesses face on a daily basis, which would in a sense serve as a reality check.",
