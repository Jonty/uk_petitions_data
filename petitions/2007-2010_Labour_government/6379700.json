        "background": "It is becoming apparent that Unit PRI's are being forced to close and the tender being offered out to civilian businesses.  This is reducing the quality of equipment on offer to individuals and being forced to pay higher prices. Where the profits are then reduced for the Unit to fund adventure training, sports eqpt etc. Please review this petition to enable the Forces, placed under such stressful times, to buy high quality eqpt at a fair price and benefit in the long term in return.",
