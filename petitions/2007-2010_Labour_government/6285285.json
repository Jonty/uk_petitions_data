        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At the moment, CCTV cameras intended to deter crime - such as those found over ATM machines, on public transport, outside nightclubs etc - vary in the quality and type of picture they are able to record and produce. These pictures can range from being of low resolution and in black and white, to a much higher resolution and in colour.\n\nI propose that a standard be set out in order that all CCTV cameras used in the examples above conform to a set of guidelines. These would be, for example:\n\n-  That all CCTV cameras are of a high enough resolution so that they are capable of clearly recording facial features from a standardized distance. \n\n- That all CCTV cameras record in full colour.\n\n- That all CCTV cameras operate at standardized frame rates.\n\nThese guidelines would apply foremost to larger chain shops, supermarkets, etc which would be able to afford such CCTV equipment, rather than smaller independent shops.\n\nI believe these steps are necessary in the prevention of crime and in further successfully identifying criminals when and where crime does happen.",
