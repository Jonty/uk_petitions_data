            "background": "We, the undersigned, call on HM Government, to remove the word \u201cchattel\u201d when describing these homes.  Council Tax is charged at the same rate as brick and mortar properties and mobile/park homes/caravans along with the land on which they are sited, are considered permanent for this purpose. This is referred to in  S.115 of the General Rate Act 1967. This contradicts the term \u201cchattel\u201d where the home can be towed away within half an hour, according to the Caravans Act (1967).  This currently affects thousands of citizens in this country thus creating a second-class group of decent, law-abiding people, by denying them the right to live their lives in peace and tranquillity as laid down in the Mobile Homes Act.",
