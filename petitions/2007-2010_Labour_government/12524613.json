        "background": "When its Easter, Christmas and any other bank holiday weekend, the railways are always having maintainance on them which means either a skeleton service or no train service at all, but having a coach service instead.\n\nI think its wrong for them to do work on these times of year as people tend to use them more to visit their families and loved ones as they can visit them using no or a days annual leave.\n\nI think its best for the rail companies to do maintainance work during the night or at less busy periods of the year.",
