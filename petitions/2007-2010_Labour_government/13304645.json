Do you not realise for example, the more you attempt to target this so called binge drinking, the more you are encouraging it. It's like telling a child they can't do something. They will, whatever you say! You are basically being your own worst enemy. Stop telling us what we can and cannot do, you are waisting a fortune of our own money trying to tell us what to do and we do not want to hear it. When will you start doing what we want (which might come as a suprise to you as you were elected to do our bidding, not whatever you think you should do).",
