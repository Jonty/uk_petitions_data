        "background": "Why do I never get a reply to my question about the sale of vehicles in this country that can exceed the speed limit? If the government and local councils are so commited to anti speeding legislation why is it still possible to buy a vehicle in this country that is capable of 250mph? Most vehicles on sale in the world now rely on electronic controls where it would be very easy to limit a vehicles speed to the country of sale. I think that the governments reluctance to take advantage of this is tantamount to entrapment! When public ownership of guns became a problem they legislated against it why haven't they done the same with vehicles??? They need the speeding fines to balance the books!!!",
