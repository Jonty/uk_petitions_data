            "background": "Baroness Uddin is yet another peer who feels no shame in lying about her main residence to grab a huge sum of money from us, the tax payers. In designating her main residence as a flat she patently doesn't live in, she's conned us out of over \u00a3100,000. This brings the House of Lords into further disrepute, and she should be stripped of her honour forthwith.",
