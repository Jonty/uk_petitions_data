        "background": "The people pushing for an A* grade are not students - and haven't been in decades.\n\nThese people simply do not realise how stressful exams currently are. Plus only 25% of candidates receive A grades - meaning that 75% will be further alienated if an A* grade was bought into play (including another 15-20% of people who would get A grades but not A* grades).\n\nAn A* grade would simply demoralise students, and inject even more stress into education (and subsequently, society).",
