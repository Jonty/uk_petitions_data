Plus only 25% of candidates receive A grades - meaning that 75% will be further alienated if an A* grade was bought into play (including another 15-20% of people who would get A grades but not A* grades).\n\nAn A* grade would simply demoralise students, and inject even more stress into education (and subsequently, society).",
