            "background": "Please can you make it illegal to drive down the centre or outside lane for no reason other than to overtake. It is a known fact that most road rage is caused by somebody driving down the middle lane with the inside lane clear. \n\nIf you was to stay in the inside lane and undertake them and a cop was to see you do it guess who would be pulled over and done for dangerous driving.\n\nwhy should we cut across three lanes to overtake when they are clearly in the wrong. even if you could put signs up saying \"keep left unless overtaking\" it should make a difference. thank you Nick Morrey",
