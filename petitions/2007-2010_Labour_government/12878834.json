            "background": "British Nationals (Overseas) used to enjoy landing visa to the United Arab Emirates, but this arrangement was suddenly cancelled by the UAE in 2002. Currently only full British citizens have the visa-free access.\n\nMany Hong Kong people, especially architects and engineers, work in Dubai. Dubai is also a tourist attraction for HK people.\n\nTherefore, many BN(O) holders are forced to apply for other passports. The withdrawal of visa-free access has caused inconvenience and the UK Government is losing revenue because less UK passports are issued in HK.",
