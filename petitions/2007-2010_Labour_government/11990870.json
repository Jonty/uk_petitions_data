            "background": "I would like the govt to abolish the Manslaughter charge on children under 10, reason being is, a child cannot defend themself so therefore it CANNOT be manslaughter. \nIn circumstances where the child has died violently at hands of an adult then charges of manslaughter must be dropped. This is MURDER, and murder MUST be the only charge given on violent acts on children which leads to death.",
