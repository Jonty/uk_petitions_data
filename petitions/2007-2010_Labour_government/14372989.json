            "background": "Please Gordon Brown and David Miliband, show mercy in the case of Danny Fitzsimmons. So many have died and taken their own lives from PTSD.\nWe don't approve of what Danny has done, but myself and several thousand other British Soldiers fought for that country's democracy and freedom, and now we are asking for Danny to be brought back home.\nHe must face trial under our laws so please show some compassion. This man served in N. Ireland, Bosnia and Afghanistan, and as our Government you owe him to get him back.\nThis man is suffering like so many veterans in this country of PTSD. My group voicesofwar are working with talking2minds and our voice will be heard. So please, I plead with you. Join us, not fight us, in our misson to eradicate this mental problem.\nOver four thousand have joined our facebook campaign, and we are still growing, so please can you sort this out swiftly.\nThe British Soldiers that gave their minds for Democracy.",
