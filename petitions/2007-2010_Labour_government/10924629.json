All Personal Water Craft to display a clearly legible registration number.\n\nThe introduction of a national equivalent of the Highway Code for users of these craft with associated penalties.\n\nUse of these machines only allowed in an area by permit following a public consultation and an assessment of the environmental impact. All other areas are out of bounds by definition.\n\nWaterside areas and launching areas to by clearly signposted if there is permission to use Jet Skis. If there is no sign, there is no permission. Signs to include a map of the permitted usage area and a phone number to report abuse.",
