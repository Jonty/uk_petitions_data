            "background": "I think it is disgraceful that politicians loiter outside polling stations and ask to see people's voting slips without introducing themselves.  A lot of people think that it is just part of the process, and that these politicans are working for the polling station.  These politicians deliberately mislead the voters by not introducing themselves, having a table and wearing offical-looking clothing to make it appear that they are working for the polling station that day.  They are in fact just trying to count votes early, and I think it violates voters' human rights. Let's ban these people from doing this.",
