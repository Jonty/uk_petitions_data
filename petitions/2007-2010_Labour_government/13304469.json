            "background": "With Christmas goods, cards & paraphernalia currently being Advertised or Sold (September 2009), we feel this is too early in the year. The \"Speciality\" of the Christmas season is being eroded. By the time the Christmas season starts, usually the last week of November, all the nice feeling about it has been reduced to last minute bargains and special offers. Certain \"Christmas\" perishables, sold in October are past their use-by date by the time Christmas week arrives.\nWe ask that restrictions on the advertising and sale of these goods is put in place to make Christmas special again.",
