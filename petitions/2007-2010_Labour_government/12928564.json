        "background": "Michael Jackson was an an icon, a singer, a dancer, and a legend. Most importantly, he was a humanitarian, who bought a smile to millions of people across the globe. He was a kind, decent, honest and loving man. Having one day to honour this great person, just doesnt seem enough. The world has lost one of the greatest musicians to ever grace our planet. Having one day in honour of this amazingly talented person seems only right. One international public holiday to help bring together millions of people across the world to pay tribute to this angel who came in the form of Michael Jackson. One day to keep Michael Jackson's memory alive. One day to honour the one and only King of pop.",
