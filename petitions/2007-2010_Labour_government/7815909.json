            "background": "It is understood that Mrs Bhutto's son, Bilawal Zardari, has decided to return to Oxford to complete his education. We have also been informed that the British Government will have to provide him personal protection while he is here and that it is going to cost the British taxpayers millions to do so. We have also been informed that his protection detail will be greater than that provided for Price Harry or Prince William. Please join me by adding your name to this petition to deny this extra burden on the British taxpayers for one who has nothing to do with the British people. Furthermore, his decision to return to UK to complete his education will endanger our citizens from possible terrorist attempts to eliminate him in the same way that the late Mrs Bhutto was assasination.",
