            "background": "Currently disabled people have very few options when it comes to parking. If they can find a space, good. But most disabled spaces are taken up by elderly people without badges or people who just cant be bothered to walk that far.\nI say that all disabled people with a blue or orange badge should get free parking in all car parks in the UK, including pay and display or pay when you leave car parks. As it stands most car parks have disabled spaces but if it is a pay and display car park the person still gets charged for using the car park which I think is wrong.",
