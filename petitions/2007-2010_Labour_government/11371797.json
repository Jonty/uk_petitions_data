            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "One of the biggest reasons for people keeping out of town centres are car parking charges. We propose that the VAT cut, which has failed to stimulate consumer spending, is reversed, and that the money is used as grants for local councils to provide free parking. This would have the effect of encouraging people into the town centres, which at present are suffering from internet shopping, out of town stores and the recession.",
