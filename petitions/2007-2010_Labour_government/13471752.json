        "background": "Tax should be increased heavily on cigarettes to encourage people to stop smoking and to prevent as many new smokers as possible.\nThis would create a healthier British public and also prevent as much polution (as well as not having to breathe in someones else's smoke in the street).\n\nThis will probably be disliked by most smokers but will eventually be valued as it will be of benefit to our beautiful country.\n\nGain in taxes can be used to help more people quit.\n\nIf successful (which it will almost certainly be) then an eventuate ban of selling cigarettes could be implented (not soon though i would propose it would take a minimum of 9 years).",
