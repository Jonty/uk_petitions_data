        "background": "i was a single parent carer of my son until i became unwell.  social care have since refused me enough help to have my son home as is our wish.  social care have used heavy handed tactics, lies and false information to make me look like a bad parent instead of funding services to keep my son at home.  he is now lving with his mum, this person didnot want him overnight at all until social care persuaded her they would help.  his mum has lost children in the past, through child protection issues, and has been arrested for lying to police about my son and i yet is deemed to be capable of caring for a severely disabled child.  there is already evidence she cannot cope with this child and i fear things will only worsen if somebody doesnot investigate what is happening to my son and myself",
