        "background": "Almost everyone in the UK will be affected by Cancer.  Cancer Research UK receive virtually no Government funding for research, depending entirely upon the generosity of public donations to fund their life saving work.  This is a good example of central Government getting their priorities wrong, when for example pointless Government Quangos cost the tax payer \u00a334 billion pounds per year.\n\nReduce the quangos and please redirect the savings to the life saving work like that undertaken by Cancer Research UK. Thankyou.",
