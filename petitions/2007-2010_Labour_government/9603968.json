        "action": "Pass an act of parliament and or to instill greater emphasis in our schools and colleges of the fine and proud history of our manufacturing. With the need for greener energy and technology there is a wonderful opportunity for us to come to the forefront of green research, wvhch is being done at present very heavily in France and Germany. This could create decent jobs and wealth in our communities. I also favour bringing 'clean coal' technology to the fore, and rebuilding our mining industry to reduce our dependence on increasingly expensive oil and potentially unreliable gas imports. I also favour recreating a British owned and run motor manufacturing industry.",
