            "background": "Automated service is useful on trains, as you travel long distances between stations and might not neccesarily know where you are, the amount of announcements per minute on a bus though is ridiculous, you can sometimes get up to 4-5 loud announcements a minute. Everytime the bus stops you are told which bus you are on. Why has this system been introduced? It isn't neccessary and makes the bus journey unpleasant in my opinion",
