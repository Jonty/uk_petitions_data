            "background": "with regards to the GDC's new regulation that all dental nurses must be registered or in training to be able to continue working.dental nurses are now expected to pay an annual registration fee,CPD course costs and for all trainees the national examination fee whilst still working on minimum wage or a minute fraction higher.This role is now considered a \"professional career\" which comes with serious added risks of potential infection and alot of hard work.Dentists make more money a day than we make in a week surely they can afford to pay us a higher wage to keep the good staff they have before we all leave and train to be dental hygienists or therapists.if you agree please sign this petition, thanks.",
