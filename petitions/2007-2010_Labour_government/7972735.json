This should see the number of people migrating to our counrty simply because of the attraction to our generous benefit schemes, drop and possibly end. However this should not put off the people who want to enter our country to actualy work hard and contribute towards our economy.\nThese hard working people are also more likely to respect our country, laws and ways of life, unlike those who enter simply for the financial benefits.\n\nTherefore this is a win win situation.",
