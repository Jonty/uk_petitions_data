            "background": "In July 2007, despite overwhelming opposition from the local community, the Boards of Wandsworth Primary Care Trust and of St. Georges' NHS Trust voted to close Clapham's Bolingbroke Hospital. The decision has now been referred to the Secretary of State.\n\nThe hospital receives about 23,700 patients each year. A closure would result in most of its services being transferred to other sites. It is suspected that many of these services would be reduced, as it has been confirmed that the money from Bolingbroke\u2019s sale would go to the Chancellor. The local Trusts would have to apply for the money to be invested in Wandsworth\u2019s health services, so there is no guarantee that it would. \n\nWandsworth\u2019s population has grown significantly over recent years. Now, more then ever it needs a community hospital. Bolingbroke is an excellent site for this, but only 20% of the hospital is currently in use.\n\nSupport the campaign to refurbish, not close Bolingbroke. Please sign this petition.",
