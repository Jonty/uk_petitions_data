Pupils\u2019 development and well-being, the governance of the school and its effectiveness to promote high quality education are all outstanding. RCS will strive to ensure pupils from HS are welcomed and strengthen the life of the school. The current site has sufficient space for the additional pupils.\n\nIt is not usual to close a good school to manage falling rolls elsewhere. Closing RCS will not be in the best interests of pupils. Option C offers the best opportunities for providing continuity for all pupils.",
