            "background": "In 2004, the Hunting Act passed in UK Parliament. This meant that hunting foxes with hounds (unless used to flush out mammals from sets/dens/burrows) is now illegal. It has recently come into the public eye again, as before 2009; the High Court will define \u2018hunting\u2019 to clarify the laws.\nSince the ban, animal rights activists have been celebrating, but hunters have been battling to bring back the traditional English sport.\nHunting is an exhilirating,exciting, and TRADITIONAL BRITISH sport. Give England back it's sport.\nI believe that we should again be able to hunt foxes on foot or horseback, with the help of Fox Hounds, Beagles, Blood Hounds etc. We should use these dogs to do what they were bred to do, do what is in their blood, to pursuit a fox. This is Tradition. This is English.",
