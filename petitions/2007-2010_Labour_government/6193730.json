Also, it may increase pollution to the extent that residents in the charging zones are forced (in the knowledge of an annual charge of almost \u00a36,500) to sell their vehicles to rural owners with a much higher annual mileage. \nThe \u00a325 charge, if applied at all (which is opposed), should not be\nborne by those who purchased their vehicles without the knowledge that such a charge would be introduced. \nIn any event, the discount for charging zone residents should be retained.",
