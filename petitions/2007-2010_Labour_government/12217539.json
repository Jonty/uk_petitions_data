We took a wrong turn somewhere and its time to start trying to head in the morally right direction. \nThere is no need for MP's to claim expenses, they earn far more then most as it is. Furthermore, it is utterly perposterous to claim that expenses are private - its public money, its a public matter!\nEither completely abolish expenses or complete transparency of every single penny. Like in the real world, not MP's dream world! They're in a VERY privileged position FOR THE PUBLIC, not the other way around as it seems right now.",
