All I ask for is a chance to show my feelings for my country, without feeling that I have done something wrong or illegal. It is for this reason that I challenge this government to come up with a good valid reason, that does not relate to finance, why they should not display a Union Flag, and the flag of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland or England respectively, in every school, college, university, hospital and other public buildings, so that the people of The United kingdom can feel that they have an identity again.",
