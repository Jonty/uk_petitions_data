            "background": "My local Tesco store is open 24 hours on most days. There are no doors, just a shutter for those times when they are closed. For the rest of the time the store is open fronted and uses an air cushion to retain heat. This seems to me to be a great waste of energy, when doors would be a more efficient way of retaining heat in the store.\n\nWhile I understand that, in some cases, air curtains are put to good use, some common sense is needed and enery savings need to be made.",
