            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In the middle of recession, it is vital that the government does everything in its power to safeguard jobs, and in particular the millions of low paid workers and schoolchildren for whom public transport is their only option. In these tough times, employers are understandably unsympathetic to the plight of those who cannot go to work because they are reliant on public transport, or because their children cannot get to school.\n\nI therefore petition the Goverment to start training soldiers so that a skeleton public transportation service can be provided during periods of industrial action. While respecting the right of train, bus and tube workers to strike, and while such action will still cause severe disruption, training soldiers for this task will enable a limited safe service to be maintained. This will give workers for whom public transport is their only possibility of getting to work, and the people who provide them employment, an absolutely vital lifeline during this period of economic uncertainty.",
