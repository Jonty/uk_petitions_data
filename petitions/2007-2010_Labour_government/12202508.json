This is leading to ever more pervasive information being disseminated, e.g. recent APACS plan regarding credit card behavioural data sharing.\n\nInformation shared between financial bodies should be:\n\ni) within well defined minimal classes (e.g. credit limits, etc);\n\nii) of absolute necessity;\n\niii) destroyed by the receiving body after use.\n\n\nCustomers should be sent explicit notification of:\n\ni) what is being shared;\n\nii) when, and if on a regular basis, the frequency of such sharing;\n\niii) who it is to be shared with;\n\niv) whether the recipient may store that data or only hold it transiently.\n\n\nThe following should never be shared:\n\ni) existance of current/savings accounts that don't have an overdraft/credit facility;\n\nii) transactional data.",
