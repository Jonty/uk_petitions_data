        "background": "It is impossible to open a bank account, savings or credit facility without giving blanket consent for the financial institution to share your data, with few real restrictions on what is allowed to be shared.  This is leading to ever more pervasive information being disseminated, e.g. recent APACS plan regarding credit card behavioural data sharing.\n\nInformation shared between financial bodies should be:\n\ni) within well defined minimal classes (e.g. credit limits, etc);\n\nii) of absolute necessity;\n\niii) destroyed by the receiving body after use.\n\n\nCustomers should be sent explicit notification of:\n\ni) what is being shared;\n\nii) when, and if on a regular basis, the frequency of such sharing;\n\niii) who it is to be shared with;\n\niv) whether the recipient may store that data or only hold it transiently.\n\n\nThe following should never be shared:\n\ni) existance of current/savings accounts that don't have an overdraft/credit facility;\n\nii) transactional data.",
