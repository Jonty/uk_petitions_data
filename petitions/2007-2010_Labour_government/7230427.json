It also shows the further blow that they are dealt when trying to access justice for the crimes committed against them, revealing that they are frequently not believed or taken seriously by criminal justice agencies.\n\nThe report contains recommendations for the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, legal professions, health service providers, relevant Government departments and the Equality and Human Rights Commission.  If acted upon they would represent a significant step towards ensuring equal access to justice for people with experience of mental distress.",
