            "background": "This petition aims to get enough numbers to act as sufficient evidence that the people are against the ludicrous plans to play the Premier League abroad. \nThe Premier League is the strongest in the world. People pay a lot of money in season tickets to go to the games. According to these plans, fans will be given a great opportunity to watch their team abroad. Firstly the match won't be worth paying for - if it was a European match (Champions League, Uefa Cup, Intertoto) the fans would pay money to be there. Secondly, many Football Federations around the world have already said no to a Premier League match being played in their country. For example, in Japan they don't want other teams playing in their country because it takes support away from their own teams. Japan have already stated that they won't allow any match to be played that doesn't feature a Japanese team.\nThese plans are just a money spinner, and money is something top clubs don't need. They get millions of pounds every year from selling TV rights to foreign countries.",
