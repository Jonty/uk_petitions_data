Leading to skin problems such as eczema and Rosacea.\n\nThe Government should look to providing water softening equipment to households who have this problem. Or should look to trying to soften the water in areas where there is extreme hardness in water, such as London.\n\nThe benefits of Soft Water outweigh those of Hard Water. The Government should look at this.",
