            "background": "Having graduated a number of years ago and having constant arguements with the Student Loans Company, it has become apparent the the Student Loans Company and HMRC (Inland Revenue) cannot communicate with each other.  It really is a chore having to send in payslips and P60's to prove that payments have been made.  If the SLC take the payment themselves, it will make simple things like obtaining balances simple instead of an aggrovated process which takes weeks.  I will shortly be expecting a letter from the SLC advising that my payments are due to come to an end, I bet the letter never arrives as the SLC probably have not received yet received data from HMRC for the last tax year.  I know that I am not alone here so sign up to this petition to make the government look at the process of taking payments.",
