Our Prime Minister should not agree to a decision on this far reaching part of the Lisbon Treaty without formal and meaningful public consultation within the U.K and he should call for the European Commission to do the same. The Lisbon Treaty should not have been ratified without a referendum but since this has happened, key provisions such as Article 27 should not be decided without the soliciting of the general publics views.",
