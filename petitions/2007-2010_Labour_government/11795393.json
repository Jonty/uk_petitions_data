            "background": "Many people can not play Airsoft even at Airsoft venues because you have to be 18 to hire equipment. You should also be able to buy an Airsoft gun which are now brightly coloured/clear so that they do not look like the real gun at a younger age like 14 but you will have to have a licence like you do for fishing! You can also hire paintball guns at a young age which are more harmfull to someone than a Airsoft gun! So age limit to play Airsoft should be 14 and then get a licence so you can buy a gun",
