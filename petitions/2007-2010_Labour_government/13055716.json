            "background": "Ceredigion Education Authority are recommending closure of this 95 year old school based on viability.  We believe parents should be allowed the choice of sending their children to a small school - one which has an excellent reputation. The Capel Dewi community feel that the school was presented with a \u2018done deal\u2019, with no alternatives, no options and no opportunities for real dialogue or discussion about the impact of the closure, after 95 years, on the sustainability of a small village community.  Please add your voice to halt the closure and keep our school open.",
