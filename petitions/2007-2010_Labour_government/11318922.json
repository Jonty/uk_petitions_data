        "background": "The sale of the Gold Reserves by Gordon Brown, when he was Chancellor of the Exhequer, was the exact bottom, now known in the Capital Markets as Brown's Bottom, of a 20 year Bear Market in Gold prices. Since then Gold has traded at 4 times the value that it was sold at, and is now considered to be in a multi year Bull Market. Not only was the Gold sold at an inappropriate time but its sale was announced prior to the sale, and, Market Makers in the Gold Market, marked the price down further to maximise their profits and cause further loss to the taxpayer.It is requested that the Prime Minster explain to the nation the full reasons behind this apparent act of economic vandalism, and, if it was as a direct result of economic incompetence, apologise to the nation.",
