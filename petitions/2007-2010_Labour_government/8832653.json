            "background": "Road Tax is unfair and no longer relevant - why should a two-car owner pay twice when they can only drive one at a time?  Why should a 'low emision' vehicle that does 100,000 miles a year pay less than a 'dirty' vehicle which does less than 6,000 miles? EU immigrants with non-UK registered vehicles and many other drivers manage to avoid this tax, but none can drive without fuel! Increased income from fuel taxes should cover the shortfall - savings would be made from the costs of printing & processing licences & reminders, postage, catching & prosecuting 'offenders', police & court time, preventing, detecting & prosecuting theft of licences etc. This taxation is not all spent on improving roads or transport infrastructure - it is now no more than just another weapon in the armoury to penalise motorists and boost revenue to the exchequer, and should be abolished. Increased road-usage taxation is both a direct and indirect burden on families - paying for essential transport, and paying increase costs of food & goods due to transportation cost increases being passed on.",
