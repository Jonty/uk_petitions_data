I have noticed since I introduced the new bulbs in a bid to save money my headaches have increased and become almost a daily experience and at the same time my skin condition which was for some time been more or less undercontrol has reappeared to the extent I am visiting a nhs skin clinic regulary one more. \nI have therefore needed to throw away the new bulbs and buy some of the old style and the room feels clearer, easier to see rather than appearing as walking through pea soup due to difference in clear vision.\nPlease sign if you feel they should still allow at least those with medical conditions which could involve light sensitivity to be able to get the old bulbs.",
