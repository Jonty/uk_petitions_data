            "background": "Under the current system of selection there is a small committee of say 10 to 12 people who select, after interview, a candidate to represent their particular political party in a constituancy. The voter's choice is therefore made by that committee.If one wants to remain loyal to a particular philosophy, ie Labour, Conservative etc the voter has limited choice. Primary elections would allow the voter to select a candidate to stand in an election. That candidate would have a broader and more committed support and more connection with the people.\n\nJohn Patrick",
