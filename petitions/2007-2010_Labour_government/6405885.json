            "background": "Help is needed to prevent families, couples or solo's from loosing all they have worked for, including thier homes, as victims of chronic, long term or terminal cancers. Many paitents have to return to work, or loose thier homes,or live in poverty, or debt; which is often their legacy to their families after death. The benefits system does not allow them to cover their living costs without creating barriers to real choice to live as full a life style as possible with their particular diagnosis. Benefit is particularly poor for people without responsiblity for children under 18. Please create a forum where this issue can be exlored and gives hope to people of all ages.",
