This is in direct contravention of the 1908 Registration Act. We would also ask that the Indian Government be asked to ensure that the Department of Revenue, Directorate of Enforcement ('D of E') acts judiciously when investigating alleged infringements of FEMA and is not being used to harass foreign nationals who have bought property in Goa.",

            "background": "Before August 2006 the Sub-Registrars were accepting foreigners' deeds.\nThere have been no changes to the Registration Act or FEMA.\nAround four hundred British Citizens bought property before August 2006 and are now being investigated by the D of E and threatened with confiscation.\nPreviously the High Commission of India offered 'X' visas  to property owners, but these are now being refused. They are not merely a convenience but are indirectly necessary to obtain items such as  driving licences and utility connections.\nAround fifty thousand persons of Goan birth or descent now live in the UK. The Petitioners hope that they are happy here and are treated fairly and justly, and ask only that the Government of Goa should extend the same courtesies to the few hundreds of foreign nationals who are full or part time residents of Goa.\nThe rule of law is central to the operation of democracy, and a central pillar of law is the protection of persons and property. In India any transfer of Property, by any means and for any purpose, is required to be registered. Thus to deny registration is to undermine the very basis of the rule of law and of democracy.",
