            "background": "As a parent of a Special Educational Needs child, we feel that these children are being neglected by this government and that the parents have to fight in in order to get their child the education that they have a right to.\nOur daughter's school noticed that our daughter had learning problems when she started reception school at the age of 4 year old, after numerous specialists had seen our daughter and over 3 1/2 years later, our daughter was turned down for a Statement of Educational Needs.We am now being forced to appeal this decision which will prolong our daughter not receiving the education she deserves.\nWe implore the government to have a good look at the future generation it is making before it it too late and to help all these children have a good future.",
