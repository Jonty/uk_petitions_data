            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Why assume people will immediatly put their own & others safety at risk if implemented?\nSurely testers can compensate by pre empting faults & wear expected to be encountered in the extended period?\nTo many people, this yearly, ever more expensive cost adds to the burden of rapidly increasing driving expenses & can be the final straw regards meeting mounting unavoidable, fixed costs. You may use your vehicle rarely, or occasionally, thus avoiding serious wear. But it has to be tested as if subjected to heavy mileage. If you pass, knowing you will pass, it has then been a waste of time & money. Increase penalties for drivers caught in charge of a vehicle that is obviously dangerous to drive. But, those vehicles & drivers probably have avoided, tax, insurance & mot regardless.\nAs ever desired, use petrol consumption to monitor mileage & tax petrol accordingly & subsidise 3rd party insurance, mots & other costs in respect of actual use.",
