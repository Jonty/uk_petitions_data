            "background": "Six Indian IT services firms recruited a total of 11,644 immigrants to work for them in the UK in 2006 alone, according to government figures.  \n\nIt may be that there are skill needs that can be filled by overseas workers but this should not be at the expense of resident workers. Questions need to be asked about how this is happening and whether companies are using the current work permits system to undercut pay rates in the UK.\n\nOver a seven-year period, the six companies - Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, Mahindra-BT, Mastek, Infosys Technologies and Satyam Computer Services - were granted work permits to bring 47,000 foreign nationals into the UK. \n\nThe annual total has climbed steadily every year since 2000 and has doubled since 2003. \n\nTata, the largest Indian IT services firm, secured the largest number of permits. It was given 4,000 permits in 2006, a big rise on the 1,600 issued in 2000.\n\nWe petition \n \n1) IMMEDIATELY STOP ISSUE OF ALL NEW WORK PERMITS\n2) REFUSE EXTENTION OF ANY WORK PERMIT THAT IS DUE FOR RENEWAL\n3) STOP ALL NEW IMMIGRATION PERMISTS SUCH AS TIER 1, etc till the economic downturn is over",
