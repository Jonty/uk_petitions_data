            "background": "The current Olympic logo has chosen style over correct grammar by failing to use an upper-case letter at the start of a proper noun.  It has been deemed acceptable for stylistic reasons; but this should not be the case.\n\nThe logo will be seen extensively throughout the world, and will be built into educational activities in classrooms all over the country.  It is an indirect endorsement of incorrect grammar by the Government and is irresponsible. Promoting such a high profile example that correct English can be flouted in formal use is wrong and against educational policy. \n\nA small white line added to the logo will correct this, and can be used to publicly emphasise the Government\u2019s commitment to the education of Britain\u2019s children.",
