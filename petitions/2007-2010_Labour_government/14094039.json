            "background": "Christmas Day is just that,one day,but now seems to last for three months or more.From sofas to food to presents we are bombarded day after day,week after week in the shops and on television from as early as September with companies trying to take money from us for Christmas.They don`t care about us,they just want as much of our money as possible.Quite apart from most people being driven mad,becoming sick and tired of the whole thing,so many people who can least afford it are spending much more than they can afford,causing untold hardship year after year.Indeed,many people are still paying for last Chrismas when the next one is on our screens.This used to be a time of year to look forward to but sadly,few now do.\nIf Christmas was condensed to just the month of December it may re-kindle peoples enjoyment of it,helping them to possibly spend less and bring back the true meaning,which is not to line the coffers of big business.\nIt is,after all,supposed to be a time for us to celebrate the birth of Jesus.",
