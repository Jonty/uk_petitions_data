            "background": "Many small investors as well as institutions relied on the dividend from Lloyds TSB as it was.  The government has prevented the new Lloyds Group from paying a dividend.  This penalises both sharehoders and the Lloyds Group.  Investors were drawn to the Lloyds shares due to the good prospects of growth combined with a good dividend.  Cancelling the dividend hurts small shareholders as well as the so-called \"fat cats\".  \nPlease support my petition to reinstate the Lloyds Group dividend",
