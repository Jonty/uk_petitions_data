            "background": "I would like to appeal to the prime minister for a flexible speed limit system, much like in Germany. Where suitable roads could have their speed limit removed completely and on other \"M\" designated roads have a flexible speed limit dependant on conditions.\n\nJust as a back ground the motorway national speed limit was introduced originally during a period of bad weather and was never removed, most cars  in the modern era can easily travel safely at well over 100mph. So why are the roads still limited to 70mph?\n\nRoSPA gave the british government the advice that the recommended speed limit should be 85mph, so why do they hold on to it?????\n\nTime to have your say",
