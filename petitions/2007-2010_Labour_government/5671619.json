            "background": "With the required income of the average first time buyer in the UK reaching \u00a335k it is staggering that young people are being given no help to make a real start in life.\n\nWith the number of affordable houses at an all time low young people are left with the previously unseen dilemma of either living with parents or sharing with friends until their thirties or renting property at an incredible rate and running up crippling debts. Neither of these scenarios is conducive to starting a happy and stable family and thus leading to a fall in the quality of society. This will in turn lead to instability of other areas of life such as education and law and order.\n\nThis situation can not go any longer without drastic action by the government. Please help the future of our great nation build a stable platform where family life can prosper, children can grow up in a happy home and people do not feel that they must resort to desperate actions to resolve their problems.",
