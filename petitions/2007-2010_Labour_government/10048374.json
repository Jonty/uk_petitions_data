            "background": "Ilkley Moor was gifted to the public in 1893 for the public pleasure, therefore Bradford council have no right to treat Ilkley Moor as if it belonged to them, without public consultation.\nI for one believe that Ilkley Moor should be left as it is for the people of Bradford to enjoy. Anyone wishing to shoot should shoot on their own land and leave the people of Bradford, Ilkley Moor and all its inhabitants in peace and safety.\nI would question whether the majority of people would even be interested in shooting , is there not already too much violence and is this a message we should be sending out to the young people that killing should be for fun.",
