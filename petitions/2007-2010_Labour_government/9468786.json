            "background": "7 Regiment AAC(V) are to be disbanded in March 2009. As well as providing communications flights within the UK,the Regiment also supports Regular and Reserve forces exercises in the UK and worldwide (deployments have included support to Regular Army in Italy, Poland, Germany and planned deployments to Kenya. These exercises would not have been able to take place without this vital helicopter support. Various agencies (including the Commons Defence Select Committee) have already identified that UK Forces suffer from a lack of helicopter support. To further reduce the number of helicopters available for training and support operations does not make sense (this is not justified by financial savings as the tasks would still exist and have to be carried out by more expensive aircraft). A cost effective plan would be to re-equip the Regiment with modern,commercially available helicopters (such as the AS350B or AW109 already in service) when the Gazelle reaches the end of its cost effective life, to allow the Regiment to continue its valuable support to all 3 services in the UK and abroad,as well as supporting civilian agencies as it did during the recent floods in Cheltenham.",
