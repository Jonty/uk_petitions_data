        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As a mature student, I wear spectacles for most things. I am also aware of the problems with extensive computer use and eye problems. The regulations concerning computer users specifically exempt students from the rights to eyecare and free prescription glasses for computer users in industry. \nAs students are now expected to perform most of their work and research using computers and online resources, there is a possibility that many of them are causing themselves problems during their period of study which will not become apparent immediately. As students do not have a right to free eyetests, this is a case of preventable damage being done which will later cost the country more money in correction.\nI ask that all students in further and higher education be entitled to free eyecare and prescription glasses for computer use as a right in order to minimise this potential problem",
