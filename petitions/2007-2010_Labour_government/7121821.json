            "background": "I am starting this petition because the law currently protects the institutions and not the students.  At the moment they have discretion to help or hinder a students right to return to study after illness.  I was diagnosed with cancer and because there was no guidelines laid down the institution, which i was formerly a member of, decided to treat me with little dignity.  This almost prevented me returning to my postgraduate studies.  \nI am starting this because institutions and bodies need to realise that illness can and will continue to happen and there needs to be protection.\nIn the light of rising tuition fee's this is very important.  Higher educational establishments need to be told to treat their students with humanity.  Getting over the disease is stressful enough without having to worry about returning to their studies.",
