        "background": "As the only through road to Leigham Court Rd, St. Julian's Farm Rd has more traffic than neighbouring roads. However, the speed at which the a high number of cars travel is, frankly, ridiculous. After conducting a brief test I found 17 out of 20 cars coming up or down the road at an unacceptable speed. We have many families with young children on the road, and it really is only a matter of time before someone gets hit. The matter of residents vehicles is also a point of concern. My own car has been scraped twice by careless, speeding drivers. \nTo summarize, we need something done about speeding drivers on our road. The obvious and most practical solution is speed humps. \nI ask my neighbours for their support in this matter.",
