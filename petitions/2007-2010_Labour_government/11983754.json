        "background": "Robert Bennett was jailed for 6 months for speeding at 122mph on his motorbike whilst carrying a pillion.Yes this was silly BUT !!!!\nThis sentence shows how motorcyclists are dealt with unfairly in court.\n\nAll motorist should be treated the same the argument that the judge took into consideration what might of happened is hypocritical. If he had been driving a car at that speed it is alot bigger weapon of distruction, but he would not of got a jail sentence just a fine.So i call for him to be released at once and maybe an appropriate suspended sentence given.",
