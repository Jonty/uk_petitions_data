            "background": "This petition is to introduce a National Children\u2019s Day into the UK ; to recognise children who are with us or for those who are no longer part of our world. This petition was started by Jo Cameron well-known media personality, businesswoman and Patron of SANDS. \n\nThis petition is to celebrate National Children's Day on the last Sunday in August every year. It makes a perfect holiday time celebration because it will usually be the last Sunday in the school holidays and may fall on a bank holiday. \n\nOther countries have their own National Children\u2019s Day and we should have one too! It\u2019s the children\u2019s equivalent to Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s Day.\n\nThe day will be used to spend time with our children and remind them how special they are. As a bereaved parent, Jo hopes that it will allow other bereaved parents to recognise their children on the same day as everyone else.  \n\nNB : In 1954 the UN recommended that all countries have a Children's Day and many countries have already followed this guidance.",
