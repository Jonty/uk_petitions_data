            "background": "Taxing fuel is fair and reasonable because it taxes mileage and it taxes gas guzzling vehicles.  Road tax and its attendant bureaucrisy should be scrapped unless there are good reasons not to, in which case road tax should simply cover administration costs.  This measure may result in higher prices in our shops, but why shouldn't we pay the true costs associated with distribution.  Money raised should be spent on better transportation infrastructure across the country.",
