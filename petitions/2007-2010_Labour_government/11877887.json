            "background": "The government wants to ration the amount of emissions people can produce through activities. Firstly, this will have no effect - it is proposed that you will be able to buy up \"carbon credits\", so rich people who usually produce the most emissions will be unaffected. \n\nAlso, this country has no high speed railways north of London, meaning for many domestic journeys air travel is a more attractive option, especially for cross-country journeys.\n\nMuch of our public transport system is very poor. Many bus and train services are expensive, unreliable, often doesn't run in the evenings and on Sundays, and in some areas doesn't exist. Therefore, many people have no choice but to drive. \n\nAnd how about promoting renewable and clean energy and actually getting it to the stage of being built, rather than confining it to paper for several decades. \n\nUntil those matters have been sorted, and carbon rationing schemes are unfair and unjust.",
