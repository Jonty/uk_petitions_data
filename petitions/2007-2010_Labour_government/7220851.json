            "background": "I know the plan of raising prices on fuel is to get cars of the road, but raising the prices isnt the answer. In my area it is 100.9 a litre for petrol, its just getting ridiculous. There must be some other way of getting vehicles of the road, maybe raising the age limit for learners to 21 will cut down on vehicles and accidents on the road . Some people like myself have to use a vehicle to make a living. So PLEASE sign this petition to cut fuel prices.\n\nThank You\n\nSTAND UP, BE HEARD!",
