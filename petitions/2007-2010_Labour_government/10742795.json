            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This proposal seeks to transfer the cost of policing increasingly rowdy city centres from the public purse to those premises serving alcohol after 11pm. Each late-opening club, restaurant or licensed premises would pay additional business rates to cover the cost of late night policing according to a simple transparent formula, as follows;\n\n(Number of hours open after 11pm x Fire Limit Capacity) x Rate in the Pound\n\nThe level of late night policing and the resultant business rate surcharge should be a matter of negotiation between the Police, Local Authority and local Chamber of Commerce.\nAs well as reducing pressure on the public purse, the clubs and pubs would have an economic interest in reducing anti-social behaviour in and around their establishments.",
