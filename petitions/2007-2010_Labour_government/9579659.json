        "background": "Unpaid Carers need to use public transport, to get groceries, go to hospital appointments, for our own health, or if our Cared ones take ill, and is hospitalised, and so on.   We also have to struggle, with shopping and other essentials, because of the rising cost of public transport we can't afford to use busses or trains. Carers need to get home quickly, so we can Care for our vulnerable, who are usually left alone for more than an hour, because of essential shopping, and lack of money to catch a bus. This fact, is underestimated by the government, it is not fair that school kids get free bus passes, and Carers are not being rewarded for what we do.  Unpaid Carers need all the help we can get, so please sign this petition, as one day, it could be you, who is a Carer to a loved one. Thank You.",
