The commercial rating for small shops is far to high and will cause the closure of high streets where there any independent retailers.\nLarge conglomerates can open in huge shopping malls, such as the new Westfield in west London, however small independent shops cannot afford these high rents.\nIn Portobello Rd,Tesco's pay less rates per m2 than all the other shops in the road. This is unfair and puts everyone else at a disadvantage.",
