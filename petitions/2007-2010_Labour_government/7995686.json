        "background": "I strongly believe John Lennon to be one of the most iconic and important people in  associated with brittish culture, not only for his music but for his work as a peace  activist and for just being an individual.  I am sure many people will agree, i think that he needs a day for people to remember just how important he was. There would be no better time than now to introduce such a day especially due to liverpool being named capital of culture this year. So let's make 9th October, the date of his birth, National John Lennon day!",
