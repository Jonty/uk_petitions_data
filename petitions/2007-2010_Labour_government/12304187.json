The sleeze and corruption in your government has come to such an appalling extent that your personal integrity is now under serious scrutiny. I do want to believe that all these fiasco, including the McBride\nblogs are wsithout your approval, but, how can he do it without your knowledge? Do you seriously think people could not see through your duplicity? Please, submit yourself now to us, electorate, so we can decide whether we still want you or not. Thank you.",
