As gas and electricity wholesale prices have fallen, suppliers have refused to pass on that reduction to UK households, despite the UK suffering a second colder than average winter.\n\nFuel poverty is now a major issue in the UK. At a time when economic stimulus is needed to bring the country out of recession, excessive profits are instead being directed towards shareholders at the expense of the wider economy.\n\nWe demand a rebate on our gas and electricity bills - NOW!",
