            "background": "Most teenagers have started smoking at such a young age these days, there are all these adverts on how to stop but its not that simple, the addiction to nicotine is hard to beat, such things as nervous breakdowns and serious stress can occur and cigarettes can help calm the person down. Most teenagers that smoke these days have older friends or relatives that would be quite happy to purchase the cigarettes for them. Highering the age may cause more problems than needed. People can have sex and go in the army at 16 so why not be able to buy cigarettes at 16 again.",
