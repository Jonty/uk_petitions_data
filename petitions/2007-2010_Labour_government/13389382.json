        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A company named Solar Roadways in the US is developing solar road surfaces to replace asphalt roads. The technology to have our road surfaces made up of solar panels exists and is viable. The benefits are wide-ranging, from a massive supply of green electricity in a ready-made grid to easy maintenance. We would like the government to seriously consider a move away from asphalt to solar surfaces for existing road surface replacement and future road building programmes.",
