            "background": "Make house buying easier, once the offer is accepted by the vendor it is a legally binding agreement. This would prevent the following problems:\n\n\"Gazumping\" when the owner agrees to sell to one person and then pulls out if they get a better offer.\n\nChains collapsing due to people putting in offers they are not serious about.\n\nThe really nasty situation when the vendor at the last minute asks for more money, even if a price has been agreed.\n\nThis would make moving house less stressful and less expensive for everyone",
