            "background": "I find it outrageous that I, as a teacher, only benefited from a 2.45% pay increase despite the hefty inflation that has pushed up my cost of living.  \n\nI believe that public sector workers deserve to have a good quality of life - after all, if it wasn't for us, lives would not be saved, children would not be educated, criminals would not be behind bars and the nation would, quite literally be in ruins.\n\nHowever, what is our reward for this?\n\nPay increases that do not reflect the fact that day-to-day, some of us put our lives on the line.  \n\nPay increases below the rises in costs of the standard of living are UNACCEPTABLE and must be stopped immediately.  We cannot continue to put our health, families and mentality second to our job.\n\nIt is a sad state that we pay those who work the least, the most.\n\nI say that ALL public sector workers should receive py increases at 2% above inflation, so that we can all afford to house our families, get on the property ladder or simply have a good life.\n\nSign up, and let's turn things around.",
