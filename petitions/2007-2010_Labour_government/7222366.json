Appeals are rarely accepted, and no attention is given to any work outside of the exam hall.  I am suggesting that the SQA requests schools give constant progress reports, with examples of work about every pupil sitting an exam, be it Standard Grade or any other, with the final grade being acheived by an actual average of progress, not on their memories.",
