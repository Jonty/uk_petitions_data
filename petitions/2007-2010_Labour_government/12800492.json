            "background": "Following the Prime Minister's welcome comment about correcting an \"injustice\" when presenting long overdue winner's medals to the 11 members of England's 1966 Football World Cup squad who did not receive them 43 years ago, this petition calls on the Prime Minister to correct the remaining major \"injustice\" which still subsists - namely that the contribution of seven members of that squad - Peter Bonetti, Gerry Byrne, John Connelly, Ron Flowers, Jimmy Greaves, Norman Hunter & Ron Springett - has never been officially recognised or rewarded by any Government. This contrasts to the fashion in which the winning members of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup squad and triumphant 2005 Ashes squad were recognised en bloc. This petition thereby strongly urges the Prime Minister - a self-confessed football fan - to personally intervene in this matter in a way that reflects their services to football.",
