            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "One way the government and local authorities could significantly reduce expenditure, borrowing and above inflation taxation increases would be to reform the current over generous  public service pension and retirement provisions so that they are in line with those available to the remainder of the population. This would seem an opportune time to reduce this profligate expenditure especially as the current government seems hell bent on taking the country and it's future tax payers into irresponsible levels of debt.",
