            "background": "Brian May CBE is one of the most influential rock guitarists of the 70s and 80s, having played with \"Queen\" for over 30 years, sold millions of records worldwide with the band, and been named one of the top 40 guitarists of all time. However, as well as being a first class guitarist, Brian is also a talented pianist and singer, having provided vocals for most of Queen's concerts, and he has also played harp and ukelele for Queen recordings.\nNumerous accomplished musicians such as Elton John, Tom Jones and Paul McCartney have all received KBE awards, and I feel as I'm sure many others will, that Brian has contributed to music and entertained the public immensely, and by all means deserves the honour!",
