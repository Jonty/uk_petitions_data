            "background": "I believe that Michael Jackson was one of the greatest entertainers on earth.\n\nI also believe he was one of the most giving people on earth.\n\nIn 2000, the Guinness Book of World Records cited Michael Jackson for holding the world record for the \u201cMost Charities Supported by a Pop Star.\u201d  \n\nHe did so much work for charities devoted to African relief, college scholarships and HIV/AIDS.  In 1992, he founded the Heal the World Foundation to relieve the suffering of children around the world\n\nBob Geldoff was knighted for similar work, and I believe Michael Jackson should be honoured as well.",
