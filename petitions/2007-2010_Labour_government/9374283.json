            "background": "The situation this year where two teams from the same country feature in the Champion's League final is not unique and could be replicated in future. Supporters who,by virtue of their loyalty to their team qualify for tickets are faced with a circa \u00a31000 travel cost and many ordinary supporters are likely to have to make way for more wealthy individuals. \nThere are also increased risks of policing problems in an unfamliar culture with no common language. Supervision by British police at a UK venue would reduce risks to the personal safety of supporters.\nThe scenario currently prevailing has looked increasingly possible for some weeks and contingency planning for relocating the final and compensating the originally designated hosts could have been implemented. The designated hosts could also have been offered the next unallocated year. The absurdity of tens of thousands of UK citizens being obliged to travel to Moscow was easily avoidable and should not be replicated in future.",
