        "background": "Many myths circulate regarding the effectiveness of cycle helmets. Many people wrongly assume that they are guaranteed to withstand an impact with a larger vehicle at speed. This is despite the many ways in which a cyclist can fall or be hit should the rarity of such an occasion occur.\n\nI would like to see the Government place funding into real peer-reviewed and state of the art research to test the effectiveness of modern cycle helmets. Current tests for UK Helmets only seem to cover moderate speeds of around 12mph and a distance of 1.5m (so essentially a fall). \n\nTests need to incorporate:\n-Blunt and sharp testing\n-A far greater range of impact speeds and distances\n-Use calibrated, modern analysis (crash test \u201cdummies\u201d perhaps) and sensing equipment\n\nThis information then needs to be made publically available to those choosing to cycle and those using the roads around cyclists. Although I am pro-helmet I feel the current information is often misleading and incomplete",
