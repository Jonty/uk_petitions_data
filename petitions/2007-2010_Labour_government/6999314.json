            "background": "This petition is to help save EMD cinema in Walthamstow, it should be restored to its original use as a cinema at the heart of the local community. The building is currently owned by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG). The UCKG put this historic cinema on the market when they learned it could not be converted into a church. Five years later and the building is still sitting empty. With the front of the building in such a poor state, local residents are worried about the state of the interior.\nWith this being such a historic building, we want the UCKG to move out and for the building to become a cinema again, which will be once again at the heart of the community.",
