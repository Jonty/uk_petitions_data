            "background": "TOTLAN - Turn Off Traffic Lights At Night - \nIn many parts of the world traffic lights are turned off at night leaving only a single flashing warning light where necessary. All over Britain thousands of traffic lights are working 24 hours a day even when there are no vehicles on the roads they control. This means not only a considerable waste of electricity but also that every night of the year, hundreds of thousands of vehicles on virtually empty roads, are decelerating, parking with their engines running, and then accelerating again, thus increasing their CO2 emissions without any obvious benefit. In view of the fact that turning off traffic lights at night is known to work without causing an unacceptably high number of accidents in other parts of the world, we would like the Prime Minister to investigate taking a similar course of action in this country.",
