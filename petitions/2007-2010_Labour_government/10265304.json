            "background": "The Government was due to issue Phase 2 European Union Allowances (EUAs) to all UK installations on 28th February 2008. However, it has failed to do so. \n \nThis failure is hindering growth in the carbon market and having a direct and negative impact on UK industry. Despite a promise to issue allowances within weeks of its announcement, there is still no sign of activity from DEFRA. \n \nFailure to issue the EUAs directly contradicts guidance from the European Commission indicating that member states can and should issue their EUAs. \n \nAllowances have a time value and failure to deliver the 2 billion allowances \u2013 with a value of roughly \u20ac48 million \u2013 are being borne by UK industry; a sector already struggling with high energy prices and faltering economic conditions. \n \nWe urge the Government to issue the allowances now.",
