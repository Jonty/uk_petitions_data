            "background": "It is recognised that both parents should financially contribute to a childs upbringing. often the parent with care is financially better off than the non-resident parents and the current child support system does not take into account a non resident parents family or financial situation, usually fathers, non resident parents can be left struggling to survive on the remainder of thier salary. The child support system should be fairer to all and should recognise and take into account both families situations to create a more personalised assessment tailored to both families incomes and needs rather than using a standard framework of assessment.",
