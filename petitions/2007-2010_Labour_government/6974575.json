The success they achieve in doing so will be reflected in the level of support they receive through membership and donations. If income generated is insufficient for their needs then this is indicative of their failure to fulfil their purpose. In any other business or household, expenditure is based on income.It is no more valid for political parties to raid the public coffers to sustain their activities than it would be for Ford to do the same to sell Mondeos - it is anti democratic and corrupt. \n\nIn summary, If you haven't got it,dont spend it - dont steal it off us!",
