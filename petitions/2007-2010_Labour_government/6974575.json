If income generated is insufficient for their needs then this is indicative of their failure to fulfil their purpose. In any other business or household, expenditure is based on income.It is no more valid for political parties to raid the public coffers to sustain their activities than it would be for Ford to do the same to sell Mondeos - it is anti democratic and corrupt. \n\nIn summary, If you haven't got it,dont spend it - dont steal it off us!",
