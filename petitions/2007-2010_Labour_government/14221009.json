            "background": "A person will only be entitled to receive assistance with their eligible housing costs if they meet certain criteria, which is usually people who are on a low income or in receipt of means tested benefits such as Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or Pension Credit. \n \nIf a claimant meets the necessary criteria then they have entitlement to receive the financial assistance, but how they choose to use this assistance cannot be regulated by the benefits agency. So even if they do not pay their rent with it, it cannot be deemed as \u201cstealing\u201d from the state because they were entitled to the benefit.This then puts a double burden on the state ( tax payers!!!) as the evicted people are still rehoused etc. especially if they have children ( that is why teenage birth rate is up, more children imported from abroad to live with 'relatives'.  lets stop this abuse!!!!",
