            "background": "Every year, councils in the UK erect Christmas lights earlier and earlier.\n\nWe are now presented with masses of Christmas lights on UK High Streets as early as the first week of October, before Halloween has taken place and Remembrance Day has been observed.\n\nThese lights are unnecessarily set up many weeks before they are even lit for no reason whatsoever, diminishing the meaning of the Christmas season to one of pure greed and commercialism.\n\nIt is an insult to the intelligence of the British people, who know perfectly well the day when Christmas falls, and need no visual reminder nearly three months in advance.  It does nothing to encourage them to spend months before they need to do so.\n\nFinally, to do so before Remembrance Day  is an insult to those who have fought for their country, sometimes paying the ultimate price.\n\nLet us ban the erection of public Christmas lights by councils, unlit or lit, until after Remembrance Day, and keep Christmas holiday in proportion.",
