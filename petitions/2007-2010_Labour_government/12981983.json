During this meeting he promised to deliver a Housing Summit.\n\nAfter great pressure from residents and two years later, MP David Wright finally arranged a Telford Housing Summit.\n\nMP David wright promised to deliver a report from the Telford Housing Summit held on 27/11/08 by February 2009.\n\nMP david Wright has now failed in his promise sending an email dated 30/06/09 stating he is to busy to keep his promise.\n\nThis housing Summit was held to address the housing and social needs of Telford and I now petition the PM to ensure MP David Wright keeps the promise he made to the residents of telford and agencies who attended the Housing Summit and releases the report concerning the telford Housing Summit.\n\nMP David Wright has now released a newsletter saying the report is available. This is untrue.\n\nWe now ask that MP David Wright releases the report, maintains his promise to residents and comes clean with the truth.",
