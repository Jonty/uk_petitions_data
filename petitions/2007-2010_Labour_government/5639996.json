            "background": "In order for parliament to have an effective oversight function parliamentary committees should have the power to require that ministers and senior civil servants attend committes and give evidence under oath.\n\nGovernment should be transparent and the ultimate authority in the country is parliament not the executive.  The executive should be answereable to parliament and the people through our parliamentary representatives.\n\nIn previous administrations ministers have misled parliament, either deliberatley or by ommission.  By requiring evidence to be given under oath deliberate untruths would result in criminal sanctions.\n\nI beleive this would restore faith in our political institutions by making MP's and members of the House Of Lords subject to the law and allow for open debates based on evidence.  With trust in politicians at an all time low and sinking ever further it is about time that we as a people demand better and make our public servants fully accountable for their actions.",
