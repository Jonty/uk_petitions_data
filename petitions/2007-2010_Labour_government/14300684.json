In the late 13th Century, it was taken from Scotland by the king of England.  At some point in the 20th Century, several Scots stole the Stone back and returned it to Scotland, where it was found and returned to England.  We petition the Stone be handed over to the Scottish Parliament, and help restore Scottish pride.",
