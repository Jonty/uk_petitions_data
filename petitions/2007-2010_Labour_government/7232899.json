        "background": "Small electric powered scooters would reduce congestion if allowed on our public roads.  Currently it is possible to use non powered scooters, however these are not suitable for commuters as you would not want to arrive to work hot and sweaty!\n\nThe scooters on the market today are small, often portable (can go on a bus or train), limited to speeds under 20mph (shower than most push bikes) and safe.  The law currently does not permit their use on our roads.  This is shortsighted when we are faced with limited infrastructure both in terms of traffic congestion and parking.",
