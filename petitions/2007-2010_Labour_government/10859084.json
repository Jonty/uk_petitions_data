This will stop people withdrawing from banks in trouble and therefore ease the pressure on them. If the government doesn't do this, they will end up having to spend billions on bail out's anyway.\n\nThis will give some comfort and stability to the British people, in this time of uncertainty.\n\nThanks a lot.",
