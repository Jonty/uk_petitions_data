        "background": "Marijuana is a plant like all others it was first banned in America by racists since then it has been reproduced around the world as a \"gate way\" drug making it illegal around many places in the world.  Marijuana has proven to make you less smarter and also lower sperm count but beer does the same effects also beer makes many people violent while marijuana makes you relaxed. The real reason why Britain is \"broken\" is because of yobs on the street drinking illegally getting violent and then mugging and stabbing for more money for beer. This needs to be thought over legalise it for great power.",
