Everyone was so pleased to have an experienced ex-police inspector as the Community Warden serving our area. Over the past few months Bob has been \"A visual figure\" around all the villages, and I don't mean driving around in a car. Bob has been walking around getting to know residents and DOING A GREAT JOB! Bob has even helped Aldington raise \u00a310,000 for two local charities. So it came as a huge shock to learn that K.C.C has decided to terminate Bob's contract with them. We all say \"BRING BACK BOB\".",
