            "background": "I want to see the complete re-nationalisation of the whole UK rail network,including all train services,all stations,all tracks,all buildings,all bridges,all tunnels,all rolling stock,all ticketing services,all catering and sleeper services,all freight services etc put back into public ownership with immediate effect.I would like to see the whole network run under the umbrella of one firm to be called \"British Railways\". There are too many operators providing too few services in overcrowded trains of which one companies service problems have not been helped out with the problems of another. There are too many ticketing schemes,not enough reasonably priced flexible off-peak ticket sales,misleading and confusing pricing structures nationwide and increasingly very poor customer services.Please sign the petition and let the Prime Minister know your feelings on the subject.",
