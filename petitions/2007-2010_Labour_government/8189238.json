This has not been the case and many people face court orders, and the threat of thier houses being pulled down.Not only this but also after submitting all thier paperwork and licences to the courts are left waiting for years for a reply from the courts as to the outcome of thier houses and thier lives. They cannot sell or remortgage or move on. Theoretically they are given a life sentence. It is wrong and unjust and something must be done to correct this situation immediately.",
