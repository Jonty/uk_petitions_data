            "background": "A lot of companies make far too much money for their own good, but yet still pay their employees \u00a36 an hour or therabouts, some even making millions, billions of pounds profit each year.  We should force companies to share their profit with people who slave day after day for a pittance, we tax companies to give the govenment money, how about an extra five percent tax given back to the people who work for that company?  Even if it's only two percent or whatever is decided, and perhaps only on companies earning more than a certain amount if that's what it takes, but you have to admit it's only fair.  Besides in this day in age, you have no chance of starting your own shop or business in a lot of places because large companies like Tesco, Boots, are cornering the market, and they should have to pay their employees for that privilige, how could anyone hope to open a corner shop at a profit when these large companies have such massive purchasing power?  Something has to be done.",
