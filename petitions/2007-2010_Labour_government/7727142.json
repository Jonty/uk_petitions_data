            "background": "The New Deal scheme for the unemployed is nothing more than a form of cheap labour. It gives jobless people just \u00a315 on top of benefits, meaning a single person takes home \u00a310 less than the Old Age Pension despite working or doing job search activity for 30 hours a week. Many people are coming round for a 3rd or 4th term on New Deal, showing that it creates few jobs. What's more, for those over 25 it has no training element.",
