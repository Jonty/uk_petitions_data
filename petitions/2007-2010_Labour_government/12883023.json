            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nGreetings. I understand you are genuinely and sincerely taking\na lot of initiatives to recover the economy from recession.\n\nWe should also take steps to stop social service benefits given to many families having more than two children.\n\nThere are many families who deliberately have 6/7 children or more\njust to claim social service benefits and exclusively live on that. This is absolutely wrong and unethical. \n\nWhy should hard working people like me be burndened to pay for the \nsweet wishes of parents having so many children? Someone's sweet \ndesires to have many children can not be funded by hard working tax payers.\n\nPlease make a law that would stop paying social service benefits to parents having more than two kids. This law can be made effective one year from now.\n\nHowever, those who are already having more than two children and are\ncurrently abusing the social service benefits can be told to repay\nthe benefits so taken as soon as their kids reach 18 years.\n\n\nI think many hard working people like me would support this bill\n\n\nRegards\n\nAL KHAN",
