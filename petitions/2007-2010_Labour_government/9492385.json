It is also fairer on the already permanently employed people in the UK who pay to support others.\nThis is not aimed at persecuting disabled and genuine claimants who are looking for work, but to reward those who reject govenment help where not required, basically the hard working people of our society who do not claim anything while contributing a huge percentage of thier earnings to support others.",
