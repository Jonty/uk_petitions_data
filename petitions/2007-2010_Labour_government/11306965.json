        "background": "Reintroduce Usury Law to limit maximum interest rates to 8% above Bank of England rate.\n\nPreventing Usury (the charging of exhorbitant interest) in adddition to be being right, proper and moral, addresses and provides a remedy to the indebtness at the root of this nations dire economic situation. Limiting the maximum interest payable to 8% above Bank of England (BoE) rate provides relief to hundreds of thousands, millions, of people facing economic ruin. It addresses substantially the problem of lenders not passing on BoE rate cuts. It is beneficial for lenders as it enforces a reasonable maximum profit margin, reduces the defaults that have brought the banking industry to its knees and prevents greed overcoming  good practice. The law should apply to all loans, past, present and future from all lenders without exception..",
