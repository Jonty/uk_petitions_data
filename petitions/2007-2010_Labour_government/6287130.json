            "background": "We ask that the UK request a UN inquiry into human right violations in Guantanamo Bay. The Declaration of human right clearly states that:\n\nArticle 10.\nEveryone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.\n\nArticle 11.\n(1) Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.\n\nThe people detained have not had a public trial and therfore have also had their article 9 rights violated. That right being:\n\nArticle 9\n\nNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\n\nTherefore we call for the UK government to request a Inquiry by the UN and to request the closure of Guantanamo Bay.The UK is an independent country and is not a US colony.We need to stand up for our principles or the UK will simply be viewed as the next US state.",
