            "background": "There has been a steady rise in obesity during the last couple of decades. One of the major causes of this is easily available cheap food that is very unhealthy when eaten as part of a regular diet. However, the situation has been made worse by the price of fruit and veg steadily increasing making it difficult for people on a low income to afford to eat healthily. For reference my weekly shop is now about \u00a310-15 more expensive since I stopped buying the unhealthy food and buying more fruit and veg instead.\n\nI also think it is in the governments interest to get people to become healthier because this will reduce the cost to the NHS due to a decrease in obesity related illness.",
