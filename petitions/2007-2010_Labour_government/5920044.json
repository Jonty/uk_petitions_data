            "background": "For a long time now, we've all been hearing the claim that cannabis is much stronger than it was in the 1960s. Newspapers, politicians and even the government's own Talk to Frank website have made this claim that weed smoked today is more dangerous than weed of the 60s due to increased potency.\n\nHowever, I have never seen the research that concluded this, nor have I even seen a name of the people involved in the study or the institute that conducted it. \n\nThe fact is, we don't have enough data on cannabis of the 60s/70s to make a comparison about potency.\n\nI propose that they should either stop propagating this myth or provide some evidence for it.",
