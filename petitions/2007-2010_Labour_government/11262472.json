            "background": "We as European Playstation Network users believe that we are being treated unfairly and dismissively compared to the US and Asia, in terms of PSN content and more specifically in the on-line application Playstation Home.\n\nSCEE should be providing a better service in terms of content and additions to Playstation Home instead of adding items now and again, and charging us heavily for them. The US and ASIA versions of Home have much more locations at their disposal. SCEE has provided a substantial amount of broken promises, and let us down many a time.\n\nAll we ask, is that we receive our fair share of PSN content in and outside of Home, to rival that of our friends in the US and ASIA.",
