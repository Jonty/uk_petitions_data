Therefore, as someone who has also suffered the detrimental effects of having had this secret and vile practice done to myself, and having been told that there is no proof that this is occurring. I petition the Government to finally \"do the right thing\", and bring in specific and effective Legislation to outlaw this vile practice and to make it a Criminal offence for anyone caught doing it.",
