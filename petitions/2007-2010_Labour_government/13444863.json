            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Since the smoking ban came in to place it has been illegal to smoke in most premises that are open to the public and all places of work (some exceptions apply).\nThe ban has been welcomed by non-smokers and medical practitioners.\n \nThe problem is that smoking has moved from inside premises to the entrances and exits to those premises meaning that people that don\u2019t want to inhale cigarette smoke often have no choice because they have to walk through harmful smoke in doorways.\n\nThe problem exists not just outside pubs, but also shops, supermarkets, doctors\u2019 surgeries, motorway service stations, hospitals and many other public buildings.\n\nThe right to choose is something that smokers have and they can choose to smoke or not but non-smokers have no choice if they have to walk through clouds of smoke outside doorways.\n\nI propose that the government extend the smoking ban to the entrances and exits of public premises and workplaces, enforcing a minimum distance between smoking and entrances.",
