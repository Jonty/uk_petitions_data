At present, during the hours of darkness it is almost impossible to get an accurate fix on many addresses, with many houses and businesses not having visible numbers, to the point where you can drive an entire street and not once see a number. We would like to see a standard design of house number (ie LED) which is illuminated during the hours of darkness and which must be seen from the road.",
