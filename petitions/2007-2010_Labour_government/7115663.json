        "background": "I request the British Government to use its influence on Junta in Pakistan and convince the General to immediately hand over the charge to a neutral care taker, who should hold and ensure free and fair elections in 90 days. Otherwise the UK Government, with the help of EU, US and rest of the international community, should put sanctions against the dictator and his associates. This should include freezing of their assets, travel embargo and expulsion of their relatives from the UK, US and EU. Only this would hurt him and persuade him to cooperate. He needs to understand that Pakistanis deserve no less right to democracy, freedom of expression and above all rule of Law than any one else in the World. This is an opportunity for the Western Governments to let every one know that they have no different standards when it comes to promote democracy, rule of law and freedom of speech.",
