            "background": "In recent years there has been a renewed calling for cultural artefacts that were removed from one nation to be restored to their place of origin. Greece having become a thriving democracy   has secured a UN Resolution for the return of the Elgin Marbles. Like Greece, Wales has developed into a thriving democracy and believe that time is now right for Wales to reclaim her cultural artefacts.\nWe believe that the stones currently making up the structure known as Stonehenge were taken from Wales unfairly and that the British government should give consideration to the case for having the stones restored to Wales.",
