The aerodrome where they are based is threatened with closure, due to plans to build on the site. Being an aero club, it has to, by law, operate from a licensed aerodrome, of which it is the only one in Leicestershire. I ask you to sign this petition, in favour of keeping the UKs oldest aero club, and it's 500 strong membership base, in operation, from a very suitable base - Leicester Aerodrome!",
