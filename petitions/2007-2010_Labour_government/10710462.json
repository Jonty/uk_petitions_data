This petition also calls for the British arms trade to be disallowed to allow their products to be sold abroad.\nThis would allow the arms trade to be controlled and prevent illegal arms deals being perpetrated such as the arms sales to saudi Arabia which are currently being investigated and enable the government to make supplies for the troops a top priority and stop the manufacture of weapons that would otherwise be sold to foreign powers which would use them inappropriately.",
