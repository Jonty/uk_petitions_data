            "background": "In recent months there has been a marked increase in the discrimination against Christian, white, heterosexual, English males. Employment tribunals and even senior politicians in all of the  main parties have suggested that employment law should be loaded against these people (eg all women short lists), it doesn't seem to matter who is the best person for the job. This makes a mockery of the phrase 'equality and diversity'. It is only fair to those people who are trying to destroy the traditional family and people who hold a religious belief. This is a call to the Prime Minister to recognise that fairness is not one sided and to take steps to redress the balance.",
