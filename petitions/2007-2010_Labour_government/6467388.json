He was breech from 30 weeks+ and it was left too late for an ECV (turning of the baby) to work.\nIt was due to this midwifes late referal that the ECV failed, and the caesarean was pushed upon me.\nThere should be more support for women to labour naturally, even if caesarean is needed the woman should at least go into labour first. Breech births are heard of and is possible yet i was practically forced to make the caesarean choice.",
