        "background": "The detection rate for hepatitis C in this country is depressingly low compared with our European neighbours. It would save an awful lot of lives and health resources if more cases were detected early as by the time symptoms appear serious liver damage has often occurred and treatment success rates are much lower. The cost of adding hepatitis C testing to the proposed blood tests would be minimal, and would actually result in a nett saving to the NHS as early treatment saves on costly later care which often requires liver transplantation. It is estimated that there are currently up to half a million undetected cases in the UK at present. This is a golden opportunity which should not be missed.",
