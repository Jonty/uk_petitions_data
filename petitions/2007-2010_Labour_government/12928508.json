He was a kind, decent, honest and loving man. Having one day to honour this great person, just doesnt seem enough. The world has lost one of the greatest musicians to ever grace our planet. Having one day in honour of this amazingly talented person seems only fair. One international holiday bringing together millions of people across the world to pay tribute to this angel who was came in the form of Michael Jackson.",
