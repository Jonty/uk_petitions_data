We believe it is now time for Her Majesty The Queen to restore faith, hope and a sense of justice, by illustrating that power and responsibility should not and does not continually corrupt. This can only be achieved by Dissolving Parliament and calling for fresh elections.\n\nDissolving Parliament is the only way to prove to future politicians and MPs that conduct such as we have recently experienced will never be tolerated.\nPlease sign this petition to show your hurt caused by these immoral activities.",
