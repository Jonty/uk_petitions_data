            "background": "Monies for the Health Service, for example for additional winter beds, went in one Trust to offset the deficit of years. In another, cars were bought with the additional funding and leased by consultants. In education, LEA's retained money at the centre instead of giving it directly to schools;and the disparity of pupil funding from LEA to LEA continues. \nThe question of banking bonuses is another area of contention.\nMonies should have strings attached, and be transparent to an audit trail.Because of the credit crunch and the need to inject billions in to the economy,the matter of ring fencing is urgent and attractive to detractors of this policy. It needs to be spelled out as the checks and balances of prudent fiscal policy.",
