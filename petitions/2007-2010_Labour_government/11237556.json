            "background": "When anyone starts employment within a school, college, or any organisation working with children or vulnerable adults they have to be CRB checked. This is generally paid for by the employer however, from October 2009, new staff will have to apply for an ISA and pay \u00a364 pounds for registration (no fee for voluntary workers). Education-wise, this will affect school dinner ladies, school and college support staff, governors and principals. Existing staff will also have to pay this fee, sometime over the 5 year phase-in period and there is absolutely guarantee or even indication that this will be covered by the employer.  I believe that low-paid workers should not be forced to pay this extra cost themselves.",
