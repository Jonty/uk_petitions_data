        "background": "The Home Office proposes that from 2011, children should learn that violence against women and girls is unacceptable.\n\nMen are still statistically more likely to be the victims of violence in the UK and claims of domestic violence against men are rising.\n\nTo spend yet more time and money focusing on women and girls only as the victims of violence is a clear case of sexual discrimination. Violence against everybody is wrong and we should not focus on one gender. \n\nFrom 2011 classes should also teach that violence against men and boys is just as unacceptable as violence against women and girls.",
