            "background": "We all know that we must do more to help prevent global warming, recycle, car share and help the environment but I find it anoying and patronising when so many taxes are justified by providing a 'GREEN' allusion to them.\n\nIt appears that by using the 'green' cause to justify such taxes Government believe that we will all just accept them and not challenge them because they are supposedly good for the environment and thereby by association us all.\n\nWe need combined multi-country action to reduce the effects of global warming; not to raise punitive taxes that hurt the poor or those of us trying to live responsibly on a budget.\n\nI suspect that the PM has good intentions, but it would be good to see him take the lead in negotiations with other nations and not just tax our own citizens even more.",
