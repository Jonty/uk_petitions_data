            "background": "Currently antisocial behaviour is dealt with by joint efforts from local authorities and the police.  Naturally the police are the first point of call, however they currently have few powers to deal with antisocial behaviour until a crime is actually committed.  Sadly in so many cases antisocial behaviour has culminated in attacks and a number of tragic murders.  If the law were to be changed it would empower police forces to act against antisocial behaviour earlier and hence reduce the risk of crimes resulting from escalating behaviour incidents. Senior police officers would also be able to request the additional resources with which to deal with this growing social problem and hopefully put an end to antisocial behaviour once and for all.",
