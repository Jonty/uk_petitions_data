            "background": "It's obvious that meats require far greater amounts of resources to produce than vegetables. Their environmental impact is also correspondingly greater. Given the need to reduce our aggregate consumption of increasingly scarce resources, it therefore makes sense to provide incentives for people to reduce their consumption of meat - via a tax. This should shift consumption to better foods like fruits and vegetables, which should also improve peoples' health.",
