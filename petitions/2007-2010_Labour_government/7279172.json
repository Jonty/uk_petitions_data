        "background": "I feel we need two sets of anthems as other commonwealth realms have. I would like to call on the government to retain God Save the Queen as the royal anthem and to have Rule Britannia as the national anthem this is by far, a more rousing and patriotic piece that can relate to all nations in the UK, I feel that it is a far more inspiring piece of music and by using this method of two anthems we can retain our royal connection and have a anthem that truly reflects our proud nation and the things it has and can achieve.",
