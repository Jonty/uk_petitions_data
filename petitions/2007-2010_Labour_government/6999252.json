        "background": "The Guardian has reported a secret document advising Gordon Brown to dilute the agreement, stating high costs to achieve this aim and it undermining the future of Nuclear Power Stations. At a time when scientists agree carbon emissions are accumulating more rapidly in the atmosphere, it is not right for Mr. Brown to back down on such an agreement. Costs now are nothing compared to the costs and damage that will be caused by not hitting this target. Please sign now to send a strong message to Gordon Brown that we will not accept him backing down on saving the planet! Mr. Brown, join Angela Merkel in spearheading this Agreement in December.",
