            "background": "Following an article in the Daily Mirror on 13/05/08, it would appear that courts have been instructed to 'go easy on thugs carrying weapons'.\n\nThe article states that 'knife carrying thugs could soon escape jail with just a fine or community service'. The article then adds that 'Cannabis dealers will also avoid prison under guidelines released to magistrates'.\n\nWe would like a full explanation as to how this is viewed as 'getting tough' on knife crime, and instead we would like to see tougher and much longer sentences for these crimes.\n\nThere is a growing trend for young people to carry knifes out onto our streets to be used solely as weapons, and we need to send out a clear message that this is totally unacceptable.",
