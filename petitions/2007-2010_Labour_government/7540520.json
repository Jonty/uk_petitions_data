            "background": "Today,people still talk about our achievements back in 1982. They talk about the British Forces being the best in the world. They talk about the Task Force doing a fantastic job against innumerable odds.\nWe now realise that without the islanders support, we may not have done so, so easily. We would have still achieved our goal but at a greater cost to servicemens lives.\nWe petition the government to recognise their efforts and make an award to the Islands, such as the George Cross, that was awarded to Malta during WWII.",
