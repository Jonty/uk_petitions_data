        "background": "In Uk alone an estimate 10.5 million tonnes of packaging waste was generated in 2006. Around half is waste from households and once in landfill it takes up to 400years to degrade. Its also expensive as it cost a lot a year to an average family's food bill. As reported in October 2007, council may be given the green light from next year to charge housholders even more depending on the ammount of rubbish they throw away - scheme called Pay as you Throw?! But we as consumers often don't have choice when it comes to packaging - supermarkets are overpackaging and we dont say anything and its costing us money. I feel manufactures should also take responsibility and package less",
