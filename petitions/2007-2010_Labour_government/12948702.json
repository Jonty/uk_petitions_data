        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Suffering from a long term neurological condition such as Parkinson's Disease, the three main symptoms of which are tremor, stiffness & rigidity and loss of fine motor movement, the 28 day repeat prescription rule causes acute anxiety to patients whose symptoms not only vary from day to day but from hour to hour during the day.  The 28 day rule was introduced to eliminate waste of prescribed medication; those with long term conditions are wholly dependant upon appropriate medication and, therefore, unlikely to cause wastage.  They should not be subject to the 28 day repeat prescription rule.",
