            "background": "For many students long summer vacations, that they are meant to enjoy, are spent working full time jobs. Not only does this fill their spare time, contribute to the economy and of course earn some money to either pay off overdrafts, credit card debts, personal debts and the like amounted over the course of the academic year, or just help them through the year ahead. So why is it right they should pay national insurance even if they end up earning less than the tax allowance??",
