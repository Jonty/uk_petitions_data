            "background": "This petition is focussed on ensuring the stability of \"The Family\" unit when going through the trauma of a break-up to minimise the damage that may be caused to their children.\n\nMany families will I am sure get caught up in emotional issues such that both parties can lose sight of where their priorities lie (the children).  Once the parties enter the court system matters become much more adversarial and whatever problems the parties may have been experiencing are magnified ten fold.  \n\nI would STRONGLY recommend that for ANY and all FAMILY matters required to be addressed in court relating to children, that Mediation should be an obligatory step prior to attendance in court.  In many cases the parties will realise the error of their ways and reconciliation may be possible; this clearly benefits the children and the state.  If reconciliation is not possible I would STRONGLY suggest that it makes absolute sense that the parties agree between themselves matters concerning access to children etc.. \n\nThe current system exacerbates and makes worse relations between parties going through/post divorce.",
