            "background": "I am a grandparent of 4 children. I gave up work to care for my daughters 2 sons so obviously I need to be paid. The tax credit system does not allow people to claim child care benefits unless the carer has an OFSTED registration number. This can cause many problems as OFSTED will not register a person if they only intend to look after their own grandchildren.\nThe government must find some system that allows Grandparents to be paid and the parents to claim child care cost. After all, we should be encouraging family and not forcing people to put their children into nursery etc.",
