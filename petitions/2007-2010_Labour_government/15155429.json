My child cried for an hour because he saw a child drinking dirty water in a charity advert during Kids TV. My child cried because tigers were dying out - he is 3 Years old. If children aren't allowed to see adverts about fast food why are they allowed to see this??  My child does not have a VISA card or a MASTERCARD or a Debit Card of any kind so why are guilt tripping adverts aimed at him when he is so young and impressionable when they do nothing but damage his innocence!!!  This is just ridiculous!",
