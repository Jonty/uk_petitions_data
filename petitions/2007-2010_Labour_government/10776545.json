            "background": "The supply of energy from abroad makes us vulnerable, and our power companies are owned by foreign entities. It is too late to renationalise the utilities, but the British people must own the renewables - Sun, Wind and Wave. We ask that the Prime Minister consider a national organisation which will exploit our indigenous renewables, promote research and bring affordable power to the people of Britain, for the benefit of the people of Britain. We ask that this new organisation be given all necessary powers, people, resources and protection to serve its vital purpose - to decrease our dependence on foreign entities for our energy needs.",
