            "background": "Guyanna has offered the largest untouched tract of primary rainforest in the world to Britain in return for aid. The population of Guyanna is the same as liverpool, this offer has been on the table for two years and finally will receive a reply this year.  should we decline the offer the alternative for Guyanna is to open the forest up  to logging for a short term high profit but as we know long term it is unsustainable and damaging to the world's climate. by accepting this offer Britain could lead the world in conservation and research, and provide Guyanna with a viable sustainable income from eco tourism.",
