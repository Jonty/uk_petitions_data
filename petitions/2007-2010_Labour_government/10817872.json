            "background": "Youth curfews are unjust and grossly unfair- they punish a whole demographic group for the actions of a few in that group.  Despite what certain media sources would like people to think, the vast majority of persons under 16 are law-abiding and polite, often more-so than their so-called \"elders and betters\". \n\nIf such a curfew was applied to any other demographic or religious group, there would (quite rightly) be an outrage. Some adults commit crimes as well, but you never see the adults that argue for youth curfews arguing that a curfew should be placed on themselves as well, no matter how much crime it could reduce.\n\nI see nothing wrong with placing curfews on individuals who have actually committed crimes, but I believe that it is wrong to generalise a whole group in this way, as well as it being a breach of most basic human rights- Young people are people too!",
