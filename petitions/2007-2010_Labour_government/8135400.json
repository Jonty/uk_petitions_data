        "background": "After seeing the media circus surrounding the death of actor Heath Ledger in New York, I propose a petition to compel the Prime Minister to toughen media intrusion laws so that individuals [famous or not] are protected from media harassment in life and death. The reporting of Mr Ledger's tragic demise by the main UK news bodies, [for example publishing pictures of Mr Ledger's body being taken from his apartment and from the funeral home] has justified the actions of downright disrespectful, disgraceful media leeches and this is unacceptable. \n\nEveryone has the right to live their life free from harassment. Fair enough if celebrities are at work functions they have to accept media interest but the stalking of them on their downtime is unacceptable.\n\nIf we take away their fuel the fire will die.",
