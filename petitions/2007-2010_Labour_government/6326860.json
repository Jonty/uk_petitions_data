If, however, Doctor Who does not carry the Olympic Flame in 2012, we could be in a whole heap of trouble. \n\nIn order to prevent serious and lasting damage to the fabric of time itself, we urge the Prime Minister to allow Doctor Who to carry the Olympic Flame for some part of its final journey.\n\nDavid Tennant or whoever's doing the part in 2012. \n\nWe don't much care, really.",
