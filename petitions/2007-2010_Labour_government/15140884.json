Many People are out of work at this time due to the finiacial climate. Jobs are being cut pay is being cut. But still this country allows immigrants to arrive in this country taking what little jobs britain has to offer at this time. Its about time Gorden Brown and the rest of his clown posse shut the doors to britain. and sort out whats going on here jobs for british people first. Ive heard people say that the british wouldn't like to do the odd jobs like bus drivers, cleaners, etc But nowadays as there are not many jobs people will take anything for work. Also Why let a 3rd world country be part of the EU, Which will drain the other countries resources. Goverment lives in a cooko land",
