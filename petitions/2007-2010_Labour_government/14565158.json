            "background": "Sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, hypermobility syndrome, and other such chronic conditions can go through periods when their ability to function is severely impaired. The current rules for claiming ESA do not recognise the validity of myalgia, arthralgia, malaise or severe sleep disruption. This causes distress and humiliation for sufferers who are often forced to appeal decisions, or to work when unfit thereby causing themselves further health problems. We ask that this family of incapacities be correctly recognised so that people who experience chronic pain and chronic fatigue can claim ESA when they need it.",
