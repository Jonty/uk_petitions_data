        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I would like the Government to change its policy regarding how it collects council tax. Bare with me, if income tax is collected by way of how much you earn rightly so, as it iused to pay for hospitals, education and the benefit system. Why not collect local government tax in the same way for all those who are PAYE it comes out your wages and its sorted. Ok there will be some who say oh its going to be awkward for self-employed etc etc but if its so difficult why has the system not changed, for income tax. Surely your ability to pay council tax should be based on your earnings not a figure that everyone has to pay. imagine if INCOME TAX decided everyone has to pay \u00a33000.00 a year regardless of income, i know people will say thats what the benefit system is for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.\nWhat about a family who only just dont qualify for C/T benefit paying the same as someone next door who earns \u00a3100,000 a year. If we as a society beleive i price fits all why do people have to pay more for first class travel, why not have all housing costs the same for everyone then maybe people could actually afford to live in a HOME.",
