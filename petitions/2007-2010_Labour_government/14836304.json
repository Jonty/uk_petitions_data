            "background": "Every time I go to a Petrol station, I find it frustrating & annoying that I am limited to using Petrol (or diesel in other cars), which is bad for the environment & is expensive.\n\nWouldn't it be better for the environment if there was a pump for Alcohol or Pure Biodiesel? Wouldn't that substantially reduce Global Warming? And wouldn't that mean you could reintroduce the fuel price escalator on fossil fuels & reduce the deficit?\n\nThere is so much wool around this subject, but I think a determined government could easily make this happen & thus put us years ahead of our competitors.",
