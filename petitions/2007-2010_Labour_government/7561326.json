        "background": "More and more people and businesses are getting effected by the file sharing bug which is spreading more and more each day. We're here to represent those effected by the illegal audio distribution.\n\nElectronic music producers, DJ's, Bands, record labels (everyone involved in the creation \\ distribution of music) are all getting very tired of the lack of support against illegal trading. The one thing we all love and enjoy is slowly getting destroyed and while the big commercial labels and artists may not be feeling the over all effects of it (yet) there are certainly small underground scenes who are getting seriously effected by this and even some major distributors going bankrupt.\n\nA bigger stand needs to be taken, we need to crack down on illegal file distribution, the applications used to share audio are used to share other medias such as video and images, both of which have at least some support and some people being brought to justice -  but audio seems to be over looked in all of this, none of it is right - none of it should be happening, more needs to be done to prevent it.",
