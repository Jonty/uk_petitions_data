            "background": "Daytime Radio 1 actively promotes it's listeners to tune into the ITV television show the Xfactor, a so called talent show.\n\nThe winner of this show will then be promoted by the BBC's radio shows. This to me is blatant manipulation of the public by both licenced broadcasting companies in order to make money from the public, monopolising all forms of media.\n\nRadio 1 asks it's listeners to text and e-mail in their requests to be played, despite this they refuse to play music requested that is not Xfactor friendly.\n\nI request this issue to be raised in Parliament as a matter of public interest",
