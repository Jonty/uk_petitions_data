We believe the same should apply to cats otherwise the law is discriminatory.\n\nFines applied to those who allow their dogs to foul on public highways should be extended to include cat owners. Cats not only foul our streets and gardens constantly, they also cause damage to private property. \n\nCats can also be vicious and have been known to cause injury to people and animals alike. If all people deserve the same treatment, why not animals too?",
