This action must have be sanctioned. The estate should be confiscated or at the very least shooting on this estate should be prohibited for at least a year. The perpetrators should in my opinion be punished for their atrocious actions.  \nPeople should be educated beyond the mentality of the need to kill something with a gun purely for pleasure. That these estates continue to exist  at all in the twenty first century cannot be justified. Please reposses the land for the people and stamp out this priviledged class whose brains are no better than their horses. \n\nAngrily Trevor Davies.\n\nPS No wonder we feel powerless when we see these idiots carrying out such actions with virtual impunity.",
