            "background": "An increasing number of stores are displaying prominent signs at checkouts reading \"Under 25? ID Required!!!\" or suchlike. \n\nThese signs are humiliating and degrading, and effectively brand such persons as second-class citizens.\n\nWhilst we realise that there is a serious problem with underage drinking and knife ownership, signs of this kind are not the solution. In fact they may be exacerbating the problem by creating justifiable anger and resentment in persons of that age-group, who see themselves as being made outcasts from society.\n\nA law is needed, banning any kind of signage in retail outlets which stigmatises certain age-groups.",
