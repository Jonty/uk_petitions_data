            "background": "Essentially this petition is requesting that all of those who's reckless deals and profiteering have caused the credit crunch be held to account for their actions. \n\nAs it is these people can make outrageous gambles knowing that if they are lucky then they generate vast sums of money. However if they make huge gambles and lose (as is the case in the present situation) then the government comes and bails them out. This is a no lose situation for bankers. However we now have to suffer from the damage they cause. \n\nThe effect on those super rich will be minimal, they walk away with the profit from reckless gambles without having to shoulder the cost of any failure. This is not right or fair.\n\nBankers should certainly at the very least be made to pay back their vast bonuses into government coffers to help cover the cost of their failure and I am damn sure there's more than a few who should end up in Jail.",
