            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We, the undersigned, ask the government to regulate against mobile networks from passing on self-incurred costs to us, the customers. In paying high premiums to a phone manufacturer (i.e. Nokia, Apple etc) for a certain handset to be 'locked' to their specific network, the cost of their agreement is passed on to the customer, and we strongly argue that the mobile phone market would be better off without such agreements. Costs would be lower and it would allow for fairer competition between networks, resulting in better deals for consumers.  As you may know, this is currently law in many European countries such as Italy, Belgium and the Czech Republic, where competition is fairer due to these regulations.\n\nIt's now come to the point where networks are in the position to overcharge customers, either deliberately or due to the manufacturers demands. If network locks were illegal, this sort of thing wouldn't happen.\n\nWe ask you to look into this matter and announce plans to stop mobile networks from entering into agreements that restrict fair competition and end up costing consumers unnecessarily.",
