The congestion around this area is bad enough during the rush hour, these lights are making it worse. Traffic is spilling over into the residential area of Irlam as well. It's bad enough that this is the only driving route in and out of Irlam. There is no need for these lights, they have no real purpose and no positive effect whatsoever.",
