            "background": "70% of drivers in the UK have admitted to driving over the speed limit. Over all collisons are down but the amount of bad drivers on Britains roads has risen ten fold to the point where even in a small journey you can recognise a number of bad drivers. From tailgating to speeding and pulling out into traffic, these selfish individuals are putting thousands of lives at risk. The goverment should re-make the driving test introducing a system similar to that in sweden where it can take a number of years to pass your test. New drivers need to be trained to a higher standard and those who do break the law or are reported as being a bad driver should face higher penalties and have to re-take driving tests or have their vehicle seised by police. There should aslo be more police patrols looking out for bad drivers as currently there is nobody out their stopping people from breaking the law and endangering lives in the public roads",
