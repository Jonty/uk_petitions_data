            "background": "Two Labour peers who were willing to be bribed to help rewrite the law for the benefit of a wealthy client are to have their membership of the House of Lords withdrawn for six months.  Both Lord Taylor and Lord Truscott were found guilty of misconduct after making it clear they would take money for helping to alter legislation.  Suspended from the Lords until the end of the parliamentary session, they will not face criminal charges as the police have already dropped their investigation. Lord Taylor is currently suspended from the Labour Party, while Lord Truscott quit the party earlier this week.  If any of us, citizens, were to do this, we would be dismissed and probably face charges.  Please sign this petition to register your dismay over these continuing financial revelations.",
