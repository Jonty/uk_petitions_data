Back in the early 90's, people or organisations could only have 20% of the UK market in order to prevent biased and skewed reporting. This was dropped in the light of developing satalite TV as Mr Murdoch was given free rein by the then Tory government to do with it pretty much what he liked.\n\nThe state of media reporting in the UK today is almost as bad as the state controlled media of the former USSR. Rupert Murdoch himself has admitted on TV to manipulating the news for his own agenda. How is this being allowed?",
