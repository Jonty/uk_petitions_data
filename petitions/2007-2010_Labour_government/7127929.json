        "background": "Gateshead Council and the owners of the site, supermarket giant Tesco confirmed the demolition of the car park. If plans move at planned speed then the car park, according to Gateshead Council, will be demolished in Spring 2008. The shops in the shopping centre down below will close at the end of January, in readiness for the demolition. The demolition of the shops, which were also built around the same time and are also in serious decline, will start in (at the earliest) November 2007. Tesco will rebuild their current supermarket on the site and new public spaces and a cinema are amongst the plans for the redevelopment of Gateshead.\n\nGiven that this is one of the UK's finest examples of Brutalist architecture we ask that it be saved.",
