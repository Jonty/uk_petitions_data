As the jobs get harder, the pay always fails to match the output of the individual.  Teachers, nurses and police officers hours are never brought up, the pressures are never discussed and the pay, never improved upon.  When the Prime Minister is flaunting himself with footballers who earn in a WEEK what a teacher does in TWO YEARS, it is nothing but disgusting.",
