            "background": "As it becomes more and more obvious that many MPs, including these of high office who should really know better, have been milking the system for all it's worth, it is time for the Citizens of Great Britain to stand up and call for these who have abused the expenses system to be shown the way out. They may say that they stayed within the rules, however, that's very easy to do if you write the rules yourself. They also are now extremely eager to let us know that they are more that willing to pay back the money that they have claimed by \"mistake\". These people are the people who have been elected to govern our country; it beggars belief. Let's kick them OUT.",
