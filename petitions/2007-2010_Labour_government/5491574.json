        "background": "Changing the name of the Department for Trade and Industry is unnecessary. Even if the department's remit has slightly changed, the old name would continue to function perfectly well. \n\nThe new name, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is too long, unpronounceable as an acronym (\"DBERR\") and the change over will be hugely costly. \n\nForeign firms who are familiar with the DTI will need to be notified of its new name. And the new name will not translate into all languages (how does Business differ from Enterprise?).\n\nThis petition urges the Prime Minister to retain the name: the DTI.\n\nOn cost grounds alone, with the memory of the Olympic Logo fiasco still fresh, we hope he will take rapid action.\n\nKeep the DTI!",
