Is it fair that they should continue to have legislative powers - making our laws without paying our taxes?\n\nIf the Bill is enacted, no-one will be able to become a member of the House of Lords unless they are resident in the UK for taxation purposes.  Existing members will have to choose to pay UK tax, or take a lifetime leave of absence from the house.",
