        "background": "The House of Lords (Members' Taxation Status) Bill aims to make members of the House of Lords pay tax in this country.\n\nA number of Lords have chosen to avoid UK tax by choosing to be officially domiciled in other countries.  Is it fair that they should continue to have legislative powers - making our laws without paying our taxes?\n\nIf the Bill is enacted, no-one will be able to become a member of the House of Lords unless they are resident in the UK for taxation purposes.  Existing members will have to choose to pay UK tax, or take a lifetime leave of absence from the house.",
