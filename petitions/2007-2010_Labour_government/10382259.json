            "background": "I petition the Prime minister to reduce the amount that lorries and cars can hold in their tanks that use transport between the UK and other countries to no more than 5 gallons.\n\nIn our present economical downturn it seems strange that we use extra fuel in ships and to power our trains just in order to move an excess of fuel from one place to another stored in vehicle tanks.\n\nBy restricting this amount to a reasonable 5 Gallons it would have the following effects.\n\n1. Stop lorries coming into this country with cheaper fuel in their tanks and not contributing anything to the UK tax system whilst being able to operate with cheaper overheads.\n\n2. Reduce the amount of fuel required to move these fuel laden vehicles from A to B and therefore reducing our carbon footprint.\n\n3. Make for potentially safer crossings by minimising the risk of spillage and fires.\n\n4. Increasing the number of vehicles that could use cross channel transportation due to reduced vehicle weight.\n\nA plan for the future, A plan to save our futures.\n\nThank you\n\nMark Curtlin",
