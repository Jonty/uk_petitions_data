            "background": "I am suggesting that those on state pensions, or other benefits claimed for permanent disabilities (not in the job market) to be able to reside anywhere in europe without loss of their state income. to these people, there is no reason they should have to live in england, as long as they are british citizens and have paid their dues they should remain in receipt of their full benefit entitlement even if they choose to live in france, spain, or any other part of the EU. we should demand this right as members of the EU and the government should recognize the advantages to health and wellbeing that living in warmer climates could give to the elderly, disabled, and long term sick.",
