            "background": "The current structure of the minimum wage agreement is unfair. Currently, workers aged 22 or over can expect a minimum wage of \u00a35.52 per hour, whilst those aged 18 \u2013 21 can only expect \u00a34.60 \u2013 and those aged 16-17 years old can only anticipate a minimum of \u00a33.40. Whether you are 17 or 62, an hour's work deserves the protection of the same minimum wage, ie \u00a35.52 per hour.  This is an issue that is being pursued by the British Youth Council and this petition supports their endeavours.",
