            "background": "MI5 do not think this extention is necessary, neither does the Director of Public Prosecution or large numbers of senior police officers. It is incompatible  with the EU Convention on Human Rights and would have to be withdrawn if challenged in court. Also its likely effect would be that of internment on the IRA by increasing the alienation of minorities and the increase of those joining terrorist organisations. It goes against all justice and democratic nature to hold someone without charge for that unnecessary amount of time, it is simply wrong.",
