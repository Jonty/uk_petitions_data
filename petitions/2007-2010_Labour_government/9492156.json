            "background": "Killing somone by a car is just the same as picking up a knife and killing someone. If you knowingly compromise your driving and therefore other road users safety,and then that results in someones death, it cannot go unpunished, not merely by a fine and some points. Its the same as knowingly picking up a knife and stabbing someone.\nFor example - man killed outright by a woman driving at 50mph on the wrong side of the road with her head below the dash - charge is driving without due care and attention - received - points and a fine.\n25 year old man killed by a man doing 85mph and overtaking 9 cars, causes young man to swerve out of his way as he does not pull in and this causes the young man to hit another car - killed outright. Speeding man receives fine and points.\nThis is just two examples of people getting away with taking a life, and whats more disgusting is that the life has a price put on it by fining the offender! But not only that, the law still lets them drive around? Waiting for it to happen again.\nIts wrong.The law needs changing.",
