They should not be penalised financially for their commitment.\"\n(from \"NUT 09-10 Your Finances: Facts and Figures\")\n\n\nIt is completely UNFAIR to reward postgraduate students for their decision to teach whilst neglecting their undergraduate colleagues who decide from the start that their passion is in teaching and education.  \n\nThis particularly affects those students training for primary education, where the most relevant degree is a BEd or a BA/QTS, as a subject-specific undergraduate degree is not a prerequisite for primary QTS training.",
