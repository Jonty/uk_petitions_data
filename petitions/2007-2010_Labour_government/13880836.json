        "background": "\"BEd and BA/QTS students do not receive the financial incentives which are available to PGCE students [Golden Hellos and Teaching Grants].\n\nAs soon as they enrol for their three or four year course, undergraduate students indicate their dedication to teaching.  They should not be penalised financially for their commitment.\"\n(from \"NUT 09-10 Your Finances: Facts and Figures\")\n\n\nIt is completely UNFAIR to reward postgraduate students for their decision to teach whilst neglecting their undergraduate colleagues who decide from the start that their passion is in teaching and education.  \n\nThis particularly affects those students training for primary education, where the most relevant degree is a BEd or a BA/QTS, as a subject-specific undergraduate degree is not a prerequisite for primary QTS training.",
