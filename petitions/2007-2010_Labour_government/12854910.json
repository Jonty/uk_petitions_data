It is the only centre in North Wales providing such a spectrum of support services for victims of sexual violence.  Staff and volunteers work harder and harder to meet the demand placed on their services with no funding from the sectors that make referalls to them.  This work is vital to our society and requires urgent financial support to safeguard a valuable asset.\n\nPlease sign this petition if you would like to help keep RASA North Wales open.",
