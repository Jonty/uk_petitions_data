            "background": "Current policy is to ONLY award medals to service personnel on completion of 30 continuous days service in Iraq.  Service personnel are frequently called upon to leave the country before re-entering therefore, they can serve for much more 30 days accumulatively but unable to fulfil the continuous requirement and are therefore NOT being awarded the medal.  This is madness!  Give our boys what they deserve and change this policy!!!",
