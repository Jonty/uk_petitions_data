        "background": "Post Office Ltd has announced the closure of three post offices in Harrow West.\n\nThe branches proposed for closure are:\n\nPinner Green 5 Pinner Green Pinner HA5 2AF, The Hill, 82 High Street, Harrow HA1 3LW and Headstone Gardens, 3 The Quadrant, Headstone Gardens Harrow HA2 6PN. All three Post Offices are a vital community resource - especially to residents without access to the internet, people on low incomes, people without transport, people with limited mobility and local businesses -all of whom deserve an accessible postal network.\n\nWe reject the closure and ask that the Government looks again at new ways of allowing sub-post offices to provide the new services that will secure their future.\n\nPost Office Ltd must be held to account and must be made to justify any closures. Please show your support for our local post offices in Harrow by signing this petition.",
