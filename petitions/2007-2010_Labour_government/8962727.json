            "background": "As more and more petrol stations are being turned into mini supermarkets, they are now lacking all\nessential vehicle supplies. It should be a legal requirement that a petrol station stocks the basic supplies required to run a vehicle.\nie: Brake, clutch & engine oils, bulbs & fuses and also have a working air pump.\n\nMost people probably already assume garages will stock these items. But now, you are more likely to be able to buy a bag of onions rather then a litre of oil.\nIt's disgusting that supermarkets can fill petrol stations with whatever they please, surly a petrol station should supply basic requirements of the vehicles that use them.\n\nPetrol stations should be there for the people and their vehicles. Not just to maximise supermarket profits.\n\nPower to the people!",
