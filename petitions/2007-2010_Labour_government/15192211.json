The work carried out there is said to have shortened WWII by 2 years saving possibly 22 million lives. \n\nBletchley Park houses many exhibits and working rebuilds of machines such as the Bombe and the Colossus, forerunners of today's computers, invented to mechanize codebreaking. \n\nBletchley Park should be made a National Museum so that our heritage is preserved for future generations.",
