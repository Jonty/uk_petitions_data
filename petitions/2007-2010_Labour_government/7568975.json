            "background": "Why is it that it socially acceptable to call English people 'Brits' and yet it is socially frowned upon or moreover considered racial abuse to call people from tha Indian sub-continent 'Pakis'.\n\nIt should be that both terms are treated with equal dismay and the user educated to the exact nationality of the recipient.\n\nPlease stop using the term 'Brit' I am English, just like someone from the Indian sub-continent may be Indian, Pakistani etc and not labelled just a 'Paki'.\n\nUntil the media, politicians and society in general distances itself from crass termonology then respect and racial harmony will sadly not happen.\n\nWe must all respect and accept each other and their wishes.",
