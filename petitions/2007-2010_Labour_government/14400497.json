            "background": "The target population that fashion designers/media/models portray on our catwalks is not a true representaion of the target population that actually buy their products.  The results show that young teenagers whom aspire to their look are increasing in serious psychological amd mental health disorders and even death.  Curvy women are a true and natural representation of our culture the showing of ribs and bones on the catwalk is not natural.  Airbrushing in pictures in the magazines also portray a false image of how women should be when in reality even the women in these pictures are not the true inage of them.  Please sign this petition and ban the size zero image on our catwalk and in the mnedia for good.",
