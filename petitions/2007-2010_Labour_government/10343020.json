            "background": "If a European police force does not exist, he should be willing to say in both public and the House of Commons that it would not be allowed in the United Kingdom.\nIf a European Police force does exist he should state both in public and the House of Commons that it would not be allowed in the United Kingdom. Various reasons fo not allowing this are:\n\nPolice forces in Europe have military structures with ranks such as Colonel.\nEach policeman is armed with military style weapons (automatic rifles etc).\nPolice in the United Kingdom are a civilian force.\nEuropean police forces do not have local policeforces such as Avon and Somerset police but are controlled centrally.\nPolice Officers are rotated around entire countries and are not able to build up a local knowledge of the area.\nEuropean police have a tradition of upholding the authority of the state, UK police are used as law enforcement.\nOther reasons include a police force being controlled by the EU rather than the UK parliament.",
