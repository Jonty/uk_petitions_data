            "background": "The A23/M23 between Brighton and M25 needs some signage that can warn of dangerous conditions like flooding, crashes, fog, congestion and closure.  I would like to see a data sign at the Brighton end (A27), near pease pottage, gatwick and M25 approach.  When this route is close there is no adequate alternate route marked out. These are often flooded or blocked by lost travellers. Accidents could be reduced by adding distance markers on the road to ease teritorial driving. Local flood/aquaplane spots could also be signed. There is no web site to give a live update of key routes with backup route planners to check when leaving work to attempt to go home.",
