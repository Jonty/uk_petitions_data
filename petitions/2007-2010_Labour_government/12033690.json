            "background": "Potential students, those who save some, spend some, and aren't in debt, are the least to blame for the recession, and yet we are to be punished for it. It's bad enough that because of the generation before us we'll have a horrible time trying to find jobs on graduation, but if university tuition fees are raised by the proposed amount, we will be facing this with an average debt of nearly \u00a330,000. Moreover, if university becomes a privilege rather than a choice, what sort of society will we be living in? Education for the rich only? Apart from in Scotland of course, who still allow their students tuition for free. Don't let this happen to the rest of the UK, sign the petition, please. Thank you.",
