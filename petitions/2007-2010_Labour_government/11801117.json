            "background": "Online gambling is a very profitable business. However, there isn't an independent governing body or government based body monitoring these sites and therefore protecting UK consumers. This means that UK consumers aren't safe on these sites. It only takes a quick search on google to read numerous accounts from people complaining of unfair treatment, unethical practices and unfair game play.\n\nA particularly worrying aspect of the lack restrictions to online gambling is it's addictive nature. It's also becoming more and more easier for under 18's to play on these sites.",
