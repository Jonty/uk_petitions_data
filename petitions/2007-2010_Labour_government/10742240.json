            "background": "This is a busy, essential office in a poor area of the town. It serves 1000 people per week and many businesses use it regularly. There is a considerable increase in housing proposed for the area which will probably be approved in 2010. Many of the local residents are unable to reach the proposed alternative offices due to lack of bus services,no personal transport,infirmity\nvery low income and small children. This office provides the only banking services south of the River Avon in the town and has free and affordable parking available so many from outside the area also rely on its services. The local MP, County Council, District and Town Councils, District Councillors and Mayor all support this petition. \nThis area of Evesham was the worst affected by the severe flooding last year and local businesses struggling to re-establish need help with regeneration not the closure of an essential service. Please save this Post Office in Bengeworth.",
