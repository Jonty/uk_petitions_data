        "background": "In Northern Ireland, when a driver first passes their test they are restricted to 45MPH and must display R Plates for their first year of driving.\n\nI propose that this scheme is extended to the rest of the UK as it helps new drivers  get used to being on the road.\n\nAlthough I do feel that restricted drivers should be limited to 60MPH on motorways as to reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nTo sum up, new drivers should display 'R Plates' to let other road users know that they are new to driving, should be normally restricted to 45MPH except on motorways where they are restricted to 60MPH for their first year.",
