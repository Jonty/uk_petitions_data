This is clearly obtaining property by deception and is a criminal offence and should be dealt with by prosecuting them.  Resigning and paying back money because they have been caught out is not good enough.  Would they have resigned or paid back money if they had not been caught - I think not.  They have committed a deliberate act to deceive because they have represented claims to be true when they have known them to be untrue.",
