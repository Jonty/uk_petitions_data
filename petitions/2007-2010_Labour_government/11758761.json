        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Comprehensive schools may indeed be 'fair' to all people, offering a standard education regardless of ability. However this is not fair to the brightest children in our society, who are held back from achieving their full potential under the pretence of 'equality'. It seems the government would rather see an entire nation of average students rather than a nation which includes significant handfuls of exceptional students. This petition asks for currently active grammar schools to be protected from being turned into comprehensives, and for the creation of more grammar schools in areas further afield of the select few they currently reside in. This would offer an excellent opportunity for bright pupils from across the country to achieve their full potential and really push forward positively.",
