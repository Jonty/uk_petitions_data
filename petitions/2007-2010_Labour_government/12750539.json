        "background": "We the People demand an election. It is clear this government is incapable of running itself let alone the country. We have been at war since your party has been in power, at great human cost. You have made us pay for this by taxing us in ever more inventive ways. You have presided over a system of corruption in our MP's expenses. We have seen personal taxation rise, pension tax credits slashed resulting in a collapse of the pension system and our freedoms have been eroded. Our education and healthcare systmems have not significantly improved.Our economy is a mess. Our children's children will be paying for your incompetence. As you do not even have the common decency to own up to this, you laughably claim all this is anyone elses fault but yours.  It is time you went for the good of the people and for democracy.",
