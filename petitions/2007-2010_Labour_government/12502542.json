            "background": "the banks are changing business loans from base rate to libour rates because they can charge you more money in the short term. the natwest bank have just told me that my loan will be changed in october this year and if i refuse to except there terms they will withdraw my loan.i have been with this bank for 30years+ and they have never done this in the past years with all my past loans, i have always paid my loans back before they were due but this does not seem to matter any more, even though they have got all the security they need, by changing my rates to libour rates my bank loan will cost me an extra \u00a355'000 per year interest only without counting the repayments to the bank, is this what we have to except for the government lending the banks our money,all the banks are doing is keeping the money the government lent building up there pots at the cost of good businesess and bringing the economy down to its knees. when are the government going to step in and order the banks to lend, once the banks are made to lend again the economy will pick up straight away, so please mr brown give them the order to lend and lets all get back to work or we are all doomed",
