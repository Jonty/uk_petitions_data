        "background": "The arguments presented by the group Stop Linton Wind Farm do not stand up in today's society - maybe 20 years ago, but not today. The residents of the area around Linton are taking the snobbish East Anglian view that it can simply 'go somewhere else'. If this is the case, then eventually there wuill be nowhere for these wind farms to be built, and we will lose to global warming because of our own ignorance. Although offshore windfarms may be the long-term solution, onshore wind farms are the only reasonable, efficient, cost-efective solution for now.",
