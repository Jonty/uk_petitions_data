        "background": "Walter Tull was commissioned as an officer in the First World war, served with distinction, was killed, and at the time of his death had been recommended for the award of the Military Cross. I suggest that it should be awarded posthumously, and if there is no precedent for that, then it should nevertheless be done in recognition both of his service and of the service of Afro-Caribbean and other soldiers of African descent.",
