But if people dont know what they are then they might not come into an awareness of their rights until something has gone wrong. Why should lawyers or people with enough money to subscribe to websites that charge be the only ones who have easy access to our laws.\n\nPublic libraries are no good and there are less locally. HMSO shows legislation after 1988 but no further back and many important pieces of legislation cam before then.\n\n\n\nIt would be a good start for example if the normal person could perhaps be in a position to read the disibility discrimination act himself if they felt there was a problem at work.",
