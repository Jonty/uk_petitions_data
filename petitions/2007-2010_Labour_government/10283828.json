            "background": "In this modern world, it is generally and rightly recognised that each person has the right to decide their own personal beliefs, religious and non-religious. It is also rightly recognised that the democratic will of the people should be represented in government. Yet although over half the population of this country professes no religion, and even more do not follow the faith of the Church of England, Anglican Christianity is still the State Religion of this country. The monarch is still the head of this Church, and a great deal of taxpayers' money is paid to this Church, which benefits only those few people who follow this faith. Why should the vast majority of non-CofE people pay for the faith of a small minority?\n\nI therefore call on the Prime Minister and government to do what should have been done some time ago and complete the separation of Church and State.",
