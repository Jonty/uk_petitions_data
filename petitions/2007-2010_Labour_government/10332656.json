We the undersigned would like to see compulsary enlistment into the army to serve until they can prove they are no longer a threat but can be useful, law abiding members of society.They should not be allowed on leave, they should not be allowed pay, it should be a boot camp situation. They lost their civil rights the moment the comitted the crime and took away another persons human rights.We need to send a strong and very clear message to all; that there is a new, very definate, no tollerence policy and that they will should they choose to step the wrong side of the law have to be corrected.I use this term instead of punished as it is the correction of bad views and behaviour that needs changed, you correct one generation and the others will follow.We must act or more and more good law abiding people  are going to end up injured or dead.It is these people's rights that need protecting, not the criminals.",
