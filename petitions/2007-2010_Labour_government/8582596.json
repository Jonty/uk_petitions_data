This was mainly aimed at people who work with Mentally ill or Learning Disabled People who come across violence from time to time. I felt it was an excellent course, teaching us skills which most people should know about. I feel that a compulsory course for all, perhaps starting with the teen school years, would be very advantageous. eg. fending off a rapist or other attacker.",
