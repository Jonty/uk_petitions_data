            "background": "if everyone in the country where to sign this petition the government may take note, that we the people the ones who pay there wage are not happy. the price of fuel is increasing daily and we are paying it we all want it to come down but nothing is being done to do this. the current cost of disel being 123.9 per litre is astronomical and petrol at 115.9 is also unfair. why are we paying so much when major players like bp reported x billion in profit last year. we can not boycott the pumps as we need fuel to goabout our lives. without it we cant work without work we cant live. and the fuel companys no this and are holding us all to ransome. so please sign this petition and make them politicians take note that we the people will not stand for it any longer.",
