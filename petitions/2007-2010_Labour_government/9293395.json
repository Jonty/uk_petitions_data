        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Every year the government preaches its committment to keeping inflation down. Every year central and local government increase the cost of both living and conducting business by piling on higher and higher direct and indirect taxes e.g. fuel and motoring costs (almost entirely made up of taxation), council tax and business rates, landfill tax, proposed additional taxes on waste collection, vat on basic gas, electricity and fuel oil etc etc. These increases are usually well above the government's quoted inflation rate. They must be included in any assessment of the cost of living together with housing costs. To that end the assessement of inflation should be carried out by an independent body free of government influence / interference.",
