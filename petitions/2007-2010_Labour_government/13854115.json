            "background": "The Home Secretary needs publicly reprimanding for rejecting scientific advice for reasons of political expediency\n\nThis is a rerun of the Yes Minister episode \"The Greasy Pole\" where Jim Hacker also rejected scientific advice for political expediency.   Unlike the Home Secretary, Jim Hacker was honest enough to admit it.\n\nThe Home Secretary has potentially created a situation where no qualified person may volunteer to advise the government as they may be asked to resign if they do not give the answers that the government wants.\n\nThis could mean that decisions  requiring scientific knowledge may have to be taken by those not qualified to do so.",
