        "background": "OB is a rare, untreatable and irreversible lung disease that occurs after injury to the lower respiratory tract. OB can be caused by infection, pneumonia (particularly with adenovirus), breathing in toxic fumes or fluid. Though limited to few children, diagnostic criteria are not fixed therefore potentially there are many undiagnosed cases. OB is not recognised in the public mind. \nA national survey would provide the critical information needed to establish diagnostic recommendations to clinicians as well as consolidating knowledge of outcomes which are currently poorly outlined. Such knowledge would allow discussion as to whether children reaching agreed criteria could be included in future clinical trials of medicines and the re-examination of the viability of traditional medicines such as steroids and immune suppressives, as well as raising awareness of OB and opening possible future opportunities for further research.",
