        "background": "This petition seeks to intiate a review of the Southeastern train franchise by the PM or Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis.\n\nWe would like reviews of:\n\n* The lack of weekday snow service in early Jan 10, with a fully functioning weekend snow service\n\n* Timetable changes on the franchise over the last few years (some journeys taking >40 mins that used to take 34 mins for example)\n\n* Trains that are now full on departure thanks to the new timetable\n\n* A new timetable that has resulted in only 69.4% of Metro trains being on time for the first 4 weeks of the timetable (even after excluding snow days)\n\nWe would like to see a TOC that actually WANTS to run a service, rather than one running a half-hearted service.",
