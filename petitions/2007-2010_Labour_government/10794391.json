            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The price per litre of petrol and diesel is the same when oil was trading at $125 per barrel, as it is now that oil has fallen to $90 per barrel.  When the price of oil rises, retail fuel prices immediately rise even though the increase in cost to the producers and retailers hasn't yet fed through; yet when the oil price falls, retail fuel prices fall much more slowly and by less, as the producers and retailers \"lock in\" extra profit margins.  This petition calls on the Office of Fair Trading to hold producers and retailers to account to explain why the retail price remains as high as it does.",
