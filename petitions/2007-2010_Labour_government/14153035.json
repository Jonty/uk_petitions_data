The last attack my assistance dog had to be retired due to the trauma that had been caused.  \n\nCriminal injouries did not recognise that I had suffered permanent trauma in the form of flash backs and loss of confidence not to mention my freedom.  \nThe law clearly needs to be changed so that more assist dog users are protected and dangerous dogs kept under controle.  \nbring back the dog licence or make chipping a legal requirment.",
