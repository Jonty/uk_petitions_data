            "background": "Many supermarkets no longer like giving out plastic carrier bags, you now have to ask for them. Marks and Spencer's even charges you to buy their bags. \n\nNow i know you can get bags for life, but some people don't like them because, if you are like me and enjoy walking to the supermarket, I now have to carry a few bags for life or stuff them in my pocket because unlike a women i don't have a handbag to put them away in.\n\nAlso Tesco now deducts points from you for carrier bags, I think this whole new scheme is rather PATHETIC to be honest. If the government is so concerned about the environment then I suggest getting the stores to supply recycling paper bags, similar to what they do in Primark for FREE. \n\nThe public should not be putting up with this form of political correctness, please sign the Petition. Thank You.",
