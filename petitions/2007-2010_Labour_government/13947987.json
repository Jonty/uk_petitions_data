            "background": "Since horse riding has been scientifically shown to be more dangerous than the taking of certain illegal drugs, the Home Secretary should apologise to the parents of children who have been killed whilst horse riding. Given that Parliament has allowed this potentially lethal activity to go unchecked, it is the only honourable thing for the Home Secretary to do.\nThis is not a humorous matter, it is a matter of life and death, and has a very clear point about government policy.",
