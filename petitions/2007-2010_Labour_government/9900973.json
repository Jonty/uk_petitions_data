            "background": "This petition is based on the interview with BT on the 6th June 2008 - where BT said they would \"be there\" if the demand was enough, to upgrade the aging copper phoneline connections with fibre optic cables.  This would then acheive internet connection speeds of 50Mb/s or faster for UK households.  Please sign, and encourage others to sign this petition.",
