This expense should be kept to a minimum, covering only the essential Government business that the Pope was invited here for. It should NOT cover touring, speaking to the masses, attending religious ceremonies, etc.\n\nYou are no doubt aware of the contentious nature of many of the Pope's views. As long as they are his sincere views, he should be entitled to express them, but the general public should not have to pay for their dissemination.",
