            "background": "HMS Ledbury, HMS Brecon and RMS St Helena sailed as part of Operation Corporate from Rosyth on the 15th May 1982, before the Argentine surrender.   As the war reached its conclusion it became clear that a major clearing-up operation would be required, with the intention of making the islands coastal waters safe, this was achieved with total professionalism with these three ships playing a major role.  They were denied the South Atlantic Medal due to lack of accumulated days before the war ended, however their task and the risks involved were still very real as they continued their operations. I ask the Prime Minister/Secretary State for Defence to review the criteria for the award of the South Atlantic Medal set in Command Paper 8601, presented to Parliament in July 82 while the three ships were conducting Mine Clearance Operations in the South Atlantic and re-consider awarding the medal (Without Rosette) to these ships.",
