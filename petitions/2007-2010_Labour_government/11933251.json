        "background": "There's been a lot of talk lately about Smear Tests and how appalling it is that the testing age was raised to 25 when teenagers are becoming sexually active younger and younger. There are women getting and even dying from Cervical Cancer before they've even reached this age.\n\nThis could so easily be avoided, if treated early pre-cancerous cells rarely develop into cancer, but for it to be treated early it has to be found early.\n\nThe age for first Smear Test's needs to be lowered before more young women die, it it avoidable which makes these deaths all the more tragic.",
