            "background": "I would like the government to team up with a major company to launch major apprenticeship schemes in schools and colleges which are widely available to all regardless of their background or apperance, to provide job opportunities to disillusioned young people.I myself am a young person and I live in south london and I have spoken to other young people and they all say the same thing, they all want a way to make money but as they dont have the opportunity/skills/clean criminal record, required for a job, they fall back into crime to make money,such as robbery and drug dealing but if they had a job they would not have time to be on the streets commiting these crimes. But the problem is a lack of opportunities, and suddenly using crime to make money seems more attractive. Which leads to more robberies and they become more desperate and even more violent and start to use weapons such as Guns and knives.",
