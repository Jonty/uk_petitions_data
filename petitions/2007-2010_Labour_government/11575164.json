            "background": "This petition is in response to a recent series of cases, in which the authorities have denied people the ability to foster / adopt children based solely on their weight.\n\n \nThese misguided and discriminatory policies have become a major element of the current 'war on obesity' despite being based not on hard scientific evidence but popular prejudices about fat people: that they will die or fall ill before being able to raise a child; that their lifestyles set a bad example to their dependents; and that only punishment through the withdrawal of civil rights will motivate them to achieve a socially acceptable size. \n\nIn fact, European studies point to the fact that adopted children overwhelmingly reflect the shape of their genetic parents, whilst the notion of 'risk', taken to its logical conclusion, would preclude most people from adopting; big people shouldn't be singled out on this basis. 'Looked-after' children enjoy better outcomes in a loving home - including one provided by a fat couple - than in residential state care. The BMI is not a reliable indicator of health, and the compassion and aptitude of a parent cannot be measured with a set of scales.",
