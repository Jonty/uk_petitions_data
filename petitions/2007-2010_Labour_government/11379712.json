            "background": "In July 2006 the Home Secretary announced that there were up to 450,000 unresolved asylum cases. The aim was to clear these cases within 5 years (July 2011). The Case Resolution Team was set up to by Border and Immigration Agency to deal with asylum application lodged before March 2007. Those who were granted Limited Leave to Remain after an asylum application and apply to extend their Leave will also fall into the category of unresolved cases. The aim of dealing with these old unresolved cases is to integrate people granted ILR and remove those with no right to be here. It has come to our attention that the Case Resolution Directorate is not dealing with the oldest cases first and people who have suffered the delay for years are not being considered(e.g dealing with applications made in 2002 first and not applications made before 2000). We would expect that the Case Resolution Team takes into account the time of the first asylum application lodged by the claimant and deals with the oldest cases first. I hope that you will sign this pettion and the Border and Immigration Agency will listen to our request which is fair and just.",
