It should be law that all commercial marketing emails should have a 'click here if you no longer wish to receive these emails' function to allow recipients to opt out of future mailings. Failing that, there should be something for email along the lines of the telephone preference / mailing preference service that stops you receiving cold calls or junk mail.",
