        "background": "The massive strides India has taken since independance are exemplified in the outstanding achievements of its space programme.\n\nIndia has truly moved on from its colonial past and should be welcomed into the club of mature democracies.\n\nFor this reason it seems demeaning that the country should still receive charity from the UK Government's Department for International Development in the form of \u00a3825 million of aid, over 3 years, pledged in January this year.\n\nhttp://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/files/pressreleases/india-aidpackage-825million.asp\n\nThis money should be reassigned to countries that are chronically underdeveloped.  At the same time the UK Government should vigorously pursue free trade agreements that allow poorer nations to trade out of poverty rather than rely on handouts.",
