            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We are an ordinary, pretty village, in Hampshire.  We are being forced to have 270 new homes built in the village. This is despite planning applications having been turned down, several times, for very sound reasons.  It is the second time this has happened to the village.  The new homes will increase traffic to intolerable levels.  We already have a lot of problems with traffic, especially at our railway crossing, which has no footbridge, nor space for one and already creates serious traffic holdups and minor incidents every couple of weeks.  It threatens the 'Village' aspect of Bramley - with enough people it simply ceases to be a village.  There are not enough local services to support all the new people, in fact the local primary school is already full. I have not spoken to one person yet who wants these homes built, yet people feel powerless to stop the government doing this to us. Please help us to get our message across to the government - this is wrong, and undemocratic.  We have never been asked if we want these homes - and we are united in agreeing they will change the character of this area for ever - for the worse.",
