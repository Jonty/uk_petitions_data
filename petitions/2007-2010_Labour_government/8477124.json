            "background": "Genital hygiene is a subject often overlooked by professional bodies and government literature.\n\nWe are told (via tv and magazines) of the dangers of STD's, of hair loss treatments, of being obese and of dental hygiene.  There is no government-sponsored health leaflet or campaign to promote genital hygiene.\n\nGenital hygiene must be considered of upmost importance.  An unclean under-carriage can be responsible for the breeding of several germs and bacteria.  I don't want, for example, to sit on a public seat (on a bus for example) where an unclean person has been sat previously.  \n\nI believe that aswell as for the health reasons given above, clean genitals can help a person gain in confidence and could even help them overcome some forms of minor depression.\n\nI think a good start would be NHS health-leaflets, possibly moving to a poster-campaign.",
