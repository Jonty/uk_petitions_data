            "background": "At the moment, the learning experience in schools is very limited.\n\nYou only really get real choice after you leave school to go to college and university.\n\nThe current system gives young people the choice of subjects that the government feels young people should be learning, rather than allowing young people to have the choice of subjects which they find interesting.\n\nIt's not surprising that there are so many young people who don't enjoy going to school or indeed find learning difficult. \n\nThey are forced into learning things they simply have no interest in.\n\nThis limited learning only leads to young people gaining basic knowledge in a subject they have no real interest in and fails to give them the opportunity to learn about the things they find interesting until they go to college and university.\n\nI propose that there is a wider range of subjects available for students at younger ages in the school system.",
