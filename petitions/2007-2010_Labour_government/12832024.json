            "background": "I commend the idea that a new design for the Chelsea Barracks site include barracks accommodation for MPs to obviate the need for second home expenses.  The preferred design is inspired by the barracks familiar to a large number of the people who viewed \"Bad Lads Army\".  Happily the MPs could be supervised by former members of the Armed Forces in accordance with 1950s National Service standards. This would also meet the Prince's wish that architecture should at least evoke a sense of history, tradition and nostalgia I thank you",
