            "background": "The English Defence League, a extremist right wing group, has been allowed to abuse the right to protest and free speech for too long. Every single one of their demo's so far have ended up in chaos. During the birmingham rally shoppers hid inside shops as they rampaged through the street shouting racist chants. During the stoke rally, several policemen was assaulted and had their equipment stolen from the back of a van. The EDL have now proposed to organize a protest in Bradford which several members have stated \"Are going to be like the bradford riots times a million.\"\n\nI petition the government to ban this group before they get too out of hand.",
