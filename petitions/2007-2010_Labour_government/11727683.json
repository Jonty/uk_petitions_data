            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In line with the thinking put forward in The House of Commons mid 2008 by the Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski we, the undersigned, back the idea of creating a new Bank Holiday in tribute to Polish contribution to the UK since 1940. \n\nWe agree wholeheartedly with Mr Kawczynski's assessments and feel that it would be very apt that the day be named after a current recognisable figure with whom the younger generation could connect. The title 'Jagielka' is derived from the surname of England International Footballer and Anglo-Polish sporting icon Philip Nikodem Jagielka who currently plays Premier League Football with Everton FC.\n\nJagielka is rapidly becoming recognised as one of the finest talents in world football and his reputation as a gentleman professional and character of impeccable nature makes him an ideal role model to young and old alike. \n\nWe therefore ask that you give serious consideration to our request to set aside a single day every year, preferably in July, to celebrate our continued special relationship with our Polish brothers and sisters in the name of an anglo-polish living legend and help further strengthen both human bonds and communities.\n\nYours Sincerely,",
