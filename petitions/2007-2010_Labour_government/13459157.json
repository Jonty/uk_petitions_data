        "background": "With the advent of tools like Google Earth and KML overlays, restricted airspace and NOTAMS if published daily in this form would make flying in the UK far safer with any restriction far easier to check. It is too easy to make a mistake with the information published in its present cryptic and unintelligible form and the CAA are years behind current technology and this can only impact safety.\n\nIn the interests of safety, the CAA should be required to publish this information freely for download each day, containing all current airspace restrictions and NOTAMS for use in point and click computer based tools like Google Earth.",
