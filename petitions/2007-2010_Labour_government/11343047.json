            "action": "prevent the treasury from printing extra money, i.e. devaluing the pound, as a measure to help us through the economic down turn.  Printing extra money will only further damage the economy and lead to a longer, deeper recession.The previous times this has been attempted, in 1967, Harold Wison, and again in the 70\u2019s by the Labour government, it was disastrous for the UK, mistakes from which the Country did not recover until well into the 80\u2019s.  The decision to devalue the Pound was, justifiably, the foundation for much lampooning of the Labor party and the main reason that Labour was effectively written out of British politics for the best part of 18 years (1979-1997).",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The 1967 sterling devaluation opened the final act of the Keynesian epoch. The assurance 'that the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse or in your bank' had not been devalued, rests upon a 'fixed price' assumption invoked by John Maynard Keynes for the 1930s. It carried the implication that a currency revaluation is the only price change that is relevant to international competitiveness. That is nonsense. Devaluation succeeds in readjusting international payments only if it reduces the value of the pound in our pocket, purse or bank. \n\nG. R. Steele \nLancaster University Management School",
