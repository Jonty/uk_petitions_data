        "background": "There is much debate about drink driving levels, etc. and how much a person can and cannot consume.\n\nLet's make things simple, if you drink with ANY alcohol in your system, you are guilty of drink driving.\n\nBy lowering the limit to zero, it will make things far simpler for people who drink. If you have had a drink you cannot drive. Doing away with any need to internal debate.",
