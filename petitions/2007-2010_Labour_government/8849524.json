        "action": "Provide incentives to parish councils to identify and allocate land for housing and redevelopment",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The impact of millions of new homes is often keenly felt when large new towns are proposed. Such proposals suit industrial scale developers but are almost universally opposed by local communities. If the lowest level of our democracy were provided significant incentives to identify and encourage proposals for small scale developments then many of the problems of meeting our housing needs would evaporate.\nThere are some 10,000 parishes in England and a housing stock of 21m or roughly 2000 houses per parish.\nA million homes represents a 5% growth (100 homes on average) in each parish, 2 million 10%. \nAs most people would prefer the development of local homes that enhance their community, to large new towns on Greenfield sites, this petition requests Government actively engage the grass roots of our democracy by investing in schemes through which local communities can proactively solve the problem.\nWell focussed incentives combined with increased local involvement would actively promote local regeneration and spread the burden of new housing more evenly across the country",
