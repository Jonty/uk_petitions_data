Instead of just Government Minister's (i.e. Minister's from the MoD)at present, being the only politician present officially at these services, gives a one side political view and idea, to others the news media covering these services and therefore the general public. That only Minister's of the Government of the Day, cares enough to go to these services, when in fact the MoD are stopping other Political Parties Politician's, even their own back bencher's and/or local councillor's from attending it seems.",
