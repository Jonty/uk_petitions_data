            "background": "Case for legalisation of recreational drugs\n\nI have come to the view that recreational drugs should be legalised I will out line some key points below.\n\n\n\nFor many years prohibition has been key government policy on the war against drugs. This has caused the following \n\nVast profits for criminal gangs\nCriminalization of drug addicts\nIncrease of crime on our streets\nPrisons filled to over capacity\nDestabilization of countries (Afghanistan, and others) \n\nThese are just a few of the problems that prohibition has cause.\n\nIt is accepted that legalizing drug may increase there use but the benefits to our society far out way any down sides.\n\nCut the criminal gangs income\nReduce the prison population\nReduce the crime on our streets\nProvide proper care for drug addicts\nCreate jobs\nProvide vast tax revenues for government\nProvide information on recreational drugs\nCreate legal industries for countries in south america and places like afghanistan (may also help to end the war)",
