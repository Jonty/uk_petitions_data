            "background": "Periodically, claimants of Jobseekers Allowance are required to attend appointments at Jobcentre Plus during which Staff are required to assess the claimants Evidence in respect of their efforts to find work. \n\nStaff at Jobcentre Plus are required to undertake this process in a Competent and Efficient manner, however this often does not take place.\n\nThis problem has great potential to enable fraudulent claimants to go unnoticed and to cause genuine claimants to feel disillusioned with the system.\n\n- Staff will sometimes rush through appointments, saying things like \"that's your evidence up to date\" without having actually checked anything.\n\n- Staff will often use confrontational gestures to assess a jobseeker instead of examining written evidence or respectfully asking pertinent questions. \n\n- Staff will often react with surprise and confusion when genuine claimants present them with their ES3 / ES4 forms or other supporting evidence.\n\n- Long term claimants are sometimes able to build up rapport with Jobcentre staff which can result in them turning a blind eye to friendly familiar claimants.",
