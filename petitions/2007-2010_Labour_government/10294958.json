            "background": "School children in the UK are given an education system and a curriculum; they do not choose it.  The month of August, when results are published, is a very tense time for many young people.  It is unfair if the media and public figures use this time to criticise the system.  Imagine if you have worked hard, got good results only to be told the system is worthless.  Worse still, imagine if you have worked hard, got poor results only to be told exams are getting easier!  Discussions about how to change the system and debates on standards can take place during the other 11 months.",
