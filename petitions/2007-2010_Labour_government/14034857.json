        "action": "advise HM The Queen to establish a Royal Commission on Climate Change",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many areas of current government policy are based on an assumption that climate change is man-made and a consequence of CO2 emissions. The Government is planning to spend a significant proportion of the UK's GDP over the medium to long term in an attempt to reduce CO2 and influence the climate. Increasingly there is evidence to support the view that recent rises in global temperature are now being reversed, in line with historical and natural climatic cycles. Before committing the UK to spending on a vast scale, which will undoubtedly have a huge impact on the UK economy at a time of difficult public finances, the Government, through a Royal Commission, should investigate the validity and robustness of the scientific claims and counterclaims surrounding climate change and its causes.",
