            "background": "Utility companies and large organisations including government, use other large companies to provide them with a so called cheaper product supply, by offering out tenders for work / product supply under a framework agreement. Smaller companies then generally can no longer compete for their work for a given time period.\nFramework contracts often work out more expensive, due to variation to contract costs.\nThis must come under a monopolies ruling as only larger companies benefit and get bigger as they tender for more work under a framework umbrella. \nThis leaves localised small business's out of the tendering process. Localised engineers usually do not get the product they require, the frameworks are restrictive in the products they provide, the end product is often sub standard to the actual requirement. Consultants and advisors often benefit and hide behind badly constructed agreements. Conclude to free up the tendering marketplace and stop this restrictive practice.",
