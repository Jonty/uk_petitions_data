        "background": "At present the hospital is charging \u00a33 car parking fee's. I would like to try and get the car parking charges at the Infirmary in Northwich abolished. It is stated in a book of old Northwich that the land and house (the old part of Northwich) should be used by the people of Northwich free of charge. They have CCTV they instruct you to park in desginated bays, failure to do this you will be issued with a \u00a350 penalty notice. It also states Mid Cheshire Hospital isn't responisble for damage or theft to cars. What do the parking fee's go to?",
