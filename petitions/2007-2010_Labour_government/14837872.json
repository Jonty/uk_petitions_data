        "action": "prevent the proposed relocation of the Health Protection Agency's Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response from their current site at Porton Down, Wiltshire to a new site in Essex.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The relocation of the HPA Porton Down site to Terlings Park, Essex would be a devastating loss to South Wiltshire's economy, thousands of local jobs would be lost or put at risk.\n\nThere is a strong tradition of public health research at Porton Down and this proposed relocation would end decades of expertise on the site. Advanced plans have already been made to redevelop the existing site and improve laboratory facilities. With no significant financial difference between redevelopment and relocation, the decision by the Health Protection Agency Board to favour relocation is an act of callous indifference towards staff and people in South Wiltshire.\n\nMinisterial approval is required for the move and we call on the Prime Minister to intervene and stop this proposed relocation.",
