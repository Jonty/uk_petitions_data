            "action": "prosecute Burmese military junta through international courts - devise an anti - corruption forum, as a branch of the ICC, (which deals with crimes against humanity committed internationally) to address crimes against international development contravening uni - laterally agreed goals and UN humanitarian, economic, democratic (as well as military) missions. The idea is to ensure basic needs programmes are apolitical and theft is still as much a triable offence against UN missions (and the organisation and personnel carrying out UN duties) as against thy neighbour.",

            "background": "Well, the confiscation of food aid to Burma reported by the UN was pretty much predicatble, wasn't it ? But suspending aid shipments to Burma after discovering all supplies sent in so far have been seized by the ruling military junta, will do little to ease the problem. The element of disaster relief is urgency - we the undersigned wish success to the humanitarian mission and urge greater govt co - operation.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to petition UN and NATO to devise a system for retrospectively prosecuting individuals convicted of these detrimental interventions, other than the Burmese courts, which is probably inadequate, when the infra - structure is under - developed and the judiiary, perhaps less than trust - worthy, given recent events. \n\nHow can the international community\ncomplain that aid took 5 days to mobilise, if preventative infrastructures were not already in place, because the junta themselves\nare traditionally non - compliant ?\n\nAll take and no give policies do not run nations - please encourage ALL nations to undertake greater responsibilities of global citizenship and establish emergency plans.",
