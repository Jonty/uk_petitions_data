        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Recently, Graham Stringer MP has made comments where he claims dyslexia is a myth. This is clearly not true. There are several people in the UK living with dyslexia today, and for them day-to-day life is very hard. He is lying, as according to the British Dyslexic Association, 10% of his constituents suffer from the condition. The condition is not 'cruel fiction', and should not be consigned to the 'dustbin of history'. As you can clearly see, Graham Stringer MP is making clearly false statements, and should be removed from his MP seat as soon as possible.",
