            "background": "It causes massive amounts of stress and endless costs in call-outs for the police and environmental health officers to attend complaints of noise nuisance which are the no. 1 cause of neighbour disputes. \n\nIt would save masses of public money and lead to happier communities if builders were required to install mimimum levels of sound insulation on new-build properties, particularly attached dwelling such as flats and terraced and semi-detached properties.\n\nNo-one expects properties to be soundproof, but it should be possible to watch TV, vacuum and play music at a reasonable volume without it being excessively noisy next door. Too many modern new-built properties have paper-thin walls.\n\nThis needn't add too much to the cost of properties - there are already minimum standards for heat insulation and noise insulation can be done quite cheaply if it is designed into the building from the start.",
