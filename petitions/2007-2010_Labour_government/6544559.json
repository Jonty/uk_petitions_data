            "background": "Disabled people and those with very young children need more space than regular car users - to take out car seats or wheelchairs, or for a disabled person to be lifted out of the car and into their wheelchair. It is wrong for people to use these spaces if they are not disabled, have no children but want to park close to the shop out of laziness, or have children that are out of car seats or of an age where they don't need any more space than anyone else. These people prevent people who genuinely need the spaces from using them and should have fines imposed on them to discourage this disrespectful behaviour.",
