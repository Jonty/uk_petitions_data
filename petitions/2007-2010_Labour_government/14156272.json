            "background": "The current situation is unnacceptable with the government, the media and the education authorities all preaching the man made global warming case as if it were a closed issue. This is clearly not the case, with many scientists dissagreeing and some very serious alternative theories being dissmissed as part of the \"sceptic`s\" \"propaganda\".\nWhilst some reliance can be placed upon adults to distinguish between scientific truth and political propaganda, education should be limited to the teaching of known truths and the ability to distinguish between fact and what the authorities want us to believe. It is absolutely essential we do not permanently currupt the minds of the young with fashionable politics.",
