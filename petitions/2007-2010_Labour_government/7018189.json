Any form of benefit should only be there for people that are totally incapacitated, not people who think they are. There are people receiving incapacity benefits walking the street and living in the pubs or down the bookies or dealing drugs. Make them all work for any benefit. They could clean the streets or scrub off grafitti or even help the older generation. Don't just give them handouts without any incentive",
