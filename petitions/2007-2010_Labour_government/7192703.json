They should have an option on the census (2011) on whether they wish to have independence, a full Parliament, an Assembly or to stay as they are; given the people the option to tick as many options as they like and also to see their views on the other nations. If the Welsh anywhere in the UK select an option where 50% or more wish to change something in Wales; that should be done,(the Welsh can not have a say on what will happen in another nation, but they can have their view). That also goes for the English, Scottish, Northern Irish and Cornish. Give them control of their lives.",
