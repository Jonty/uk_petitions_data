            "background": "Currently we have children and youths playing with and getting injured with fireworks on, or around, 5th November each year. This is a week after children and youths are running riot threatening OAP's into having heart attacks by Trick Or Treating. \nWe could discourage unsocial behaviour on these days by bringing the two different occasions together and promoting a family day on the Monday between Halloween and Bonfire Night. They could have parties where the kids dress up like they would at Halloween, go to firework displays and barbecues all on the monday between Halloween and Bonfire Night.\nBan the sale of fireworks from shops, and manufacturers should only sell them to licensed people.\n\nThis would introduce a much needed extra bank holiday as well as discourage the increase in unsocial behaviour around this time.",
