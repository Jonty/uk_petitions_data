            "background": "Introduce a 'Refresher Test' for Drivers every 5 years which covers the majority of of faults and bad habits which cause the most accidents ie. Lane Discipline, Blind Spots, Speed etc. Then our skill is graded on a scale of 1-5 this score is then used to determine Insurance Premiums. At the moment we have people who have been driving for 40 years and paying 100 pound Insurance and are dangerous and careless drivers as the roads change so much every year. Insurance should be based on Skill!!",
