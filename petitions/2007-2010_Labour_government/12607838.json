            "background": "Sign here if you wish to petition Prime Minister Gordon Brown to launch a full public enquiry into the MP\u2019s expenses fiasco.\nAt a time when the world faces a global recession; Armed Services fighting over seas are without proper resources to complete their task; Public Sector workers are told to accept low salary increases and the Government explaining that there is no money in the pot the media discover MP\u2019s have claimed expenses for extraordinary items and services. \nONLY due to this media coverage and pressure by the PM have some MP\u2019s paid these extraordinary expenses back into the public purse. I wonder what would have happened if the media coverage and PM\u2019s pressure had not evolved at all?\nTo restore the UK\u2019s faith in the democratic political system in the UK I ask you to sign this petition to ensure that this astonishing situation does not repeat itself in the future and restore faith in the political system in the UK.",
