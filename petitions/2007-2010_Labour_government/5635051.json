            "background": "The Irish newspaper Tribune recently published an article on the horrors of the forum football365. There was a light hearted topic in which members posted pictures they had taken of random things which happened to have women standing in the way of them. The paper seemed outraged that people posted a smilie indicating that they found the woman attractive next to particularly funny or interesting pictures. They then decided that this had something to do with rape. They then decided to involve the man hating group Rape Crisis and persuaded the moderators of the forum that they had to take it down. This surely oversteps the bounds of what it is acceptable for the press to do and so the smilie should be reinstated and preferably the newspaper should be punished.",
