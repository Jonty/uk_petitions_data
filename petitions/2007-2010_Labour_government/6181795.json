            "background": "I would like to see Upper Heyford Airfield re-opened for civil flights and flying schools. Sonce its closure in 1993 it has unfortunately become largely a ghost town with buildings long abandoned and cordoned off to the public. This is a great shame becuse the Airfoeld has a lot of history.\n\nIt was used by the RAF in World War II as a training facility where RAF flyers learned paratroop tactics. During the Cold War, Upper Heyford served as a base for United States Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers and United States Air Forces In Europe (USAFE) tactical reconnaissance and fighter aircraft in the UK. It was also used in the Gulf War.\n\nIt would be a boost to the local area and also tourism to see the airfield re-opened as a civil airfield.",
