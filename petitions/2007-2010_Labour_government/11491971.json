            "background": "Graham Stringer has made a series of comments in the media and on a Manchester website accusing the education establishment of creating the condition of Dyslexia.  As a documented medical condition, of which some 6 million people in the UK are sufferers, Mr Stringers comments highlight his clear disregard for a large proportion of the UK public, and his disparaging comments are tantamount to calling those who live with the condition liars.  Mr Stringer should issue a complete retraction of his comments, issue a public apology, and spend some time with real dyslexia sufferers to understand the condition and its effect on children in their most formative years.",
