            "background": "There are plans to build a virus containment facility and animal testing lab in Camden in defiance of the council's own planning brief calling for 50% social housing. The lab poses a very real virus leak threat similar to the Pirbright Foot & Mouth disaster. The lab will hold animals including cats and dogs which is opposed by many people. We ask that the land be sold and used to benefit the community in a compulsory purchase order.",
