            "background": "Please  take a moment to sign this petition. The cost of a dog licence in Northern Ireland is set to increase 10-fold to \u00a350. The new legislation will go out to public consultation next month. \nThis is a ridiculous hike in the Licence Fee and is completely unrealistic. Responsible dog owners who do not allow their dogs to roam will be penalised. \nThis is not the answer to controlling the stray dog issue in Northern Ireland. The answer is neutering and spaying to avoid further litters.\nWe urge the government to rethink this increase.",
