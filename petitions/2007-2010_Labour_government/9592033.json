            "background": "Members of society have increasingly become segregated from one another over the years. This form of detachment creates indifference among communities. \n\nPossible causes are breakdowns in families. Provisions are needed for sundered families to create unification or improve harmonization within the family structure. Seperations of families causes identity issues, segregation and insecurities. More support is required to lone parents in the up bringing of their children, mediation is needed when family members no longer communicate effectively and the promotion of extended families to support nuclear families with everyday activities.\n\nProviding anger management and conflict resolution training and restoring families will help to regenerate communities and thus help eradicate street violence.",
