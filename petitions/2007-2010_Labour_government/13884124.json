            "background": "To change the laws on Domestic Voilence as right now the courts do a court order to stop all contact but under public interest the police and CPS wont take minor crimes like withheld phione calls to court, what makes it even worse the abuser only has to say they didn't do it and they are let off.  The victims have the right to livce without fear, plus shouldn't have to hide, move etc the court order should be made to stop it. Please change the laws and make it harder for these abusers to carry on!  This isn't just a problem in the UK but all over the world. No one should be abuseed or harassed.",
