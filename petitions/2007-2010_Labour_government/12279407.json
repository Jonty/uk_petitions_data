            "background": "Mothers are often forced to return to work after having children because the cost of living is just too high for one wage. I feel they should be given the opportunity to raise their own children by increasing their benefit payments in alignment to the number of years worked and taxes paid. For example,\n5 years worked = 40% of final salary, 10 years = 60%\n15 years = 80%\n20 years = 100%\nThis would not only make many women very happy, it would also make thousands of jobs available to those who are currently unemployed and children would definately benefit from having a parent at home - this may even help to cut down on crime. Also please consider allowing them to continue to pay into any company pension scheme.",
