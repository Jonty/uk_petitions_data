There's also been the tax credits fiasco (also involving HM Revenue and Customs) which cost the taxpayer at least \u00a33bn, not to mention the fact that they seem determined to do absolutely NOTHING useful about the hatred for this country and its folk from Islamic extremists.\n\nGET THIS BUNGLING LOAD OF INCOMPETENTS OUT NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE TO SAVE THE COUNTRY!!",
