            "background": "\"Ceux qui oublient le passe se condamnent a le revivre\".\n\nWe believe it is vitally important for the British public to be given the opportunity to commemorate the fallen in all wars. November 11th is already a national holiday in France, Belgium, Canada and the United States amongst other places, so there is a clear precedent for establishing this date as a national holiday. \n\nAdditionally, the four months between the August Bank Holiday and Christmas is the longest such break in the year, and the British public would benefit from this new holiday.\n\nWe also suggest this would bring us more into line with the rest of Europe who all enjoy a greater number of national holidays than we do in the United Kingdom.",
