            "background": "Please could the government reduce the tax on biodiesel so that the cost to the public is considerably lower then conventional diesels. BioDiesel is a great way to recycle waste cooking oils and should be recognized as a good alternative to fossil fuels. The cost of goods and services to all is bankrupting the country and if anyone is like me they are struggling to pay the bills. Please listen to the public and act now.",
