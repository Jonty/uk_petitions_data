        "background": "stop new asylum seekers from moving to other local authorities and put a maximum length of time spent during and after assessing their application for asylum in order to integrate fully within the UK society & help reduce financial burdens on all sector service such as the nhs and tax payers. to implement a policy that all placement of asylum seeker at any local authority is followed by adequate and measured support in housing, welfare and education and not to be asked to vacate homes within two weeks after hearing the outcome of their asylum application. to put a policy in place that any interpretor wannabes that cost our tax payers comply and understand uk laws & are standard means tested and have spent reasonable time in uk before taking the role of interpretor. this would greatly help to create a new and proactive well integrated future society to our well diverse British culture and enhanced sense of community.",
