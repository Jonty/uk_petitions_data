            "background": "The price of petrol is shortly expected to reach over 120 pence/litre. \nThis is too high. Commuters and companies are suffering due to the constant and rapid petrol increases. \nMost of this cost is due to tax (approximately 2/3 of the price) and not the price of oil. \nPlease consider lowering the tax rate to avoid the country grinding to a halt.",
