        "background": "21000 people have made complaints to the PCC over the article published in October by the Daily mail about the death of Stephen Gately. Jan Moir wrote the highly contraversial piece that suggests that Gately's sexuality is a negative choice and has some relation to his early death. \n\nNot only was this an irresponsible and offensive decision by Moir, the editor of the Daily Mail accepted the article into his newspaper as a suitable and fair piece to share with the nation.\n\nIt only seems appropriate that they should not be able to keep their positions as they chose to abuse them by offending many social groups and the Daily Mail reading audience. The lack of disciple by the Editor and the igorance of Moir must be reviewed to avoid any more upset for the family of Gately and to salvage the newspaper's reputation.",
