            "background": "I wear size 8 shoes. The number of shops that don't sell size 8 shoes is on the increase. Why is this? This also applies to men's shoes if size 13. Each generation is getting taller - so need larger shoes. I think it's only fair that women's shoes should be stocked to up to a size 10 minimum and men size 15. People with large feet have to pay over the odds to buy shoes and also with that, they have a limited choice. You cannot determine what shoe size you going to be.",
