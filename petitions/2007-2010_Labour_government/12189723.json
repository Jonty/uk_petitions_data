In China where a large proportion of animal fur originates, animals including cats and dogs are  skinned alive. There are fur farms in other countries throughout the world including the  United States. Buying, wearing, selling and trading in any way with fur supports animal cruelty. \nWe call upon the Government to end all imports of fur and make it illegal to sell any fur products within the United kingdom.",
