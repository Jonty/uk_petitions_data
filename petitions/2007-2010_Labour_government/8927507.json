            "background": "The government should offer large incentives to companies to use rail to transport their products.\n\nThis would have positive ramifications...\n1) Reduce congestion on our roads that is estimated to cost the economy \u00a320bn a year.\n2) Encourage investment into the rail network - i.e reintroduction of lines.\n3) Use freight to subsidise the rail network for passenger use.\n\nThe only negative i can see is that it may result in a slight rise for the price we pay for goods in the shops. But this would possibly be offset by the gain in reducing congestion?",
