            "background": "More and more people are altering their cars (customising)by lowering the suspension, puting wider wheels on and puting big bore exhausts on. This seriously affects the control of the car and makes them louder. Because they are made to look and sound like a  rally car people drive them fast and take risks like rally drivers and add risk to other law abiding people.I propose that all said cars should not be given an M.O.T certificate and when seen by the police taken off them and distroyed.",
