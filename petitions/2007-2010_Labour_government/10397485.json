            "background": "I welcome the current proposed changes to the benefit system to make claimants work for their hand out, however I feel the changes don\u2019t go far enough. I would like to propose that every citizen is entitled to an initial 6 months worth of benefits to be claimed at any point in their working life and payment of said benefit would be immediate without question or doubt. \n\nOnce the initial 6 months \u201cfree\u201d credit is consumed further benefit credits will need to be earned via gainful employment and contributions to the system. For instance, for every year worked where contributions to the system were made a person would earn 1 months worth of benefit credit so, work for 10 years and expect to get 10 months benefit paid immediately no questions asked.\n\nThe fundamental principle behind this is everyone gets a start of 6 months free, thereafter if people can\u2019t find enough self motivation to feed and cloth themselves then why should hard working tax payers subsidise them?",
