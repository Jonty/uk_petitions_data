            "background": "Many private commercial organisations are using new number plate reading systems to log the timed movements of vehicles. Many of these are private firms working for tesco, sainsbury etc who log the time you arrive and then depart and will fine you if you stay over the displayed time limit. To do this they buy citizens confidential address details from the DVLA. UK citizens have a statutory duty to disclose data to the vehicle licensing office and it is immoral that a govt agency then peddles this data for commercial gain at \u00a32.50 per address with resulting fines costing \u00a370-200 per time. This causes us to mistrust our govt and its integrity greatly.",
