            "background": "It is grossly unfair that Primary schools are used as Polling stations.\n\nFirstly it means that our children will only receive 194 days of education, whereas children from other schools will receive the full 195 that they are entitled to.\n\nThe second and main problem is the cost implication that this has for parents. \n\nIn most families both parents are working. One parent will have to take the day off work, on top of the fact that the children have teacher training days.\n\nThere are no childcare facilities available for Polling day or teacher training as they only run during the school holidays.\n\nI feel very strongly that, if schools are to be used as a polling station in future, that the Council should make free childcare available to the parents by using a leisure centre, or other suitable location such as a local college or secondary school.\n\nI feel that the current situation is grossly unfair and only adversely affects parents with children attending schools used as polling stations.",
