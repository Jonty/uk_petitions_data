        "background": "Oral infection is prevalent and public institutions like the Church of England and the Roman Catholic churches should be informed of their responsibilities to safeguard public health.\nThe use of one cup which is shared by  several communicants  at Eucharist is wholly unhygienic and has no theological basis. Indeed the practice is doctrinal and in the interest of public health, the clerics should be forced to learn about cleanliness. After all, in pubs and other catering establishments, the punters are not expected to use one glass for the whole room of guests.\nEnvironmental officers should enforce the law and not be afraid of clerics who endanger public health. Like the non-smoking ban, there should be punitive measures in place for non-compliance.",
