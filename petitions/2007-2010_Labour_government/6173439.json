            "background": "Every year companies make British workers redundant just to replace them with offshore workers they can hire at a fraction of the cost it is to employ a British person.  I believe that this has damaging effects to the British economy, as people will be claiming unemployment benefits rather than contributing to income taxes and monies are leaving the UK in order to pay for these workers wages.\nThere is also an issue of security; sensitive information such as bank account details are being transferred into countries that have no data protection laws.",
