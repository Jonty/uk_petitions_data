These changes will give the Secretary of State (Mandelson -- or his successor in the next government) the power to make \"secondary legislation\" (legislation that is passed without debate) to amend the provisions of Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988).\n\nWhat that means is that an unelected official would have the power to do anything without Parliamentary oversight or debate, provided it was done in the name of protecting copyright.\n\nhttp://www.boingboing.net/2009/11/19/breaking-leaked-uk-g.html",
