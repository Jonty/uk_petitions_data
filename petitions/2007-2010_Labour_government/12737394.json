            "background": "We the undersigned formally petition that the British Government implement tax deductible status on Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs).\n\nIn doing this the Government can dramatically increase the amount of money being held in British Financial Institutions and in return savers are duly rewarded. This will have on going benefits to the industry and savers alike and promotes long term growth of the nation.\n\nThe value of your additional non-taxable income will be equal to the increase in value of your ISA from April 1st year one until March 31 the following year. So if you put your full \u00a33,000 ISA allowance in but make withdrawals as well and end the year with \u00a32,000 then your rebate will be calculated on an increase on your on-taxable income of \u00a32,000.\n\nThis will encourage a nation of savers, help get our country out of a financial crisis, and create wealth and growth throughout the Great British Nation.",
