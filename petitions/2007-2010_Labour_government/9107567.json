            "background": "You like me must have had enough of the public services apartheid between England and Scotland; we are on course for the abolition of all prescription charges in Scotland and Wales while millions of patients in England will still have to pay for vital medication. \n\nOn top of this Scottish residents have free eye care, dental check ups, free personal care for the elderly, extra central heating grants, availability to drugs banned for use in England and Wales due to the high costs and Scottish students get funded university education.\n\nScotland receives \u00a31,500 more of Government funding per head of population than England each year, something the Scottish parliament is taking advantage of by abolishing many fees costing the English taxpayer hundreds of millions.\n\nI suggest that one of the following solutions should be followed.\n\n\u2022\tScotland should be made to raise the money it spends itself.\n\u2022\tThese measures should be rolled out nation wide.\n\u2022\tWe should complete the movement of power to create a fair and balanced system. \n\nCurrently power has all been devolved to Scotland, devolution is supposed to be about fairness and currently we seem to have only done half the job.",
