Will Govt explain this distinction and why help is denied, particularly as my father was one of 3 haemophiliac brothers (all dead) and the estates of his siblings, who perished of HIV complexities - contracted via contaminated NHS blood  - have been assisted? Answer before the 15th anniversary of my father\u2019s death 3/9/09 - 100 days from my petition date. See You Tube \u201cGreg Murphy - My Stupid Father\u201d.",
