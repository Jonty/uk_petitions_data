            "background": "Statistics say that women are better drivers as they are more careful and more considerate drivers than men. In the not so distant past men and women have fought for equality between the sexes and races, and now car insurance companies are hiding behind their statistics that are seen to be sexist in the eyes of equality protesters. All everybody wants is to be equal between each other and no company or corporation should be able to hide behind any statistics that judge you on your gender or what colour your skin is, and so this is why I believe that insurance companies should create equal costs for car insurance for men and women.",
