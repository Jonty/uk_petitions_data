        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "British Airways have got a policy which is totally discriminatory towards men. It is the policy of British Airways to only seat children who are flying alone with a female. This has meant many adult male passengers have been moved from a seat that they have paid for, away from their families, so a child may sit next to a female. Not only are British Airways treating men less favourably due to their gender, but they are humiliating men placed in this situation. British Airways say they have the policy to \"prevent abuse\", but the policy just reinforces the social hysteria around paedophilia. The policy also totally disregards the fact that females may also be abusers, and stereotypes men in this way. I request the Prime Minister takes action to ensure Britisg Airways are not allowed to discriminate against men in this way.",
