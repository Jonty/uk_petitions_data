        "background": "LPG tracks at approximately 55p a litre less than petrol, therefore as petrol increases it becomes relatively less of a financial incentive to convert to LPG.\n\nThe government withdrew the grant to convert to LPG but in order to reduce greenhouse-gases they need to give motorists more incentive to convert to this green fuel.\n\nI propose reducing or abolishing the tax added to this fuel, it is a by-product from producing petrol so if motorists don't use it then it will be burnt off anyway, therefore it's environmental impact is almost neutral.",
