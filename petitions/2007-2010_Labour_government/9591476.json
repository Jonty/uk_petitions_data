            "background": "Citizenship is now a very important part of the secondary school curriculum and more must be done to cut down on knife crime. By making education about knife crime compulsory for all students we're encouraging children to discuss why it happens, allowing teachers to change hearts, minds and attitudes of young people towards knife crime and helps us understand why young people become involved. This would also allow knife crime victims to tell their stories to young people and help them realise how knife crime can both take away and destroy lives. So therefore we the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to \"Provide more education in secondary schools about knife crime and to encourage in class discussions, organise talks by knife crime victims and make this compulsory for all students in all citizenship lessons.\"",
