        "background": "A documentary this week highlighted how today police officers recieve no kind of water lifesaving training and don't even have to able to swim to enter the force. Considering how stringent fitness standards are supposed to be I find this a bit wrong. I think it is about this training was brought back and made law, also all recruits should be able to swim (except for exceptional circumstances)",
