            "background": "The PM should lower tax levels especially petrol. We pay more than double on petrol tax than other countries and it is getting ridiculous. Think about people who don't have a lot money but need to earn a living and get to work each day, people like health visitors and district nurses who have not had their petrol allowance increased for a LONG time and are now having to fund their own JOB! Please sign this petition and help us in our campaign to lower England's taxes!",
