There is one reason for that, I know the English Prime-minister or the English Government cannot help with this problem, but I can only think of it as a mere crisis to the animal kingdom.\n      Orang-utans shoudn't deserve to die because of farmer's selfish needs for money, they can plant oil in over places instead of destroying innocent creatures.\n     I, am a 13 year old boy, I want to change the world to how some people see it, please help me, thank you. Each signature counts and could save a life.",
