CCTV, DNA databases, biometric ID cards, and the numerous other branches of government snooping that have appeared in the last few years are a direct threat to this right. Ministers have admitted that the new measures would have done nothing to stop the atrocities of 7/7, and have proven through their actions countless times that they cannot be trusted with our personal information. The government has no authority to spy upon its own citizens. Restore our right to privacy!",
