            "background": "We all have to wear seat belts whilst driving but not on trains that go at motorway speeds and faster. New high-speed trains are being rolled out with speeds in excess of 200 mph. The injuries from an accident would be horrendous. The Health & Safety Executive should be consulted to advise on an upper speed limit over which seat belts must be fitted on trains. This comes with the caveat that these seat belts are designed to provide sufficient head support to prevent deceleration/whiplash injuries.",
