        "background": "The number of Uk companies which became insolvent in this first quarter of the year 2008 is estimated to be over 3000 and predicted to increase in the future.With these insolvencies comes loss of income,jobs and sufferings to many families. This is a small fraction compared to those under genuine threat of insolvency.If the government rescued Northern Rock from insolvency,and gave Banks \u00a350b to stop them from becoming insolvent,the same should be done for all other insolvent companies and those genuinely under threat of insolvency .If the \u00a350b given to the banks was meant for all sector of the economy,it obviously did not help these companies that has stopped trading.Banks were given the opportunity to meet with the Bank of England where a solution was worked out to help them out.This same opportunity should be extended to these companies.",
