            "background": "It is absurd that upon the birth of a fourth child, myself and my partner's housing benefit dropped due to the increased Child Tax Credits. I work a 44 hour week and all that has happened, rather than receive increased help with the new addition to the family, is that the increase in Tax Credits has been negated by the decrease in Housing Benefit, meaning our net household wealth has stayed the same, with a further mouth to feed. Child Tax Credits should be exempt from being counted as income for the purposes of Housing Benefit etc.",
