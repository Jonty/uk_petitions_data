            "background": "Children are our most precious commodity. They are our future. Every year approx. 160,000 children are affected by a parent in prison every year. . A Government funded report entitled Inside Fatherhood, which was commissioned by the DfES' Offenders' Learning and Skills Unit and is published by Fathers Direct states \"that many children find it difficult to cope when dad is jailed, facing bullying, stigmatisation, confusion, insecurity, poverty and loneliness in the absence of their dads. One in three witness their fathers' arrest. More than half of sons go on to be convicted of offences by the age of 32.\" There are no national guidelines to acknowledge, let alone support these children and they remain a silent minority. I would like to see provision for these children in the form of support where needed in schools and the HMP establishments that they may visit funded by the Government. Please sign this petition to stop these children becoming just more statistics and help them receive the care and support they need.",
