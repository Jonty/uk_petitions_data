            "background": "\"Pets at Home\" have apparently been granted permission to build a large store at Liverton Ind. Est - despite a fairly large petition organised by a fair sized Pet Shop no more than 150 yards away from the proposed site, and despite two weeks ago East Devon District Council suggested this planning proposal would be thrown out; we now find that they have granted permission to built subject to \"conditions\"! - There are currently 8 or 9 Pet Stores/shops in Exmouth and the immediate surrounding area - by allowing \"Pets at Home\" into the area (when there is already a large store 10 miles away in Exeter) would effectively destroy trading for about 50% of the existing pet stores in Exmouth. ALL these existing stores employ folk, and pay EDDC commercial rates... to lose 50% of those employed people, and also lose 50% of the rates would be for the EDDC a stab in their own heart.  We do not need yet another multiple Pet Store in Exmouth - ps: apart from the existing 8-9 pet stores already running, there are of course Tesco's Pet Dept; Somerfields, Kings, Co-op, and every grocers shop that also sell pet foods etc.  Please sign against Pets at Home from continuing their plans",
