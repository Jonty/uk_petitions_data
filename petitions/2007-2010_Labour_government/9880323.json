            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The penalty points limit accrual system would be implemented such that a newly qualified driver would be set a limit of 3 points.\n\nThereafter it would be possible to accrue an additional 3 points per year if the completion of previous 12 months driving was done in the absence of being convicted of a motoring offence.\n\nEach offence free year would accrue a 3 point credit up to the current maximum of 12.\n\nThe guiding principle being that during the early years of a drivers career there is an incentive for the driver to invest the extra care reflective of their inexperienced to prevent unnecessary motoring offences.   \n\nThe accrual of a higher limit should serve as both a reward for past lawful driving and to introduce some tolerance and latitude into the system for minor indiscretions which may be inadvertently committed.",
