Our local services are stretched to breaking point already, and with no new investment from the Develpers will be unable to cope with the estimated 650+ new residents.  The developement proposed will also result in loss of farmland and a significant number of tress and areas of historic woodland, home to some rare and endangered widlife flora and fauna.",
