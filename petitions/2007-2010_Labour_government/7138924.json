            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Taxes now account for around 70% of the cost of fuel and price increases alone provide the Government with ever-increasing revenue from the VAT element of taxation. Rises in fuel duty add to the already unsustainable levels of taxation which this Government continue to impose upon individuals and businesses. High fuel prices are a threat to the economy; slowing growth, aiding inflation and diverting financial resources away from other areas. The Treasury are the principal beneficiaries of the current oil price crisis and the Chancellor should fundamentally reassess the way fuel duties are applied. He should consider a sliding-scale fuel duty based on a percentage which falls as oil prices rise and increases when they drop in order to stabilise the cost of motor fuel at a reasonable level.",
