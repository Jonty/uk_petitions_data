            "background": "At the start of this year I lost my 7 weeks old baby, Morgan, when both my baby twins caught Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV),just before they were due to come home from the special care baby unit. I had never heard of this virus, although it effects 20,000 children and babies a year. My babies were born in the middle of RSV season, yet the hospital had no warnings of this or any other illness and people were left to walk in and out however sick, with no awareness of the consequences. We have to trust the most fragile babies to this care, the law should take this on and ensure procedures are in place to inform and monitor people entering this supposedly protected environment. My baby would still be with me today if this basic level of care was taken. I cannot follow up this case with the hospital as there is no law that says they need to offer this basic level of protection!",
