These are people we have elected on the basis of trust to represent us.\n\nTo do otherwise, to lie to us, to mislead us is a betrayal of that trust at the most basic and abusive level.\n\nParents who abuse their children are punished - so should public servants who abuse those in their charge.\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to define in law the punishments and penalties for deception and misleading the public.\n\nWe believe as those who elected you this is the very least we deserve.",
