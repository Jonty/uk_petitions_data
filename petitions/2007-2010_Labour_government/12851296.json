Dr Abidi, founder director of a social entreprise in Health & Social care, CHIEF raised questions over the fairness of forcing social enterprises to pay tax(CT) on profits if that tax will cut down their ability to deliver social benefits. Although tax can be avoided through setting up a charity, this brings with it added costs, management issues and extra hassle.",
