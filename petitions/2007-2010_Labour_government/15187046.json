            "background": "The 10% Cider Tax will apply to the traditional cider brewed at small local farms and businesses throughout the UK therefore risking putting more traditional British firms out of business.  It will also penalise the people who simply enjoy a glass of traditional cider with their Ploughman\u2019s lunch.\n\nExperts predict the tax hike raise as little as \u00a315 million a year for the Treasury whilst devastating the revitalised UK cider-making industry and putting hundreds of jobs at risk. \n\nThe government has shown an ignorance to Britain's cider industry.  Taxing all cider so heavily is wrong.  The Government has made a mistake.  Instead the Government needs to address the problem drinks, which have a dangerously high strength, in a considered way not by just slapping on tax.  \n\nThe Government should heed the lessons of the 1763 cider tax which led to riots and the resignation of the Prime Minister.",
