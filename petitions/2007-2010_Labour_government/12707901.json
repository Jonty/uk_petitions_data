        "action": "introduce legislation to remove the right to Legal Aid provided to repeat offenders (defined as anyone convicted of three or more offences within any four-year period).",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The majority of crime is committed by a relatively small but very active number of offenders who have no motivation to be rehabilitated as the Criminal Justice system indulges rather than deters them.\n\nThis soft approach starts when the suspect is processed after arrest and immediately told that they are entitled to legal representation.  As almost all repeat offenders qualify for Legal Aid due to the lack or covert nature of their funds, we the taxpayers are being taken for mugs.\n\nI understand that the Liberal elite who got us into this terrible mess will howl but they can mitigate the effect on their friends by volunteering their own services pro bono or contributing to a Repeat Offender Legal Aid charity if they are so bothered.",
