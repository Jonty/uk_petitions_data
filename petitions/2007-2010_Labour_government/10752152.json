            "background": "Hi my name is Carl and i have written and produced a song called people need to stop knife crime. The song is aimed at reducing knife crime across Birmingham and gives parents, teachers and the general public an insight into why people commit knife crime and offers the youth a way out. The CD is on sale at Hard to find records .com and Swordfish Records Temple street Birmingham city centre. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOUR COMPANY COULD SHOW AN INTEREST AND SUPPORT THE CAUSE. I would like to sell the CD from community centers, schools and youth centers AND NEED SOME PR to get the ball rolling. Thanks from Carl Martin 07504148064 I would be good if you could help me get me to raise awareness about knife crime and promote the song.",
