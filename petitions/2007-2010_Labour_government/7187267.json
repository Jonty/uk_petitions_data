Immigrants, on the whole, are very badly-off so they are unable to afford to pay for such lessons themselves; if, therefore, the Government (or Local Authorities) will not pay for them how ARE they supposed to learn it?  The American government used to (and may still) pay for their immigrants to do so.",
