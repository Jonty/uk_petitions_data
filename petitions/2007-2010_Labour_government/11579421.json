        "background": "We think that driving lessons should be made cheaper because young people find it difficult to get enough money for driving lessons and it is difficult to learn to drive so this means they need to have longer hours of driving, therefore the payment is more worthwhile as it covers more hours. (at least 2 hours)Also if this is not possible then all driving companies should ensure that if a learner driver fails their first exam, they should get the next test free.",
