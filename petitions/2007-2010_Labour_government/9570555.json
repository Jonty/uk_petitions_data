            "background": "I believe that all service men and women fighting the wars for this government are entitled to the correct kit and equipment and as such should not have to buy any part tof the kit that will save lives such as bullet proof vests and helmets, boots or in some instances weapons, and basic supplies such as food and uniforms. These men and women are putting their lives on the line and as such we feel it is the responsibility of the people who send them there to ensure they come back alive if possible. Also that the accomodation they reside in before and after fighting shoudld be brought to anacceptable level. It is not right that soldiers sailors and airmen should be forced to live in squalor and buildings that should have been condemmed years ago with rats and various other vermin.",
