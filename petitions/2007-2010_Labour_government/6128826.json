            "background": "Whilst I appreciate the reasoning behind asking smokers to venture outdoors to enjoy their cigarettes we now have the scenario that non smokers are being driven from the outside areas of pubs and restaurants.\n\nFresh air is a natural comodity which we should all be encouraged to enjoy, can we have the current smoking restrictions increased to include all places that people congregate.\n\nPublic Parks should also be considered as they are provided for the enjoyment and benefit of all of the society but particularly children, by banning smoking from these areas the enjoyment of these areas would be opened up to us all.",
