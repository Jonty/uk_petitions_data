            "background": "The abolition of the 10p tax band means that anyone earning under \u00a319,000 per year now pays more than \u00a3200 a year in extra tax. This is a steep levy for those already struggling with rising living costs.\nThe Prime Minister has stated that those adversely affected will be compensated through tax credits. This does not compensate childless people and pensioners. The complex system of tax credits means that money is taken from even the lowest earners and then hands it back to parents. A fairer option to all would have been to simply raise the starting threshold for tax, taking the poorest out of the system altogether.\nThis petition seeks to ensure that the Government fully compensates those affected who do not qualify for tax credits.",
