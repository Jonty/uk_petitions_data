It does not matter if you are unemployed or working you get it anyhow. Doctors do not do this and hospitals do not do this so why should  dentists be allowed to. In my own experience i was charged this fee and because i could not afford to pay it neither myself or my children were allowed treatment. This could happen to you.",
