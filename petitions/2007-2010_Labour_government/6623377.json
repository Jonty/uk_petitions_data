            "background": "The price level of petrol and diesel is getting beyond; effectively increasing the cost of living for all. All areas of society rely heavily upon road transport, therefore, by increasing fuel costs this increases transportation costs, hence food, clothing, travel to and from work, leisure etc, all are affected, pushing up the cost of living.\n\nThe time has come to say enough is enough and the Government has this time gone too far. Whilst in the past, they have relied upon competition from within the industry to keep prices low. There is now, very little scope for this to continue. Consequently, fuel prices on this occasion are likely to stay high and likely to rise even higher. Many British people are already finding it difficult to make ends meet. The recent increase in fuel duty will inevitably, push many into spiralling debt.",
