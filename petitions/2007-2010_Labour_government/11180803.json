            "background": "Our gonernment currently levies the same duty on diesel as it does on petrol.  This puts business at a disadvantage and negates the benefit of buying diesel cars which generate less CO2.  \n\nThe duty should be reduced by about 10p to level the price (the oil companies are still overcharging for diesel because they can).  Instead, legislation could easily be intoduced to make DPFs (diesel particulate filters) compusory on new vehicles - this would make them as clean as petrol vehicles, whilst still emitting less CO2.",
