            "background": "Older riders using a provisional motorcycle license are considered as incompetent and as dangerous as teenage moped risers. This is unfair and discriminates against responsible older motorcycle users. The light motorcycle license should be awarded after holding a provisional license for 4 years and allow the holder to ride up to a 250cc motorcycle maximum without L plates. The license holder would need to be aged 25+ and with no points or any other traffic convictions/prosecutions gained within those 4 years. A motorway test would  be undertaken if, and only if, the holder wishes to use motorways. This petition does not propose changes to Direct Access.",
