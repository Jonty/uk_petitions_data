        "background": "In response to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's documentary on chicken farming, I beleive that inhumane chicken farming is driven by supermarket demands. These demands leave farmers with no option but to resort to intensive farming to make a living. Many cannot afford free range chicken, however a national move to free range would reduce the cost of free range chickens.",
