            "background": "Following the loss of the confidential records of 25 million Britons by H.M. Revenue & Customs, personal data of 3 million learner drivers and several other data protection incidents, we urge the Government to abandon the planned NHS database.\n\nThis national NHS database, which is part of the NHS Programme for IT/NHS Care Records Service/NHS Spine will store large amounts of personal data, much of which will be more sensitive than that lost by HMRC.\n\nEven without malicious or accidental data loss, sensitive medical recordds will be accessible to many more people (NHS staff) than is currently the case for locally-held data.\n \nThis fundamental attribute of the NHS Spine is also a fundamental & inescapable data protection risk.\n\nThe British people would be forgiven for lacking faith in the Government's ability to protect the security and integrity of personal information held on large databases, given recent events.\n\nTherefore, we urge the Government to learn from the recent data protection incidents and abandon its drive to create ever larger & more complex databases about its citizens, such as the national NHS database.",
