        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Transport chaos has hit the users of the Oldham Loop as the planners involved in the creation of the Metrolink extension didn't have to common sense to close the train loop gradually while the necessary changes were made to allow for the new trams.\n\nThe impact of this closure has been felt in the Oldham and Rochdale districts, as inadequate alternative transport to Manchester has been provided.\n\nWith the line being a loop, it would have made much more sense to continue journeys for as long as possible while gradually closing the line when the work has reached that point.  Instead, the whole borough of Oldham is cut off from the National Rail Network, as are areas of Rochdale, prime commuter belt.\n\nWe, the undersigned, would like to hear the reasons for this lack of common sense, and desperately hope the line can at least partially be reopened in the short term.",
