No pages in Maths and Science papers should have instructions in how to do equations\n\nStudents have to resort in doing 2 years' of study in a couple of 2-3 hour papers. This will sort out those who have studied hard over those who skipped revision. Also, teachers should not tell their students what areas could be in the papers. It's should be anything covered during the past 2 years.\nToday's grades are seriously inflated. Once this is introduced, see the grades tumble to more realistic levels.",
