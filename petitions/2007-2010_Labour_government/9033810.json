        "background": "Religious education currently serves to teach children about Christianity and Islam mainly. Children in all schools, and of all ages, should be taught about all religions, and for equal duration. This would create more conscious thinkers in our society, and also if the views of athiest or agnostic people were included within these lessons, it would cause believers of different religions, and non believers, to understand each other better as societies and individuals.",
