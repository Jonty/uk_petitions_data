        "action": "spare the historic Norfolk village of Pentney by refusing approval for gravel extraction in the proposed MIN93 site, which extends into the heart of the village and threatens to rip the heart and soul out of the community.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "What's the threat?\nA mineral extraction company wants to dig a whopping great big quarry smack bang in the middle of our lovely village.\n\nWhat's at risk?\nIn simple terms, everything that we know and love about Pentney. The peace, the serenity, the scenery. Properties will suffer damage and in some cases will be swallowed entirely, their values will be reduced and the roads will be rendered unuseable and dangerous.\nA green cemetary will be dug up, and the grade 1 listed church of St Mary Magdalene will be destroyed.\n\nWho will it affect?\nEveryone in the village, and more. The proposal will also have an impact on the lives of people living as far away as Narborough and West Bilney.\n\nWhat can I do about it?\nSupport the Save Pentney campaign by signing this E-Petition.",
