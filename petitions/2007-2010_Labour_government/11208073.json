            "background": "There are six times as many savers as there are borrowers in the United Kingdom.In spite of this the Prime Minister is pressurising Banks and Building  Societies to pass on the whole of  base rate cuts to borrowers with total disregard for the plight of prudent, hard working savers.This has lead to a big reduction in income for people who rely heavily upon savings income to maintain a reasonable standard of living.\nIf justice for savers is not addressed it is our intention to withdraw our deposits from Banks and Building Societies starting with those which have been partly nationalised eg Royal Bank of Scotland.\nThis would give rise to the unedifying sight of depositors queuing around the block to retrieve their hard earned but undervalued funds.",
