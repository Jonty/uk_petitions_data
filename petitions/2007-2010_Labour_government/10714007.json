            "background": "I like a lot of people find it strange that in good times the government claim it is due to their management of the economy, and yet when there is a downturn it is everyone elses fault bar theirs.\n\nThey should take the banks and energy companies to task over their mis-management. If these were ordinary companies they would have gone to the wall. I believe the government have a legitimate cause to do this as they are taking tax payers money - therefore they ARE answerable to us.\n\nThey should clear up the mess they have help worsen in the housing market by confirming the stamp duty plans.\n\nThis government needs to stop twiddling their thumbs and come up with a step by step plan and quickly to get the economy back on it's feet.",
