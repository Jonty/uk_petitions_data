            "background": "The true worth of a government is measured by how it preserves the health and wellbeing of the people in the country or nation that it represents.  Obesity epidemic in Britain can be eradicated by introducing deterrent laws. We have trust funds for children but if we do not preserve their lives by investing in a no junk policy; we can defeat the object as many may not live long enough to make a valid contribution to the pension fund.  Homogenised milk riddled with chemicals that mimic estrogen could be blamed for the increasing numbers of women with fibroids... who eventually end their child bearing years earlier with hysterectomy. Let us invest in tomorrow and save our future sorrow.",
