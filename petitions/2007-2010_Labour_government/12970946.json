            "background": "In the current economic climate, many small businesses are struggling just to survive. For many, particulary those in rural locations, their business rates demand represents nothing more than a waste of money - there is the perception that very little is given in return for paying the business rates - at a time when cashflow is critical and many business owners are struggling to keep their staff in employment.\n\nThe current 'small business relief' does not go far enough. We are still paying thousands of pounds in business rates every year in return for very little.\n\nThe backbone of this country's economy are SME's, and without further support from the government, many will go out of business and weaken the country as a whole.\n\nWe demand that the business rates system for SME's is reviewed and overhauled, and that SME's are given more financial support to enable them to continue trading",
