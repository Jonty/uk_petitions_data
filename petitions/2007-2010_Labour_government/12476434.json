If the response was good, they would then look for a new property.\n\nBy putting the burden of a \u00a3400 HIP on folk, they no longer take this approach. This has resulted in a dramatic slump of the housing market.\n\nThe HIP is of minimal use to the purchaser - e.g. local authority searches are only relevant on the day they are carried out, not up to twelve months later.",
