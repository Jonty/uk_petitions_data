            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The early U turn on HIPs was prompted by failure to attract surveyors to train as Home Inspectors, and latterly as Energy Inspectors. Surveyors, estate agents, lawyers and mortgage lenders, have expressed opposition to HIPs. Lenders now say the pack is insufficient for their purpose. Public support is minimal. \nWithin it's brief, the enquiry should investigate  \n1. whether the department was aware it would be unlikely to attract surveyors in the numbers required, there being little support for the scheme from day 1, therefore wasting public money \n2. accusations that the department gave false estimates on the numbers of surveyors recruited as Home Inspectors and Energy Inspectors and consequently mislead parliament and the industry \n3. accusations that, small business's and individuals have lost considerable sums of money on wasted training, \n4. payment of compensation to those who have lost money on wasted training and acreditation\n5. withdrawal of the scheme to be followed by full discussions with the industry on the way forward in which the government will listen and take advice offered by professionals.",
