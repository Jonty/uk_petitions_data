            "background": "Today saw the announcement that the bank of England is working on a lending programme that could make it easier for banks to lend to each other; The plan is to swap mortgage-based assets for government bonds - as such the treasury will use taxpayers money to back mortgage books of dubious quality in a housing market which is seeing price crashes; a potentially dangerous situation for taxpayer wallets already facing higher fuel, food and mortgage bills. \n\nWe the signatories of this petition believe this to be a government bailout of an industry that has reported yearly record profits for the past decade but now does not want to face the negative aspects of its business models.\n\nAs such we demand that any such package of initiatives involving taxpayer backed money to banks or financial institutions stipulate that all management bonuses and shareholder dividends be stopped until the loan is paid back to the taxpayer; this way you ensure that the persons responsible for the bailout mess do not reap the benefits of the bailout.",
