That\u2019s in addition to the unwilling support given by millions of decent hardworking folk reluctant to ignore PC directives, no matter how absurd, for fear of having their jobs/careers put on hold or ruined by the politically correct. Political correctness and it\u2019s running mate, compensation, have become instruments of fear in the hands of too many people with vested interests all too eager to play the discrimination card. Who agrees that political correctness, in a creepy crawly way, is peeling away significant layers of our cherished freedoms and liberties?",
