            "background": "What on earth is happening here? A child gets abused by someone they are supposed to trust, they then get interviewed, which is videoed, and in which they are subject to all manner of questions! You then go home to 'get on with it'. Then statements have to be made by immidiate family.....\nWhilst all this is happening The person that has committed the abused leave their job and is roaming about god knows where, While we sit, and suffer by not Knowing where they are! Great is'nt it? I request that new laws are made to provide protection for the Child, instead of The child abuser being protected for their own safety! Also for the family to be offered some help during this time not 3 to 6 months down the line!  Tougher sentences or Corporal punishment would also be a deterrent of such people. Therefore maintaining the right of the child for protection, dignity, and hopefully worthiness.....",
