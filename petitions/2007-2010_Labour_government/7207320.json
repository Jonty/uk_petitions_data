        "background": "This is in opposition to a petition asking for their use to be available to all traffic except during the rush hour.  As a non-driver who depends on buses I am, quite frankly, tired of spending what feels like hours waiting for buses which never arrive (or feel as if they don't) while car after car, almost all containing only the driver, goes past.  In my opinion there should be MORE bus lanes; in fact ALL roads should have them.  Drivers might object that this would increase congestion for drivers; maybe it would but at least they'd be sitting in a warm car while waiting to continue their journey unlike would-be bus passengers standing waiting in the cold!",
