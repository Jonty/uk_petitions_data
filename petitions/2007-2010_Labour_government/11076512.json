            "background": "To toughen the job seekers and income support laws by instead of handing over money to hand over a card that can only be used for essential items ie:- NO ALCOHOL, CIGARETTES AND DRUGS ALLOWED. Thus ensuring people will want to get a job to enjoy the pleasures in life but also realise they have to work for them, also ensuring that those on long term income support don't turn to alcohol or cigarettes due to depression, this ensures children are looked after better, people want to get back to work the government spends less, there are less chance of these people becoming alcohol dependant and having to go onto disability. Help people find their way back and give them something to work for.",
