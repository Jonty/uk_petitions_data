            "background": "Our understanding of the human genome is increasing every day. Many therapies for diseases which use genetic engineering are in preparation. We are constantly seeing headlines about genes for certain traits (diseases, looks, intelligence, talents) being discovered. At some point in the future, it will be possible to introduce these traits into a human embryo, and bring about babies born with traits different to their parents.\n This country has a strong history of socialised healthcare via the NHS. It is deplorable to think that in the future, the rich will be able to buy treatments for their own genes to extend their lives and health, and to improve their children's genetics, while the poor are left without. Therefore, we call upon the Prime Minister to ensure equality of access once these technologies are safe.",
