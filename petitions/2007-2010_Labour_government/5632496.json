        "action": "set Council Tax on second homes at 20 times the normal band rate",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Second homes are responsible for greatly inflated house prices in areas of natural beauty but poverty for local people.\nWages in these areas are among the lowest in the UK and partial occupation of second homes is killing off villages and communities. \nMany young people and key workers are unable to afford the prices and either live with relatives or move out of the area all together.\nSecond home owners and locals who sell to SHO's are creating a time bomb of inequality and resentment that if left unchecked will explode into civil unrest (as currently being seen in Cornwall)\nIf people can afford \u00a3300,000 on a second home then they can afford to pay X20 Council tax which should be used to build affordable housing in prime locations and not sink estates on the edge of towns.",
