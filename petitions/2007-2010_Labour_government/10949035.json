            "background": "It has been reported in the press that the FIA has been trying to pressure the BBC into reversing their decision to employ Martin Brundle as a F1 commentator.\n\nWe the undersigned believe that if this is true then this is likely to be motivated by the FIAs displeasure at Mr Brundle's opinions which have critisised the FIAs running of Forumla 1 and the behaviour of its president Max Mosely.\n\nWe the undersigned believe that free speech is a basic tenet of a free society and that the BBC as a publicly funded organisation has a responsibility to uphold this fundamental freedom despite pressure from external parties.  We call upon the Prime Minister to support the BBC by writing to the BBC encouraging them to resist any call for Mr Brundles position of commentator to be reversed.",
