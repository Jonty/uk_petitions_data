            "background": "Over the last few decades some corrupt citizens of this country have created an illegal spy network consisting of hidden listening devices and spy cameras covering virtually the whole country. It is used in a completely illegal way to spy on, steal from, and harass innocent citizens. It contradicts many laws including the Human Rights Act, The Freedom From Harassment Act, The Data Protection Act, The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, The Computer Misuses Act, and Copyright and Confidentiality laws. The people they target are not criminals or terrorists but ordinary people who are singled out in an arbitrary way and victimised for no good reason. It\u2019s use is completely out of control, it is essentially legitimised criminality. This petition calls for the complete abolition of this illegal network and for existing laws against illegal spying to be properly enforced.",
