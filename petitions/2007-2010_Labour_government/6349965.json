            "background": "Dr. Howard Stoate (MP Dartford) speaking in a House of Commons debate last May, according to  the Hansard report, suggested co-proxamol should become a controlled painkiller as the GP would then be free to prescribe it without having to walk a legal tightrope to do so. Few GPs, if any, will wish to expose themselves to the possible threat of litigation by doing so, however strong the patient\u2019s need for the drug. In practice, the solution amounts to a comprehensive ban he said.",
