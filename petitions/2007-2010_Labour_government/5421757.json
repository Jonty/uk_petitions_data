            "background": "For those on lower incomes, Network cards are a lifeline allowing them to access affordable rail transport in a country where it normally costs more than in most other European countries, and where it is 70% more expensive in real terms than it was in the UK in the 1970s - despite the Government's supposed interest in encouraging public transport to reduce greeenhouse gas emissions.  Until recently Network cards allowed one-third off rail journeys in the South East 7 days a week (after 10 am on weekdays) - but since a minimum charge of \u00a310 a journey has been introduced Monday to Friday, this has discouraged the use of public transport, encouraged the environmentally damaging use of cars insetead, and prevented travel by the poorest who cannot afford the high standard fares now charged by Britain's railways.",
