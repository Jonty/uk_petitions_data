            "background": "The hazard perception component of the theory test should be cancelled due to these reasons:\n\n - You do not have the same visibility as you do in a real life situation; you cannot check your mirrors or look out of the side doors. \n - There is no noise which is unreal\n - the computer screen is un-clear and not as visible as in real life\n\n\nThere is an alternate, more fair solution: You could be analysed for hazard perception in your practical driving test\n\n\nThe cost of retaking the exam, is \u00a331+. When you fail, you are paying for nothing, if the hazard perception test is chose not to be removed, it should at least allow you to continue retaking the exam until you pass with one payment.",
