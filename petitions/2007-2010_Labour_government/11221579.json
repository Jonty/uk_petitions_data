        "background": "Halal meat is barbaric and cruel. As a Christian, I am deeply offended by this ferocious and brutal slaughter of our animals. Why should this Government allow this to happen - is it because they are so afraid of upsetting this minority. I, and I\u2019m sure the majority of people, would like to see this outlawed completely. Just remember this is not a muslim country. I thought that democracy stood for the majority and not the minority.  I am not against muslims but if they come to a Christian country they should follow Christian values.  Stop this so called multicultural society it will never work British people need British values. If they do not have this then why would you be proud of your country, why would you fight for your country, when most Councils will not even let you fly a British flags in case you upset the minority's.  Remember who\u2019s grandfather's died for this country, then remember those who live in this country and then move to their native country to kill British troops in the name of Allah and terrorism because of their indifference to the British public who are forced to endure demands.",
