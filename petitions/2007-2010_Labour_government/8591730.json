        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With so many schools across the UK being closed and/or joined with other schools, schools will soon be in short supply. I also believe that Locals Councils Accountants are selling land that belongs to their constituants to save themselves and their out of control budgets. Schools are necessary to the local population and are not cash cows to be sold off to balance the councils books. If you have a local school that is closing you should sign this petition, and help stop the rot in local council education buget balancing.",
