            "background": "I have experienced an appalling standard of tuition at my university, during my second year.  We were told at the being of the second year, \"second years kinda get put to one side\", yet we were still expected to pay the \u00a33145 in tuition fees.  We did, in fact, get put to one side and hardly received anything the course supposedly offered.  I don't see why we have payed \u00a33145, to be pushed to one side.  It's absolutely outrageous! Furthermore, they've completely exploited us as they probably think the majority of students will settle for anything because we are young and \"naive\".  Therefore will not complain.  People will only realise  when it's too late and have left university and have to come to terms with having spent an insane amount of money and gained hardly anything from it.  Except, debt.  \nIf this happens in one university, how many other universities allow this?  It has to be stopped.",
