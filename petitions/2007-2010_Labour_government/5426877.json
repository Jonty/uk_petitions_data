            "background": "Appealing the administration would likely lead to the demise of Leeds United FC, a club with a long and esteemed history. The appeal will only work on the basis of problems with the process and it is known the process was sound. Any appeal by the HMRC would consequently appear to be a personal vendetta by the civil servants in question, as the HMRC will receive much more funding in the future by a vibrant Leeds United. If the HMRC succeed in winding Leeds United up, there will be no prospect of future income and tax, it will create a void of sport in Leeds, result in the loss of many jobs, and cause huge disruption to the lives of the many people who support Leeds United and follow football in general.",
