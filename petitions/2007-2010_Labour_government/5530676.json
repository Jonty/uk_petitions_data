            "background": "The current driving penalty points system for drivers is outdated and needs to be improved. It seems nowadays people cannot be bothered with common courtesy and manners on UK roads. Not bothering to indicate on roundabouts and motorways, hogging middle and outside lanes on motorways, entering motorways/dual carriageways from slip roads which are supposed to be \"GIVE WAY\" but just pulling straight out with the real possibilty of causing accidents, queue jumping and barging in etc.. I think it should be of the descretion of any police officer viewing the above offences to give maybe one, two or three points and a fine. This would certainly improve driving in the UK and ease the current problems with road rage.",
