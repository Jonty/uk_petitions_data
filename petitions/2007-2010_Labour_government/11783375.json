            "background": "We need the current age limit of 50 changed to allow mammograms for all women.\nThere is no age limit to who can get breast cancer so there should be no age limit to who can be screened for it. Early detection is vital for good recovery and survival.\nOpening up the age limit would be beneficial to both the health service and the women whose lives are affected by breast cancer due to the early detection and therefore less harrowing and intrusive treatment that late detection inevitably brings.\nPrevention is better than cure.",
