        "background": "Whilst we recognise the ultimate sacrifice made by many conscripts in the first and second world wars, any conceivable justification for creating a public holiday by which to remember these dead has long since passed. Not only were those who have died in combat since conscription ended in 1960 military professionals who chose their occupation in full knowledge of the possible outcome, but also these recent wars have been largely expeditionary conflicts with political origins. There has been much public opposition to these wars and therefore creating a public holiday to commemorate those who died fighting them as opposed to taking a principled stand against participation in them would be socially divisive.",
