            "background": "We are now being told that it is likely that nearly 2m cars are being driven on UK roads without even third party insurance.  The system is in place to impound and crush the vehicle when drivers are found not to be insured.  However this is rarely enforced and a moderate fine, usually less than an annual premium, is the punishment given by courts.  If an insured car is always impounded and crushed I believe the number of abusers would reduce significantly.",
