A moat.\n\n2. A pond with housing for ducks. \n\n3. A plasma television.\n\n4. An elephant-shaped lamp. \n\n5. Several bags of manure.\n\n6. As many lavatory seats as necessary.\n\n7. Hanging baskets.\n\n8. A trouser press.\n\n9. A leather rocking-chair\n\n10. Treatment for dry rot.\n\nEDITORS - Whilst my petition DOES contain humour, it does make a serious point about government policy. Considering you allowed the following petition - http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/nightclubcheese/ I think your rejection of my petition is odd. If you reject it again, I would like a full explanation of why you allowed the nightclub cheese petition please.",
