We have accepted the smoking ban in public places with very little problems - probably because as a group we have great consideration for others.\nBut how much further is this persecution going to go - will it be soon any films showing people smoking will not be allowed to be screened on TV.\nWill non-smokers not be allowed to see great films such as the Guns of Navarone.",
