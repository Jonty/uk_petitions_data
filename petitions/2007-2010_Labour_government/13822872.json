            "background": "Due to the effects of global warming the rain falling from ours skies is becoming more and more polluted. The wearing of swimming goggles would prevent rain to eye penetration; which could cause temporary blindness, thus making it very dangerous for the pedestrian who intends to cross. This would invariably reduce the number of people being knocked down by motor    vehicles whilst crossing roads/streets. The reduction of accidents would have a money saving affect on the emergency   services and alleviate some of the pressure on our, already over stretched National Health Service.",
