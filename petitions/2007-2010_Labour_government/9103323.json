            "background": "To have a dog gate next to every countryside footpath style would improve access to dog walkers and their dogs in the countryside, especially for those with larger breeds. This would also improve Health and Safety in the countryside for dog walkers, especially the young and elderly. As the only other way to get access if there is no existing dog gate is to carry a dog over a style thus increasing the chances of a fall and injury to owner and pet.",
