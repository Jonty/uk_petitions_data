        "background": "Carbon trading is an ill considered concept that will do little or nothing to reduce overall pollution and may actually increase the production of greenhouse gasses in some sectors. \nThe only beneficiary is likely to be a vast new industry devoted to trading in 'carbon' and raking off large profits from taxpayers' money. Powerful institutions with vested financial interests in the proliferation of carbon trading will, once the scheme is established, ensure that it can never be reversed or challenged and will block more effective solutions to global warming.",
