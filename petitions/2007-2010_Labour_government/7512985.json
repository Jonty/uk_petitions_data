        "background": "Following the recent announcement by the Home Secretary of the Police Pay award, it appears that Police Officers are now being treated in the same way as all Public Sector workers. Police Officers hold a unique place in society and due to the nature of the job have restrictions placed on them. It is illegal for a Police Officer to go on strike and they cannot take an active role within a political party, amongst many other restrictions. Unless these rights are reinstated Police Officers will not be able to negotiate fair pay or appropriate conditions of service.",
