            "background": "The current system for unemployed people isn't working. The staff in jobcentres have very little knowledge and offer no help to the customer. The fortnightly visits to sign a form are humiliating and degrading.\n\nThe government should introduce a new service aimed at assisting those out of work and allow signing remotely using modern technology such as the computer or mobile phone as a means of reporting any changes in circumstances. Money could be saved by getting rid of all the buildings and unhelpful staff most of whom delight in causing problems and stopping benefit at the slightest excuse.",
