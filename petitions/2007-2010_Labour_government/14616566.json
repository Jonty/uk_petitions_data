Everybody KNOWS that Lord Hutton was instructed to whitewash the government and acted with direct instructions from our so called government to secret the information away for 70 years.  We need to know why it is OK for American taxpayers to know the truth and why our government feels that the truth must be kept from UK taxpayers.",
