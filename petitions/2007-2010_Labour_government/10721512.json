            "background": "Music festivals have long been an integral part of British culture, stretching back many centuries. \nPeople work hard all year round for that one weekend a year when they can let their hair down and be themselves. Such events are to be encouraged at a time when we are being urged to cut down on foreign travel to cut carbon emissions.\nIt is unreasonable that absurdly low decibel limits can be imposed because a tiny number of residents complain, even when 99% of residents don\u2019t object. The silent majority of non-objectors have paid their council taxes too, so why don\u2019t their views prevail? This is meant to be a democracy.\nThese decibel limits do not just affect overall volume, they have a detrimental effect on sound quality too. People have often paid \u00a3150 or more for these tickets, a sizeable chunk of it going to the Government. Some festivals also donate to worthy causes locally and globally.\nPlease get the balance right \u2013 only impose limits where a majority of local residents want them.",
