            "background": "It is a well known problem.  Young people get fake ID, which allows them into Bars, Pubs, Clubs, you name it and the ID allows them to do it.  This is obviously a problem, because it can lead to youth violence, which has dominated the broadsheets and tabloids alike\n\nThe aim of this petition is to put new measures in place to make it tougher for fake id.  For example, making it so that the only form of ID acceptable for pubs etc is a passport, which is harder to fake than an ID card.  Also, if this were to go ahead, then a random police sting should happen regularly to ensure that the clubs are checking properly.",
