            "background": "The current national speed limit of 60 mph on single carriage roads encourages excessive speeds on inappropriate roads, such as country lanes, and allows for challenges to prosecution on the grounds that speed limit signs were incorrectly placed. A new national limit of 30 mph on all roads, with higher, or lower limits being applied only where appropriately signed, would significantly reduce traffic speeds on the majority of small roads. It would also create a culture of driving more slowly. Where a driver was unsure of the permitted speed limit then there would be no excuse to travel at any speed greater than 30 mph.",
