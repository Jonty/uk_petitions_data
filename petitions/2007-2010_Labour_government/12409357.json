            "background": "The Government should consider both Harry Patch and Henry Allingham for a Knighthood, because,\nBoth these men fought in the first World War, which was termed \"Hell on Earth\". Not only that, they are the ONLY combatants still alive. When these men sadly pass away, WW1 will change from \"Living History\" to History. Surely these men deserve a Knighthood for what they have been through for OUR Country.",
