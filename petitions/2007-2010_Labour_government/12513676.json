            "background": "Under this legislation, every MP would be paid whatever they liked, so long as the electorate voted for them. There would need to be safeguards to ensure that political parties didn't subsidise their MPs. Not only would this remove all arguments about MPs' pay and expenses, it would make for very interesting elections. Candidates who were prepared to live frugally could stand in safe seats and present a real challenge to the sitting MPs. It would have the added benefit of making opinion pollsters' jobs a lot more difficult.",
