            "background": "Banks have not reduced their targets for both the branch and individual cashiers since the economic downturn. Cashiers are being bullied if they do not meet their targets for the week. Most banks are advertising for cashiers as people are leaving the jobs due to the high stress of hitting unrealistic targets. Plus people are getting fed up asking questions when they visit the branch such as 'do you want a loan?' etc.\n\nI would like the govt to intervene with banks as ask them to reduce targets and leads needs per bank.",
