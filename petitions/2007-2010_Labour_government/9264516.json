The Youth Parliament does not, however, attract the same levels of publicity as the 'adult' Parliament. The Prime Minister needs to be made more aware of what the Youth Parliament does, as there are 11 million young people in the UK - the Government doesn't always think to consult young people on matters affecting them...surely their voices need to be listened to too?!",
