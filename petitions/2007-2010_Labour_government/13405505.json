Anyone born in the same circumstances after 1983 or at anytime to a UK father can simply complete a passport application without the need to register.  The registration/fee is required regardless of country of residence so that even someone who has lived in the UK for most of their lives, is a taxpayer, a home owner and has known no other country, still has to register and pay the fee.",
