        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently stamp duty goes up for the whole cost of the property so the cost of stamp duty if you pay \u00a3249,999 is \u00a32,499. If you pay \u00a3250,001 (\u00a32 more pounds!) your stamp duty bill goes up to \u00a37500. More than \u00a35000 for paying \u00a32 more.\n\nRates of stamp duty should be altered so that each level applies to the proportion of the property price in which it falls, so if you paid \u00a3250,001 the cost would be 1% on the first \u00a3250,000 and 3% on the \u00a31 over the threshold. This may require a review of the threshold levels and percentages charged but would help buyers who are put off houses priced between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3300,000 because of the unreasonable amount of duty paid.\n\nThis is a continuation of the petition opened by James Shepherd that expired in January 2008.  I see this petition as on-going because its sign-up rate will be fairly low, due to the long time periods between people moving properties and realising the crazy situation.",
