        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The fact is that all smokers know smoking is bad for you, and carries all kinds of risks, however we continue to do so. The government cannot raise taxes on smoking any further, and people will continue to smoke, banning vending machines and shops even showing a cigarette packet will only push more people toward the black market, the pub might not sell them but there is a guy in the corner with duty free, thus preventing much needed revenue.\n\nThis whole notion of people stopping smoking if they can't see it is bogus, smokers are citizens too. The legislative time could be better used on real social problems, not wasted on people who are fully aware of the situation they put themselves in.",
