            "background": "Seatbelts are a vital part of the safety equipment fitted in all vehicles. The majority of drivers use seatbelts however there are still numerous driver who flout the law. \nThe current colouring of seatbelts makes them difficult for police officers to see. \nInstituting a requirement for seatbelts to be an bright colour, say illuminous yellow, would encourage people to wear them instead of receiving a fine from the police. \nMany road safety initiatives around seatbelts have failed to change the habits of some - change the law so that everyone will see if someone isnt wearing their belt!!",
