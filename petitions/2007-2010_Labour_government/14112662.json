            "background": "The UK is among the few countries in Europe that persist in allowing parents the right to 'chastise' their children using physical force and violence.\nThe UK was one of the first countries in the world to abolish the ultimate hypocrisy of capital punishment (a feat of which we should be proud) and has already successfully barred schools and othering 'caring' settings from beating children in the interests of 'behavioural improvement'.\nUltimately, abuse and physical assault on another human being is morally and legally wrong - to condone such behaviour against a person under the age of 16 is vile, unjustifiable and an insult to the idea of a humane and civilised society. Corporal punishment should be ended: now!",
