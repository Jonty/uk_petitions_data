        "background": "From 11 pm to 5 am it is apparently illegal for petrol stations to sell hot drinks for \"licensing reasons\".\n\nYet, this is the very time weary drivers could benefit from the often quoted advice in the \"tiredness kills\" campaign's message to take a break, and a coffee will often help revive a tired driver.  Away from the motorways and their service stations, thousands of miles of trunk roads are served by 24 hours petrol stations which have hot drinks vending machines, which they are not allowed to use.\n\nAllowing them to do so may even save lives by ensuring drivers have access to coffee and tea during the hours that tiredness can be a particular problem.",
