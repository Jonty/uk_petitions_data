            "background": "Any Government will naturally have re-election in mind when creating policy. The current economic situation calls for long term thinking and action, both of which will be stifled by the thought of an election. \n\nWe call for this Government to announce the date for an election so that whichever party wins, they have the mandate to act appropriately for the situation. \n\nWe need an end to party politics and the beginning of thoughtful, pro-active and responsible action. An election victory for any of our political parties will provide at least 5 years of Government to work through the recession without short-term thinking focusing on re-election.",
