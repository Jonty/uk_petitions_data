            "background": "This petition is part of a campaign led by holiday home rentals website Direct Holiday Bookings, aiming to prevent airlines from allowing mobile phone calls and texts during flights.\n \nCurrently, a number of airlines including Ryanair are trialling this service. It is important that this doesn't become common practise within the commercial aviation industry as this will mean that passengers are subjected to excessive noise levels caused by people shouting into handsets or irritating and loud ring tones.\n \nOur users also have safety concerns following a recent report regarding an emergency landing by airline Quantas, thought to have resulted from interference with the aircraft's control system from a wireless laptop. How do we know that the use of mobiles on aeroplanes is completely safe if such events have already occurred?\n \nWe are determined that such trials are abandoned and that no further airlines are able to introduce this facility. Many people use flights as an opportunity to relax before landing at their destination - their flight experience should not be disrupted so that airlines can make more money by introducing this unwanted service.",
