We request our own government recognised mouse council that can meet and discuss issues that affect us and rules and laws for our colonies. Give us the right to vote through Squeak!\n\nwe are citizens of this country and receive no benefits in the harsh times of winter. Allow us the mousely right to a cheese benefit system to keep all mice in cheese- else we shall start nipping ankles!",
