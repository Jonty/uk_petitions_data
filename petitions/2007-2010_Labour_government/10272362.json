            "background": "My son Ben, was 3yrs old, exhausted, pale, thin and depressed. His prognosis was to suffer from asthma, eczema and allergies and be on a 24/7 drug regime for a decade or more. That was his entire childhood. I was not prepared to accept this, at least not without a fight. Learning the right questions to ask of his treatments gave me, his mother, the right information to be able to wean my son off daily use of all conventional medicine within three months. \n\nWell informed, a patient is the right person in the right place to make the right decision for his or her self, or children. Well informed we can work more constructively with the medical profession.  \n\nWe the undersigned feel that a simple poster reminding patients, or the parents of patients, of good questions they could ask should be distributed to, and required to be displayed in, all surgeries and medical centres.",
