        "background": "You have today stated that too much food is wasted, I totally agree with you, but considering that most supermarkets only seem to cater for families.\nBeing a single senior citizen with limited income, its very hard not to waste food as its not always possible to keep such things as bread, bags of potatoes, buy one get one free offers, that usually mean one has 16 chicken thighs etc., and not always the storage for them, or want to eat the same thing each day for the next 8 days.\nPerhaps it would not be a bad idea to suggest to the supermarkets that they should start to consider us and help cut down the waste.",
