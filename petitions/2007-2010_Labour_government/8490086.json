        "background": "Gas fired 'patio heaters' burn a fossil fuel which releases heat and carbon dioxide directly into the atmosphere. This is an incredible waste of a rapidly diminishing finite resource. Heating should be allowed in enclosed spaces and ideally only in insulated closed spaces.\n\nThe UK is a temperate country which means it is has a cold season. People do not have the right to all year outside heat.\n\nThis product may well be routinely burnt as a waste by-product in oil refineries but that is a seperate issue that should be addressed seperately.",
