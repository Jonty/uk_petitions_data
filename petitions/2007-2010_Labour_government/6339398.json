            "background": "In the private sector, employees typically receive 20-30 days holiday allowance per year, whilst teachers are afforded more than double that amount via the school holidays which typically equate to 60+ working days each year.  Those parents working in the private sector with children in school need to manage what is already a huge mis-match between their own holiday allowance and that of their children.  This problem is further aggravated by the ADDITIONAL burden caused by teacher training days.  We are having to arrange child care/take single days holidays for 5-6 teacher training days per annum.  The Government must ensure that teacher training takes place during the actual school holiday, not on the first day back or the last friday before that holiday to lessen the unfair impact on parents.",
