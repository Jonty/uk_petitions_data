        "background": "Bobby Crush was second only to Liberace when it came to tinkling the Ivories during the bygone days of the nineteen seventies.\n\nGetting Bobby back on the box would give youngsters a true role model to live up to in these days of ASBOs, drug crime and loud banging pop music. He was a selfless performer who inspired, created and was fantastic during live performances and also on compilation albums.\n\nMr Brown, please use your influence with the BBC to help get Bobby Crush back onto our screens.",
