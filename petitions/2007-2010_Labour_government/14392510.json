        "background": "Far too often the money spent on overseas aid finds its way into the pockets of unscrupulous individuals who are not in need and fails to help the underprivileged. \n\nWorld population increase is by far the single biggest problem we face today. By educating the world to limit the growth and providing the means to do so, we will solve the problems of famine and climate change at a stroke.\n\nIn 1900 the world population was only 1.5 billion and it has risen to 6.8 billion today.\n\nSir David Attenborough's Horizon documentary poses the uncomfortable question \u201cHow Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?\u201d  \n\nThe Horizon programme describes how the earth will have 7 billion inhabitants within the next couple of years and 9 billion by 2050. Its conclusion is that we are fast approaching the limit for sustainability. Many would admit that we are already there.",
