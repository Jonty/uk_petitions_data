            "background": "BFRS are required by the Fire & Rescue Service National Framework to have in place, and maintain an IRMP which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle both existing and potential risks to communities.  It is not a tool to cut public services to fit an ever reducing budget determined by central government \n\nOne of the proposed cuts to service, and therefore an increased risk to the residents of Bucks is to reduce the amount of Ff\u2019s that currently crew fire appliances from five on the first appliance to every incident, to a new standard of four at five locations across the county.  This single proposal will in all probability, increase injuries and cost lives if implemented.\n\nWhen public and Ff lives are clearly being placed at a far greater risk following the introduction of a draft IRMP, this proves that the current system is broken, and Ministers must intervene. The fact that the present situation is still in the consultation period, and no definite decisions have been made to the alteration of the present staffing arrangements in BFRS is irrelevant to this point.",
