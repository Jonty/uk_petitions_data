        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Stop the RSPB and other organisations from chopping down our woodland to create heathland! Europe now gives money to organisations, like the RSPB to create heathland. The British Isles were never primarily heathland they were always forest. Why should the shape of our countryside be dictated by charities such as the RSPB? Rather than trying to rebuild our indigenous woodlands they are creating an entirely new ecological system that never existed in Britain in the past.\n\nEven if the RSPB want to preserve heath dwelling birds, what about all the vast numbers of insects, mammals, reptiles, fungi and birds that already exist in these areas and are now being destroyed?\n\nIf they want to cut down pines then they need to start replanting indigenous species instead of trying to cultivate heathland. Already areas of ancient woodland have been cut down because of this new European initiative. \n\nAn article by a leading newspaper has already been published entitled 'RSPB accused of damaging British environment in bid to save birds'.\n\nHelp to save our woodlands and rebuild indigenous forests by signing this petition.",
