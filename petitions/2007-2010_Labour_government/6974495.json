Despite graphic TV adverts showing the horrific reality of drink driving, many still get into a car whilst drunk - deliberatly putting other people's lives at risk. If drink driving was considered attempted murder, and punished with 15 years in prison, potential drink drivers would think twice before getting behind the wheel.",
