Two of the coolest cities in England are separated by a mere hour\u2019s train journey, yet a round trip is going to set you back a massive \u00a326!\n\nTravelling from Zone 6 \u2013 the outskirts of London \u2013 to London Bridge Station \u2013 a potentially longer journey \u2013 costs from just \u00a36.50 return. For that you can also travel all over London to your heart\u2019s content at off-peak times. In real terms that\u2019s slightly more than the price of a packet of cigarettes. And slightly less than a brand new bucket and spade. Madness, we say!\n\nWe want to visit the seaside. We want to fish for Oysters with our Oyster cards. And we want our friends by the sea to see the South Bank. It\u2019s only fair. \n\nSo sign up! And help us join these two fair cities with the mighty BLOyster.",
