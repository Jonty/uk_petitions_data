            "background": "Since 1968 all bridleways, irrespective of width, sightlines, surface, urban or rural, have been legally shared by walkers, cyclists and horse riders.  Yet legislation ensures access only to walkers and cyclists on cyclepaths.  Bridleways are used as part of the Safe Routes to School network, yet horse riders, over 85% of whom are women and children, are forced onto dangerous roads instead of sharing safe, off road cyclepaths.  There are well over 29 accidents between horse riders and vehicles per day, 10,658 per year, many of which result in death or serious injury.  There is no justification at all for discriminating against this vulnerable user group. Please put right the wrongs of the last 40 years and save lives.",
