            "background": "Wat Tyler was as charismatic and significant as any leader of any group in history. Others would include Spartacus, William Wallace and Simon de Montfort. The Peasants Revolt established a humanist attitude in the midst of the squalor, disease and the suffering of the English Working Class. It is the belief of a great number of British people that Wat Tyler is worthy of International  recognition because of the egalitarianism suggested in a charter, at a time which pre-dated any accepted comparable intellectual work, by at least 300 years. Let the world see that the ideas of Freedom for all were germinating in England in the summer of 1381. We propose that the 15th of June be commemorated as Wat Tyler Day.",
