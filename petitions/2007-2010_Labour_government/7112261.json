The widespread immigration is crippling the NHS, Housing System, schools & raping the country of benefits that all British people have worked for & entitled to at sometime in their live when disaster strikes. Enoch Powell did not ask for the immigrants to be deported, he asked to close the gates to stop more entering the country. There has been talk of the points system as used in Australia, we shouldn\u2019t be talking about it we should put the system in place!",
