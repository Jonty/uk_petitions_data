        "background": "Whilst I believe it is very important for children to receive religious education to inform them about other cultures and lifestyles, it is wrong to immerse them in religion at an educational establishment in modern Britain. We are an advanced society and religion must play a lesser role or become a problem in the future. Parents too are worried about how religion still plays a role in what should be a school community based upon logic, learning and reason rather than unfounded guesses at what kind of higher being there may be. In the USA religion is a fundamental part of school life and it has become a barrier to progress, with only around 1/4 of the population believing evolutionary theory to be correct, as opposed to around 70% in favour of creationism. It cannot be right to risk our children's education- would you rather your child believed in Darwinian theory that has solid evidence and proof, or a religion that has caused war and grief for countless thousands through the centuries?",
