She frequently does not have an injection on her person when needed, due to being too expensive to purchase and a short shelf life.  Therefore, her life and others in similar situations are in danger.\nI understand people suffering from certain serious illnesses can get free anaphylactic injections (so I have been told - needs confirmation of this point).  \nInjections such as Epipen are vital to life-threatening illness sufferers and should be free, as other medicine is for life-threatening illnesses.\n\nSufferers end up in hospital, which costs the NHS. more in the long run, so please may these people have free injections?",
