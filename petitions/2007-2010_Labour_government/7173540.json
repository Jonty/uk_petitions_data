            "background": "I believe that taxing people purely because they drive a car is nothing short of disgusting. There is more often than not no public transport system in place as an alternative. This shows to me that the government is merely using fuel duty as a tax for the sake of raising money and do not realise that it is a neccessary part of peoples lives to be able to to move freely as and when they wish.",
