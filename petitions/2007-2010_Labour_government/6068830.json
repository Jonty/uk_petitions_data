            "background": "As a non-smoker, i do'nt like being around lots of smoke, but i earn my living in pubs,.. being a musician. Pub culture is a way of life, people do'nt want to use them so much, and the atmosphere is dying now this ban has come into force. Yet another piece of our history/way of life is being taken from us. Soon there will be no communication between people as we head for total communism. Anarchy will increase through resentment/suppression. Live and let live,...\"if you do'nt want to go in a pub that has no extractor/non smoking area,...do'nt F ing well go there\"!. As before, everything was alright, but this government has to dicatate to the point of intrusion on what little happiness/communication there is left. Insanity, and unfairness, prevails, and all these do-gooder/busybody/nimby interfering types,that do'nt like smoke, should go to a place where their own kind hang out. Soon no one will be allowed to leave their home, because they are contributing to the green house effect by breathing out air into the atmosphere, thereby damaging the planet. So do'nt enjoy yourself anymore people, you must be a boring b'stard and live longer, so that you can contribute more tax.",
