It seems ridiculous to demand a yearly television licence payment which allegedly goes to the BBC, when one can watch many many other channels on freeview and Sky etc. All commercial television stations support themselves with advertising - I have no objection to the BBC also obtaining revenue from similar advertising. It's just another tax that we don't want or need.",
