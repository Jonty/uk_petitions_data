The new Infrastructure Planning Commission set up by the UK Government is \"a body blow for democracy in Wales\"\n\nThe new commission will be able to completely bypass the local planning process and locate developments where it sees fit. Despite the fact that half the projects currently under consideration are located in Wales, there is no Welsh representation on the commission and the Assembly has no say in its decisions.",
