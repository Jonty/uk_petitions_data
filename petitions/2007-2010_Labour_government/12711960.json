You like certains styles or you don't.\n\nToo many people are abusing the rights of others to choose what they listen to and when by blasting music at a volume that projects it well beyond their own territory and into the lives of other unwilling participants..\n\nI stongly feel this should stop,and I suspect a great many other people would agree with me on that point..  Especially within the home..\n\nI feel those who have abused their right to listen to what they want to have gone so far now that the only way to curb their intrusions upon other peoples lives is a complete ban on the playing of music to a volume that it is audible beyond the extent of the players premises..\n\nAnybody who is agreement with me on this please take the time to register your name to the petition..",
