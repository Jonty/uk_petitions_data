I think, in order to show a clearer picture of public opinion, that a FOR and AGAINST option be made to give a better indication of opinion vers volume of the public who read them. In addition to this, a counter to show the number of times they have been viewed. This will form a good picture of the total number of those who read the items, those who are in favor of them, and those who are particularly against the idea. Where as a petition may have few FOR votes, it may bring a tremendous volume of AGAINST votes enabling more to be learned from public opinion on the whole range of issues formed in the total.",
