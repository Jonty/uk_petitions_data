            "background": "It has been stated by ACPO that innocent people have nothing to fear from their DNA being retained even after acquittal.  Since police officers must necessarily visit the scenes of crimes, it is reasonable that their DNA be added to the national DNA database and retained for 12 years after leaving the force (or indefinitely in the case of dismissal or resignation while under investigation for misconduct).\n\nAny police officer not enrolled on the DNA database should be prevented from taking a DNA sample from a suspect, or accessing the database in the course of an investigation.  This would be a reasonable safeguard against the use of a system by a police officer who clearly has no confidence in it.",
