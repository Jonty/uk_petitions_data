            "background": "There was once a time when you wouldn't dare to answer your teachers back , you respected them , you were anxious until you had done your homework and you didn't think it was cool to run away from school . However, now it is considerred cool ! \n In addition,children have been given equal rights to adults in school yet parents are responsible for their children whilst they are at school who can do whatever they want ? MMM Doesn't hang together does it ? The teachers don't have the powers over children at school and the parents don't have the control because they aren't there ! My child doesn't want to go to school so I have to go to jail ?  Who created this law ? \n Teachers are blamed for students poor performance yet they don't have real authority over them ...responsibility without control is surely a recipe for disaster. \nWho suffers ? Children do because they come out of school unable to read or write and incapable of showing respect or regard to people in possitions of power or authority.These are people who deserve our support .",
