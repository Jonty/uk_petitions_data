            "background": "This is a petition to limit cars to 70 MPH; Why are cars made capable to do high speeds reaching 120MPH etc when our laws clearly state 70MPH is the Maximum possible throughout the country?\n\nLorries and other vehicles are limited and forced to obey limits... Long gone are the days where nothing could be done...Technology makes limiting cars possible. A nut and bolt is all it takes. A minimum cost saving countless lives, freeing up our hospitals from constant RTA's and a mass reduction in motorway Road Rage, tailgating and \"Motorway Bullying\". People are afraid to use our motorways. Cars are constantly dangerously driving on our motorways being continuous hazards and nothing is being done! In 2008 49% of Cars exceeded the 70MPH speed limit-15% travelling above 80MPH! This is unacceptable! Our government must take account of this and something must be done! It is a simple matter simply resolved! \n\nCar insurance costs would decrease, \"boy racers\" and speeders would decline (if not disappear!), new statutory offences could be created making offences for attempting to remove limiters or driving without a limiter etc.\n\nPlease sign and make a difference- Make our roads safer!\n\nThank You",
