            "background": "THE campaign to end \"ludicrous\" lane alterations at a motorway junction.\nDrivers fed up with increasing congestion are calling on the Highways Agency to scrap changes recently made to the M25 at junction 19.\nMany contend that these changes have turned several roads in Watford into fume-filled carparks as motorists attempt to avoid junction 19.\nThe controversial scheme introduced in February, saw the Highways Agency reduce the entry slip road at Hunton Bridge.\nIt now wants to make the reduction permanent.\n\nHowever, local politicians say this improvement has been at the expense of congestion on local roads.\nCouncillors from Watford Borough Council, Hertfordshire County Council and Three Rivers District Council have demanded the trial end.",
