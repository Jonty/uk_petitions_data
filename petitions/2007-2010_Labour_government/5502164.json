        "background": "Gordon Brown's plans for reform of the British parliament, with many of the powers of royal perogative being given to Parliament, and a possibel codified constitution and bill of rights will destroy the British system. British Parliamentry politics has naturally evolved over centuries into an organic political system, which adapts to changing social conditions without any major constitutional upheavels, Brown's plans will change all of this, weakening the very institutions which govern us, and reducing the power of the PM. No unelected PM should be able to contemplate such drastic and disastrous reforms. Brown has no mandate for such plans!!!!",
