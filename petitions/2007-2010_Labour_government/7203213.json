            "background": "Congratulations on announcing another 400 000 by 2020, but further to other petitions calling for apprenticeship reviews (http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/post16education/), the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to appoint either a Secretary of State or single govt agency responsible for contractualising on and off - the - job training. Many initiatives are announced, but not implemented, some initiatives are commenced, like YTS, but abandoned, qualifications and regulatory bodies change so often it's hard to keep up. All of this leaves the young, already finanically and professionally vulnerable through lack of practical experience, spiralling in a debt cycle. The clearing house, announced by the DFES in 2004 is one positive step, for school - leavers, but in the NW trainers are encountering every day problems with suitable supervision and allocation to placement. Similarly, other professional highlight concerns about the relevance of what is taught on courses, to job skils. Can this be improved ? How ? What does the rest of the nation think ? Any ideas ?",
