            "background": "The requirements for EMA do not allow for a sudden change in circumstance, for example: redundancy; which could bring the household income below the cut off point for EMA.\n\nThis is due to the fact that the government work it out according to how much your household income was in the previous tax year. So for this academic year, they would look at the household income earned in tax year 2007/2008. However, a sudden change in circumstance may make the situation appear, that for the coming/just gone tax year, 2008/2009, the household income is above the limit for EMA - when really the situation would be, that the redundancy (for example), has placed the income below the limit.\n\nThe person(s) that should be entitled to EMA would have to wait for the next tax year, 2009/2010, to even just apply, and by then it is often too late as the person(s) may be too old to apply, and therefore missing out in a time of need.\n\nSurely the government should give EMA to those when circumstances change, if they can prove that they have?",
