If the ice caps melt and fresh water is released, then the water will not sink and cool, and the sea convayor belt will cease to function, meaning that the gulf stream will no longer function, meaning that Britian will be thrown into an ice age. Unless you like your drinks extreamly cold, i urge you to presure the goverment into sorting this problem out NOW!!",
