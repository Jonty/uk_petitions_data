            "background": "The current proposals are highly likely to result in many experienced family solicitors and barristers ceasing to undertake this type of delicate and difficult legal work as it will no longer be financially viable.Not only will families in crisis then find it difficult to obtain representation, but the courts will be faced with a massive increase in unrepresented litigants. We are NOT greedy lawyers - noone undertaking family legal aid work does it for the money - but rates of remuneration must at least remain at current levels.Of even greater concern is the fact that there will be a dearth of younger members of the profession undertaking family work. This will impact on the family justice system for many years to come, but most importantly many many children will inevitably suffer as a result. Finally by way of example a practitioner undertaking a lengthy and complex finding of fact hearing of some 22 days court time would receive a fixed fee of \u00a3154 under the new scheme. At less than \u00a310 per day one does not need to be a mathematician to see that is less than the minimum wage!",
