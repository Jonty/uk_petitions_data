            "background": "Research has shown that many people spend their tax free cash on foreign holidays or new cars, when in fact they should save their money for their future.  Many people who retire will have TFC over the \u00a37,200 annual savings limit, yet these people should be encouraged to save.\n\nPermitting the Tax Free Cash payments from pensions to be rolled into ISA contracts as an additional benefit - i.e. without affecting the annual limits for saving, would encourage people to save their lump sum payment for a rainy day.",
