            "background": "We would like to urge the Government to put pressure on the Chinese authorities to stop the appalling cruelty which takes place each and every day in Chinese Zoos, in particular, the feeding of live animals to tigers etc, which is done in the name of entertainment, is barbaric in the extreme and shows complete contempt for animal welfare.  There is no place for this behaviour in the 21st Century and this has to be stopped.  The trading of cat and dog fur was banned by the EU as a direct result of people putting pressure on the relevant authorities, so likewise we should do the same. Zoos are a place to educate the public on the animal kingdom, not exploit, and cause them untold suffering.",
