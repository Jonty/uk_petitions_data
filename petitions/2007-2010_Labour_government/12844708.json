            "background": "In a recent Scottish court ruling the \"famine song\" was ruled to be racist and the singing of the chorus which asks why Irish people do not feel the need to return home since the famine which brought them here is over is illegal due to the fact that the rest of the words would be known by those hearing it. I believe that, inspite of the judge's comment that the national anthem of God Save the Queen is not racist, this ruling makes the singing of God save the Queen an illegal act in Scotland due to the verse,\n\nLord grant that Marshal Wade \nMay by thy mighty aid \nVictory bring. \nMay he sedition hush, \nAnd like a torrent rush, \nRebellious Scots to crush. \nGod save the Queen! \n\nCalling on the genocide of a nation of people is far more offensive than asking people of a nation to return home.",
