        "background": "We work far too long hours as a nation, and now have to work until we are around 70-75 years old to pay off mortgages, university fees etc. We should balance that out a little by having more annual holiday entitlement to at least enjoy part of our lives while we can. By the time we retire we will have no money or inclination to do anything at 75 years of age!",
