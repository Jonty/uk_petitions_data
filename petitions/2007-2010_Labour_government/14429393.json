But we need help to prevent so-called \u201cinvestors\u201d from bleeding our clubs dry. \n\nWhat the Glazer family are doing to Manchester United represents merely the latest stage in the implosion of English football as we know it. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just fans that are affected. The slow demise of Manchester United and other clubs could mean: \n\n- Fewer tourists visiting those clubs\u2019 home towns, following the sale of top players and other assets\n\n- Local businesses losing out \n\n- Damage to England\u2019s World Cup bid: who will back a country where the FA does not stand up against the pillaging of its own football clubs\n\n- Young people losing the desire to play football\n\nIt isn't just a problem for Manchester United fans. It\u2019s the problem of our footballing nation. In the Premier League alone, Liverpool and Portsmouth are experiencing similar difficulties and many more will follow if the authorities do not act to prevent it. Football clubs are both community and national assets. The FA, parliament and the government should recognise this and act before it\u2019s too late.",
