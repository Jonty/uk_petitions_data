        "background": "The science behind global warming, climate change, CO2 and oil is not fixed and there is no consensus. The IPCC, on whom governments rely, has issued incorrect information, and claims by some environmentalists are wrongly made. Thus, government laws and policies based on this are invalid and void, and should cease, as should \ntaxation based on incorrect science. Government departments linked to unproven science must be closed, including 'Act on CO2', which only state a one-sided argument. Schools should no longer be indoctrinated with this. The British government must cease EU and global environmental involvement predicated on the supposed factuality of the scientific claims made by a few, and which are currently under severe scrutiny. Funding based on these much debated issues must be stopped if it is not also given to those of opposing scientific views. Taxation and laws based on invalid or challenged science should not be made. These are all connected points.",
