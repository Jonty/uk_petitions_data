This is law you have to do jury service.\n\nIt is time they did the same for reveiwing their expense claims at local and central goverment. \n\nunemployed people seeking work should be made to do jury expense claims in their local area. this would mean that they sit in an office for 5 days and all claims for expenses are reveiwed and as a result the 10/12 people will decide if the expense claim should be passed for payment. \n\nThe persons on the expense jury will be paid at the same rate as traditional jury service \n\nIt's our money, lets decide where politicains should spend it.",
