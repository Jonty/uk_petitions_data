        "background": "Around the world many women are persecuted merely for exercising rights that should be freely available to all. This is not a problem exclusive to any one society, but an attitude all too common in many. We believe that Britain has a moral responsibility to curb this kind of violence both at home and abroad. The ideal at the heart of this petition is that women should enjoy all of the same rights as men. We believe that the majority of the British people feel the same way, and would like to see this ideal reflected in both the laws and behaviour of Britain. Such action could include forbidding immigration to anyone refusing to sign a declaration that women have the same rights as men, ensuring that anyone convicted of an \"honour killing\" receives the maximum possible sentence, and putting pressure on any nation where the government supports, or turns a blind eye, to this kind of violence. Education should also play a role in this process.",
