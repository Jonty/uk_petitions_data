            "background": "At present there are only two units in the country that provide care for people with Intestinal Failure one at St Mark's Hospital\nNorthwick Park\nWatford Road\nHarrow\nMiddlesex \n\nthe other \n\nSalford Royal NHS FoundationTrust\nStott Lane\nSalford\nManchester \nat present my partner had been waiting for nearly 4 months as an inpatient at Rochdale Infirmary for treatment from the unit in Manchester but there are also 16 patients waiting admission. I think this situation is totally unaceptable and think something needs to be done about it to provide more facilities to enable people to get the treatment that they so desperately need. \n\nFor more information please see this Facebook Group Get Jason Mulligan to Hope Hospital.\n\nPlease consider helping me on this matter.\n\nThank you",
