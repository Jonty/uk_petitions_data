Armed forces are expected to be on call 24 hours per day and have their families follow or be alone at the drop of a hat.  \nIsn't it about time they were respected and given a salary that reflects their work and difficulties forced onto them and their families??\nI have also noticed that no pay increase has been announced this year.",
