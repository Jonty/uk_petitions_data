        "background": "Being ex armed forces and married to serving member.  I had noticed that they get poor pay and no more than a 1.5% payrise and if more is split over the year.  Armed forces are expected to be on call 24 hours per day and have their families follow or be alone at the drop of a hat.  \nIsn't it about time they were respected and given a salary that reflects their work and difficulties forced onto them and their families??\nI have also noticed that no pay increase has been announced this year.",
