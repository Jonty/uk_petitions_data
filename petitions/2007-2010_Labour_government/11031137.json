            "background": "In this current economic climate and in view of the way Banks have made deplorable financial decisions that have affected millions of customers, moreover that Executive Bank officials have taken hundreds of thousands in personal pay offs, it seems right and just that the Prime Minister should step in and insist the Banks repay all the minor \u00a325 and \u00a335 charges made on customers accounts. These are the unfair amounts that make the difference to Mr and Mrs Average staying afloat or going under. It would be good PR for the Prime Minister to act as a current Robin Hood and turn the flow of money going into the pockets of these Executives, back into the pockets of the customers who had so much faith and have been basically robbed and living on the bread line.",
