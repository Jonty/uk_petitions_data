            "background": "There is 1 orthodontic practice for the whole of the Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre which means children are having to wait 5 years for treatment. My own daughter is being bullied and is suffering from pain due to crooked and mishapen teeth. She had perfect milk teeth and looks after her teeth well. It is through no fault of her own that her adult teeth have grown in wrong. She is suffering name calling and doesnt like to eat in front of others due to her teeth. Yet the wait for treatment is 5 years!!\nBring more orthodontists into the areas where needed, provide more NHS money to fund them and let the dentists perfom more orthondicts that are needed and not as many better paying private treatments.",
