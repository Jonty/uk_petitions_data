The government will increase the tax to \u00a3455 in April 2010 for gas-guzzling cars, the higher the emissions the higher the tax.\nThe scheme would leave a total of 9.4 million motorists significantly worse off and another 8.4 million no better off, with only 4.1 million benefiting.\nFive of the top 30 cars, the UK's most popular cars, will have to pay more.\n\nIt would have severe damaging effects on the second hand car market, including unemployment.\n\nIt would increase unlicensed vehicles on the road.",
