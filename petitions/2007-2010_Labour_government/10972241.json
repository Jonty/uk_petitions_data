I suggest the following pieces added as an area of study/debate:\n\n1> 1984 - Author: George Orwell\n2> Animal Farm - Author: George Orwell\n\nIt must be made absolutely clear the dangers of an authoritarian government.  \nI am sure as our government clearly agree with the dangers of such a government - an internal terrorism, as warned by US President Eisenhower, General MacArthur et al.  As such I am sure they will back this 100% without feign or delay.",
