It is not organised. Local people, veterans, service personnel stationed locally, leather-clad bikers and bereaved families just turn up, line the street and bear witness.\n\nAs always, silence descended on the town just before 3pm as the church bell began to toll and the hearses reached the main street.\nis it not possible for the town to be awarded an Elizabeth Medal in recognition  of there unstinting support to the fallen heroes and their loved ones.",
