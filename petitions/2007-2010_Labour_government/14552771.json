        "background": "It isn't right that a working father does not have to pay any child maintenance for his own child because he has step children living with him who he has to financially support.Every child deserves to be supported by both their parents regardless of where their child lives.Every absent father should support their own child first before supporting any stepchildren they have living with them.Do you think it is right for the CSA to calculate maintenance as nil where there are two incomes coming into a household?Why should my child get nothing because her father has married someone who has children?",
