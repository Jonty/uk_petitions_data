        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there are elected bodies responsible for a wide range of domestic issues such as health, education and transport to which the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish people are able to vote for their representatives to speak for them in the parliaments or assemblies of those countries. They are also able to vote for MP's to serve them in the UK's parliament in Westminster where they can have an often decisive influence upon England's domestic affairs which are of no concern to the people who elected them. It is my belief that this is incredibly undemocratic and an embarrassment to a parliament which prides itself on being a beacon of democracy.",
