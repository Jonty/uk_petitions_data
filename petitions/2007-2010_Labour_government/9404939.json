        "action": "Develop A Race Circuit At Maze Prison - Northern Ireland",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The maze prison is now an historic ruin, and debate over how it should be redeveloped is arising. There are talks mainly of a GAA stadium which would be a good idea, however, there already are numerous GAA stadiums throughout the country.\n\nWhich Northern Ireland does nto need is another football/gaa stadium, so I propose a racing circuit be developed. \n\nA well developed racing circuit may attract sporting events such as Formula 1, can be used for local sporting events such as motorbike racing and car racing.\n\nAswell as that it could be used to try and encourage young people from racing on our roads and give them a location to go and race around safely, and not put innocent lives at risk.\n\nSo if you like the idea of a racing stadium, then vote on this petition!!",
