            "background": "There is a massive gap in the confectionery market to capitalise on the credit crunch. \n\nThere is a massive gap in public finances because of the credit crunch.\n\nTherefore, the nation should step up and bridge the gap in the chocolate market and consequencely reduce our national debt.\n\nBy adding a new 'crunch' to a popular favourite, the 'chocolate coin', we could raise enough funds to quash our debt, reduce taxes and see a massive increase in exports. \n\nThe Prime Minister would also raise the morale of the nation, as consumption of chocolate triggers the release of endorphins, the body's endogenous opiates, making us more relaxed and happy as a people.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure and beginning production, I must profess to not being an expert. However, I do submit this as an excellent idea - one that certainly shouldn't be dismissed without full consideration of Parliament.",
