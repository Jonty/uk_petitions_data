The Trade Union movement has a long history of loyalty to the Labour Party which has been disregarded in the last 20 years. I ask that the PM re-affirm the party's ties to the TUC and support workers struggling to attain a decent living wage especially in Industries which, whilst claiming they have no money for pay rises for workers, award their CEO's millions in 'Bonus' payments! ie Royal Mail to cite but one organisation",
