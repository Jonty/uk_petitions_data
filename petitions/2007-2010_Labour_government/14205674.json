        "background": "Munir and his family became victims when masked men entered their home and threatened to kill them. Giving evidence, his wife, Shaheen Begum, said, \u201cThey were hitting my husband. When I asked them to stop or looked up they started hitting him again. They told us to lie face down and not speak, or they would kill us. It was very terrifying\u201d. She also told the court that she feared they had killed her youngest son.\n\nWe also believe the claim of Salem, to be suffering brain damage to be questionable given that he is currently waiting to be charged for fraud.\n\nWe believe that Munir and Tokeer have been wrongfully imprisoned and that their case must be reviewed, and appeal to you as our Prime Minister to offer your support to correct the injustice that has taken place.",
