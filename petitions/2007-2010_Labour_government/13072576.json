            "background": "Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) or Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)has been proved time and again as a primary skin irritant which hasbeen known to penetrate into the eyes as well as brain, heart,liver etc, and also been known to show long-term retention inthe tissues. Studies indicated that when penetrating achildren's eyes this could prevent them from developingproperly and caused cataracts to develop in adults; may alsocause hair loss by attacking the follicle. Another extremelyserious problem is the connection of SLS or SDS with nitratecontamination - Nitrates are a potential cancer-causingcarcinogenic. The list is endless and they are found in manyindustrial products including floor cleaners, car wash soaps,toothpastes, shampoos and some dissolvable aspirin, fibertherapy caplets, bubble baths and many more products. Due tothe harmful hidden dangers to children and adults the above useof the products should be banned completely. They are only usedas a cheap alternative rather than using a product that isn'tharmful to humans.",
