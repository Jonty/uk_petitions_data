            "background": "It is clear that London and it\u2019s current fleet of problematic bendy-busses are simply not suited for the busy, small and narrow streets of London. They are too big and too dangerous and are not designed to meet the needs of the average commuter travelling in and around London. We must come up with a new design for a bus that has a bigger and better capacity then the old rout master, is more environmentally friendly and that is safer to use and creates less noise pollution then that of the old one which served London so well for so many years.",
