            "background": "Please increase the payment for funeral costs for people who cannot afford them. For example, at the moment the social fund gives \u00a31400 to the applicant but he or she then has to find an additional \u00a31400 or more to cover the whole cost. If one does not have the savings or the money to live on how can one afford this. It is bad enough when one loses a loved one, but it is even worse when one does not the closure of the burial the loved one. So much money is wasted this in country that could be put to a better cause, like the funeral social fund.",
