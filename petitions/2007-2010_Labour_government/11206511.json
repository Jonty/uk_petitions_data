            "background": "Mr Michael Martin, the Speaker of the House of Commons has consistently proved that he is incapable of adequately carrying out the duties of his office. The latest episode, involving the unwarranted and unprecedented ransacking by the police, of the offices of an MP, has showed not only his glaring inability to handle the situation; but his complete cowardice in attempting to lay the blame on his more junior staff. He should resign without compensation immediately, and we urge you to use your influence to bring this about.",
