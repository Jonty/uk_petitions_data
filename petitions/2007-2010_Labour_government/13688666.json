            "background": "A year ago Ross Brawn took over the failing Honda formula 1 racing team, and in 1 season has won both the constructors championship, and their driver Jenson Button has won the drivers world championship.  This is British determination, and British engineering at its very best.  The driver may well get BBC sports personality of the year or a similar award, but it is the team manager who really deserves the credit.",
