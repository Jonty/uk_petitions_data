            "background": "I am calling for people to sign this petition as energy prices are getting out of control and the Government have the power to change this and make energy more affordable for us but dont and millions of people are struggling with bills of outrageous amounts of money, If the Government is unable to lower energy prices I feel that during winter periods the Government should subsidise our energy costs similar to the way that elderly people get winter payments. The Government should stretch this out to anybody who is on a low income and not just the elderly as there are alot of kids that have to suffer throughout the winter as some parents cant afford the outrageous energy bills.",
