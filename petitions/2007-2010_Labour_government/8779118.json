            "background": "Figures from the Assembly library show that the total cash collected on both Severn Bridges from 1996-2006 was a whopping \u00a3684m. The Second Severn Crossing cost just \u00a3300m to build when it was completed in 1996. Under the Severn Bridges Act, when the tolls reach \u00a31bn in 1989 prices, the bridge reverts to public ownership.\n\nNotwithstanding, the government could then decide to scrap the tolls and put the Welsh economy on an equal footing with its neighbours in and around Bristol. So far, they have failed to abolish this divisive and disruptive toll. The government needs to support economic and social cohesion in Wales.",
