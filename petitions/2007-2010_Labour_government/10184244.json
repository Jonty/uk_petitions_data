            "background": "The East Surrey Branch of the Society has been given the devastating news that Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Trust has withdrawn funding which has been used to provide a day centre especially for those people with dementia.  Other day centres locally run by Health have also been given notice to close.  The East Surrey Branch of the Alzheimer's Society provides specialist day care for people with dementia, giving their carer a day to either go out to do shopping etc or to stay at home and just be able to relax without worrying about their loved one.  With the raising of awareness of Dementia, the Dementia Strategy and the Carers Strategy just being published we are now in the position of being able to offer less rather than more services and help to those carers and people with dementia who need us now and in the future.",
