            "background": "Parking meters have recently been added to the car park on Priory Wharf Birkenhead. For anglers both shore and charter boat we now have to pay \u00a33.60 to leave our vehicles unattended whilst we participate in our favourite pastime. \nMembers of the public who drive to this relatively quiet part of the Wirral to walk this stretch of waterfront now also have to pay this penalty to partake in what ultimately should be a free pastime.\nThis is a blatant revenue generating exercise by Wirral Borough Council and is an infringement on our basic rights and pockets.\nThese car parks are monitored only by wardens ensuring tickets are purchased and does not guaranty the safety of your vehicle, which previously has always been left at great risk to the vehicle owner.\n Money collected from us will not be used to maintain or secure these parking spaces and will be directed into avenues not relevant to the people using this facility.\nI suggest these meters are removed as soon as possible and return to the days when we left our vehicles at our own risk and of no cost to the already overtaxed motor vehicle using public.\n\nKind regards\n\nPeter Harrison",
