I am a born and bred English citizen, and am so ashamed to be, I have made the decision to move away in two weeks, because I for one cannot stay in a country where the government is such a joke. You say you support Israel Mr Brown? Doesn't sound like it. Stop the cowardice Mr Brown and stop the lies, say outwardly what you believe, so we can make a fair judgment on whether or not we want you as our Prime Minister, it\u2019s called Democracy, it is called civilisation.",
