            "background": "Chris Hoy became one of the most successful Olympians at Beijing this year winning 3 gold medals in cycling, the first UK athlete to win 3 golds at a single Olympics in over 100 years. He is a true ambassador for cycling, the Olympics and to Scotland. In a world where sport is bombarded with money from abroad, drugs cheats and so on, Chris Hoy personifies the true spirit of dedicating oneself totally to his sport. He should be properly rewarded with a knighthood in the New Year Honours List.",
