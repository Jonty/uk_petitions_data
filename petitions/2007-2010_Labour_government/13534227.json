Since then, RNIB has decided to close the office in Carlisle, Cumbria and suggests that all Cumbrian service users may access this service in Preston.  For those with visual impairment of differing degrees, Action for Blind People in Cumbria provides information, training and in -depth knowledge and solutions to suit every situation. Amongst many other things, this includes training to keep people in work, help with finding work, advice with housing and guidance for benefits for those who find sight loss is dramatically threatening their livelihoods. There are no alternatives in Cumbria for the services that Action for Blind People provide here.\nIt is not feasible to travel to Preston when taking into account the geographical peculiarities of Cumbria and the difficulties of traveling in unfamiliar territory with a visual impairment. Please help to keep this service in Cumbria.",
