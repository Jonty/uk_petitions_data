            "background": "We want the Law to protect the people from violent criminals rather than leave them victimised, helpless and scared in the knowledge that they will be back on the streets within the week on a suspended sentence.\n\nViolent crime is rife on the streets of most (if not all) cities and towns and needs to be ammended. The penalty needs to out-weigh the benefits of the crime and needs to provide the victims with a sense of justice and deter offenders.\n\nIt's a clear waste of tax payers money to pay for a police service that is unable to protect the people due to the Law 'freeing' the criminals.\n\nPlease ammend the Laws to protect the people!",
