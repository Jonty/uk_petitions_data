This example you gave does not intend to review the above in any way and despite my requests no one at No.10 has responded. The petition I requested is a separate issue to the petition you gave in the link. My petition is about regulators and systems of government. The petition you gave in the link refers to the management of Mid Staffordshire NHS FT.",
