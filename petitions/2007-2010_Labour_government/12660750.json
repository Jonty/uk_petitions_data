            "background": "In February 2009 the government issued a document entitled 'Next Steps for Early Learning and Childcare.' This is signed by 3 government ministers.\nThe aspirations outlined in the document are commendable; 'all childcare practitioners to be qualified to a minimum of level 3 by 2015 and an annual training entitlement for all practitioners up to graduate level.'\nThe industry will not be able to meet these targets without substantial and sustained extra funding for training.\nWe estimate the shortfall in funding for childcare training 2009/2010 to be in excess of 15,000 places.\nWe need Childcare to be recognised as a special case if we are to continue to raise standards within the industry and if we are to provide quality childcare  for every child in Britain.\nIf 'Every Child Matters' we need to prove it by raising the funding to a level that is sufficient for the needs of the sector.",
