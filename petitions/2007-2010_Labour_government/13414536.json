        "background": "My girlfriend and unbelievably about 10 people i know have lost their passport which was sent to the Home Office to renew their visas. A simple apology is NOT enough as this greatly inconvenience us stuck not able to travel, business obligations, studies and to attend to family matters. We are setting up a group on facebook to gather comments, and more signatures about this and how this deeply inconvenience people. As said before honestly a simple apology is not enough considering that we still have to pay to get the passports renew, legal costs again, loss of air tickets if i had one already to travel and all sorts of inconveniences you may think of . Please support this petition to influence the PM or the government to do something about this. Considering how much we pay to renew passports - \u00a3300 and \u00a3500 plus post and other costs - put yourself in our shoes. Foreigners contribute a great deal to this country and we see we have to be treated fairly and supportive. Thanks. Support this petition please. Sign Up. Thanks",
