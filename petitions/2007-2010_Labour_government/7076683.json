            "background": "Teacher's working in state schools currently put in a very large number of hours outside of school to maintain a school within the government guidelines for school's achievement, even more to achieve a good or outstanding review. These long hours worked by teacher's, especially during the first 5-7 years of teaching are well above the European Legislation and Union guidelines as to how many hours should be worked by a teacher throughout the year. This is however ignored by both schools and government who both expect teachers to do this, as demonstrated by the level of funding schools are given for staffing and the standards expected to be delivered by these staff. Is the PM really happy with the threat of closing failing schools whilst being content with the illegality of the better performing ones?",
