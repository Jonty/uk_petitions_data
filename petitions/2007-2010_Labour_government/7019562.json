            "background": "Iranian born Mrs Narges Fazeli (39)and her daughter Elaheh (16) live in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Elaheh is studying at Wakefield College and wishes to join the Police Service. Mrs Fazeli's husband has been granted asylum and cannot return to Iran. Mrs Fazeli converted to Christianity a number of years ago. She has been a member of the Wakefield Baptist Church for five years. She has already been imprisoned, raped and tortured in Iran and fears that she and her daughter will be further persecuted if the Home Office, separate her from her husband and enforce her deportation. The Home Office is clearly in breach of the Fazeli family's Human Rights and to expect her to return to the dangers of persecution is a flagrant abuse of their fundamental rights and freedom.",
