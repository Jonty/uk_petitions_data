            "background": "Whilst on a tram, Stephen Gordon became annoyed that he couldn't pass and punched 96 year old Shah Chaudury in the face in an unprovoked attack, blinding him in one eye. He was only given a three year supervision order, which is quite frankly an absolute disgrace. The judge felt that the public would be better protected from this monster by treating him, but surely we'd be safer if he was locked up? And what about Shah Chaudury? He'll probably never leave his house again. Let's put this right - send Stephen Gordon to jail where he belongs.",
