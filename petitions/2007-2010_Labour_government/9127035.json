            "background": "Cigarettes are bought mostly from high street supermarket stores. If people go to the pub to relax and there are no cigarettes to buy there, then this is a disincentive to smoke. The inelastic demand for cigarettes will become more elastic because as they are not as  readily available. The option of having to drive and find cigarettes after having reached a pub is a high disincentive to smoking. \nNot only will this reduce the use of electricity use f the machines but reduce the amount of people smoking and buying cigarettes/ buying underage as well. Also with less smokers comes less expense on the NHS.",
