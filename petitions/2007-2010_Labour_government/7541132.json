            "background": "The Military Covenant says. Our Armed Forces will be called upon to make personal sacrifices, including the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the Nation. In putting the needs of the nation and Armed Forces, before their own, they forgo some of the rights enjoyed by those outside the Armed Forces. In return, servicemen and women must always be able to expect fair treatment, to be valued and respected as individuals, and that they (and their families) will be sustained and rewarded by commensurate terms and conditions of service. In the same way, the unique nature of military operations means that our Armed Forces differs from all other institutions, and must be sustained and provided for accordingly by the nation. This mutual obligation forms the Military Covenant between the nation, our Armed Forces and each individual member; an unbreakable common bond of identity, loyalty and responsibility which has sustained the armed forces and its servicemen and women throughout its history\u2026\n\nThis Bill would apply to past members of our Armed Forces, reservists, auxiliaries, and foreign nationals including the Gurkhas.",
