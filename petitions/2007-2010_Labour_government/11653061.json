        "background": "Together Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean have revolutionised their sport of Ice skating/Ice dance, and are still doing so almost 30 years later.\n\nThey won every possible competition and everything they entered; who can forget the remarkable moment on 14th Feb 1984 when they won an Olympic Gold medal for their performance of Ravels \u2018Bolero' . It is a moment of sporting history, as was their dramatic return in 1994 seeing them represent our country once again and gaining a Bronze medal for 'Face The Music'\n\nIn this year, 2009, the 25th anniversary of Bolero, it seems fitting that they are given the greatest honour possible by this country and are knighted.\n\nAs well as relentless charity work Torvill and Dean are the golden couple of the United Kingdom, they stole not only the nation\u2019s heart but the world\u2019s and it is only right we give them this sign of gratitude.",
