        "background": "With the ever-increasing terrorist threat to our country, direct action groups such as Plane Stupid endager the lives of the flying public and aviation workers by disrupting our airports and attempting to access restricted areas.  As well as creating delays, it puts a strain on airport police patrols, thus leaving them unable to respond should a real terrorist attempt to strike at a UK airport.  As a law forbids protest within one mile of Parliament, we who work at airports would like a similar law introduced to forbid anyone trying to disrupt the operations of a UK airport.",
