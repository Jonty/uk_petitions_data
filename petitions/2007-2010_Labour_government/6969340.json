            "background": "Crest Nicholson, a national builder is in the final stages of a development in Woodmancote, near Cheltenham. Sadly there has been tensions between some local residents, Crest Nicholson, their architects and Tewkesbury Council. \n\nThere is a group trying to block this path being opened due to it being \u201ca perceived eyesore\u201d and having some safety concerns. The development has been built sympathetically using Cotswold stone. \n\nThere is an issue on the site around parking and access at times although this should not stop this path being opened. Planning permission was granted and the safety of this crossing has been passed by the relevant safety bodies. \n\nThis path removes the need to use a dirt path leading to Butts Lane or walking along the main road (which has high traffic levels and is a major source of concern for most locals due to the speed of traffic). The path is to the playing fields and the Village hall (where pre-school, Probus, ballet and many clubs meet). This path allows for a safer and shorter passage and will reduce the chances of an accident.(or we could drive this journey)\n\nWe need an urgent saftey review into the danger of keeping this closed",
