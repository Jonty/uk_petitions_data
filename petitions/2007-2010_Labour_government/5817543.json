            "background": "Since this is democracy and people should get what they need out of the money they pay, it should be made so that everybody in the country is entitled to a home automatically as long as that they are born in Britain.\n\nIt would be free of charge for the individual to move in when they want to once they're 18 or over, but they must start paying back the cost of the flat to the government in the same way as a mortgage by the time they are 25.\n\nThe cost to build a bog standard block of flats is not a lot, and the government could do this on a non-profit basis. This idea would eventually almost eliminate the number of people renting and therefore stop rich people from wanting to own several properties, which would free up the housing market so that more houses are available.\n\nThat individual can then move out to buy a house if he wants to once he has paid for his/her flat, or he/she could sell what he/she owns of flat back to the government for the ammount paid.",
