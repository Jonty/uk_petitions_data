            "background": "The UK makes exemptions to slaughter laws on the grounds of religion.\nWhile the UK will support freedom of belief and freedom to follow religious doctrines, we oppose the use of religiously slaughtered meat sold as that that is conventionally slaughtered.\nThe RSPCA, DEFRA and FAWC have made recommendations that exemptions to UK slaughter laws be repelled on the grounds that religious slaughter does increase suffering.\nWe believe that we should have the right to choose how all meat consumed in this country is slaughtered just as we have a right to choose how our eggs are farmed so as not be a part of the cruel and barbaric methods of slaughter and to reduce the amount of animals that suffer these processes daily. An estimated 20 million animals are slaughtered each year in this country without the compassion that would be to pre-stun!!",
