        "background": "Even with improving technology each new child brought into the world increases pressure on the Earth's resources and the environment.\nBy encouraging sterilization, perhaps with a financial award of \u00a3500, the immense future environmental costs and the costs of education and healthcare attributable to the unborn child, will be eliminated.\nSterilization should be entirely the choice of the individual and steps should be taken to ensure that they are of sound mind and are not being coerced. Prior to sterilization, counselling and a cooling off period should be mandatory.",
