            "background": "Many people are going into debt for their electric and Gas when using pre-pay meters, a device that is designed to allow people on a budget to manage the amount of money they spend. Electric companies are raising prices but failing to update the meters to the new price, then billing customers (some as high as \u00a3250) for a service that they have already used, and paid for. This is underhanded and wrong, all customers who have been in this position should have their money reimbursed as it is the fault of big business not consumers. In Retail, consumers are protected from paying more than the advertised price by Trading Standards, this should be extended to all businesses and service providers.",
