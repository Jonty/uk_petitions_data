        "action": "legislate for house builders to provide more off-road parking for the occupants of apartments. When an apartment is occupied by two or more persons then the current legislation of one parking space per apartment is insufficient.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Current legislation says that only one parking bay per new build apartment is required. It is a ridiculous situation for apartments to be limited to one bay per apartment\n\nAlthough the current government is trying to reduce motor vehicle usage by measures such as limiting off-road parking, it is wholly inadequate to restrict road usage by allocating only one parking bay per apartment.\n\nThe current legislation prohibits those who might like to live in apartment, but because of work commitments have to run two or more vehicles. The current restrictions are severely limiting personal choice of where people live and their lifestyle choices.\n\nThere are not many apartment dwelling families or couples who can manage with only one car. As a large propotion of new builds are now apartments there should be a minimum requirement of two parking spaces per apartment.",
