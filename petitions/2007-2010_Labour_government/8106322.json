            "background": "Segways are currently not allowed to be used on public roads or pavements. Whilst the use of segways on roads, due to there slow speeds and lack of safety equipement would posses a hazard to other road users, on the pavement they would be less dangerous than a person using a mobility scooter, as they are smaller in surface area taken up from the pavement, and would generally be used by younger more capable drivers as they require full attention to operate, using a combination of both balance and mental focus to move in the direction you wish to go. They are also a huge success in the states. We want to allow the public to be able to use this particular form of transport, that is more efficient then a short car journey, quicker than walking, but still provides a small amount of excercise. Ideal for people who think a walk of 30mins+ is worth a car journey.",
