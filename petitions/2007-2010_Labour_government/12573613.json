            "background": "Just imagine if the beautiful churches of England were available to the whole community, and not just a religious minority. Kept primarily as sanctuaries of peaceful contemplation and reflection they could provide other services such as, art, music, theatre, and discussions on topics as diverse as science, philosophy, psychology and the meaning of life, as well as providing the usual services of weddings and funerals to all members of the community.\n\nOrganised on a strictly non-religious basis the new reformed organisation would be open to all. In the past, when most people were, supposedly, religious, the Church was synonymous with the community and as such was funded by the community.\n\nLack of belief, in the unsubstantiated dogma of Christianity, should not deprive anyone of their heritage. Rather the Church should change to reflect the modern world and evolve into a non-religious entity to be enjoyed by the entire Community of England.",
