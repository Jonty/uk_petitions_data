            "background": "This is in response to a petition which asks for smoking to be allowed in schools on the grounds that students have to go outside school to smoke; I would say that if they're young enough still to be in school they're too young to smoke anyway!  Far more importantly how would that affect their non-smoking class-mates?  As previously stated in anti-smoking petitions passive smoking KILLS and the younger the person exposed to this the more serious the consequences to what I would consider the innocent victim(s).  In my opinion the smoking ban was WELL overdue; please resist any calls to ban or weaken it!",
