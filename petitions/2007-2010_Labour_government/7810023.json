            "background": "Plymouth's Civic centre has been an eyesore in the eyes of many of Plymouth's people. The building built in 1962 has been grade 2 Listed much to the horror of most of Plymouth's people. It also needs structural repairs which would cost at least \u00a310million and more recently a part of the buildings roof fell off crashing to the ground luckily not killing or injuring anyone. The building is environmentally inefficient and dangerous in it's current condition. It has also been labelled as an eyesore and depressive to the people of Plymouth and it's employees. I therefore believe a new modern, warm and pleasant building should be made to replace this and pave a way to a new future for Plymouth's people.",
