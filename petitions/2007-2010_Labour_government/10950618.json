The creation jobs by the building of the new stadium for L.F.C. would give a much needed financial boost to one of the poorest areas in the country. By not allowing the extension of the loan to Mr.Hicks and Mr.Gillett you would force a sale which would in turn allow the club to be sold to a consortium or individual who would put the club and the local area before themselves.",
