The public want answers, and those we will get once the trial takes place. However, it's quite apparent that the general public want to re-address the balance regarding these crimes against innocent children. \nBaby P suffered more than 50 injuries despite 60 visits from the authorities. he was also seen by 28 different social workers, doctors and police officers who were involved with the boy's case before he was tortured to death. We want justice for his death.... We want the return of the death Sentence for murders of children, and life sentences for child abuse... And life meaning LIFE.. Not 10 years with good behaviour.",
