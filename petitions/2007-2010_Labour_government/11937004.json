            "background": "The Government is proposing doubling the stake and prize limits for Category C Gaming Machines to \u00a31 / \u00a370.\n\nMaking it easier to gamble more during a time of recession is wrong.  The new prize limit for fruit machines will be more than weekly benefit levels.\n\nThere is also a risk that this proposal could lead to an increase in problem gambling.  The Government had committed to protecting children and vulnerable people from being harmed or exploited by gambling.\n\nThere are other, more constructive, ways to support struggling businesses and regenerate seaside resorts.",
