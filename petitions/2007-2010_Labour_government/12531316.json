This would slightly reduce MP's wages currently, and give them a vested interest in how EVERYONE in the country is doing financially. Also, why not convert one old london tower block into flats for MP's, and scrap the second home allowance in one go. LET'S STOP THE GRAVY TRAIN AND SNOUTS IN TROUGHS!",
