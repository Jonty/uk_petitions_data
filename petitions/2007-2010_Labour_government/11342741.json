We all, governments included, have to start existing within our means and to stop borrowing excessivly from tomorrow to pay for today.\n\nPrinting extra money will simply devalue the pound yet further, penalising those with savings and those that have made sound financial planning and continue the perception of the majority of the current generation that saving is a pointless exercise.",
