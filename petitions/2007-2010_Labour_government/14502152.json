            "background": "In 1993 James Bulger a 2 year old vulnerable and helpless todder was taken away from his mother by two boys named Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. They took him 2 and half miles away from the shopping center where they abducted him and gave him grievious bodily harm. They released in 2001, after ONLY 8 years in prison. They were given new identities to protect their safety. \nNow why should these thugs have their identities protected when they committed such a terrible crime, that even James Bulgers mother was not permitted by the police to identify her sons body as it was too traumatic.\nPlease sign your name so we can stop our tax payers money from protecting these two evil boys.",
