            "background": "In the UK there are literally thousands of preserved emegency vehicles owned by private individuals and enthusiast organisations. These vehicles are taken to classic car shows, and Police organised shows and events throughout the year. Up until yesterday,when someone was prosecuted and found guilty, the vehicle owners relied on the discretion of the  Police, in turning a blind eye to a particular regulation in the Road Transport Lighting Regs which creates the offence of having a blue light fitted on any motot vehicle. There is no getout even when the light is covered up and not visible as such. This regulation was never meant to be as restrictive and it is asked that the regulation be amended so that is not an offence have such a light fitted provided it is covered up on the highway",
