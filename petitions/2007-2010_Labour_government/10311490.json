            "background": "The cycle to work scheme is supposed to be a tax incentive aimed at encouraging employees to cycle to work by providing cycling equipment more affordably.  The benefits include improving the employees' health, reducing traffic congestion and hence pollution.  However, the scheme does not benefit those who already have a bicycle as it does not include the cost of maintaining the bicycle when it is used regularly.  It becomes more cost effective for people to purchase another bike under this scheme rather than get their bicycle serviced.  As it is, this scheme, in effect, is a vehicle for increasing the sales of bicycle manufacturers rather than encouraging people to cycle to work.",
