        "background": "There are plans to build a \u00a3100 Incinerator in Leicestershire (exact site not specified at time of writing). The incinerator will burn non-recyclable waste that would otherwise go to landfill. It is stated that emissions from the plant would be well within European Union limits. However we object to this incinerator on the following grounds: Incinerators cause pollution which affect human health & the environment. Incinerators discourage local authorities from acheiving better recycling targets and to instead waste natural resources. Incinerators are very expensive to build and create few jobs in return. In this day and age we should be looking for greener methods of disposal.",
