            "background": "British Airways have declined surfers the ability to take their surfboards on any of their planes within the baggage hold. I feel this is ridiculas as all other carriers allow surfboards. Their are no safety issues involved and therefore, it is shameful that the airline that carry's our nations name, refuses to respect its citizens. They will still allow golf clubs and other sports equipment so why not surfboards? The Goverment should step in and over rule this action as it could harm intercontinetal friendships built up through the sport of surfing (not forgetting the many travellers that compete within this country from overseas).",
