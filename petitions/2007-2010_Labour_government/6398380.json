        "background": "The leap from childhood to adult on your 18th birthday can be detrimental to some people.  Far better to stagger the introduction of benefits and responsibilities of adulthood over time. Starting while still at school allowing the pupils to vote on the appointment of school governors.  From the age of 16 allow voting in local elections. Then at age 21 (18 would be too close to 16) to vote in general elections.  One step at a time. Encouraging teenagers to participate and see the rewards of that participation is more likely to produce continued participation into adulthood.",
