We will lose 38 garages and 76 car parking places if it goes ahead. There is nowhere to park safely and legally in the surrounding streets. Parking is limited and some streets have double yellow lines. This is already a built up area full of flats and cars and very little communual spaces. Please rethink how people will suffer if this goes ahead.",
