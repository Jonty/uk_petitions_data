            "background": "1. That the Government should not require that the councils find an allocation of travellers\u2019 sites since this is leading to inappropriate sites being chosen at great cost to the local communities.\n\n2. That planning proposals should be treated as normal applications and not \u201caffordable housing.\u201d Particularly for private applications this appears to lead to an abuse of process and local government.\n\n3. That the effect of devaluation on nearby housing (e.g. 0.5 mile) should be a very important planning consideration and that the council should be liable for it.\n\n4. That allowing councils to use compulsory purchase orders to buy land for travellers sites is wrong.\n\n5. That sites once created are controlled and restrictions enforced. That the council and police work with the communities to ensure that there are no no-go areas and that everybody\u2019s rights are protected.",
