            "background": "Wouldnt it be nice to walk down the street and not hear heavy metal and rap music blaring out of cars, or to go on a bus and not hear the kids at the back playing tinny sounding tunes through their phones?\n\nI propose that heavy metal, rap and similar genres be banned. They are such incredibly aggressive forms of music (not that you can call them that), I fear that it is poisoning the minds of our youths and driving them to violence. After all, heavy metal often promotes Satanism, and rap often glorifies gang culture and murder, surely this is having a damaging effect on peoples minds?\n\nMake the production, sale and purchase of these genres illegal, and give a mandatory community service order to anyone found listening to them. In turn, i would like the government to do more to promote real musicians.",
