            "background": "The current TV licence costs \u00a3135- no small sum for a student living away from home for the first time and trying to manage a very tight budget. In recent years, the cost of university to students has dramatically increased and whilst many students would support the BBC surely it is unfair to charge them full licence fee when these are the people who are trying to become the country's future teachers, doctors, academics and it does seem as if the government wants to discourage people from entering higher education. The TV licence for those in higher education whould be reduced significantly, say by half, or should be scrapped altogether.",
