            "background": "SEN Code of practice edition 2001 requires updating to todays current standards and as to how are children are educated in school.  The UN has updated Articles in education. Our SEN children are not always given fair chance in accessing their schools or curriculum. Recognise that SEN children that are Statemented are not Statemented legally.LA's need to review Statement process.SEN children are not always suitable for mainstream education, and when this occurs Government need to recognise that appealing against LEA decisions takes forever, and our children are left with the emotional scarring and unhappiness this causes them are their families. Parental and Child preference for specialist schooling should be granted immediately because after all the decision is not taken lightly by any parent to send their child away to be educated appropriately. Create Schools for the Deaf in ALL cities.\nDeaf children should be educated by a Teacher of the Deaf with at least a miniumum of BSL level II and above, for ALL curriculum subjects in mainstream schools.\nDeafness is a culture, has its own identity, BSL was recognised as an official language in 2003,let's use it.",
