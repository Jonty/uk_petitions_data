            "background": "As quoted by Michael Jackson, \"my biggest dream is to have a children's day where children can bond with their parents\" or care givers.There's mother's day, there's father's day and there's grandparent's day. In these changing times and with both parents working away from home being more the norm, it's important now, more than ever, to create this holiday. To make Michael Jackson's biggest dream come true would be the greatest way we can honour him. As well as this, we would be giving every child a day where they are the main focus, rather than many children struggling to fit into their parents' work schedules.\nThis yearly event would highlight the importance of family time together.",
