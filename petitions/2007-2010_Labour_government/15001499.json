            "background": "dear sir, please reconsider the idea to introduce a gaming tax/licence on pub games. Dominoes, Darts. Quiz Nights and Pool Nights do not directly generate money for the pub. In fact, Pubs which provide supper as an incentive- do so at their own expense.\nThis idea will only drive more independent pubs to question whether they should continue. It will be a devestating blow to the independents facing stiff competition from brewery chains.",
