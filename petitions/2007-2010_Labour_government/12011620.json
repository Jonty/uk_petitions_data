            "background": "1 - The Crown Prerogative is contrary to democracy in that it allows the Government to do things which impact on citizens without previous approval from Parliament or even without consulting them.\n2 - The PASC reported on this matter and its recommendations have still to be implemented.  Gordon Brown committed himself to constitutional reform of prerogative powers when he took office.  He has not yet done so.\n3 - The prerogatives needed and exercised by the Government (including relating to treaties, armed forces, civil service, honours, the judiciary) should be listed exhaustively in a Bill to be laid before Parliament, with the express provision that all other prerogatives not mentioned in the Bill are abolished.  They should all be subject to judicial review.  The Queen's role should be unaffected.  This would mean the Government would have to rely solely on statutory powers, granted by the people in Parliament, to conduct their business.",
