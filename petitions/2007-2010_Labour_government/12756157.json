            "background": "With the current expenses and other problems in the Houses of Parliament the electorate are not just annoyed by the expenses themselves but the reluctance to reveal what was spent and by whom. It is this culture of avoidance and misdirection and deceit that the public are fed up with. Now with all of these problems the government\u2019s reaction is to bring back spin with a vengeance by putting some of its favorite spin doctors into the House of Lords and wheeling them out to spin more stories in the media. When we consider what spin doctors are they are people who either emphasize one point of an issue or redirect questioning or even out and out lie. This is a failure to recognize that spin doctors are a symptom of the problem and certainly not the solution. Be honest with the electorate after all they vote for you, get rid of spin and stop lying.",
