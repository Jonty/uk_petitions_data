            "background": "Make women pay for abortions unless it is for serious health reasons. This will reduce NHS costs. If women have to pay for IVF to get pregant then women should pay to end a pregnancy.The government could then put childless couples out of their misery and more babies would be available for adoption. Women and girls then might think of using a different method of contraception rather than abortion.",
