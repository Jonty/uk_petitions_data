            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many bereaved families are outraged at what they consider pitifully low sentences imposed by judges when a jury has found the killer of their loved one guilty of death by dangerous driving. \n\nThe Criminal Justice Act 2003 increased the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving from 10 to 14 years, but the courts hardly ever apply sentences at the top end of the range. This is because judges follow guidelines on the factors to consider when sentencing someone found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. If they don\u2019t take note of these guidelines, it is possible that their ruling will be overturned in the Court of Appeal, which may adjust the sentence in line with the guidelines.\n\nIf you have lost someone close due to death by dangerous driving or simply believe that the laws need to be changed, please take the time to sign this petition!",
