            "background": "The worst prime minister in living memory presides over the \"stupid party\". With a mandate from no-one, a consumate coward, with an ostrich like approach to real life. Its over for you and the cronies. In the words of a real leader \"For God's sake go\". You should be more comfortable with commanding say, a mobile chip shop, instead of a country whose occupants are \"on their knees\"; over taxed, over regulated and as the results of Henley on Thames by election demonstrate, over \"New Labour\". My grandparents would turn in their graves to see their beliefs parodied by you. As I've said before, \"Gordon you are the weakest link-Goodbye\"",
