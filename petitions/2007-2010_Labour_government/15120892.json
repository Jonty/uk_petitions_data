            "background": "Stop the Primary Care Trusts from handing over our GP surgeries and Hospitals to \"Private Providers\". The government should come clean and ask the people of this country their views on the commercialisation/privatisation of the NHS. The government are dictating to us the people of this country what is good for our health.  What happened to patient choice? I understand that surgeries that have already been privatised or taken over by the Primary Care Trusts are the worst performing. Patients complain that they do not see the same doctor twice which is obviously not good for  continuity of patient care. If the government were keen to reduce waist in the NHS then they should cut back on unnecessary managers within these Primary Care Trusts and not allow profit making organisations the opportunity to take money out of NHS and pay it to shareholders.",
