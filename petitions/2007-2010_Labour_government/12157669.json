            "background": "With the new decision made by Home Office Post Graduate Diploma holders are not allowed to join the Post Study Work Scheme. Students were allowed to join this scheme when they made up their mind to study in UK and while they were studying in UK. \nNow with the new legislation government asks the students to leave the UK although many of these students came to UK to join Post Study Work Scheme.\nNew legislation takes the right to join the scheme from students and puts the students in a terrible situation. \n\n\nI want that new legislation gets adjusted. It should not affect students who were studying in UK before the legislation came into effect.",
