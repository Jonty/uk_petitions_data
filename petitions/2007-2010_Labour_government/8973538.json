            "background": "What do to in resuscitation emergencies is well covered - professionals are well trained in HOW to resuscitate , but like many life and death decisions, there remains some inconsistency in the following areas. I would benefit from better govt guidance on the following, since I have serious concerns in the clinical management of some cases I am coming across : \n\n1. Diagnosis and resuscitation\n2. Stage of disease and when/if to resuscitate\n3. Which professionals are making these decisions and their grading\n4. How long they've been in the country (i.e. whether they actually know the patient at all)\n5. Consultation with the patient's families and patient themselves about whether to sustain life.\n\nCan I make a formal complaint to the British govt in this respect and express my concern, I dare say, litigatiously, in terms of veteran management, you would be well advised to look at these issues.",
