        "background": "Until 1967 Hollywood was bound by the Production Code (aka the Hays Code), which forbade things like the ridicule of religion, and words and phrases that were considered to be offensive...including words like \u201cGod\u201d, \u201cLord\u201d, \u201cJesus\u201d etc.\n\nStandards changed and these words were allowed to be used but were still considered vulgar and contributed to higher age restrictions for movies or barring TV shows from containing them before watershed.\n\nIn recent times this has changed and blasphemy has become accepted phrasing not only in movies, TV and radio shows but in adverts and trailers at any time of the day. The bible states very clearly: \u201cYou shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name\u201d.  (Exodus 20:7)\n\nRegulation could either be put in place to remove it from future programming, highlighting it when it will exist in the content to warn viewers or \u201cdub\u201d out the words as currently used for other offensive language at certain times.",
