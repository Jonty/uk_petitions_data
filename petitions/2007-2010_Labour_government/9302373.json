While the lowly paid and pensioners tend to get very low if any increases in their incomes, it is this part of the UK which Mr Brown decided to squeeze for more money! It's easy to wonder what all the fuss is about when your on more than \u00a361,000 a year as an MP plus upwards of another \u00a390,000 in allowances but the UKs pensioners and lowly paid cannot even dream of these types of incomes. I ask the Prime Minister and The Chancellor to \u201cStop taxing the poor of the UK\u201d and show some sensitivity to the population of the UK.",
