I require on behalf of everyone in Middlesbrough and fellow television presenters for them to make a public apology and to also stop paying production teams to stand in Middlesbrough town centre for days on end looking for cellulite filled posteriors, struggling to distinguish between Middlesbrough and the surrounding areas, manipulating statistics that would make Enron look like a profitable company and finally allowing the viewers of the programme to imagine Sofie Allsop(sibling of one half of the dream team) having long a prosperous television career that would make the pronunciation of her sister look bad.",
