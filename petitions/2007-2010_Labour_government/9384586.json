            "background": "With the increase of numbers of Seagulls and their sizes they are nasty, frightening and their mess is a helath hazard. The reason I am raising this petition is that someone in the neighbourhood has been doing this for years, and the food they are leaving is not waste but fresh and in large quanties.Despite the local council telling her not to feed them and animal welfare are involved.  The resident continues to feed the Seagulls. It is at the state people in the area can not use their gardens. I have installed seagull deterrent on my roof, have to check my garden before I let my dog out and children refuse to play out if they hear the Seagulls.",
