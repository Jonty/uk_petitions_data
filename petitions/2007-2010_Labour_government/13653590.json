            "background": "Our national postal service has become increasingly expensive, complicated regards parcel and letter sizes and deliveries occur when you are at work in the middle of the day.\n\nThis postal service needs to be regulated to be effectual and satisfactory for our national needs. Deliveries need to be in the morning before going to work, prices need to stop rising with out proper justification and packages and letters should be accepted regardless of size on the basis of weight.\n\nI also propose to remove the letter size pricing and go on weight as this is just another attempt to make as much profit as possible. If you have paid for a parcel to go from door to door then this is what should occur and not a trip to the postal depot, or at least some rebate on the amount paid. If such changes cannot be made then we should have at least access to a postal service that can provide us with this minimum level of quality and provide us with what we desperately need.",
