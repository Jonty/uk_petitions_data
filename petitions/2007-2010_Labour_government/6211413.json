            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is well know that companies operate a policy of fixing prices for UK residents by pretending that we don't have a currency sign.  $100 is not equal to \u00a3100.  Where this blatant \"discrimination\" occurs the issue should be recognised as a criminal offence because that is precisely what it is.  \n\nThis is not about free markets and a companies rights to charge what it likes.  This is exactly the opposite, to the extent that the practice is so wide spread and deliberate that to describe it as anything other than \"discrimination\" is to be considered foolish.\n\nThe current situation allows a non free market to be created such that the persons discriminated against have no choice but to accept the fake market place and the entire \"CARTEL\"; much like a slave must accept his masters choices. \n\nToday it is simply that as a company you can just discriminate against the UK resident and you'll have the governments blessing.",
