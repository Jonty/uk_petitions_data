I got it then after the medical it was stopped as I scored 0 points despite everything! So DWP doctors are making out my own GP to be a liar and they haven't checked medical records. Lets get help for those who actually need it and get the government to target the RIGHT people to get back into some sort of work. There's also a Facebook group where you can read my story and share yours, please join! DWP - Fair medicals required for the genuine sick!!",
