            "background": "A small country like the UK has no power to change the course of Global warming on any scale.  Anything we do on our tiny island to reduce CO2 emissions will not count while China, the USA etc dont bring in severe reductions.  Therefore, fuel duty increases have no effect on reducing emissions as people don't drive for the fun of it, they have no choice but to get to work or go about their business.  We call on the PM to reduce fuel duty and stop adding VAT on top of duty, as it is unfair to pay a tax on a tax.",
