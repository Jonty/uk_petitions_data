        "background": "The onus is shifting onto schools to bring up children correctly. However, life and learning start from day one and parents need to educate their own children from birth.  \n\nSchools can only do so much when children arrive, aged 4 or 5 years old, and they have never been read to, let alone held a book. \n\nShift the onus back onto parents to begin education at home. \n\nSome parents-to-be may need help with this, so perhaps 'good parenting' should be taught as a core subject in the final years of school.",
