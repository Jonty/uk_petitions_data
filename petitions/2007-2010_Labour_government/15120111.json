            "background": "Mephedrone, or more commonly known as Meow Meow or M-CAT, is a legal substance which youngsters are taking for a legal high. It is avilable to buy on the internet and is relatively cheap - but it is dangerous. It has so far caused the death of four people and one case where a young lad ripped of his own scrotum due to hallucinations induced by the drug.\n\nThis drug will claim more lives unless it is made illegal. The fact that it is leal removes power from our Police forces, who already have a major battle against drugs. It's legal status probably encourages kids to use it under the false security they feel that it is legal and most likely safe.\n\nIt is not safe, and it needs to be controlled.\n\nMephedrone is an ingredient used in plant fertliser and it dangerous for human consumption. Ban it now!",
