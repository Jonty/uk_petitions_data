There has been a few cases in recent months such as the nurse sacked for exposing poor standards in the NHS and the most publicised being the leak what led to the rest of Damien Green. Whistle blowers do a grave justice in this country and should be encouraged to speak out. Gordon Brown was renowned for whistle blowing himself whilst in opposition.",
