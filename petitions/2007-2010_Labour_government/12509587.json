            "background": "I'm creating this petition at the beginning of the May Day holiday having seen from my paper that a large number of train journeys are going to be disrupted for this purpose.  The same thing happens every weekend, to a greater or lesser extent, on the London Underground and doubtless in other parts of the country as well.  \n\nI do, of course, understand that this work has to be done; but why can't it be done during the week after people have got to work and before they go home? People value their weekends and holidays and don't want to be unable to go where they had planned to because of this work; I imagine the people who do the work would also appreciate having this time off.  Finally it must be obvious that disruption to rail services leads to more car use; to the detriment of the environment.",
