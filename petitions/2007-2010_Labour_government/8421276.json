Their families are so very proud of their mothers/sisters/aunts/grandmothers.... and I know that my mother campaigned to be recognised for all the work she did. I don't understand that because my mother has died that she shouldn't have recognition... and this medal will proudly sit along with her Womens Timber Corps badge in my memorabilia.",
