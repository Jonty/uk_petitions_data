            "background": "It's long been a grave concern to parents that they have to beg GPs to prescribe quality formula and treatments (e.g. for skin conditions) to babies. Currently hundreds, more likely thousands, of babies in this country are being harmed as a result of inflexible GPs. Many GPs are known to be patronising to mothers when requests for specialist formula and treatments are made. Why are these specialist treatments even designed when GPs aren't prescribing them, especially when sound evidence is shown of the baby's need for them?",
