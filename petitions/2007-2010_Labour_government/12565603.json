            "background": "Over the years the trade of Engineering & manufacturing has been hit hard in the  \nUK, many company's over heads are such that they can't afford to train or invest in equipment (CNC machines are expensive) & the world market is an unbalanced one with labour costs & wages   \nbeing forced down making it a less attractive proposition for people to stay in the trade or to get involved with. The UK once prided it's self on it's manufacturing & engineering know how, we invented & built the worlds fines creations on our own but not any more. This country needs it's heart back so I ask the government to do something about this. I have not seen a shop floor apprentice in years so the skills will never be passed on & you can't train some one up in 12 months or just send them to college or university & hope it all will work out, it takes years of time, sweat & blood to pick this trade up & it's varied.",
