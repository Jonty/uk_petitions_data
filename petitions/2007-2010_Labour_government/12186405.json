        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I petition that Council Tax needs to be regulated and ran more fairly.\n\nIts not fair on the residents and businesses that the councils can take upto 10 days to respond to email and threaten to take people to court if payment not received within 7 days\n\nThis attitude of PAY NOW, query later is not good for businesses or for people on low income. Most people have had dealings with the councils and no one finds it a quick and positive experience for something we get little return from.\n\nAlso, if you get a court summons fee and you pay before it goes to court, that none of the fee is reimbursable. And that some councils will not allow you to discuss payment issues until you get a summons or fine\n\nSadly we have to pay this joke of a tax and I doubt that will change soon, but it should not be a thorne in our side and we the tax payer should be more respected.",
