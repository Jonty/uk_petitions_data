            "background": "The removal of personal allowance from those earning over \u00a3100,000 at a rate of \u00a31 less for every \u00a32 earned creates an effective marginal tax band of 60%. The leaked headline top tax band of 45% for those earning over \u00a3150,000 was designed to distract attention from this more ferocious tax on those less likely to be able to avoid tax. The government should look to create a system whereby the percentage of income tax goes up more smoothly the more you earn, not one where it goes up and down dramatically as is the case with this.",
