            "background": "Mrs Wallis has become the first unintended victim of changes to UK immigration laws which were designed to protect young British Asian women from being subjected to forced marriages.\n\nNo-one disputes the couple's marriage is anything other than genuine. But four days after they were married, new immigration rules were brought in. \n\nThese rules apply to everyone under 21 from outside Europe who marries a British person. \n\nMPs including home affairs committee chair Keith Vaz had appealed to the home secretary to let her stay. \n\nBut Alan Johnson has now personally written to the couple to order her to leave Britain or be forcibly deported. \n\nAnd yet this may have been avoided if the Governments own authorities hadn't lost their passport photographs causing delays and when permission did come through it was days to go before her visa expired and their wedding was not arranged in time.\n\nRochelle has more coordination and sense than Alan Johnson does and so would be a suitable replacement.",
