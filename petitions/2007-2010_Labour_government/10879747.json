        "background": "The Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Chancellor Alistair Darling have initiated a \u00a3500 billion bailout package for UK banks.  This will be paid for by the UK taxpayer without prior consultation. \n\nWe the undersigned call for the immediate withdrawl of any financial assistance from the British government and the Bank of England to UK commercial banks.  \n\nFinancial assets raised through the taxation of British citizens are the property of the nation and should be protected for the direct benefit of its citizens. As such, these assets should be used for the future provision of cuts in taxation or welfare and pensions benefits.  \n\nHowever if the UK government insists on injecting several billion pounds of capital into the UK economy in order to stimulate growth, then the method adopted should be that of direct payment to UK citizens. Given a figure of \u00a3500 billion this would equate to \u00a38,200 being credited to each and every man woman and child in the UK.  \n\nThis would serve as a direct means of reducing the personal debt of UK citizens, thereby recapitalising banks. At the same time this action would help to stimulate the housing market, motor trade, manufacturing and service sectors.",
