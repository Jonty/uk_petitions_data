            "background": "The Church of Scientology refer's to itself as a religion, however the organisation is a global pyramid money making scheme. Through personality tests, stress tests and auditing interviews, the Church of Scientology is able to identify impressionable people, perhaps those suffering from depression and over a period time persuade them to join the Church of Scientology and \"donate\" large sums of money even property in order to move higher within the church to become a \"clear\". The organisation provides \"counselling\" in an unchecked environment with no regulated body overseeing their work. The COS undermines the medical profession, convincing those on medication to stop taking their prescribed medicines.",
