            "background": "Due to the financial climate, my husband and I, like many others, have become unemployed. During the 8yrs we have been together my husband alone has paid over \u00a3200k in Tax & NI into the system. I have 2 children, one at High School and one at college. To our dismay we have been \"awarded\" \u00a380.95pw joint JSA and \u00a34.20pw child tax credits. My son at college can not have 1 penny of an EMA and we have only just been awarded free school meals for my youngest. Why? Because my husband earned too much money from April '08 to '09. If we were alcoholics, junkies, on special measures with social services, never worked and/or kept popping babies out whilst on benefits, we could be \"awarded\" hundreds per week. A backward nation indeed! Please sign this petition if you are hard working, let down by the system and fed up with paying for undeserving members of a broken society.",
