            "background": "Evidence shows that many adults who were abused as children are being discriminated and stigmatised within child proection, with the current working beliefs within local authorities being \"the abused become the abusers\". So anyone who was abused as a child is a potential abuser and a risk to children. Evidence shows that families who have recovered from childhood traumas are being ripped apart by incorrect or incomplete records in many cases records that are 20 + years old. The damage this is causing is a breach to anyone's human rights as individuals affected have decribed it as mental torture and degrading to be judged and falsely accused on your parents behaviour and social services failures - not their own.",
