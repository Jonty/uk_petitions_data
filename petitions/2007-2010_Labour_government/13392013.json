Particularly the lack of tax on benefits in kind, such as subsidised food and alcohol which is available in the many clubs in the HofC and the provision of vehicular transport and free bus and rail journies for them and their families is something which MUST be stopped forthwith.  They have no entitlement to it, except that they voted it in for themselves.",
