        "background": "Whilst I applaud and acknowledge that the Prime Minister is about to commemorate the great contribution the Bevin Boys played to the war effort I am saddened that only surviving miners will be decorated. Many widows, my mother included, would fully appreciated and cherish a medal for their husband's contribution. I think it shameful that Mr. Brown decrees that a tiny minority of the men deserve a medal because they have a robust constritution. My father deserves to be recognised whether he is with us or not. Please reconsider this decision Mr. Brown.",
