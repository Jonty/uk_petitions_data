            "background": "The amount of tax and duty which is collected \"unseen\" by the public on petrol and diesel is blatantly day light robbery. The government has for too long been subsidizing other areas with funds collected from UK Motorists. Quite simply UK motorists pay much higher costs than the rest of europe, but have some shocking roads as the money is not re-invested in either roads or greener policies like improving public transport. The level of tax and duty should be displayed at the pump to embarrass the government into cutting these stealth taxes.\nI've read that the government has also blocked hauliers etc. who heavily rely on the price of fuel for their income, to stop them protesting so the rest of the public now have to act to try and force some action.",
