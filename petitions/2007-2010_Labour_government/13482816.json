        "background": "Ban lorry drivers from overtaking on dual carriageways and motorways.\nI feel the need to create this petition due to my own everyday observations using our road network.\nIt is becoming increasingly frustrating having to sit behind these lorries when there drivers seem to lose commonsense and try to overtake uphill.\nWhy do they think they can do this, do they suddenly forget they are driving a 40ton articulated vehicle.\nIt is a major cause of congestion and crashes.\nNot only ovetaking uphill, they just seem to pull out into the outer lane with very little or no notice of indication. I have seen on many many different times lorry drivers suddenly pulling out into the middle lane or outer lanes trying to overtake cutting vehicles up dramatically, where those vehicles in turn are either forced to brake suddenly or forced out into the outer lane. Obviously all of these actions can cause huge crashes.\nBan lorries overtaking and this wont happen and congestion would be cut.",
