        "background": "Noah's Ark Zoo farm is a pro-question facility which questions scientific theory in an informative and rational way. They do not make a secret of this and provide information from both sides.\n\nBristol Noah's Ark Farm is clear in its aims and goals and offers facilities to Schools as a cost effective and enjoyable way for many children to see animals they would otherwise be unable to. It is for the Teacher of such groups to put any information given into context. \n\nAs a Open and Free Society, the British Government should not be called on to remove funding or support for a venue which does not persecute any belief but simply offers alternative points of view.\nSigning the petition is in objection to and to counter the Anti Noah's ark Zoo farm Petition and accepts the right to religious belief and views.",
