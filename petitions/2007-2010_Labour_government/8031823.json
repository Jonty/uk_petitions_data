            "background": "Why is it that the taxpayer must foot the bill for offenders who can sit about all day watching Sky TV and playing pool. The prisons are full as a result of non deterrent sentences. Build a tented camp on Dartmoor or better still outsource internment to China where it will be cheaper. If families of those convicted want to visit them they can do so at their own expense. When the offenders are released, they will be able to make their own way home at thier own expense. If they have not left the country in 14 days they can be rearrested as vagrants.",
