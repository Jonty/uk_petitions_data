            "background": "This method of raising funds for improved internet access proposes the creation of money by the Bank of England. It would be without cost to the public purse, in contrast to government borrowing and also would be without cost to businesses or individual households in contrast to the direct taxation proposed. It would provide an interest-free and debt-free gain to the national wealth through higher productivity. It would bring forward future enterprise, would add to sustainable growth and help employment. Being a specific time-limited investment it would eventually cease to be needed at all when the task was complete and would not have added to any public or private burden of debt for the future.",
