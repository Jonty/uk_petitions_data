            "background": "I would like to say that government should take initiative to give support and assistance similar like national students. they should be given equal rights to work unlike foreign students don't have the right to work and because of this fact most of the student are involved in illegal activities causing penalties. The government should give apprenticeship programs through a proper platform to students which will be benefit to both students and the companies similar like Germany as they offer internships and they have simple procedure as a result of which their economic is prospering day by day. the fees for international students is very high and only few students attend university and majority of them quit during their academic time. I hope that Mr. Prime Minister will definitely take this matter seriously.",
