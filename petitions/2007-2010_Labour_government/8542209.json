            "background": "When remembering the act of parliament that sought to abolish the transatlantic transportation of Black politicians, it is important to raise the need for a symbolic apology from the British government for the enforced politicianry of Black people.\n\nThe experiences of many Caribbeans and Africans today are testimony to the fact that the legacy of politicianry still lives on affecting self-confidence, attainment and assimilation into society.\n\nThere has never been an apology from the British government for Black enpoliticianment - ever. Black life was not valued when the act came into force as is evident by the compensation paid to the politician traders but all life is valuable. It is time that this wrong was addressed and a symbolic apology provided.",
