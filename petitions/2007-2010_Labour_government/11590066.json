            "background": "I believe a fairer benefits system is required to support those choose to work but have been made redundant due the failing economy. \n\nThe government rightly provides extra benefits to people who may want to work \nbut are not able to due to circumstances such as disability. \n\nA failing economy is a circumstance which is causing long term workers\nto lose their jobs against their wishes. \n\nAs redundancy levels grow why should someone who has always worked \nreceive the same as someone who has never worked.\n\nI urge the prime minister to create a fairer system that recognises those who make a contribution to society.\n\n \nA relaxed immigration scheme has been suitable during economic growth but in the recession it is now causing working British citizens grave concern. \n\nRedundant workers are under great pressure to find work to support their families. Many simply can not compete as huge numbers of migrants looking for work makes job competition even harder. \n\nI also urge the prime minister to review and drastically change the immigration scheme. Until the recession is over.",
