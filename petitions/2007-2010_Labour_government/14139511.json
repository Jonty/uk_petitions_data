            "background": "Major IT companies operating in the UK, such as Fujitsu, IBM, CSC, HP and Steria are making cuts in jobs, pay and pensions, despite being profitable.  This corporate greed threatens to undermine economic recovery and delivery of the high quality services which the public rely on.\n\nFujitsu reneged on a pay deal, imposed a pay freeze, proposed to dismiss and re-engage almost 4000 UK staff to end their final salary pensions and proposed 1200 job losses.\n\nIBM, CSC and Steria proposed to close their final salary or defined benefit pension schemes to existing employees.\n\nHP asked staff to take a pay cut and cut hundreds of jobs.\n\nCompanies like these receive billions of pounds of public money.  They should not be allowed to treat trusted and loyal employees like this, especially when they can afford to reward shareholders and directors handsomely.\n\nThe UK relies on the staff in these companies, who provide vital services including to the NHS, HMRC, DWP, Royal Mail Group and MOD in the public sector, as well as to major private companies in industries from finance to manufacturing.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister to contact these companies to register opposition to their plans.",
