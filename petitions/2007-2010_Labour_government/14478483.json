            "background": "I consider that Frances Inglis, whilst technically guilty of murder should be released with a full pardon.  The Ambulance Service/NHS ruined her sons life removing any potential quality of life he may have had and caused this lovely lady intolerable stress.   What good will finding her guilty of murder and committing her to jail do to anyone least of all her, her other children and the rest of her family.  If it really is impossible to pardeon her then I feel very strongly that the law should immediately be changed to accommodate this kind of situation and that she should be pardoned forthwith.\n\nAndrew Hill",
