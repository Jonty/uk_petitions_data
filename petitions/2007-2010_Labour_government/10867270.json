        "background": "I am a child at age 16.  \n\nWhy as a 16 year old,  am I not being treated as a child when I travel by rail, I am unable to vote as I am not 18, I am not permitted to drink nor smoke (not that I want to anway), I have no legal authority to be an adult. I am unable to go into a club under the age of 18, so why please do I now have to pay for my own transport to school or travel by rail and am being charged the adult rate? I cannot drive as I am under 18 so I am forced to use public transport. I cannot have a loan, a credit card, I can buy a house (if I have the cash) but I cannot get mortgage. But yet if I wished I could get married with parental guardians' consent but something simple as being treated with the child charge for rail travel seems to be impossible.   If you want my or other youths future vote, perhaps you wish to address these inconsistencies?",
