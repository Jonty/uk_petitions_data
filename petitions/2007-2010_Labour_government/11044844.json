        "background": "EEA Citizens living in the UK may bring family members (even if these family members are non-EEA citizens) to live with them in the UK under EU Law.\n\nBritish Citizens are not allowed to bring such family members to live with them in the UK, as the EU Law does not apply in that case.\n\nThis is grosly unfair towards British citizens and their families who may be non-EEA citizens. It seems British citizens have fewer rights in their own country than citizens of other EEA states who live in the UK.\n\nI believe it is a breach of human rights to withold the right to a wholesome family life from British Citizens while it is upheld for other EEA citizens in the UK.",
