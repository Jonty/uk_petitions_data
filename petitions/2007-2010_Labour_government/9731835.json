            "background": "The current 'end of speed limit' road sign - a circular white road sign with a black diagonal bar - is misleading and should be replaced by road signs showing the actual speed limit for the road.  It is insufficient to rely on the motorists' knowledge of whether the road is a single carriageway or not to determine the speed limit - or indeed if some other limit applies - this should be clearly indicated by signage at every change to a speed limit.",
