            "background": "This petition makes the point so many pro-smokers do: the amount of tax that is added to the price of cigarettes.  They all seem to take it for granted that all this tax is spent on the N.H.S.; but how do they know it is?  As a letter on either Ceefax or Teletext pointed out it could be spent on anything; possibly Iraq.\nThis is not, however, my main reason for being so opposed to this.  The main reason is the harm smokers cause to non-smokers via passive smoking: not only lung cancer and heart disease but also other cancers such as breast cancer.  Also; passive smoking on the part of a pregnant woman can cause a number of disabilities in the baby.  How can ANY of this be justified; let alone actually giving preferential treatment to the perpetrators?\nThe creator of the petition I oppose says many people didn't know about the dangers of smoking when they started; maybe not but they do now so why not, instead, ask for help giving up?!",
