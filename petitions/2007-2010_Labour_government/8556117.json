            "background": "the imminent closure of Cavell House Nursey'\nCavell House is a Pre school Nursery run by Bradford Council and has been a nursery of excellence for some years. Bradford Council have recently announced that the Nursery is to close in August of 2008 due to funding shortfalls. I would strongly recommend that central government look at the offstead reports\nand the history behind Cavell house.It would be a great loss to the community to lose an establishment of this stature and an insult to the efforts of the hard working staff past and present, that have given their all to reach these high\nstandards of excellence.\n\nPlease help save our nursery and safeguard our childrens'future development\n\nCavell House Children's Centre",
