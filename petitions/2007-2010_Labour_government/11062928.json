            "background": "This petition was created to better the lifes of everyone suffering from an anxiety disorder- who feel the medical proffesion has failed them.\n\nMany people suffer from anxiety in silence, as the medication and help doctors provide just isnt good enough. \n\nAnxiety is recognised as one of the most debilitating illnesses, so why isnt the medical proffesion taking it seriously and treating it like one. The truth is doctors are practicing old treatments that have failed so many people, so this petition is to protest for funding to provide upto date care and treatment for those who need it.\n\nAnxiety sufferers need real help and support, been sent home with a 'magic' pill and been told to rest simply isnt working.  So lets get together and raise awareness of a problem that has been brushed under the carpet for far too long.\n\nWe want adiquate support provided by the health service, programmes created to cure anxiety naturally and effectively- treatments proven to work. The health service wouldnt send someone with cancer to a specialist who has had no specific training in that area- so why should people with anxiety be given treatment from Doctors who lack knowledge and experience on the illness.",
