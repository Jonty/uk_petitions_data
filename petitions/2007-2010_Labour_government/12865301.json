            "background": "25/06/09.\nRumour has it that the UK economy is about to slowly start to recover but at the same time we're seeing that vehicle fuel (diesel and petrol) are now past the 1 pound per litre mark again.\nExactly one year ago the price of crude was approx $140 - that's double what it is today but fuel was at about \u00a31.30 per litre then.\nSeems like the petroleum companies are making a killing again (watch out for those quarterly profit figures coming out soon) and that we and the UK economy are the ones that will be suffering once more.\nPlease government, set up a task-force to look into the pricing criteria that the UK Petroleum companies are subjecting us to.\nIf our government does not have the power to influence this pricing would our government not be able to set up it's own fuel distribution network so that we can finally pay a fair price.\nOf course, reducing taxation on fuel as well would give us a double win !!\nRegards,\nMr Del Core",
