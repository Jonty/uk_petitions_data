        "background": "Mr Speaker is once again demonstrating that he is the head trougher and considers himself to be outside the rule of common sense and respect for the taxpayer.  There is absolutely no way that use of public funds for travel to foreign parts for an employee (AND HIS WIFE WHO HAS NO ELECTORAL DUTIES AT ALL) whose duties lie entirely within the House of Commons, can be justified.  Use of taxes in this manner is theft and the taxpayer is entitled to an explanation detailing why he should be allowed to get away with this theft and it is up to the Prime Minister to give us the explanation.",
