This would give our inneficient agencies time to process the backlog of applicants.\nM.P.'s talk of educaion and health etc. being the country's priorities, but they never mention the 'Immigration' word. It is as if they are afraid of the word yet if they listen to their constituents, it's immigration that everyone talks about. The cost to the taxpayer of employing extra teachers to teach immigrant kids who do not speak English, and the cost to the N.H.S. to care for imigrants who come to the U.K. suffering from God knows what must run in to millions. We all know why people want to come here....It's because they know that they can sponge of us all.\n If this government what to stay in office, stop immigration. The B.N.P. winning office was no fluke.",
