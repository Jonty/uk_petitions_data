            "background": "Passengers will no longer be able to watch the countryside slip by at 125mph as a waiter serves them a four-course dinner at a neatly laid table. Instead, they will have to bring their own food or buy snacks from trolleys. \n\nThe company claims that it is losing about \u00a320 million a year from its train catering, even though the restaurants are so popular that passengers are often turned away or have to wait for a second sitting. It claims that restaurant cars waste seats because passengers who use them leave an empty seat elsewhere on the train. \n\nBut in 2007, when National Express took over the franchise, the DfT secretly removed the obligation and left train catering at the company\u2019s discretion.\n\nBruce Williamson, of Railfuture, which campaigns on behalf of rail passengers, said: \u201cDining cars are a great railway tradition and it is shortsighted to remove something which makes trains more attractive than less sustainable modes of transport.\u201d",
