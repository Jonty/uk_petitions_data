            "background": "Mobile phones are being used as an alternative to cash. Using premium rate SMS mobile phones are used to charge for downloads. Similarly parking and travel costs are being charged too. Few mobile phone owners realise that charges made without consent aren\u2019t covered by any code of practice enforceable in law. This means that if a company obtains your number either randomly, by purchasing your details from marketing companies or fraudulently you have no legal comeback on anyone for charges incurred. Also there is no requirement for the mobile companies to inform you where they pay your money to allow you to take civil action against such companies. \nThere needs to be an indemnity for these charges in a similar way as exists for direct debit mandates whereby the mobile phone network operator is responsible to ensure that any charges on your account are refunded in the event of fraud or mistake, and that there is a clear method of recourse in this type of event.",
