            "background": "At present, due to a loophole in current legislation, Fish Farm operators and Fishermen are legally allowed to shoot any Marine Mammal \"damaging nets\".\nThis has resulted in an organised massacre of Seals in Scotland by the fish farming industry.\nAn estimated 5000 seals a year are currently being shot.\nAt present pregnant and nursing mothers may also be shot. This causes many young seal pups to die of starvation after their mothers have been shot. \nThis carnage must be stopped, and can only be prevented by an Act of Parliament providing proper protection to all Marine Mammals including all species of Seal. This act specifically making it illegal for anyone to kill or cause the death of any Marine Mammal, with the exception of veterinary practitioners for medical reasons.\nWe also petition that the Prime Minister brings pressure to bear on the leader of the Scottish Parliament to ensure that an identical act is passed in Scotland with no exemptions permitted for the Fish Farming Industry.",
