There is a hideous correlation between this and creation of animal human hybrids being proposed under the Human Tissue and Embyology Bill. Can we please stop this 'sea change' shift  away from our evolutionary heritage which I have greater faith in than the over zealous curiosity of the scientific community. I wish this were all just a bad dream. Why can't we just leave mother nature alone?",
