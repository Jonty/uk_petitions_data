            "background": "Under section 57 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, it is an offence to place or maintain a misleading notice on a right of way likely to deter public access.\n\nThe original Act specified a fine of up to \u00a35 for this offence (subsection 1), and a fine of up to \u00a32 per day for failing to comply with a court order to remove the notice (subsection 2).\n\nThe maximum fine in subsection 1 has since been revised to \"level 1 on the standard scale\", currently \u00a3200.  However, the daily maximum fine specified in subsection 2 has stagnated at \u00a32 ever since; we therefore call on the government to revise it to 40% of the level 1 maximum, i.e. currently \u00a380.\n\nThis will restore the deterrent effect as originally intended, both now and for the future.",
