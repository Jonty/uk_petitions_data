            "background": "BRITISH DEVELOPMENT of RADAR was never adequately recognised although both The Battle of Britain & The Battle of The Atlantic were won as a result and hence WW2. The \"Electronics Age\" also resulted largely from derivatives of the circuits and components developed in this 1935/42 work.\u00a0OBJECTIVE:- To locate, register, preserve, store, interpret, explain & display remaining equipment, parts and documents by working with DEHS (See Website), NATIONAL MUSEUMS, THE SERVICES et al, also to produce educational & research material. History and Physics of Radar are not taught at school. For 2 generations, Official Secrets Act restricted communication on design, uses, experiences etc. of RADAR. To implement requires funds - a relatively small amount c.f. Govt. Sport, Arts, Special interest groups, Olympics etc.\u00a0 \u00a35 million would help perform the work and excite kids about why maths and physics are worth the effort. The CENTRE would also act as Memorial to the \"BOFFINS\". HRH Prince Phillip has noted this endeavour. Please add your support.",
