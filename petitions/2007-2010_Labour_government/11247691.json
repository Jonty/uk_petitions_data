            "background": "Much police (and public) time is wasted on the legal requirement to hand-write multiple copies of witness statements, reports and criminal record archives.\nTo re-deploy the police more effectively, we propose a change in the law coupled with the research, development and introduction of a hand-held digital recording device admisible in court. This would transcribe spoken word to on-screen text for a witness to review, alter and digitally sign. Once signed the data would become encrypted beyond further editing. Only senior officers would have decryption keys that allowed transfer of the data into base computers for presentation in a standard format. The software for this process would not allow editing, only transfer.",
