            "background": "Currently councils do not take into account the length of time somebody has been on a housing waiting list. There are too many cases of \"queue jumping\" from non UK born applicants, when housing is being allocated. They also discriminate against, single UK born men, who may be on low incomes and may have been registered on housing lists for many years and are being told they have absolutely no chance of attaining social housing. All councils need to remove this bias.",
