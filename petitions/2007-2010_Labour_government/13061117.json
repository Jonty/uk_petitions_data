        "background": "We demand a public enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the bank bailouts. Where the government was getting it's advice. Why they where not allowed to go into receivership in order to have a chance of truly cleaning up the banking system. What role did Goldman Sachs play - what advice did they give to the government and how did they stand to benefit. \n\nWas the idea of systemic risk a fraud or was this just a long overdue correction induced by these glutinous banks themselves - should we have contained the damage through carefully managed bankruptcy so to have avoided making the tax payer pay for and reward the greed and failure endemic in this industry and avoid putting the tax payer on the hook for future greed and failure.\n\nIn short a full public enquiry into the circumstances surrounding and reasons for the bank bailouts and who exactly ended up benefiting most from this. We believe the public was duped into believing that this was essential - the only option - but this is not the way Capitalism is actually meant to work. \n\nWhy do banks manage to keep all profits while when they fail the taxpayer is on the hook for their losses.",
