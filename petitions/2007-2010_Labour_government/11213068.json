            "background": "In light of the situation in Zimbabwe and the insensitive nature of the Zimbabwe government leadeship to the plight of it's people, we believe that every measure to promote democratic and responsible rule in Zimbabwe should be taken. The Zimbabwean people are powerless as any sign to have their voices heard is brutally put down by Mugabe and his police and army. Zimbabweans greatly appreciate the efforts by the Prime minister and the opposition leaders to assist in ensuring democracy in Zimbabwe is upheld and the will of the people prevail. In this light as an addition to other measures already in place we urge the British government to stop Air Zimbabwe lying into the UK as revenue accumulated via this route is used to prop up the brutal Mugabe regime. We believe this is one of the most effective ways to free the Zimbabwean people from the clutches of oppression.",
