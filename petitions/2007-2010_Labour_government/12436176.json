            "background": "Maltby comp are trying to change the students uniform, and the way the students wear their hair. Not only is this a cost to a lot of parents who are on a low incomes, but more to the point it is an infringement of human rights.\nThere is nothing wrong with a student wearing short sleeved shirts/blouses as these can not be seen under their already black blazers that have to be worn at all times.\nStudents are now being told, girls hair might have to be no longer than shoulder length and MUST remain its natural colour ie girls are not aloud to wear high lights.\nI fully be leave that a student must respect the schools wishes and NOT wear any extreme hair cuts, but to deny a girl to have her hair looking nice is going beyond reality, and is totally unfair.\nStudents are already being sent home for not wearing correct uniform. Surely it's more important that students get an education? and for the school to be dealing with more important issues like protecting it's students, and stop the bullying that goes on within it's walls on a daily basis.",
