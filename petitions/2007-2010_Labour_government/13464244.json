            "background": "Many years ago it was decided that St Clears was too small to keep a train station there. Today, with well over 10k residents, St Clears is in dire need of a train station. \n\nWith a much needed train station in St Clears, it would not only boost local trade, it would also decrease the traffic on the A40, decreasing the number of accidents that occur there, and bottle necks in the morning. \n\nIt would also allow for much needed, better public transport links between what has become a popular, and well known village in Carmarthenshire and its surrounding villages. Even Clunderwen has its own station and that village doesn't have half the population of St Clears.",
