            "background": "There are many disabled toilets all over the UK that are inaccessible to disabled people because they do not use the Radar key system of entry.\n\nA lot of these disabled toilets are also locked and require you to find someone to unlock it for you or there is a notice on the door that tells you to go somewhere, that is often inaccessible to disabled people, to get the key to open the disabled toilet door.\n\nWhen a disabled person needs to go to the toilet they do not need the added embarrassment of having to seek out someone to unlock the disabled toilet for them, or having to justify to someone why they have the right to use a disabled toilet.\n\nIf it were made law that all disabled toilets must use the Radar key system of entry it would eliminate a lot of the problems experienced by disabled people when they try to access a disabled toilet.",
