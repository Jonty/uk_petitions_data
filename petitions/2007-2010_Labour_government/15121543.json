            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Commentators attacking H&S legislation have suggested de-regulating health and safety and allow business to refuse access to HSE inspectors, introduce self regulation and abolish current H&S legislation considered by business to be a burden. This approach introduces the US system of self regulation which increases deaths and serious injury of people at work, weakening workers rights to a safe and healthy working environment. It compromises the aims of UK H&S legislation in protecting workers from injury and death at work, making employers responsible for the safety and welfare of their employees. The Government should embark on a media campaign to defend current health & safety legislation educating the public to the disastrous situation that self regulation of health and safety by employers would create. This is rather like making it lawful for criminals to reject any investigations from the police and instead regulate themselves and decide upon their own guilt in relation to the criminal law!",
