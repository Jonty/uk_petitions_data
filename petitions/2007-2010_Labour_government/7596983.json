        "background": "Time and Time again visiting fans to italian clubs are subjected to violence and mistreatment, the latest incident involving the stabbing of 5 manchester united fans in Rome must be the final straw. Roma are by far the worst of the offenders, but not the only ones.  Also Middlesboro in 2006, Liverpool in 2001, manchester united 3 times in 2007 newcastle and leeds fans have been attacked. And you cannt even turn to the Italian police for support as they are a large part of the problem, they repeatedly use violence as a first not last resort, and are not in the slightest bit concerned if the people they are attacking are guilty of anything. Enough is enough, its time Italian clubs are banned from europe before the injuries become deaths. If English fans were still behaving like this we would have been banned before our plane home had landed!",
