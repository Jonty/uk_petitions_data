        "background": "The arc between Oxford and East Anglia is an area of major growth, both currently and projected in the near future. Despite this, rail links between these two areas are non-existent. A rail journey between Oxford and Ipswich, for instance, takes over three hours. Re-opening this lost link would not be very expensive or involve major disruption to the existing network. Indeed re-opening the link between Oxford and Milton Keynes would require a comparatively minimal amount of work as much of the track still exists. Given the projected future growth in this area, such a rail link will be (and is currently) vital.",
