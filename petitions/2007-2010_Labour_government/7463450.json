Despite this, rail links between these two areas are non-existent. A rail journey between Oxford and Ipswich, for instance, takes over three hours. Re-opening this lost link would not be very expensive or involve major disruption to the existing network.

Given the projected future growth in this area, such a rail link will be (and is currently) vital.",
