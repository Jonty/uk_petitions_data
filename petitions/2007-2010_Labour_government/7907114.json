            "background": "london is a wonderful diverse city that has everything going for it including great nightlife and wonderful things to do 365 days per year.\nbut the thing is after 12am the city shuts down. in new york and america there is nothing like this at all.\nfor the price of rail fares now days this should be our right as the public to get on a train or any means of public transport at 4 in the morning.\ni love london but do not like paying massive amounts of cash to get home in a clapped out car that might not be legal or spending my hard earned money on a black cab that will only take me half way to my house before dropping me at a bus stop at 5am.\ni think having 24hr transport would boost london even more and crate thousands of more jobs.\nso everyone sign the petition and we will se what we can do.\n\nso my message is for london and other major cities to have the transport system running 24hrs a day",
