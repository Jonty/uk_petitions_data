What happen to helping those in the developing countries? \nWe can't deport terrorist or murderous criminals because of their human rights, spending more money and resources looking after them but can removed this lady to have a painful slow death.\nYes, the NHS is under funded and not working well for the people of England but this is a very special case but to remove a terminally ill woman who has cancer and requires kidney dialysis is very heartless this day and age. I am against people breaking our laws and abusing the system but what happen to a little bit of dignity.\nMr. Brown please do something and don't let her suffer in silence",
