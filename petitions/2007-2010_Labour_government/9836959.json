Their meal cost 40 cents.They actually spend 3 times the amount of money on a meal for police dogs\nA couple of weeks ago I watched a documentary about him. Absolutely brilliant. Maybe we should take a leaf out of his book! This is why he gets re-elected again and again.\n\nYou can google his name.",
