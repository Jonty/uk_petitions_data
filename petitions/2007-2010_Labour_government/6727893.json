        "action": "Recognise the Kurdish Freedom Movement in Turkey as a legitimate representation of the Kurdish people's will. To ignore the Turkish State's labelling of the Kurds as 'terrorists' and initiate political negotiations with other states to decriminalise the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) and recognise the political reality of the Kurdish people's struggle in Turkey. At a time when Turkey is returning to a purely military solution to the Kurdish Question in Turkey the international community must not leave the Kurdish people to endure another 'dirty war' being waged against them and should send a strong message to Turkey to solve its Kurdish Question peacefully and politically with political representatives of the Kurdish people.",
