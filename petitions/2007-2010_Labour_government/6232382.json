        "background": "The price of doorstep deliveries by milkmen is on the verge of going up in price again - Dairy Crest brought out Express Dairies last year, shortly after the sale they increased prices by 1pence per bottle, now again they are on the verge of increasing the price by 2pence per pint - this will end the tradition of Doorstep delivery and at the end of the day make hundreds of milkmen/ladies who brave all weathers redundant. Why cannot the doorstep prices come more in line with Supermarket prices - our Farmers will not be seeing much of this further increase - so please help.",
