Over a year ago, they nationalised B&B and shareholders are no more informed about what is happening to their share holdings. I had nealy all of my life savings in B&B shares and they have been nationalised, and not a word from the Goverenment about when they will compensate people.\nWith tens of thousands of people like myself who have lost all their money, why are the goverment not making sure we recieve a fair and prompt price for our shares which the governemnt have taken.\nPlease sign this and lets get things moving!!",
