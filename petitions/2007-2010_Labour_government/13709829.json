            "background": "Ofgem recently signalled that it would not outlaw the contracts, which lock customers in to their energy suppliers for the next period unless they take action to cancel their contracts. This was a u-turn on previous plans to outlaw the contracts. Ofgem has bowed to pressure from energy companies, (whose influence within Ofgem should be subject to a parliamentary enquiry).\nResearch shows that one in five businesses received inadequate notice that their energy contracts were coming to an end. One in ten had received backdated bills and one in four businesses had initially been offered unfavourable renewal terms.\nFPB and ACS also voiced concerns that proposals by Ofgem to ease the contracts - such as 30-day notice periods to allow businesses to renegotiate contracts - apply only to micro-businesses (those employing 10 staff or fewer), and not other small business employers.\nSmall businesses are given extremely inadequate notice periods, with some  receiving no notice at all. Often, they are then forced to pay much higher rates. This is simply unfair.",
