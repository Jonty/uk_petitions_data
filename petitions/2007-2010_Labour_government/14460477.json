            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Royal Mail in its wisdom are looking at closing Delivery Offices up and down the country. They are currently looking at the posibility of moving Stourport D.O into Kidderminster D.O. This would mean the closure of Stourport Delivery Office all returned mail having to be collected from Kidderminster, the staff would have to travel to Kidderminster for place of work considering there is no public transport first thing in the morning this will mean Royal Mail will have to provide conveyance. The loss of this valued Delivery Office will mean a deteriation in the Postal services in the Stourport area and the loss of potential employment out of a town that is already suffering from the recesion.\nPlease sign this petition to maintain the postal service the people of Stourport deserve and to maintain jobs in Stourport.",
