        "background": "Why did the government allow spec savers to be the only company that can provide eye glasses to under 16 for free? This is not fair. It is really sad to know that the government would empower one company over thousands of other companies, leaving  companies e.g mine, to suffer and been unable to offer the same services as spec savers hence making me to loose business.",
