            "background": "The European Union was established in order to unite our continent of small nations into a region where people can move and trade freely, and as a forum for European governments to debate pressing modern issues on a scale to match them. Since Britain's part in this began, we have made a mockery of the system, rejecting it's principles and ideas in favour of our own, on the basis of a weak argument that we will lose our \"national identity\".\n\nThe Prime Minister must understand that the EU is not attempting to be its own state and that being a member of any supranational organization such as the EU or the UN requires both give and take. We are separated from the rest of Europe by a stretch of water, but joined surely by a desire to improve the quality of life for all of us. He must understand that we no longer live in an imperial age where establishing national identity is the sole sign of strength, but in a diplomatic one where we understand that uniting together is the surest way to progress.",
