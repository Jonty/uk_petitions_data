            "background": "Since 2006 me and afew of my friends have been going to Southbank. Up until recently it has been extremely pleasent and fun. Now big groups of people (Scene/Emo Kids) have been comming to Southbank and they are ruining it by chucking glass bottles everywhere and being sick all over the place. Disturbing people who are eating at local resturants because of these scene kids who are drunk and cause riots/fights. They make the atmostphere so unpleasent and because of their awful behaviour they are getting the people who go there to see their skater friends kicked out. The security do their job very well don't get me wrong but they never seem to just target the drunk kids. It always seems that the original southbank kids are getting punished aswell and getting kicked out of somewhere they like to skate/catch up with friends without taking/smoking drugs or drinking alchol.\nPeople need to leanrn that they are ruining other peoples nights and the enviroment.",
