            "background": "After reading a BBC news article about 'Jedward' from X-factor fame I saw that Gordon Brown has 'burnt his bridges' with the awful duo who symbolises everything that is wrong with this country. Why is he even caring about that show? Is he now going to phone Katie Price and tell her how he thought it was unfair she got voted to do every trial? Why can't he just get on with trying to run our country? Why can't he demand train fares to be cheaper? Why can't he stop utilities companies from overcharging us? Why can't he give more money to the NHS so that they can give a better service during our final days on this planet. I want Gordon Brown to know that we don't care what he thinks about bad TV and get on with sorting out this country - and this does not mean to help out banks by using our money",
