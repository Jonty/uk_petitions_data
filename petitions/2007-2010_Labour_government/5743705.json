Take it or leave it .\nThis is not how Democracy works .\nFor each petition accepted we should be able to comment on the answer. Now that IS Democracy. No Politician of the Labour party or any party in power wants this petition that`s why it will be rejected.\nSo sign up and show them what democracy really means.",
