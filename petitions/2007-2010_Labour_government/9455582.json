        "action": "Provide Free Broadband Internet for Pensioners",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many Pensioners get free TV licences, Bus Passes and winter fuel allowances but have to pay for Telephone lines and Internet connections.  When most are struggling to meet rising food and fuel bills they can not afford to keep in touch with relatives and friends via the ordinary telephone and also with the newer email and instant messaging provided by the Internet.  This seriously disadvantages the pensioners (from the rest of modern society) who, due to the relative high monthly costs, are unable also to easily access the millions of pages of pensioner related content on the Internet such as health and benefit information for example.  \n\n(Note: Also it might be prudent to include the disabled, unemployed and very low income families in any free internet).\n\nI petition the Prime Minister to grant Free Broadband Internet access to all Pensioners.",
