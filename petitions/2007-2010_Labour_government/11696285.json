TO SURVIVE FOR THEIR REMAINING YEARS ON THE PENSION FROZEN AT THE TIME THEY LEAVE.- IT CAUSES A GREAT DEAL OF BITTERNESS WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE PAID NOTHING INTO THE SYSTEM CAN CLAIM AN INCREASING PENSION UNTILL THEIR DEMISE. - IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT THE U.K GOV. STARTED CARING MORE ABOUT ITS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE . SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENNED TO THE ECONOMY BY THROWING MONEY AWAY TO NON BRITISH , IT CERTAINLY HAS NOT HELPED . WE OLD FOLK DESERVE MORE IN OUR REMAINING YEARS. IT IS OUR HUMAN RIGHT , OR DOES THAT NOT APPLY TO US.",
