They are unable to work and liable to be detained at any time. We call on the British Government to pass new legislation which acknowledges and defines statelessness in various forms and has clear systems of protection for stateless people. This includes granting leave to remain immediately, for people who are returned to their country and refused entry, and after 6 months, if the Home Office has been unable to obtain effective entry papers for people it intends to return.",
