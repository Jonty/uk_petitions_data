            "background": "Each year, a large amount of money is spent printing literature bi-lingualy. Welsh speakers will not read the English version and English speakers will not read the Welsh.\n\nWhen completing any application form (council tax, road tax, banks, etc.) a simple tick box could be added to the form, allowing the applicant to nominate the language they would like to be written to in. \n\nThis would enforce an individual's right to use the language they prefer and organisations would know what volumes of leaflets, etc. need to be printed in each language.\n\n\nThe benefits would be:\n\n\n- A focussed langage policy\n\n- Reduced printing costs\n\n- Reduced amount of paper used\n\n- Lower energy costs\n\n- Lower C02 emissions\n\n\n** The aim of this petition is to enforce a person's right to use the language they prefer - it is not intended to be an \"anti-Welsh\" or \"anti-English\" campaign **",
