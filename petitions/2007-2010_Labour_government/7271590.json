        "background": "Workers in the UK work the longest hours in Europe, and the UK is the only EU country that allows staff to opt out of the 48-hour limit set by the Working Time Directive. A number of surveys suggests that the number of people working more than 48 hours a week has increased in the last decade. \nOne in six workers now work over 60 hours a week, up from one out of eight just two years ago. A survey conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry's Work-life Balance Campaign and Management Today magazine, illustrates the link between long hours and stress, showing that almost a third (29%) of employees with high stress levels work more than 10 hours over their contractual hours every week. And seven out of 10 highly stressed workers do not have access to any formal flexible working practices.\n\nSource: Unison web site",
