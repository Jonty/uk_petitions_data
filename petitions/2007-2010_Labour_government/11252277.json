I have just received my post split & torn, damaged, and very wet. Please Mr Brown, save our mail service and our post offices, by returning them to the national status they never should have been taken from. Privatisation will destroy it. Ensure their staff are not overstretched as current news implies, and not given rounds to complete in impossible time scales. Save our postman!",
