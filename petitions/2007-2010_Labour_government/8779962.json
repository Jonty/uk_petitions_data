            "background": "Doonies Farm Aberdeen is a rare breed\u2019s farm and model farm at the village of Cove just outside, Aberdeen, Scotland. Doonies Farm is the home to the largest collection of rare breeds of sheep, goats and cows within Scotland and works with the Rare Breed Survival Trust (RBST) to preserve many rare breeds such as the Gloucester and White Park cow and bull. Doonies Farm breeds their livestock to either keep at the farm or sell throughout the United Kingdom so that farmers can continue to breed from the rare stock.\nThis wonderful farm gives children the chance to feed and handle a wide range of animals from lambs, pigs, horses, goats, ducks, chickens and even large cows.\nChildren are even allowed to bottle feed calves and lambs.\nThe delight on children\u2019s faces when visiting this traditional hand\u2019s on Scottish farm is a joy to behold.\n Please help fight this closure and keep our children happy, while at the same time preserving a farm that nurtures and protects our traditional farming heritage.",
