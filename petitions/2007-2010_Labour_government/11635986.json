            "background": "I propose that the 'Life in the UK' culture test, required to be passed by those applying for indefinite leave to remain in the UK, or those seeking British citizenship, should be abandoned. It is not successful in testing a person's knowledge about life in the UK and tests irrelevant information. Providing evidence of work, study or active community life in the UK should be enough to show that a person is able to adapt to, live in and contribute to our society. A multiple choice exam that tests artificial knowledge and cannot even be passed by the majority of the British population serves no purpose but to limit the number of people able to receive their required visa status.",
