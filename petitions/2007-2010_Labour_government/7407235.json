        "background": "UNECE has done a study that proves that a flashing red brake light can cause Photo Sensitive Epilepsy if operated for more than 2 seconds. As cyclists use a flashing red light for far longer, this can cause drivers to have a PSE episode. Research needs to be instigated into the effects of a flashing red light as the primary rear light source on cycles before someone gets killed. If this is proven to be true then the Lighting Regulations need to be changed to remove the flashing red rear light.",
