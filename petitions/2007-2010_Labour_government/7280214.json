        "action": "Make white crossover or 'H' lines enforcable",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently, local authorities will charge to provide white crossover or 'H' lines to indicate that a driveway into private property must be left clear for access/egress. The current legislation is that such markings are only advisory and not enforceable. The rising demand for parking of private cars in residential areas has lead to increased complaints from residents who have paid for such markings and find that motorists simply ignore them.  This leads to difficult and chronic problems for such residents when accessing and leaving their property. We, the undersigned, ask that parking on crossover lines should be designated as a traffic offence on a par with parking on double-yellow lines and that the appropriate authorities (police and local government) be given powers to issue parking tickets for this offence.",
