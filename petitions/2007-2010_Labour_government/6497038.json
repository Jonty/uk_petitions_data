            "background": "Recent changes to the penalties issued for non-driving offences including failure to identify the driver in an alleged speeding  offence have resulted in higher potential penalties for this non driving offence. A keeper of a shared car or company car would only need two incidences to be banned from driving despite not having committed, or even being accused, of a driving offence. There are many reasons including registration cloning that a keeper may not know who committed the alleged offence, or the car may have been loaned and under the care of multiple people at the time, or the keeper just may not remember. This review was conducted with consultation road safety lobbiests and victims of road traffic collisions and their families, hardly an independant or balanced review. It is time the motorists who contribute to the public purse through taxes on purchase of cars and running thereof were treated with the same \"Innocent until proven guilty\" rights as anyone accused of any other offence and not seen as a target for quick conviction rate results and revenue raising fines.",
