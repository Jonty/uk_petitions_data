        "background": "I agree with GB position in relation to the unit cost for alcohol as I believe that whatever the cost there will always be abusers and that there are other measures which can be taken to reduce alcohol intake nationally.\n\nFor example I have recently got over an alcohol problem with drugs prescribed by the doc.  Whilst recovering I noticed that alcohol in my local supermarket was at the end of almost every aisle creating temptation.  Why can this not just be limited to one place so that it - and temptation - can be avoided?  Similar laws exist for gambling EG in amusement arcades areas are cordoned off for over 18's only for those machines with higher payouts which attract the more serious gambler.\n\nanyone else agree?",
