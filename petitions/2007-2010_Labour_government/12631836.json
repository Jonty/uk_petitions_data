Journalists are not allowed to enter the zone. \nTamils moved to the Srilankan control area are treated like politicians and kept in camps against their will. Please put pressure on Srilanka to release them all. \nFailure of their governments to act sooner will lead to an \"inevitable\" slaughter of civilians.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n\n\nTamil Diaspora",
