            "background": "We are calling for the Government to legislate to set a minimum price for the sale of a unit of alcohol at around 40p-50p, to prevent alcohol being sold for pocket-money prices.\n\nEvidence collected by the British Liver Trust in a snapshot survey in February demonstrates that a harmful binge drink can be bought for less than the cost of a sandwich. \n\nThe evidence is clear that the cost of alcohol has an impact on consumption. Cost particularly affects the youngest and heaviest drinkers, who are most at risk of health damage. \n\nA minimum price for a unit of alcohol would have little or no effect on most social drinkers who drink in moderation and who generally pay considerably more than this minimum for their favourite tipple.\n\n\t\t\t\nAlcohol costs the NHS \u00a31.7 billion a year and four people every hour are admitted to hospital with alcoholic liver disease. Liver disease is now the fifth biggest killer in the UK and the only one out of the five that is on the rise.",
