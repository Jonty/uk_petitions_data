Like all small individual HMRC offices facing the threat of closure, we have a highly skilled and experienced workforce, most of whom have worked loyally for HMRC for many years.  HMRC has plently of work to go around, we know that.  We also know that the staff in Perth, and other similar locations are ready and more than able to do that work, professionally and productively.  Please sign up to this petition and support the campaign to keep local offices, and save local jobs.",
