            "background": "i am shocked by reports in the news not only about minister expenses and the refusal of mr brown 'the unelected' to give us our voice in what is preached to be a democracy. now we have the US placing ex detainees from Guantanamo in bermuda. my petition isn\u2019t about if these people are guilty, it\u2019s to do with the lack of power, conviction and courage from this government that once made this country great. stand up and tell the u.s that these are our lands, the lands of Britain. You don\u2019t seem bothered by the impact it has on how we feel as britains. We\u2019re proud to be british, we love this country. stand up and show us we won\u2019t allow any country to make decisions on our behalf and dont blame Bermuda. make us remember and feel how great we are again. all you do is make a shambles of our national identity, our freedom to elect and it\u2019s a disgrace. this petition is to show we\u2019re tired and ask you as the public of these great lands that you don\u2019t just make a \u2019small\u2019 complaint to the u.s for this but make it known on the international stage, that we wont be walked on and our sovereignty  is ours! dont go on x factor to show people you are a peoples person. This is what people want. be a real leader",
