            "background": "We as a history class in Wales have decided that the word clapter should be a real word. This came about because we thought that in the sentence \"the room was filled with laughter\" there should be an equivalent for clapping e.g, \"the room was filled with clapter\". After taking it upon myself to research the word I could not find any definition in the dictionary but I did find a reference to the word 'clapter' in a book written by Amanda Filipacchi in her novel written in 1993 called 'Nude Men'.\n(This wasn't part of our history class) My history teacher did agree and many of my friends that this should be a word and i have no made it my life time goal to make this word official.",
