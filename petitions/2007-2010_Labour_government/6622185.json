            "background": "Indonesian Palm Oil is becoming the bane of the biodiesel industry due to its net carbon emissions caused by deforestation. \n\nIndonesian Palm is damaging the UK public into thinking that all biodiesel is harmful - because of one of many feedstocks, Palm. \n\nIf a levy was put onto the import of Palm Oil, the biofuels industry would have to use renewable feedstocks with a more viable financial margin and the RTFO would become viable as an environmental proposal. \n\nIt would also be favourable if the govt. would allocate the funds raised by such taxation to research and development of future fuel supplies from environmentally friendly and finacially viable fuel sources.",
