        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is abdundantly clear that the cost of living has risen alarmingly in the past 12 months - despite the government figures showing inflation running at around 2.5%.  Many individuals are on fixed incomes and are already struggling to meet the cost of price increases in gas and electricity - never mind council tax and food bills.  The reality for most people outside major cities is that public transport is inadequate and we are all forced to rely on our cars.  The proposed tax increase (at a time when government tax receipts from higher oil prices) is totally unnecessary and should be scrapped.  If it goes ahead then it will create increased worry and misery for thousands of people and will show yet again that our government is deaf to the real and valid concerns of the population of the UK",
