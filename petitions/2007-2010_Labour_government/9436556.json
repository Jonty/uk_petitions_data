        "background": "I petition the Prime minister to abolish the absurd rule that all children over the age of 12 are in most cases charged as adults for holidays, entry to theme parks, zoos and other educational or recreational establishments. The Prime Minister should stop all UK registered companies from exploiting this as an easy way to make money as children over 12 are not legally adults so why should they pay adult prices. This should not reflect on adult prices and would result in the lower income families actually having the funds to take children on trips and outings that they might actually benefit from both socially and educationally.",
