            "background": "Ensure that the consultation to be launched this summer by The Energy & Climate Change Dept does not include consideration of imposing a levy on users of Oil & LPG for heating.Most users of these fuels do so because there is no other alternative and are in the main rural dwellers who are already paying higher charges for these fuels and other services. This would amount to a further stealth tax directed at this portion of the the population and is totally unacceptable and inequitable",
