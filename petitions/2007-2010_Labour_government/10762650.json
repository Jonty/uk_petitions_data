            "background": "We the Undersigned of the petition are not happy that the age limit of 16-18 means that males/females cant do what they really want to do if they realise too late what they want to do. So if your 19/20 you miss out! but if you start your apprenticeship at 18 and it lasts 3 years then that means you finish at 21 so what is the problem starting an apprenticeship at 19/20 or older! your never too old to learn something new!!",
