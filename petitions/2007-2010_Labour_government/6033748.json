            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Congestion of infrastructure is achieved by limiting holiday dates by means of universal school term or factory closure dates. This system was originally designed thus to boost revenue for establishment businesses, like travel & leisure companies. If schools were open all year round they could accommodate more students without increasing congestion. Teachers could also be better paid without incurring any true cost.\nSchools could have two timetable groups using an alternate fortnightly attendance. That is children would attend school every other fortnight (for one fortnight).\n\nFamily holidays and public & private amenities demand would be more evenly spread over the whole year. This would create less congested useage without artificially inflated peak time prices.",
