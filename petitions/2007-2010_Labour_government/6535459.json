            "background": "People who have been raped don't have many options.  Counselling through GPs or through Rape Crisis is slow because it is under funded.  Rape is alarmingly common, it is reported 12,000 times a year; it has been estimated that up to 1 in 4 women have experienced rape or attempted rape (source; rape crisis).  It causes severe emotional turmoil and in many cases triggers mental illness affecting relationships, work and suicide risk.  Symptoms e.g. PTSD or depression may not appear until months or years afterwards when the limited help available may have stopped.\n\nIsn't it time that help was available quickly through the NHS quickly for all rape victims regardless on how long ago the rape occurred?  Currently N.I.C.E. has no guidelines on treating people who have been raped when due to the variety of conditions which can result; a coherent strategy would show commitment.  The only option for many now is rape crisis; however, many centres face closure or have closed due to lack of funding.",
