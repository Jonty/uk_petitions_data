There are some prices for oil and gas that are just not worth paying and this is one of them.  Once the East Coast Bottle-nosed dolphins are extinct it will be for ever.\n\nThe Prime Minister should take all steps to protect this intelligent and attractive animal that also swims off his constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.",
