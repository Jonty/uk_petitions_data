            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, pupils considered to be in a more wealthy family are being discriminated against with the EMA system. Poorer pupils are getting \u00a330, of which they end up spending completely, resulting in having no money each week anyway.\n\nThe pay scale should be scrapped and all who have a household income of under \u00a335,000 should be awarded \u00a330 a week WITH the bonuses that are currently available. This makes the system much fairer and more open.\n\nI hope you can support this petition and make it go somewhere, it will make a difference.",
