            "action": "ease motorway congestion by means of a solid white line between lanes 1 and 2 (for half a mile) to prevent slow merging traffic from pulling directly into lane 2 (or even 3) of the main carriageway before getting up to motorway speed.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A prime example of this is at the Stevenage South junction of the A1(M) London bound.  At peak times, cars pulling directly into lane 2 of a two lane carriageway before getting up to motorway speed, slow the natural flow of lane 2 with a domino effect of brake lights causing 5 mile tailbacks in both lanes, this then impedes traffic filtering onto the carriageway, grinding everything to a halt.\n\nIf cars were prevented from pulling out of lane 1 for a half mile stretch, I believe this would dramatically reduce the bottle neck, speed would be maintained as cars after that point would be more inclined to allow people to pull out in front of them thus keeping the flow of traffic at a sensible speed.\n\nThis is a cheap and simple trial to implement (a single solid white line). \nPotential to extend nationally.\nIt will reduce CO2 emissions as flowing traffic is at its most efficient.\nEase congestion at bottleneck junctions.",
