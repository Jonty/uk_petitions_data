            "background": "I am sick of the councils saying that if you are not pregnant, an alcoholic or drug addict then the council cannot help house you! What message is this giving young people? The council has stated to me that it is government policy for local councils to house people who fall into the three categories mentioned above along with foriegners. So why would the british government refuse to give priority to law abiding british citizens? Something has to give or the British people will have nothing!\n I am 22 years old and I am homeless. I was informed by my local council that although I suffer from depression, they are under no obligation to house me as I would cope being on the streets and that I am not vulnerable. What ever happened to the great British society that everyone was proud of once upon a time?!",
