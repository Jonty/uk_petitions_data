She retains a ship (the Ross Revenge), capable of being refitted for broadcasting.\nThe granting of an offshore broadcasting licence would recognise her popularity, and undo the injustice of a heavy handed government attitude in the 1960's.\nThis country urgently needs a \"feel-good factor\", and the granting of this licence would instantly provide one.",
