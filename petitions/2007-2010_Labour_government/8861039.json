            "background": "In 18 days time, Canada will begin its barbaric seal hunt, killing thousands of baby Harp seals in the most cruel and appalling way. These baby seals are either clubbed or shot, many not to death but severely injured, before being dragged across the ice and dumped in boats to die in agony.\nThese beautiful, gentle creatures are killed for their fur. It is now known that they do not deplete the fishing stock and because of climate change their habitat is being affected. Why then would Canada even allow such a henious crime to continue. I emplore the Government to ban all trade in Seal products in Europe in order to reduce the income gained from this horrific practice. As civilised human being, we should find such cruelty totally and utterly unacceptable. It should end and end NOW.",
