At least 12 in the next two years.  \nThis is contrary to the wishes of Iranian legislators and Iran's international commitments.\nIn 2003 the Iranian parliament voted to abolish the death penalty for under 18s but this was overturned by the Council of Guardians as being contrary 'to Islamic purity' which sets minimum execution ages at 13 for boys and nine for girls.\nIran is also party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which forbids any death sentence on those who were under 18 when the offence happened.",
