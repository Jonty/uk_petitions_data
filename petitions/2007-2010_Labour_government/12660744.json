        "background": "From the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs:\n\n\"On 3rd March 2008 European Council responded to concerns over the illicit misuse of the stimulant drug BZP (Benzylpiperazine) by subjecting it to \u2018control measures and criminal provisions\u2019 across the EU Member States. As an EU Member State the UK must, within one year put in place measures to submit BZP to; control measures proportionate to the risks posed by the substance and criminal penalties in keeping with its national laws.\"\n\nAfter many millions of doses consumed worldwide, two deaths have been officially recorded in correlation with the use of BZP, although no causal relationship has been proven. (Balmelli C et al 2001)\n\nOn this basis there is no justification for banning this drug. It will be yet another harmless drug driven underground where it will be controlled and adulterated by criminals. This will result in deaths - a bizarre logic.\n\nKeep it safe, keep it legal.",
