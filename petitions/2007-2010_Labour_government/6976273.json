            "background": "Children with conditions such as ADHD and dyslexia are being labelled as \"distruptive\" in the classroom (which I have witnessed in Primary schools) and are being made to stand outside the classroom, hence missing out on vital education.  This I believe is due to lack of specialised trained teachers within the classroom and the government should give more funding to schools to allow teachers to be better trained and increase the number of helpers in each class.",
