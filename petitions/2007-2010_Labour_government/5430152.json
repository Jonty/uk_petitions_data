            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is without debate that speed is one of the major factors in all fatal accidents in Great Britain.\nThe recent adverts of a child being hit at 30mph having an 80% greater chance of survival, are really compelling.\nIt must also be acknowledged, that the change in policy toward the high visibility of fixed enforcement cameras has made a major impact to road safety.\nRoad users are now able to observe fixed cameras in advance and adjust their speed if required. This removes the prospect of a conviction whilst also providing greater safety with enforced speed reductions.\nIt is the lack of visibility of mobile enforcement cameras, that make their purpose completely ineffective as a speed reduction measure.\nTheir use does nothing to address the speed of the motorist, as most have no idea that they have broken the law until they receive a fixed penalty notice.\nI ask of this \u201cNew Government\u201d, to address this issue as a matter of urgency.\nMake it a requirement of all cameras both fixed and mobile to have pre-warning signs with high visibility markings for the cameras themselves.\nProve to the general public that all enforcement cameras are truly sited for safety.",
