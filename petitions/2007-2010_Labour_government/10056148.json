Why must governments push ahead with a treaty/constitution that the people, when given the choice, clearly do not want. If our own governments cannot speak for what the people want, we certainly don't want to give up any of the decision making to un-elected european 'presidents' etc listen to the poeple even less. Either scrap it all together or give us our say (referendum).",
