            "background": "I was told recently in order for a person who is working part time to qualify for governemnt funding to upgrade his skills for a job he has applyed for he has to lose his part time job. I feel this is simply stupid as the people who have the best chance of getting a full time job are those in part time employment and so they should get funding to upgrade there skill in order to obtain those full time jobs. These people are bearly surviving on the part time wage they get they dont have the money to pay for training. all they ask is when they apply for a job where they have a skills gap you the government pay the employers to train them and help fill the skills gap.Even if people know they are about to lose there jobs and are looking for work they are told they dont qualify.",
