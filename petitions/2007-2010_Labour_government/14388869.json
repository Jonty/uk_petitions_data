            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This is a system so wrong it is verging on being criminal in itself as since the dissolvation of the over-riding body that trainee psychologists were answerable to they now answer to no-one, therefore they are making an awful lot of wrong decisions affecting many peoples lives for many years in some cases the rest of their lives. They have neither the experience or accrued enough knowledge to do this safely or fairly on their own resulting in an awful lot of unjust decisions which are based on a bare minimum contact with said person of a case on average amounting to 20-30 minutes a week and quite often less than that, upon that basis they can give their opinion and over-ride the reports from many more knowledgable people therefore keeping the prisons overcrowded with people that should now not be in the system, this also places a further unnecessary burden on the taxpayers. This system must be ammended for the sake of everybody wether inside the prison system or out of it, it affects us all.",
