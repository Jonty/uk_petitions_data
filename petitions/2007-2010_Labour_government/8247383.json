            "background": "There are so many more accurate measures of human intelligence and mental maturity, why must we settle for the crudest? Why could we not allow mentally healthy people to make up their own minds on whether to watch a film or not? Could we not conduct some kind of simple mental test to ensure that the audience won't emulate the actions they see in media? I propose the abolition of film certificates, just as all forms of censorship are wrong, for a more accurate (and fair) way of defining mental maturity.",
