            "background": "The proximity of the war memorial in Cannock like many town centre memorials is surrounded by or very close to retail outlets. In years gone by these were not open on any Sunday but now most are. During the service on Sunday 11.11.07 there were people walkng to and from shops carrying items and effectively disrupting the peace of the service for those who want to remember. Surely one sunday in the year could be set aside from 'retail therapy' and given over the honouring the dead of two wars + current and more recent conflicts who gave their lives for us to be able to go shopping on the remaining Sundays throughout the year.",
