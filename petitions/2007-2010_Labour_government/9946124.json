            "background": "At present, all under 18s are allowed in pub-style restaurants if they are accompanied by their parents. Parents who take their children to such restaurants can easy become stressed if their children 'play up,' thus making the environment more stressful for other customers. Some parents may even hit their children if it all becomes too much, which can also make the atmosphere more unpleasant.\n\nIf all under 14s could be banned from all Harvester, JD Wetherspoon, Brewer's Fayre, Toby Carvery and Beefeater chain restaurants, then it would give parents and other customers a more relaxed experience. \n\nCustomers between the ages of 14 and 17 should be accompanied by an adult when attending those restaurants.",
