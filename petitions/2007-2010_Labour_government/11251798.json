        "background": "I, as many people do, want to see the death penalty brought back for Terrorists and murderers.\nAnyone taking a life using knives, guns ect ect should pay for their crime with their own life. Or, if they are given a LIFE sentence, it should mean exactly that, LIFE!!!\nWhy should they get light sentences and then relaesed early and put back onto our streets.\nThis countries law makers need to wake up and smell the coffee.\nThe law seems to always side with the criminals and their families, rather than with the victims and their families.\nThis country is total disgrace, and we, the everyday people of this country should take a stand and get the politicians to work for us for a change, afterall, its what they are supposedly elected to do.\nAbolish human rights for these murderers, afterall, they are not human, they are evil scum.",
