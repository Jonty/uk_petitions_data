As we research the professional development of critical global citizenship, and an education to equip our youth for deliberative democracy, we appreciate the principles reflected in the Prime Minister's life and work. We also regret the way the media and current consumer culture has forced the Prime Minister to respond to less worthy criteria for public approval, narrow interests, and short-term success.",
