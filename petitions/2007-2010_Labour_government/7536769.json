Also people on benefits for depression should get monitored more often. Someone has been on benefits for 11 years for depression due to a member of a boyband leaving. I understand that depression is an illness, but needs to be more regulated. Also have known people on benefits for depression and have been on holiday, done rock climbing. If having depression, this is the last thing you do. I had depression myself and could not face going outside.",
