            "background": "Power generating companies were given free permits for their CO2 emissions. Now airlines are to be given free permits. In other words, they will not pay a penny for the pollution they create. Yet they will pass the full cost on to their passengers, and gain twice financially.\nBoth power generators and airlines are in a win-win situation: get free permits and charge their customers and passengers for something they already received for free.\nMake industry pay for their share in pollution of CO2 and other emissions.",
