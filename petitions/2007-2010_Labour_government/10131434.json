        "background": "I write to voice the concerns of very many parents, teachers and local residents and councillors that the proposed amalgamation of Summerhill Infants and Junior Schools would be inappropriate and detrimental to both the well-being of all who attend these schools, and the maintenance of the high standards of attainment Summerhill has achieved.  Furthermore,we feel that the existing smaller educational settings enable staff to better support our children's learning and holistic development as confident and creative individuals.",
