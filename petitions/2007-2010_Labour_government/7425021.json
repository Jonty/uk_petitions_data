I conducted an informal survey in my area and all but 1 said they would GIVE UP there car if public transport was priced between 20 and 50 pence. The volume of people using such a service would mean it would probably break even or at least increase the till box recovery to a much higher extent. If profit was generated why not use it to built light rail systema? You cant tax people off the roads without providing a realistic alternative.",
