            "background": "Ten percent of all CO2 emissions in the West are the by-product of creating food that never gets eaten. The supermarkets play a massive role in this wastage, and if we are serious about meeting our emissions targets, they need to stop passing food waste up to suppliers and down to consumers. An ombudsman would help to achieve that goal.",
