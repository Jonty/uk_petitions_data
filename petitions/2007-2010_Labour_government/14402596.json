            "background": "Riders of quad bikes, buggies etc that have a class of PLG, (private light goods), and are treated in the same way as cars should not pay for road tax because of the vehicles low emissions.\n\nQuad bikes, Buggies etc that have to pay the same rate as a car should be treated in exactly the same way as a car, for example, if a car produces up to 100 grams/KM then they are exempt from pay road tax, therefore, Quad Bikes, Buggies etc falls into this category, they produce well below 100g/km and therefore should be treated in exactly the same way as a car would, in that they should not pay for road tax.  In my humble opinion the government cannot have their cake and eat it, either put Quad Bikes, Buggies etc under a different class or treat them in exactly the same way as a car, after all, we as riders are doing our bit for the environment by riding a vehicle that produces low CO2 emissions.\n\nI would like for the Prime Minister to seriously look into this for us, we as riders are having to save money by riding a vehicle that is cheap to run but paying top road tax is extremely unfair.",
