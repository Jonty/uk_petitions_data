        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe the word 'Disabled' is offensive and demeaning and has no place in society. By it's very nature it implies that a 'disabled' person is less able than a 'enabled' person to carry out a task. Surely it also depends on the task. One of the meanings in The Oxford dictionary is \"a disadvantage or handicap.\" Who is to say that the  'disadvantage' is not a advantage to society? Every person has something unique to contribute to society. By applying legislation to ban the use of the word 'disabled' and use 'diffabled' (ie 'differently-abled\") in it's place it may help people to view others positively and more inclusively. It may also empower the people with the diffability  ,who see it as a disadvantage, to change their view and thus lead them to a more fulfilling, positive and equal view of life. It's time to change the PERCEPTION.",
