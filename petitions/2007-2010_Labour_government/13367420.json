        "background": "With the UK having record levels of debt and that debt being passed on to our children and the ever decreasing level of social standards. It is now the case that the cost to the tax payer to pay for all those people on benefits costs more than all the money taken in by income tax \u00a3172 Billion. It seems to be a far to easy option these days to leave school get pregnant get pushed to the top of the housing list and start your life of sponging off the state to pay for all your needs fags, booze, sky tv, and all those other nice things we as tax payers have had to cut back on. It seems to be common that you will find that this is a choice of lifestyle taken by some people and is also often adopted by all generations following in that family as they dont know better. So my idea is to replace the cash used to buy all these things which make it comfortable to be on benefits, with living vouchers. At the same time I am aware that some are not on benefits by choice and where thats the case maybe this would not suit but would still need to be looked at. Its time that the taxpayer got the better deal and the correction in direction of the slipping social standards was addressed and reversed.",
