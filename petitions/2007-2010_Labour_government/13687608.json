            "action": "reverse the cherry-picking of Royal Mail's business by commercial competitors & thus allow Royal Mail to establish the modernised nationwide delivery network for letters and small packets that the country requires - a modern workable franchise whcih is neither some archaic monopoly nor some free-market nonsense.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As long as Royal Mail delivers nationwide daily to all UK addresses it will remain a labour-intensive business. Commercial competitors snapping up the profitable corners of Royal Mail's business is presently forcing Royal Mail to rapidly modernise its business in the hope that profitability and government goodwill can be sustained. In this rush to reform and in the face of an uncertain future, Royal Mail is overloading its managemental capabilities and also losing its major asset \u2013 the goodwill of its workforce. Fair competition requires level playing fields. Shed of its most fertile areas of operation, Royal Mail is operating on a cliff edge. If the future is free market competition, suburban back-streets and remote farmhouses will no longer get mail delivered. To prevent such a future Royal Mail requires a workable defined franchise on which to build its business models, on which to manage a sustainable and profitable future and on which to re-build the good faith of its workforce.",
