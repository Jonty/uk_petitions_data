            "background": "Anyone going from College back into college and have EMA do you believe they should give us some sort of money during the holidays? There are no jobs going for part time students\nI Know EMA is for college stuff, but we all must admit we dont spend \u00a330 a week on pens + Paper!\nI Think if people who are being paid for unemployment then why cant students get a certain grant for the summer holidays... we need to live too\n\nExample - I Cant go into a full time job (9-5) because when september comes il have to quit that job because the college course would be too much with a job.  Yes i know years ago there wasnt EMA but not all parents can afford to give their children money each week for personal use.\neven if it isnt EMA just some other student funding for holidays\nthere are thousands out there recieving EMA and the goverment cant afford it, well why not stop the people who are too lazy to get a job and only give money to the people who are unemployed because of the credit crunch problems lately.. and give the money to those who are gaining education for jobs",
