            "background": "When two transgendered girls came out and went to school as girls, it caused a transphobic backlash when the parents called the tabloids after hearing that one of their schoolmates came to school as girls instead of the obvious move of calling the school. \n\nThe tabloids published frank lies like they were going to be the 'youngest people to have a sex change' and the girls then received massive transphobic abuse from all and eventually and to flee their homes.\n\nWe, the undersigned would like an inquiry on how two transgendered girls has their lives ruined because of bigoted parents and a sensationalist, shock hungry press and whether or not a large part of the mainstream media lean towards a transphobic viewpoint where transgendered issues are concerned",
