            "background": "Once again this government is out to close another service in its town and villages, with the so called introduction of about 250 polyclincs in england, these will contain up to 25 Gp`s and will also take away much needed funds to support local Gp`s.\nThis will also take away the built up trust, respect and personal relationship people have with there Gp. With the new clinics you may not see the same Gp twice. So if you want to put a stop to this Governments crazy plan for these so called polyclinics. please sign to put pressure on the government.",
