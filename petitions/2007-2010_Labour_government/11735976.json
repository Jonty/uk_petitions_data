        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Since the economic downturn has begun interest rates have been  cut time and time again by the Bank of England. Though this has helped borrowers keep up with payments and put more money into their pockets at a time when most people could do with a little extra cash the low interest rate has penalised savers. The government should introduce legislation to create a second interest rate just for savers for the duration of the economic downturn. This new rate should be, by law, above 7%. This will not only provide more money for savers and reward those who have been prudent but it will help businesses who have put money away as well. The banks the government own should be forced to provide this special rate in its full extent.",
