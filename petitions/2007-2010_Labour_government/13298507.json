They are trying to run a seven day service on goodwill only, and their removal of the short term double time payment for working on a Sunday has made the situation plain ; they cannot run a full seven day service.\n\nThe signatories urge the government to remove this firm and instate one that is able to sgree to deliver a full service.",
