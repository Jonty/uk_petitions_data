            "background": "I feel it is unsuitable to sell high caffeine drinks to children aged under 16 years of age, even the manufacturers put 'not suitable for children' on their packaging, but yet there's no law restricting it's sale. Working in a senior school I see the negative affect it has on children who, as young as 11 are openly sold it in leading supermarkets, many of whom have their own made brands - often on offer for less than \u00a31 per litre - no wonder the children consider it as 'pop' when it's cheaper than healthier drinks.\nI feel that behaviour standards in many schools would improve if the sale of such drinks was restricted.",
