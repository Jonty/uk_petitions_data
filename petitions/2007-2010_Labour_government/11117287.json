Justice MUST be done for this poor child and for thousands of others like him.\nHis killers must be kept in prison for a very long time. No time off for good behaviour, no time out early because of time spent on remand. We ALL want justice for this little boy. You prime minister have the power to ensure that this is done. Do the right thing. Get justice for this little boy. Keep his evil killers locked away in prison.",
