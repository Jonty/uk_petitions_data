            "background": "South Africa is the key to toppling the murderous house of cards that is Robert Mugabe's dictatorship.\n  Without trade from South Africa, without finance from its banks, without arms, Mugabe would surely fall.   \n South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki has refused to even criticise Robert Mugabe but the ruling ANC and trade unions have urged him to take a stronger line.\n   Britain would never impose an embargo on South Africa but if enough people sign this petition, perhaps South Africa might take notice.",
