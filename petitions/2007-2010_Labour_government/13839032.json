        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Professor David Nutt has criticised the reclassification of cannabis from Class C to Class B, accusing ministers of devaluing and distorting evidence and has said drugs classification was being politicised. These are valid criticisms, and reflect the views of many, if not most, people who have read the available research on cannabis. The sacking of Professor Nutt confirms that the government cannot abide dissenting voices or an open debate on the effects of drugs, instead opting for a dangerously propagandist and anti-scientific approach based on archaic moral arguments. Professor Nutt must be restored to his previous role, and be allowed to make his views known in order to encourage genuine debate and understanding on this topic.",
