The lilly livered liberal stance taken to date, clearly does not work, so it is time to put in place a proper deterrent that will scare these cowardly thugs back into line. The birch should be the penalty for any crime, starting at ABH working through to murder. These young thugs need to know some real pain, and then add on top a significant jail term. The death of the gentleman in Warrington should be a watermark for handling these young lunatics!",
