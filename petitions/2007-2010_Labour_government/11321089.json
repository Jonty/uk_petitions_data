Another example is that all Scotish patients receive their prescriptions free.\n\nThe reality is that we have a Welsh Heath Service, a Scottish Health Service and an English Health Service.  Each has separate budgets, management and levels of service.\n\nWe should no longer live under the illusion that the UK has a national level of healthcare provision and now is the time for the Government to recognise this by introducing the new names.",
