        "background": "As reported in the Daily Mail in January 2009, the two children of a recovering drug addict were offered a home by the mother's parents - the children's grandparents. Social services in Edinburgh rejected this offer, claiming that the parents were too old (59 ad 46) and too ill (though not too ill to work as a farm labourer!). Instead the children were given to a homosexual couple to adopt, despite objections from the mother, the grandparents, and the children themselves (the little girl is nervous of men). It is hard to characterise this decision as anything other than perverse and evil.",
