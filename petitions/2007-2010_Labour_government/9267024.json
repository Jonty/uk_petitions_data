If the pensioners get \u00a35.00 then the disabled get only \u00a32.50 Even when the pensioners got only .80p a few years ago the disabled only got .55p that same year. Many pensioners can get out of their homes saving fuel bills, the disabled cannot always do this yet they do not get the fuel allowance.",
