            "background": "Recent announcements made by the PM have mentioned the gold plated pensions of MP's with a view to make them more acceptable in the current economic climate. I would like to petition No 10 that a radical change in the direct taxation structure be made for pensioners to affect all pension income. Firstly I would like to see all the demeaning top up benefits dropped and the basic state pension doubled to at least \u00a310k per year. Next I would like to see the non taxable level of pensions raised to \u00a315k which I believe is a realistic level required for a minimum standard of living. The actual taxation levels proposed would be as follows. Pension income for \u00a315k - \u00a320k taxed at 10%, \u00a320k - \u00a330k taxed at 22% and \u00a330k to \u00a340k at 40%. From \u00a340k to \u00a3100k income tax would rise exponentially to a maximum of 95% where it would stay for pensions in excess of this amount. These changes would address all pensioners life styles, it will be self funding & address's the current pension apartheid.",
