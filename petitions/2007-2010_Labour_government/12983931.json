            "background": "1.The IDI is contradicting The British Nationality Act 1981 - Case working Instructions Chapter 18 Annex \u2018B\u2019 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 C.  The British Nationality Act 1981 contemplates absences totaling 480 to be normally disregarded for the purposes of Naturalization.\n\n2.HO should extend same policy to all which applied to Investors and private servants.  HO accepted 25% absence will be tolerated and did not break continuity of residence. Refer pages 438 & 439 of JCWI refugee Law Handbook.  HO undertook to publish revised guidelines.\n\n3.Principle of Legitimate Expectation violated.\n\n4.Companies in IT sector send their WP holders in UK on project works abroad continuing to pay salaries in UK.  Denying these WP holders the right and granting the same right to WP holders working on projects in UK for the same company is discriminatory.\n\n5.No uniformity in applying the IDI. Many instances where ILR had been granted to the applicants who were outside of UK on an employment related work for more than 6 months, and many refused unjustifiably.\n\n6.That the emphasis should be \u201cresidence\u201d not \u201cpresence\u201d, while interpreting the IDI.",
