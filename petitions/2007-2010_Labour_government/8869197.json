            "background": "-Perpetuating an underclass by giving people more money to do nothing than they would get working, giving people no incentive to do anything\n\n-Insanely politically correct actions eg. saying that anyone who complains about immigration is a racist while the PC person would never dare to say that an African country could not control it's borders. Also to stop P.C. nonsense like having a women\u2019s minister but not a men's and banning British flags.  \n\n-Having an insane tax system with 100's of different taxes, a complexity which few can understand and a graduated tax system to satisfy the ideological thrust of socialist when a flat rate lower (20%) tax scheme would collect more tax because the wealthy would not bother hiring accountants for various schemes and offshore money.\n\n-Having the police not investigate most crimes, not even bother at all and credit card fraud is a complete free for all. No will to push for more secure credit card/ online environments, yet prosecute people for speeding vigorously because its an easy crime to catch. Having a double standard of law whereby scumbags get away with anything but middle class people would get prosecuted for minor things.",
