        "background": "If a British citizen has been living out of the country, they are required to pay 'overseas' fees in order to attend a British university if they have not been resident back in Britain for 3 years. This is regardless of the amount of tax they or their parents have paid over the years. Meanwhile, students from the EU are entitled to and English university education paying only 'home' rates. It is unfair and prevents British citizens returning with their children, whilst encouraging EU students. Surely we should be encouraging British citizens to return home with their British children..who have not had a say in where their parents lived but wish to study and work in Britain.",
