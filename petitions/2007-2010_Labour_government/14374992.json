            "background": "make people on Jobeekers allowance work for 4 hours per work, doing community service\n\nEvery person who is on Job seekers allowance for longer than 1 month must attend for 4 hours per week to do community service\n\n2 hours spent in an office on a computer, searching for jobs, writing C.V's.\n\n2 Hours spent out in the community, fixing fenches, painting walls,  helping with recycling projects, cleaning parks, helping the elderly, helping their local council with jobs they just dont have the time nor money to do\n\nIn my life I have claimed jobseekers allowance for 2 weeks, it took me nearly 2 months to get, by this time I had a job, but I know of and see people around who since leaving school have either had a few jobs or have never had a job and have always been on jobseekers coz its easy, the service is poor and unacceptable and needs to change",
