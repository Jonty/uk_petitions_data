            "background": "The inflationary booms and the recessionary busts in our economy; the credit crunch are all caused by the nature of our banking system.\n\nBy allowing banks to create credit in a fractional manner, the government allows, even encourages speculative booms which are then followed by the financial collapse of credit as it is consumed by the corresponding debt.\n\nBoth the inflation and deflation are undesirable.\n\nPreventing this is relatively simple. Require banks to hold 100% reserves for all lending. This prevents the creation of new money when loans are created. It prevents credit based inflation. Without inflation, there will be no following deflation.\n\nGrowth can be accommodated through the creation of new currency and held as reserves by the banks.",
