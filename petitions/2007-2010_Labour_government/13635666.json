        "background": "save money, save energy, save the planet\n\nAs energy saving light bulbs can be up to 80% more efficient and still give of the same amount or more light, there is no apposing argument.\n\nmany people were put of years ago when the first energy saving light bulbs took 10 minutes or so to warm up but now they are pretty much instant ( i cant tellthe difference)\n\nAlso energy saving lightbulbs are now availible for any type of fitting and you an get them in the same shape as traditional light bulbs.\n\nAnother advantage is that they last for years meaning you not only save money on energy bills but you need to buy less lightbulbs. \n\nIts such a siumple thing that can make a massive difference and gets us one step closer to tackling climate change.\n\nPlease sign this petition and persuade the goverment to ban traditional earth killing bulbs.",
