            "background": "There is no child care , help or surport for lone parients that wish to studie, ie college or university. There only apears to be fincial surport towards child care cost if ya go to work. But not if you want to studie in order to gain a perfessional career. This seems wrong and unfair. If we had surport for those that want to studie, in the long run the country would benfit from more adults in proffesional careers and less benifit payments would need to be payed out. However if we don't gain surport, ie with child care cost it will put more people off from wanting to studie. More help is needed for lone parients like myself who just want to beable to live a decent life with good prospects. Surely my children deserve that too.",
