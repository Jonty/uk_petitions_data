            "background": "why don't we make all cigarette packets have to be pink, imagine every bloke who smokes having to open a pink box every time he wants a smoke... talk about embarrassing, and this will slowly change the image of smoking to be very uncool, blokes who hundle in groups smoking cancer sticks from bright pink little boxes!\n\nI used to smoke for 8 years but gave up over 9 years ago now, I never wanted to smoke in the first place but a friend got me hooked when I was 16.\n\nIf all packets are bright pink then I would definately never want to start smoking and if I already smoked I'd definately want to quick real fast so should work a treat.\n\nCheers, James Mellor - London",
