            "background": "There are no specific rules only \"guidelines\" as to the positioning and use of speed cameras either mobile or static. These can be ignored enabling \"safety\" camera partnerships to place cameras where they are most likely to catch offenders; such as when speed limits change or on long straight roads and not immediately outside high risk areas such as schools and crossings etc. A set of rules saying how they MUST be used would help restore some trust in their use. Areas such as position, visibility, advance warning signs and use of speed limit signs in the area should be included as well as a standard leniance figure across all police authorities.",
