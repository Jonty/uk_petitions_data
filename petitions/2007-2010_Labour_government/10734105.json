Several innocent people have been killed, churches and service institutions have been burnt, people have fled into the forest fearing for the lives. The law and order situation has broken down since the police seems to be indifferent to the plight of the hapless victims. A statement of concern is critical since there are so many Indians in UK quite concerned about the\nalarming situation that does not seem to come under control",
