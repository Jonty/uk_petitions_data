            "background": "It is of great concern to many people that The Law Society has been asked to look into the financial arrangements of people who decide to live together and choose not to get married. Whilst in theory it is laudable to try to protect everyone in society; the impact on people who are 'happy just as they are' should also be considered. In trying to create new legislation all that will be achieved will be further confusion and resentment. All the necessary  legislation is already in place; children are already catered for within the CSA guidelines and if couples decide to bind themselves together financially, then all they need to do is get married, or formalise the relationship in another way. \nAll that is needed is education, not more and more legislation that meddles with peoples lives and their own personal 'life choices'.\nThere has been mention of possible  'opt-outs' for people who wish to stay as they are, and lets hope if this silly legislation does finally arrive that these 'opt-outs' are watertight. If not then you might just create a society of single people to frightened to 'take the risk!'",
