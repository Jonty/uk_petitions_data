            "background": "Remove expensive beurocracy. Scrap all state pensions, benefits, tax credits, disability benefits, low income family\u2019s student grants etc. Instead a simple weekly payment of eg \u00a3150 to ALL uk residents of 18+ years of age to be funded by the scrapping of the government departments dealing with our over complex national benefits systems and if necessary by increasing the base rate of income tax (come on folks, you\u2019ll be getting \u00a3150 a week of HMGov so you can afford a bit more tax on earned income). This will benefit all by reducing HMGgov complexity and costs, no costly nosing about by benefits staff, workers will be no worse off as they top-up this base income with work, students will have an almost livable income and those with passion (artists, artisans, musicians) will have a stipend to live on while chasing their dream (enhancing cultural life of our great nation). This is not free money for the lazy, this is a simple way to run a welfare state for the good of all.",
