            "background": "John is coach of possibly the worst football side in England - yes even worse than England. Mudford FC are rubbish, have conceded 150+ goals and scored only a handful themselves. BUT they play with passion and energy, and are led by a man who is dedicated to the cause, full of fire and commitment...which is more than the previous England manager can claim. The NEXT England coach MUST have these essential qualities, and the ability to motivate hopeless players....so sign up for John Britain as England manager.",
