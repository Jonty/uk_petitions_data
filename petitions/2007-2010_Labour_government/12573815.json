            "background": "At the moment anyone who needs to buy clothing/shoes which is \"outsize\" are forced to go to \"specialist\" shops (High & Mighty, etc...) These \"specialist\" shops knowing that they are the only place that \"outsize\" people can obtain clothing/shoes in their size add further insult to injury by charging more than the \"normally\" sized item. for example: i take a size 14 shoe. i have to pay a minimum of \u00a370 in a specialist shop whereas a size 12 can be bought at a high street chain that i know for as little as \u00a315. Such profiteering is immoral and should be legislated against",
