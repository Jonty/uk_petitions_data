            "background": "Funds from the Royal Bank of Scotland should not be used to extend credit given to Kop Holdings. Scheduled for July 2009. These loans have been taken out against the future profits of Liverpool FC. We believe that the sheer weight of interest required to service these debts will have a detrimental effect on Liverpool FC's infrastructure, which will in turn reflect in performance and reduction in profits ergo extending the credit is only delaying the inevitable where Liverpool FC will end up going into administration at a point where the overall value of the club will be greatly diminished. The consequences of extending the credit would have a damaging long term effect on Liverpool FC, football in general and the immediate Anfield  community as a whole.",
