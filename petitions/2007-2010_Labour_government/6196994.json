So you check the answer phone or 1571 only to find they haven't so you have no idea who called or what they wanted.\n\nThe same is of course true of calls received on mobile phones as well.\n\nWe petition the prime minister to make it against the law to call someone using a withheld number, and in the case of being diverted to answerphone/voicemail, fail to leave a message clearly identifying who you are and what it is you are calling about and how to call you back",
