            "background": "It's about time this country acknowledges classical music in the same way as other countries. It's shameful the state of concert halls in this country compared with the rest of Europe, America and even the Far East. Musicians are paid a minimal salary in comparison to other countries and it's about time the government did something to bring back culture into this country! We have some of the best orchestras in the world, but when the musicians are being paid about half that of a similar standard European orchestra and a quarter of an American orchestra, I don't see much future for orchestras in this country.",
