            "background": "recognise home care workers as skilled work force within this country. the vast majority are working for private domicilary homecare agencies, have nvq's, fully trained and do a very thankless job. where if they did not, then a vast majority of vulnerable and elderly would no longer be able to stay in their own homes. home care workers are very undervalued and very low paid. pay is usually \u00a35.53 per hour or \u00a33.50 per half hour, they only get paid for the exact hours they do, with no allowances. to get a decent wage, many have to work 50 plus hours per week.\nwe need these very caring, dedicated individuals to be nationally recognised and paid a decent wage.",
