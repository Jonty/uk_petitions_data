            "background": "Local government should not use independant Bailiffs to attempt to recover debt owed to them. The debts are administered in such a way that the companies make money and lie in order to increase revenue. Local government deny responsibility in the debt after it is handed over to a bailiff. Complaints of aggression, degradation and humiliation and threats against the bailiffs are ONLY to be directed at the bailiff agency involved. It seems that this is a case of, the lunatics running the asylumn. Sign this petition to stop government local and central, using bailiffs to recover debt and stop them making money from your misery",
