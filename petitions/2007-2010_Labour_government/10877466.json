            "background": "In 100 years, British people will look at Britain, finally completely concreted over, and will question whether is was really worth it in the end. It's hard enough to imagine the impact that the 3 million new properties will have on our green belts and countryside, but that only takes us up to 2020, at which point the government will then be saying, \"But we need to build another 6 million new houses in order to remain globally competitive\", and again another 20 years later. It is not worth destroying Britain in order to have a few years of being \"globally competitive\". Instead, we need to enjoy what remains of this country. \n\nThe Government must cease its quest to over-populate Britain and remove the need for undesirable new housing developments.",
