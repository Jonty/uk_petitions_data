            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "For too long has Wigan Council decided what happens in Atherton and the surrounding towns of Leigh and Tyldesley, but why is this the case? Atherton may only be approximately 4-5 miles from Wigan but might as well be 400-500 miles away for the things we have in common, which are very few. So I propose Atherton to be able to have its own government in its own town hall which for too long a time has been nothing more than an old building that people pass without a seconds thought because of the lack of power it holds over it's own town, I propose Atherton, Leigh and Tyldesley be allowed to sort out it's own affairs and have nothing more to do with Wigan and what they think is right for us because we all know what is right for us which is being able to sort out our towns's business for the good of it's people, sign the petition and let this situation be resolved once and for all.",
