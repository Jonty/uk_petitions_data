            "background": "Winchester is under imminent threat of massive development.\n    Winchester City Council (WCC) has declared Barton Farm as its\n    \u201cPreferred Options\u201d site for 2,000 houses in its Local\n    Development Framework document. Barton Farm is a green wedge of\n    land on the northern outskirts of Winchester and is integral to\n    Winchester\u2019s unique landscape setting. Ignored by their elected\n    representatives, the people of Winchester have formed the \u201cSave\n    Barton Farm Group\u201d (SBFG) which has rapidly grown into the\n    largest community group in Winchester with 5,000 supporters and\n    growing.The full Council meets to make its final decision on\n    22nd April 2009 \u2013 time is therefore of the essence.  The\n    Council claim Barton Farm is the \u201cleast damaging\u201d option for\n    Winchester. SBFG say that is not good enough \u2013 Winchester\n    deserves the best option not the \u201cleast damaging\u201d. We propose a\n    long-term plan for Winchester to take full advantage of the\n    things that make Winchester special \u2013 its history, culture,\n    arts and unrivalled landscape setting.  Please sign this\n    Petition and visit our website at www.savebartonfarm.org for\n    further information. Thank you",
