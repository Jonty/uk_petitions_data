            "background": "Thatcher is undeserving of a state funeral and tax payers should not have to foot the bill as she was the most divisive prime minister in the last 50 years. Under her stewardship she desimated British industry and ruined the lives of millions of working class people to fund tax breaks for her rich Tory supporters. Labour party voters will not forget the damage this person inflicted on the north of England and we are still suffering fallout from her policies. a generation of young workers was lost due to her economic policies and her attitude to society",
