            "background": "Introduce a tax deductible 3-5 year savings plan where the final capital can be used as a deposit for a mortgage or to reduce existing mortgage debt. Only 1 plan would be allowed per person. This is similar to the 529 savings schemes in the US where the capital can be used to finance college fees. For the majority of people entering the work force this is more relevant than saving for pension schemes. Employers could offer this as part of a flexible benefits package.",
