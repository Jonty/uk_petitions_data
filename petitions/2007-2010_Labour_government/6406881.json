        "background": "Roger Moore is widely recognised as the epitome of suave and smooth charm - a true Ladies' man -  and on many occasions he has single handedly saved the world eg. from Stromberg (See 'The Spy Who Loved Me\", Scaramanga (See 'the Man with the Golden Gun') and Mr Big (See 'Live and Let Die). But beneath his dark blue blazer and MI6 based steely  professionalism lies a charitable figure who has raised millions for UNICEF.  Sir Roger clearly has the intellect, popular appeal and kudos to be a policymaker for the UK and he was the best Bond.  Make him a Lord asap GB.",
