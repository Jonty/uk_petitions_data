            "background": "Right Honourable Mr. Brown MP, we have believe that due to the current state of affairs in the state of Zimbabwe it would be morally unjust to continue the deportation of failed asylum seekers from this nation, especially those with children.\n\nWe are disturbed that, despite the European Convention on Human Rights, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Childeren, Her Majesty's government is continuing to deport Zimbabweans with expired visas as well as those who have failed in claiming for asylum, despite the real risk of political condemnation upon return.\n\nThe United Kingdom has long been acclaimed for its position upon the rights of people from all nations and races. By allowing temporary amnesty to Zimbabweans who have fled looking for safety we would send a powerful message to the dictator Robert Mugabe and the international community.\n\nExpelling Zimbabweans with children from this country is ethically contemptible and contradicts every value our society holds. We as a nation must protect the rights of these families\u2019 innocent children, and ensure they are given a safe society to live their lives, so that they may benefit the community in return.",
