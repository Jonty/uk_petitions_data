            "background": "The Government should begin investigating the 'politics of happiness' and look into the causes of excess alcohol consumption. Countries with cheaper alcohol and more flexible licensing do not have the same problems as the UK, so, yet more taxes do not appear to be the answer.  Instead the Government should look at why people may wish to consume such large amounts and address the root causes.",
