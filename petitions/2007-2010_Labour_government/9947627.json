            "background": "Since the beginning of the 2007/08 school year, my cousin's school bus has not turned up on average of every 9 school days. The bus used is 30 years old, clapped out and parents wonder how it has passed the bus MOT for the past five years. Due to the combination of parents working, no bus between the village and the town where the school is and very few taxis operationg in the area, many pupils don't attend school the day the bus doesn't turn up. As my cousin is sitting her GCSEs, I am taking her and 2 friends to school on exam days as she does not trust the bus. It is costing me a lot of money in petrol taking them there as it's a 22 mile round trip. The bus firm that operates the school bus runs modern buses to other schools in the county. Those pupils who haven't attended school when the bus didn't turn up have lost 3 weeks of schooling.",
