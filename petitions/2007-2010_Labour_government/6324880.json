You do the crime you do the time anyone who comits murder should have no human rights and should face life in prison. The murdered person or persons do not have there rights taken into account. LIFE MEANS LIFE ACT NOW.\n\nYouth Violence.\n\nAgain with the increasing news reports of gangs of youths causing trouble i call for the Courts to be able to auto enlist any offender found guilty into the armed forces for a minimum of 10 yrs with no option of leaving. Lets see how big they are then.",
