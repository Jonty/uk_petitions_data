            "background": "It is my firm belief that one of the main reasons the world tipped in to the current downturn was the sky high price of oil at the time, pushing up prices and leaving many people not being able to make ends meet.\nNow the basic fact is that oil production cannot keep up with demand even in the medium term never mind in years to come, so the inevitable consequence is very high oil prices. Now while renewables may help create some electricity, oil is essential for far more than that, from plastics, petrol, pesticides to pharmaceuticals etc. So when oil shoots up again getting  more and more expensive  as reserves dwindle what is the plan to deal with this?",
