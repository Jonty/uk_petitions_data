            "background": "Local councils were required to remove refuse every seven days by the Public Health Act 1875 to control disease. One Hundred and thirty two years later we have lost this right. Along with this comes an enforced recycling scheme\nbecause of a policy which comes from the EUrocrats, a NON-Elected body.  The British electorate were not consulted on the introduction of these matters and should have been. Tell the government we want the laws repealed.",
