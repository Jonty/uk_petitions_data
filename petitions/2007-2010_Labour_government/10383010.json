        "background": "We the British people feel that since labour has been in office they have failed the people it has been elected to govern. Since Gordon Brown became prime minister the country has gone from bad to worse, breaking all his so called golden rules. Borrowing more money, when we are already in debt of 555 billion pounds. Of which it will be the British people who suffer as we will be the ones that have to repay that debt FOR GENERATIONS thanks to our present careless leader. Wrongfully  giving and pledging money away to other countries which we do not have, such as 30 million pounds pledged to the palestinians. Do we really have this sort of money to give away??? NO we do not !!!!. It is about time we had a leader who is perpared to sort out our OWN COUNTRY before trying to correct any other country and put the great back in GREAT BRITON thus being the reason i create this petition.",
