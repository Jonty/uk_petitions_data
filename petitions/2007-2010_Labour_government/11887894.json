            "background": "Working tax credit does not help people back into work if made redundant or after maternity leave because of the way it is calculated.\nIt uses your last tax years earnings to calculate your entitlement now.\nMy example, i was made redundant in August 08 and will get NO Working Tax Credit for taking a minimum wage job because i earned \u00a316,000 Gross, tax year April 07 to April 08.\nDaughters example, After having a baby in December she wants to go back to work. She claimed Working Tax Credit towards Child Care of \u00a3750 per month (average in this area and nearly her entire monthly earnings) she as been told she will receive \u00a372 Tax Credit per month as she and her husband earned \u00a333,000 Gross between them from April 07 to April 08. Surely Tax credits should take into account circumstances now, not nearly 2 years ago when i was in full time employment and my Daughter was hoping to start a family and carry on with her career.",
