            "background": "Presently, the justice system appears to favour the high profile media stars and athletes by giving them lower sentences and fines, and at the same time they keep their job. These stars and athletes are role models to the youth of today and the this lack of punishment gives the wrong message and shows lack of respect to the majority law abiding population. Laws should be passed to ensure these stars and athletes require a 'licence' to work - any violations will result in loss of this licence. This would mean that they would not be allowed to appear on TV, stage or compete in their sport. Once these trouble-makers and poor role models are properly punished will we start to rebuild respect in society.",
