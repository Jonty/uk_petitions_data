            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In certain other European countries, the use of winter tyres is compulsory in winter. Even though we see less snow and ice than those countries, we are much more vulnerable to it. Gritting only makes main roads \"safe\", rural and urban residential roads remain highly dangerous. Transport is essential not only for convenience but for emergency services and the ability of doctors to get to work. The compulsory use of winter tyres for all in the UK would not only make roads much safer in black ice conditions (seen every year) and save lives, but would effectively prevent the gridlocks that we have suffered two years running and that no doubt prevent emergency services from performing their duties. The counterargument that the economic cost would outweigh the benefit is not valid when you consider that human life and safety has no easily applied cost to it.",
