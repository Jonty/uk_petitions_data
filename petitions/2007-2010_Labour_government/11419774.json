Any women due to receive a pension before this date need 39 years worth of NI contributions. Some may miss out on a full pension by one day.  How can this nine year gap be fair?  The cost of allowing all women a full state pension with 30 years worth of contributions is a drop in the ocean compared to government spending else where.",
