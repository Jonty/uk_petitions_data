            "background": "The NI system is stacked against freelancers.\n\nAn employee earning millions loses their job after 2 years and gets 6 months\u2019 contributory (non-means-tested) JSA.\n\nA freelancer signs on as their business fails. They can\u2019t get contributory JSA and must apply for means-tested benefit, which they probably won\u2019t get if their spouse or partner works. \n\nIs this what our benefits system is for?\n\nHMRC says buy income insurance but this can be hard to get or too costly, especially for those with disabilities or serious illnesses.\n\nPlus freelancers forced onto PAYE for casual work must pay Class 1 NI. These sporadic payments don\u2019t count but can\u2019t be reclaimed. \n\nWe want:\n\n- Freelance NI to count towards contributory JSA or Class 3 top-ups to be eligible\n\n- Better explanation of current rules to people registering as self-employed\n\n- Those paying Class 1 NI for 2 years to retain eligibility for contributory JSA if they then go freelance\n\n- A higher threshold for freelancers before paying Class 1 or a Class 1 exemption system",
