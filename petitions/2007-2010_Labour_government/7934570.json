        "background": "A number of people are interested in setting up the SD Car Company to manufacture a new version of the Rover SD1 using the same bodyshell (this time it will be galvanised) and modern mechanical parts. However, the Government stupidly allowed Nanjing Automotive to take the rights to old British Leyland cars following the collapse of MG Rover. Therefore, could the Government please recover the rights to the Rover SD1 so it can be recreated in Britain.",
