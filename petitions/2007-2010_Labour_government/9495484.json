            "background": "Landlords and letting agencies should be compelled to take responsibility for the actions of their tenants. It should be made illegal for any landlord or letting agent to allow a tenant to continue to behave in an antisocial manner after they have received a complaint regarding that tenant. Individuals affected should be allowed to claim compensation on a per diem basis from the point that a complaint is made to the point that it is resolved if that complaint is deemed to be reasonable. This would incentivise landlords and letting agents to take responsibility for their tennants, and would help to ease the burden on local authorities.",
