        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many teachers, for years, have predicted the kind of SATS marking problems that are being reported in the press. The idea of NVQs originally was to improve access for non - academics to gain professional status, but in reality arduous and copious assessments recreated the problems that the NVQs were intended to solve - paperwork ! Please, can I urge Rt Hon Balls and Lord Houndwood to consider this quick testing method for submission rather than long - winded essay type discursive papers, which burden FE and HE. Please also consider computerised quick multiple choice testing.",
