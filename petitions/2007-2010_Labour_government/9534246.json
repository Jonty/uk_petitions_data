            "background": "A massive government database holding details of every phone call, e-mail and time spent on the internet by the public is being planned as part of the fight against crime and terrorism. Internet service providers (ISPs) and telecoms companies would hand over the records to the Home Office under plans put forward by officials.\nIndustry sources gave warning that a single database would be at greater risk of attack and abuse. David Davis, the Shadow Home Secretary, said: \u201cGiven [ministers\u2019] appalling record at maintaining the integrity of databases holding people\u2019s sensitive data, this could well be more of a threat to our security, than a support.\u201d\nA similar petition by MPWilliams was rejected due being incomprehensible. This isn't.  These plans need to be stopped.  We are blindly moving into a 'Big Brother' society.",
