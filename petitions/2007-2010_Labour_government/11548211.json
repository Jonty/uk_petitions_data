The order will single out MPs and Peers in a special category as the only paid public officials who will not have to disclose full details of their expenses, causing a regressive effect on Parliamentary transparency, a detrimental impact on Parliament in the eyes of the public; and is an attack on MPs' and Peers' accountability to members of the public.",
