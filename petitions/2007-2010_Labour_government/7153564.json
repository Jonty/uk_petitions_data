In my opinion this was a particularly nasty petition created by someone who obviously has no personal experience of being on benefits.  This person does not seem realise that ANYONE can, through circumstances beyond his/her control, be in a position to need them: redundancy (and inability to find another job possibly via employer prejudice on age and/or personality) or disability (possibly caused by an accident for which someone else is responsible).  Jobseekers Allowance and Incapacity Benefits are contributory - i.e. the claimant has paid for them via National Insurance contributions - and, unless an individual has NEVER been employed, even Income Support has been funded through his/her taxes.",
