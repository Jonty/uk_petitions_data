            "background": "I am certain that both sides of the Gaza conflict will never be content with whatever peace plan is agreed,as there are too many other parties stirring behind the scene.So any respite for the suffering people of Gaza, will only be temporary. \nI suggest the UK proposes that the whole Gaza area be declared a UN PROTECTED ZONE under UN administration\nand policing. In the zone, political parties should be banned and possession of any type of weapon illegal.Issue identification cards to bonafide residents to control infiltration by trouble makers.Free egress and ingress by all but with immigration type controls. In the short term, this will allow the people of Gaza to live normal lives and establish a little piece of homeland. It will also give Israel the security it seeks for its borders. This could be the base to a long term goal of establishing a fixed homeland for Palestinians.It is suggested that Israel, in exchange for the West Bank, give a tract of land which will link the Gaza Strip to an area along the Eygptian border up to Jordan. Areas in the West Bank sacred to all faiths should be made UN protectorates. The whole world then can contribute financial aid to create a new Palestine.",
