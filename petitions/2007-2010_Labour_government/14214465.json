            "background": "No one really likes the coconut chocolates. You always end up with a sad little huddle of rejected sweets in the bottom of the tin. These are inevitably given to the person who has said that 'They don't mind them' but who doesn't like them in all honesty. It would be more economically viable and also more ethical to remove these poor, unwanted chocolates from the selections and give them their own box, so that the few individuals who do like them can purchase them without having to buy the whole box. This would prevent waste of food, money and time sorting through the boxes. Thank you.",
