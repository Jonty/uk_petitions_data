            "background": "The London Borough of Sutton has a disproportionate number of children from outside the borough taking up places in its secondary schools. 33% are from outside the borough. Published Admission Numbers have been exceeded in all of the past three years. Sutton operates a selective/grammar school system. The grammar schools' in-take from children living outside the borough ranges from 50% to 85%. This is resulting in long journeys to school for many children and dissatisfaction among parents living in the borough, who are disadvantaged by the unfair competition for their children's school places.",
