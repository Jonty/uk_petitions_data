Last year, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) fined Nationwide \u00a31m following the theft of a laptop. This was a double penalty to those clients whose date was stolen as Nationwide are a mutual and hence owned by it's depositers (those who'd been offended against!). The FSA should refund the \u00a31m or insist that it is paid for by those senior staff in Nationwide who failed in their duty of care to their members.",
