            "background": "In May 2007 the National Staff Dismissal Register (NSDR) is expected to go live. This register will allow employers to check whether applicants to jobs have been accused of theft or dishonesty by a previous employer. No conviction or proof of the allegation is necessary for an employee to be entered onto the NSDR, and once blacklisted an employee will have little chance of securing a job. This scheme goes completely against the concept of innocence until proof of guilt, is open to flagrant misuse and abuse by vindictive employers, and offers little real prospect of redress or compensation to those innocent employees who will undoubtedly be affected by it.\n\nHere is a link to a BBC News article which goes into greater detail over the plan and its implications: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7389547.stm",
