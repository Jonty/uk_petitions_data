        "action": "look into funding an extension of the A14 from a dual carriageway to a 3 lane motorway.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We believe that the east of England require a major motorway to not only improve traffic flow but create job opportunities throught the Eastern region.\n\nWhile the extension of the A14 to a motorway would create jobs within the local communities it would also improve the traffic situation from the Port of Felixstowe up to the M1 motorway. The Port of Felixstowe has long been recognised as not only one of Europes largest ports but also one of the largest in the world. Traffic is busy throughout the day along the A14 and we believe that the extension would ease traffic problems and provide a valuable route from the main ports of Felixstowe and Harwich to main cities and towns along the A14 including Ipswich, Newmarket, Cambridge, Petterborough among many others. With the local Snoasis development also in the area and being used in the future Olympics the motorway would benefit access for all future sporting events also. The East of England is one of the main areas without a motorway link.",
