        "background": "There is currently a great deal of controversy regarding the use of Bisphenol-A (BPA) in baby bottles, and in plastic food containers in general. Bisphenol-A is in widespread use in polycarbonate plastics and the potential health risks are severe. Almost all baby bottles are made from polycarbonate, and infant health is being put at great risk. We urge the Prime Minister to ban the sale of baby products containing Bisphenol-A in the UK. Ideally this ban would extend to all products containing Bisphenol-A.",
