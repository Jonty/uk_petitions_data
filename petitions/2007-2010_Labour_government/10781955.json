            "background": "The amount of homework children receive from school should be reduced due to the school leaving age being raised to 18 years old. Children spend on average 6 hours a day in school, and an extra couple of hours doing homework. Attending school for 6 hours a day of a childs life is enough, rather than the additional homework and the recent push up to an extra year of school whilst you're in your adult years. You can get married and have children by that age, could you find enough time for excessive piles of homework stacking up on your desk?",
