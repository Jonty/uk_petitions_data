        "background": "Democracy in the UK is at its lowest ebb, with a strong perception that it is irrelevant to people's lives.  It's time to reverse that trend for good.  One way to make that work would be for party labels and whips politics to be removed from MPS and for members to stand or fall solely by their merits, policies, voting record and skills in representing constituents.  Governments should be formed from the most talented and skilled of MPS from any side of the house. Adversarial politics must be replaced by co-operation and unity of purpose.",
