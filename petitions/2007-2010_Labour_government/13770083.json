        "background": "Currently when a Judgement is issued by the Employment Tribunal it is up to the creditor to recover the money.\n\nIn many cases, such as those involving Limited Companies, the process to recover the money is long-winded, complicated and often impossible.\n\nCertain strategies can be employed but often aren't financially justifiable as they outweigh the debt involved.\n\nThe Citizens Advice Bureau estimate they deal with 1000 cases a year involving the Employment Tribunal with debts totaling \u00a34.5 million.\n\nThe CAB has set a convincing argument stating that even under \"cautious assumptions\" the cost to the government of enforcing these judgements could be as little as \u00a30.5 million...a small price to pay for the well being of many residents in the country.",
