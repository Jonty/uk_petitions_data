            "background": "The new vehicle excise duty has been applied indescriminately.  Taxing an MPV which will carry 7 or 8 people equally with a 4 or 2 seater car is not logical or fair.  This penalises the larger family who may be on low income and for which an MPV is a necessity.\n\nExcise duty has been based upon engine size for some time now but we must be more logical and fair about it and base the tax for co2 on the emmission per car seat not on engine size.",
