Yes i agree that\n    we have come up with a way of stopping the jewels from reaching\n    the shops but it is mine and other people's opions that it is\n    not the satisfaction of the customers that consume\n    themselfs with useless jewels but it is of the children who are\n    killed and kill everyday. imagine if you were stolen from your\n    parents brought up in an atmosphere of war and aboilshment,\n    then forced to kill your own parents... would you do it and\n    spend a lifetime in a cave never to see the light. and there\n    digging out more war.you are aware that the money made by the diamonds\n     is used for more war and if they were to go to war the\n    children would be put at the front line. in addition to this\n    the goverment over there is doing nothing but you can. england\n    is more powerful than africa ecspecially in places such as\n    sirra leone. make a difference, save lives, save the generations to come.all you have to do is talk to the african goverment negotiate/send a group of armed forces to arrest them.PLEASE!",
