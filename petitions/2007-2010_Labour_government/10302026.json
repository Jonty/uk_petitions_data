            "background": "A lot of people have now lost faith in Gordon Brown; he was elected without the publics consent.\n\nDaily we hear nothing but news about rising prices for fuel, food and energy, which just proves putting a TAX MAN in charge, was the wrong thing to do.\n\nHe talks about the environment and Green tax\u2019s etc, but has done nothing to push green energy for car drivers. What\u2019s wrong with pushing Bio-diesel?\n\nConverting Diesel cars would more beneficial and surely discounting the conversion would change a lot of people\u2019s minds.\n \nWe didn\u2019t vote for Gordon Brown, so why is he aloud to make a mess of this country.\n\nIt\u2019s time for an election, before things deteriorate further.",
