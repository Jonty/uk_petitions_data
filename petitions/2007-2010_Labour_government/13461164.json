        "background": "The stupidity of current legislation now makes it illegal for your neighbours and friends to look after your children even with your consent. The legislation obliges parents to get professional childminders to look after their children or family. It is the nanny state gone totally mad. The law is not clear and it is evident that the police do not even know what the law means. Please protest against this law which probably effects most working parents in this country.",
