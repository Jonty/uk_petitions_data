            "background": "Sacking scientists who do not toe the party line was something we saw in Eastern Europe before the Iron Curtain fell.  It has no place in 21st century Britain.\n\nOn one side of the argument here we have - not the opinions of an individual - but the consensus opinion of the ACMD as a whole.  On the other side, the opinions of Alan Johnson, who neither professes or posesses any scientific expertise, and whose only employment (other than in union/party politics) was as a postman.\n\nIn what sense can the current government be said to be interested in independent scientific advice, rather than personal prejudice?  And can the ACMD, in future, be considered as \"independent\" if the government is prepared to sack its head for stating scientific facts?\n\nProfessor Nutt should be reinstated forthwith.  Mr Johnson should consider his position.",
