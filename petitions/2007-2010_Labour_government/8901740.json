        "background": "A lot of buisnesses say that they would be willing to put recycling initiatives into action if their employees asked them to.\nThe only problem for a lot of companies and businesses (especially on the high street) is that their Local Counsell do not provide a recycling service for them. They will sweep the streets and take away normal rubbish, but the recycling lorries bypass them.\nAlso, we see every day the amount of waste that is disposed of in the workplace that could easily be recycled or reused.\nTherefore, i propose that an initiative is put in place for all types of buisinesses, that will make it compulsory to put some type of recycling scheme into action. \nOne small step is better than none at all.",
