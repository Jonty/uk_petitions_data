            "background": "The bare facts of the brutal murder of Marwa el-Sherbini has horrified the public. A devout and professional Muslim woman was killed while seeking justice inside a European courtroom apparently for no other reason than her being a veil-wearing Muslim woman. \nThe security guards who rushed to the scene opened fire on her husband, who was trying to defend her, mistaking him for the attacker. He is in a critical condition.\nQuestions are being asked about why the attacker was allowed to take a knife inside the courtroom, and why there was such a serious security failure in a modern and efficient society like Germany. \n\nBehind the questions lurk a suspicion of foul play - some sinister anti-Islamic hand at work.\nthe German media has shown double standards by ignoring the Dresden incident - as if it had happened on another planet... with the excesses of the same media when a Muslim commits such a crime, or even a lesser one.\n\nAs reported by BBC News on 10th July 2009.",
