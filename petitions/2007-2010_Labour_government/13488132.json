The petitions you see here are a way of controlling disaffected and unhappy citizens by the  means of their appearing to be able to make a difference. When the huge number of petitions receive few votes, the petitioners become disillusioned and give up. By forcing the Prime Minister to personally address the petitions the British public can be assured that their efforts have not been completely wasted.",
