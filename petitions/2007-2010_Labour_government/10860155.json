The Prime Minister, is not so important that he needs a whole street to himself with police stopping people even walking down there. I don't expect to be able to drive down it but we pedestrians and cyclists should be given unrestiricted access, like they have in my street.\n\nIt's our street, if we want to walk down then we should be able to.",
