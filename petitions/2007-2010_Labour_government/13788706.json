            "background": "The most recent case example is going on in The Hague, where Karadzic is using the law against the judges and advocates appointed to try him MUCH MUCH more beneficially than the judges and advocates seem able to use the law against him.  We in this country have had numerous cases where criminals have won cases on ludicrous points of law and as a result the money we taxpayers have stumped up to pay the DPP and his staff has been an unequivocal waste of money.  Some thought has to be given to employing those criminals who won their cases as legal eagles to work in the DPP - they seem to be much better lawyers than the lawyers we are currently paying lots of money to.",
