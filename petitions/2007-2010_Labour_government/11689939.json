            "background": "Although a petition has already been put forward to prevent BT from monopolizing line rental, this is an extension of that. \nThe problem is that if a member of the public have a financial disagreement with BT and legal action is taken from either party, you are unable to use other companies for your line rental as BT, restricts and has control over it. \nI am asking that the Prime minister forces BT to allow all telecom/internet providers access to the line rental contracts. I.E. allow the public to have line rental with other providers even though they have had financial difficulties with BT.\nThis is the year 2009, and is the age of technology. The internet is a necessity, and the public have the right to it.",
