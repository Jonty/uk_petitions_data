            "background": "There should be more channels on Freeview - ideally more music, documentaries, kids and general entertainment channels. Plus they should be showing the full days' worth of tv for each channel. For example UKTV History is only on Freeview from 7am-6pm. On Sky/cable, it is on from 7am-3am. There are programmes I would like to view outside the freeview hours, but cannot. Please stop restricting the viewing hours for freeview viewers. People are forced to buy digital tvs and are let down with the 1950s style of channels shutting down early in the evening.",
