            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "For years both sellers and buyers of residential property in the UK have been left in a state of limbo not knowing whether their prospective house sale or purchase will proceed to a succesful conclusion. If a sale/ purchase falls through for whatever reason all parties are inevitably left out of pocket without any form of compensation for ie solicitors costs.  I suggest that the system in the UK is unfair and in need of change. I am seeking support for a fairer system which would incorporate a non refundable deposit being lodged with Estate Agents at the the time of the agreed purchase, this would be used in the event of financial loss to the seller should the purchase not proceed. Implementing a similar system used in France would be advantageous whereas a signed agreement to purchase is made followed by a statutory cooling off period of approximately seven days, which allows either party to withdraw without penalty. After this period has expired the parties involved would proceed to a succesful sale/purchase. This would benefit and inhance the whole experience for all concerned and alleviate the stress that house sellers and purchasers have to go through at the moment.",
