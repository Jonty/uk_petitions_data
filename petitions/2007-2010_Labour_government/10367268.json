            "background": "It would solve our impact on global warming as well as potential crises caused by a dependence on fossil fuels.\nWhile expensive it is the only realistic way to a sustainable future. The real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever-rising energy prices.\nTo speed up the transition to new energy sources, there is a need to heavily review income tax, why not tax what we buy, use and burn through a much higher VAT not through what we earn. A VAT rate around 50% would see no loss in government revenues and no impact on peoples life, while higher tax could be applied to items deemed bad for the environment such as non renewable energy supplies encouraging people to adopt more sustainable way of living while putting companys into a position where funding these energy changes makes financial sense.",
