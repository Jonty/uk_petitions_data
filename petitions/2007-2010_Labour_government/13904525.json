        "background": "The vast majority of specialised companies that sell goods to people with disabilities, charge way over the top for products. By searching around online, most items can be purchased far cheaper from Europe and quite often the postage is free or much lower than companies charge over here. I thought we were supposed to support local companies, but why should we at these ridiculous prices. An example: I needed a wheel bag for my wheelchair wheels, a well known wheelchair shop charge \u00a3175.00 - a shop in Belfast sold me the same bag for \u00a339.99 with free postage. Its the same bag, same make and model. Its very wrong.",
