        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "No Items matterless of what they are should be taxed at more than the retail price of that item. IE 100% of the retail price.\nFuel taxation is now abhorent & oppresive at >300% and the government is persecuting Motorists in the form of fuel taxation, purely for Taxation Revenue.  Drop any further rise in fuel taxation forthwith.\nI find it Digusting that this government has again raised fuel taxes / VAT / Revenue / Road fund license. Why do you continue to PERSECUTE motorists in the name of the Environment and other numerous excuses including paying for Blair & Browns many fiscal disasters, when the revenue is not even used for these purposes.  If the road fund license revenue from Inception (Which must run into Thousands of Bilions of pounds) alone, had been used to build Roads and improve the Transport infrastucture, this country would have the best transport system in the world BAR NONE !!!!\nThis is without the other oppresive amounts of Taxes raised from Speeding Parking, Stealth and other Taxes This Blair & Brown government has imposed on the Population.",
