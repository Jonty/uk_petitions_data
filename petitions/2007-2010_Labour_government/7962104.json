            "background": "The British government should nationalise the Northern Rock Bank, any future profits or sale of the bank would then benefit the Taxpayer's who have already in effect bought the bank. when banks have gone bust in the past the shareholders have lost their money, why should the Northern Rock shareholders be any different?\n\nNationalising the Bank would protect the  account holders, borrowers and mortgage holders, while also protecting the investment in the bank from the Taxpayer. \n\nTo sell the bank now would only benefit the eventual purchaser and current shareholders, who took on the shares in the full knowledge that it is possible to loose their money in exchange for the profits while the bank was doing well.",
