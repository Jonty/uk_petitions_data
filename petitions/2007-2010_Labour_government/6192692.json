        "action": "Create a Government Letting Agency to govern Landlords and Letting Agencies",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Tenancy agreements need to change between letting agents, Landlords and the Tenants. Landlords have the power to revoke deposits on properties let, even for minor damage, and in some cases where the damage was caused prior to the property being let. The present system gives the power over tenants solely to the Landlords. There is no in-between body to aid tenants in seeking assistance over the Landlords decisions at the start and end of their contracts. \nI'd like to see a government body that handles all tenancy agreements fairly, plus this body would handle all deposits (that would therefore fund the government body) rather than the Landlords. Why should the Landlords get interest off the Tenants deposit? Why should letting agents be able to charge various amounts for their services, and draw up varying contracts that the Tenants have no say in.\n\nPlease petition to request the Government to take control over Tenancy and Letting laws. It makes sense, and it will also help eradicate many law breaking Landlords, especially with respect to sub letting, and over crowding in let houses. It will also aid the control over extortionate rent prices.",
