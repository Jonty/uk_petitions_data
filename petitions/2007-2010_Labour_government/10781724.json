        "background": "The Barnett Formula, created in 1978, drew-up spending allocations that allowed for Scotland's larger physical area, lower average incomes and its particularly acute needs in health care and housing. \n\nThe formula dictates that for every \u00a31 the Government distributes, 85p goes to England, 10p to Scotland and 5p to Wales. \n\nScotland now has only 8.3 per cent of the UK population and the disparate conditions idenntified by Barnett are much less acute. That has led to a situation where \"identifiable spending\" in Scotland on public services is \u00a31,500 higher per person than in England, according to Treasury figures.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament is using this advantage to create large advantages in social provision in Scotland at the expense of England and is driving resentment that it will eventually use to create the conditions for break-up of the Union.",
