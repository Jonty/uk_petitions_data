        "background": "Currently in the uk we have a benefits system that rewards people who do not work and hence do not contribute to the public purse. By capping the total benefits paid to a level whereby getting a job would improve every claimants financial situation would no doubt reduce the current level of unemployment and also greatly boost our economy. Total benefits should be capped, including, but not limited to, cash, housing benefit, council tax benefit and child benefit. It is not fair that some people work so others do not have to. Lets make a life on benefits a penalty and restore the original purpose of benefits to help those out of work in the short term",
