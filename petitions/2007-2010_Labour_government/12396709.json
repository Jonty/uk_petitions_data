You, the Prime Minister, should be doing the same to those running the credit card business in the UK, and help to prevent what is appearing to be a developing \"lone-shark\" mentality, using the credit crunch as an excuse.  Their actions cause great difficulty and pain to many in this country. How is it justifiable for companies to increase their rates from 24% to 35% when the bank base rate is under 1%? Something needs to be done and quickly.",
