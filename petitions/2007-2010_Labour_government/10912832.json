            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The M5 is an important motorway linking the West Midlands with the South West. However it gives up short by ending just a few miles south of Exeter leaving motorists wishing to travel to Plymouth, a growing city with a quarter of a million residents, to use the substandard A38 dual carriageway, which has badly designed bends and gradients. The existing dual two lane road should be upgraded, with substantial realignment, to a dual three lane road with full hard shoulders. Plymouth is the largest settlement in the United Kingdom without a motorway link and thus is clearly in need of one. The benefit of such a road would be the arrival of increased economic prosper in the region, and a significant decrease of accidents on the route.",
