            "background": "I can't explain the feeling of hurt and angryness which I felt when my pet cat was killed and then left dead at the side of the road.\nIf this happens to a human it is known as a hit and run so why can't it be the same for our beloved pets too?? who are often just as much loved family members as children.\nIn my opinion anyone who does this should suffer the same punishment as they would if it was a person, either a fine or going to jail.\nI also think we should be able to report these crimes and there should be an investigation, it could have been caught on camera or maybe someone saw it happen. (I know that part is unlikely to be done but I can't see why it shoudln't happen afterall they are living creatures just like us who are loved dearly and feel pain the same as any human.)\n\nPlease sign my petition if you feel the same way.\nThank you",
