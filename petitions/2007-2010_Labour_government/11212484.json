            "background": "I was walking just outside Clapham Junction station on Saturday night, when I saw a young lady sobbing on the floor.  It was clear to me that she was homeless and seeing so many happy people walking past her (including myself) hammered home just how dreadful she must have been feeling.  Admittedly, I\u2019m a \u201cwalk past and don\u2019t make eye contact\u201d person and performed the same tired old routine on Saturday night.\n\nAccording to Crisis, there are approximately 700 people sleeping rough every night.  That\u2019s 700 people who, on Christmas day, will realise just how homeless they are when the Christmas Crackers start to crack above and around them.\n\nThere\u2019s not much that one person can do to relieve the suffering of our \u201crough sleeping\u201d homeless but I hope that those who can do something will do anything they can.",
