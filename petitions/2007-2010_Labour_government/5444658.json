            "background": "People in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receive more from their public services because the per capita spend awarded to those countries is higher than that awarded to England.\nThis is patently unfair as the English taxpayer has to subsidise these increased benefits.  This is particularly relevant in the areas of Health and Education.\nIt is time that England had it's own regional government and this subsidy was scrapped.  We should all be treated equally.",
