        "background": "Companies send scratch cards through people's doors which require phoning a telephone number which can charge anything from \u00a35 - \u00a330 when following the instructions exactly.  They promise a large prize which they name on the phone.  I tested this out and it's been 4 years since I last tried it, I never heard back off any of them.\nThey sometimes call home phones with recorded messages which work the same way.  They intend to charge large amounts for these calls and have no intention to give out prizes which they wrongfully promise.\n\nIt is a SCAM and should be made illegal.",
