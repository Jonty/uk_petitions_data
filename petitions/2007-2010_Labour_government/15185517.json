        "background": "As I understand it V.A.T. is, or at least used to be, applied only to items considered luxuries.  And yet every time I look at the items on my supermarket bill I see that V.A.T. has been charged on such things as: soap, shampoo, washing-up liquid, detergent, toothpaste, hankies and even toilet paper!  \n\nHow can any of these (with the possible exception of paper hankies; people could instead use re-useable cotton ones) be considered luxuries?  How could we keep clean without them?  In particular what would, or could, we do without toilet paper?!  All these are things we can't do without so V.A.T. should not be charged on them.  If charging V.A.T. is dictated by the E.U. at least the rate could be reduced to the lowest possible percentage.",
