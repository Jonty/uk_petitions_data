        "action": "Reduce the price of diesel and bring it in line with petrol",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Diesel has been increasing in price vastly compared to petrol over recent years due to high levels of so called 'green tax'. Even though it is much more enviromentally friendly than petrol and the deisel cars are much more economical than petrol yet the people trying to be green, are still being punished. The current price levels are acting as a disincentive to be green. So i think diesel should be cut to the same price as petrol, if not made cheaper. If you agree please sign this petition. Thankyou",
