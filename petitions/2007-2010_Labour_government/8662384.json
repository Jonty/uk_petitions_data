            "background": "As a tax payer I object to funding a despicably unfair system. For years I have said nothing, but unless we stand up to be counted you CANNOT rely on those voted into power to represent the needs and wants of the British people \u2013 we must stand up for ourselves!\n\nThe welfare state was originally designed as a safety net but is now a crutch for far too many people. We are in danger of creating an ever growing dependent underclass - who make no positive and constructive contribution to society whatsoever and who often would be worse off working!!!\n\nThe breakdown in society can be traced firmly back to our Welfare state because RESPONSIBILITY is no longer a requirement as a British adult. \n\nUrgent Welfare reform needed, 3 main proposals;\n\n1. If you aren\u2019t British and have never contributed \u2013 you are NOT entitled!\n\n2. End something for nothing \u2013 what about volunteer work in positions such as park wardens, street cleaners\u2026.these could be filled by those without jobs and may even give them some skills?\n\n3. No money paid directly into an account, use a funding card instead that would block the purchase of non-essential items such as alcohol, cigarettes and mobile phone credit.",
