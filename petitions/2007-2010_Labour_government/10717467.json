            "background": "We believe that the UK Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly should extend the 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland, and grant women there the same rights to abortion as women in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nAs the law currently stands, no woman in Northern Ireland with an unwanted pregnancy (including women who\u2019ve been raped, victims of incest, diagnosed with fetal abnormality/disability) has the automatic right to abortion. \n\nConsequently, Northern Irish women:\n\n\u2022 Pay the emotional and financial costs (up to \u00a32,500) and travel to England or overseas for a private abortion.\n\n\u2022 Have babies they have already decided they don\u2019t want. \n\n\u2022 Buy illegal and unsafe abortion pills on the internet in desperation.\n\nfpa believes Parliament should change the law to end the discrimination against Northern Ireland women and give them the right to choose.",
