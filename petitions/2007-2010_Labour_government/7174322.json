Commendably, post - graduate student applications are often more profession - lead in terms of content - rather than for the simple reason of earning cash for universities, keen to get as many students as possibe to attend their courses. The current scholarship system lacks a system and stifles innovation - with very limited support for those talented and gifted academics with good project initiatives.",
