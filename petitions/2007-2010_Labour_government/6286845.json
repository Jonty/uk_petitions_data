Some way, e.g. an e-mail address, of contacting the administrator(s)/staff running the site should be provided. There should also be consistency in the approval, or otherwise, of petitions; e.g. I recently created a petition against one which already existed (so had obviously been approved) and mine was rejected on the grounds that it was not an appropriate issue for the site!  Either the one I was reacting to wasn't or mine was; they can't have it both ways!  Maybe this petition itself is not appropriate for the site but it would be nice if the administrators could take the points raised on board!",
