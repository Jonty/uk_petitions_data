With Multiple Sclerosis, you never know how you will feel from day to day. Like alot of people with chronic conditions, if we are having a bad day, all we can do is rest, and to do that in a cold environment would only add to the condition. With the constant rise in price of all heating providers, many of us are findig it hard being able to afford to have our heating on when we need it. With the extra help for this it would make out daily living more bearable.",
