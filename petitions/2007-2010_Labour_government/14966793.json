            "background": "It as been announced by the IPS that the cost of BMD certificates will rise in April by 75%.  Whilst there as been no increase since 2003 this rise in the present economic climate is extortionate.  A large proportion of family historians are retired and elderly people who will not have the resources to pay for this rise.  It is therefore my request that the Prime Minister look at this rise and reduce it to the rate of inflation which at present is 3.5%.  In business this price hike would not be allowed by the government or the public sector so why should it be allowed by a govermental department. Also would the prime minister look at the possibility of changing the law to allow for information contained on the certificates to be gievn in another way other than by purchasing the certificate as it seems is possible for Scottish BMD information.",
