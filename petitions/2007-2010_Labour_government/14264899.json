        "background": "Islam4UK, an extremist Muslim groups that actively seeks to introduce Shari'ah law within the UK and has close links with known Islamic terrorist organisations, has announced that it plans a march along Wootton Bassett's Highway of Heroes that has become synonymous with the repatriation of British men and women killed in conflct.  To even suggest such a march is irresponsible and insensitive, but also seeks to undermine British pride and respect for its fallen service personnel.  The Prime Minister must immediately and publicly ban the proposed march and all other expressions of Islamic extremist, irrespective of whether this is initiated by Islam4UK or similar extremist organisations.",
