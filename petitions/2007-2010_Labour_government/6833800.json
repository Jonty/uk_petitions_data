        "background": "It has been clearly demonstrated in the offshore centres (Jersey,IoM etc) that a single income tax rate does NOT create inequality amongst the population. Equality is established through varying personal thresholds and allowances. This therefore creates a society where hard work is rewarded and not piliged by the government and simplifies the cost of administering the tax system.",
