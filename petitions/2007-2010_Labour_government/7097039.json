His refuasl to fall on his sword for the fatal errors that have happened on his watch is unforgiveable.\n\nHe refused to listen to his senior officers advice and plead guilty to the charges for which they were found guilty on the 1st November 2007.\n\nHis alledged criticisms of his deputy in not taking up his bonus payment (which meant that he had to waive hs as-well) is unforgiveable.\n\nThe man has been a disaster and a travesty for londoners. it is about time that the office of commissioner was directly elected for by londoners!",
