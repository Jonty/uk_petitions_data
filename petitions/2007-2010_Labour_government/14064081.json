            "background": "We have already got 10 take-aways in Smallthorne Village Stoke On Trent, the residents of Smallthorne have seen and experienced a huge increase in illegal and dangerous parking, severe antisocial behaviour and noise late at night, and litter in recent years, it is no coincidence that it is proportional in growth to the opening of the night time food premises. There is grave concern about the increased problems of parking of customers using the these premises. These facts can be verified not only by the residents but also by the local police and council officers. I therefore have grave concerns about another similar premises adding to the already exasperated situation.",
