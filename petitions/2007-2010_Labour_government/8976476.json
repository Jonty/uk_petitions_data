        "background": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to...\n\nInvestigate the current BBC practice of supporting private enterprise with public funds by using its Saturday evening prime time schedule to promote musicals either produced by or presented in theatres belonging to Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Producers of other shows have no access to this medium and would have to spend approximately \u00a316m to get the same kind of coverage on ITV.  Andrew Lloyd Webber owned businesses are profiteering from this unfair alliance, enjoying income from theatre rent, bar, programme and even ice cream sales. Where his company is the producer, he will also benefit from royalty payments and producer\u2019s share of the income generated by the sale of tickets promoted on the BBC. Not only is this practice unfair it will ruin the West End's reputation world wide for new and exciting theatre. Another side effect will be trained actors losing out to amateur 'chancers'.",
