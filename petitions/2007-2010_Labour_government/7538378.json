        "background": "We unanimously believe that taper relief should be left at 10% for founders and start-up staff and urge you to support our Life Science & Technology \u2013 Save CGT Relief campaign. \n\nOption schemes are an integral part of a small company\u2019s ability to remunerate founders, staff and key consultants to levels that are competitive. Commercialising a technology involves vision, commitment and often accepting a personal risk from founders and early stage employees. To attract the best talent many of us have Option schemes whilst others have plans for such schemes to ensure long-term staff commitment. Option schemes form a significant part of the overall remuneration package \u2013 especially for start-ups.\n\nTo encourage the Government to maintain Capital Gains Tax Taper Relief at its current level, please sign the Life Science - Save CGT Relief petition and fill out our survey at www.g-nostics.com (follow the link to Save CGT Relief).",
