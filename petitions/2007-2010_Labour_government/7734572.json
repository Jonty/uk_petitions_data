Police foot patrols need to be visible and regular in order to prevent crime on our streets and in our neighbourhoods. There needs to be a very proactive campaign in every media outlet in order to encourage recruitment into the police. There also needs to be a determined and sustained effort to make the police organisation a worthwhile career choice for aspiring employees and jobseekers.",
