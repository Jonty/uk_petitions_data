            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The economy and peoples financial security is at stake within the next year and possible next four years.  It would be helpful for the government to instruct banks to waive early redemption fees on those mortgages which are tied to high interest rates, so we are able to take advantage of a lower rate during this difficult time we are experiencing, especially if the UK citizen has no guarantee their job is safe in the six months.  The fall in house is rapidly transferring house prices into negative equity people are afraid the government will raise the lending rates to banks next year at a phenonemonal rate to recoup losses.  The UK citizen will suffer down the line, who is already paying a large amount of taxes on a regular basis. Banks will lend to one another again if the UK citizen was not tied down with a fixed ate mortgage this year, we should be able to re-mortgage and take old of the low rates available to us, subject to credit status etc.\n\nEdeus and Mortgage Express are examples of banks who have already taken this approach and i'm sure have released burdens from their mortgage books.",
