            "background": "Currently, the official rate of interest for beneficial loans sits at 6.25%. With base-rate falling, this is likely to be higher than even standard variable rates on most mortgages and substantially higher than the bank-of-england base-rates. This means that employees taking advantage of staff mortgage schemes will not recieve the full benefit of base-rate cuts, leaving such people being penalised.\nI move that the beneficial rate should be returned to at least the 5% rate that it held for previous years, if not lower.",
