            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition proposes a trial in which HGV and other speed limited vehicles are forced to remain in the inside line of 3 lane motorways during peak periods in order to avoid blocking 2 lanes of the motorway during peak times.\n\nThe autobahn in Germany uses the lane signs to instruct HGV's to remain in the inside lane during peak periods thus avoiding the bottlenecks we all experience when one lorry is running parallel with another making little or no progress in overtaking. Camera's are used to monitor and fine any offenders.\n\nThe proposal ties into a \"fair deal on fuel\" for HGV drivers, with lower sales tax on fuel to HGV drivers in exchange for this compromise.",
