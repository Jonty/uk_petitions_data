        "background": "i studied both subjects at a level, and they opened my eyes up to things i would not have realised if i did not study the subjects.  I wish that i could have studied these subjects much earlier in my academics.They both discuss the mind, behavior, individuals,groups/societies, sexuality and so much more that would benefit a person in life.  this would open up minds of young individuals as they would learn about other cultures and religions hence reducing racisms or any prejudice/discrimination to anyone who is different to them. Both are very interesting subjects, if we have to study something as useless as pythagoras theorom or that humans were once monkeys, then children atleast can learn about eachother and learn to become accepting of one another.",
