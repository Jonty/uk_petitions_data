            "background": "The UK\u00b4s streets are dark after nightfall, very dark. It doesn\u00b4t make going outside very appealing at all. Life does not finish at 17.00 hours, but it does for so many UK citizens because of poor street lighting. Improper lighting aids car thieves, burglars, muggers to get what they want. Let\u00b4s stop this by making the streets safer at night. It is a well known fact that more people would leave their homes in the evening if they felt safer walking in the streets, better street lighting would enable more people to go out at night, in turn increasing the economy. City centres are even too dark at the moment, sort it out please with energy saving lightbulbs we can make a difference.",
