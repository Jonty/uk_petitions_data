            "background": "Disabled parking places are intended for disabled people.\n\nResidents\u2019 parking places are intended for residents.\n\nWe have a disabled parking place outside of our home which is in an area that already requires a resident\u2019s parking permit in order to park anywhere on that road.\n\nI am not referring to generic bays which any Blue Bade holder can use; I am referring to a bay which has been installed in an area already requiring the possession of a resident\u2019s permit.\n\nIn the last year, I have taken photographs of 68 vehicles illegally parked in that one bay not even displaying resident\u2019s permits.\n\nThe local authority and the police refuse to enforce the law in residents\u2019 parking areas which is tantamount to giving permission for these people to do as they please.\n\nI am sure many other people face the same injustice day after day.\n\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister to create an offence of misusing residents\u2019 disabled parking places, which results in the mandatory application of a \u00a35000 fine and three penalty points for the offence and results in the seizure and destruction of the vehicle for a second offence.",
