            "background": "Most people on Disability Livng Allownce can't afford suitable housing,because basic housing benefit rates are far too low for us to find anything suitable.Discretionary Housing Payments don't help many of us.It's common sense that if you're disabled,you'll need to pay more as a result of your disability.If basic HB rates had add-ons for people on DLA,we could afford to live in accommodation for our needs,such as houses with stairlifts,properties with a 2nd bedroom for single disabled people who regularly need someone to stay with them,a flat in a block with 24hr security/concierge for people whose disabilities make them vulnerable but who still want to exercise their right to live independently (such as people with mental health problems & learning disabilities),& anything else which a disabled person needs in their housing so that they aren't being discriminated against if they can't afford it.",
