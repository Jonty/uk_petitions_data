            "background": "We, the undersigned, want Radar keys ONLY available for the disabled.  We want proof of disability to be asked for, when a person wishes to purchase a Radar key.  Proof of disability is needed when applying for a Disabled Freedom Bus Pass or Blue Badge.\n\nRADAR and most local Council's will sell these keys to anyone willing to pay for them. The only time you need to prove disability, is if you are entitled to and wish to be VAT exempt.\n\nSome Council\u2019s require proof of disability, before issuing a RADAR key, Radar & others do not.  We want ALL Council\u2019s and Radar to require proof of disability.\n\nRADAR and many Council's state, that these keys are provided, to prevent vandalism and MISUSE.  Allowing NON disabled people to purchase/posses these keys, is a form of misuse.\n\nNON disabled people possessing a Radar key, have a choice when needing the toilet.  Men\u2019s, Women\u2019s (normally only a few feet from a disabled toilet) and DISABLED toilets.  \n\nDisabled people only have ONE choice, DISABLED toilets.",
