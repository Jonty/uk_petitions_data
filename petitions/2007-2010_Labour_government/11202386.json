            "background": "I know of a couple of friends that live in flats and both live in different cities. The councils have only provided the residents living in flats just the bins for normal rubbish. If they lived in a house, they would receive a bin for paper and for one of them a box to put glass bottles/jars and food/drink cans.\n\nMy friends don't have cars or an area for recycling near them. They want to recycle more, but are unable to as they live in flats. \n\nIf the govt seriously wants to hit recycling targets, then they need to make councils provide flats with recycling bins",
