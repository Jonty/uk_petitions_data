            "background": "With fuel now topping \u00a31 a litre it has become prohibitive for the man in the street to drive. With the UK's failing public transport system, jobs being populated well away from where people live, the increasing cost of food and goods deliveries it is imperative that the Government act now to bring fuel to a reasonable price. We understand that this cost will be made up elsewhere, perhaps an extra 1% on the higher rate of income tax would soften the blow.",
