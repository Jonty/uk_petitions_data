            "background": "How many people have to privately rent in this country because housing is too expensive. When looking through your tenancy agreement has your landlord put in a clause to prevent large rental increases every year? Did you know that a private landlord can increase your rent massively every year if there is no clause. \nI petition that there should be a cap on yearly rental increases to protect tenants from unrealistic cost of living rises.",
