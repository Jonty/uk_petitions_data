            "background": "Although in an ideal world all student loan repayments would be written off, if this isn't going to happen then at least all graduates should start off on a level field with their level of student debt. Those who have attended university from more disadvantged backgrounds (especially those who attended before the partial reintroduction of grants) have started their working lives with larger loans. This appears to go against the governments stated aims of promoting equality and in encouraging greater attendance at university in this group. \nThis petition asks that the means tested component of a persons student loan and the interest accrued on this component be written off by the government.",
