Nations like the USA and Britain will readily send troops to Iraq who unsurprisingly have a huge wealth of oil. With Zimbabwe though, our government appears to be willing to make a few noises in the U.N., instead of doing what they did in Iraq and go it alone in removing a corrupt dictator for the good of humanity. Gordon Brown on behalf of ALL decent human beings ACT NOW.",
