This creates a large burden for the patient and the NHS. \nThere is a lack of expertise in allergy right across the NHS.Most doctors just don\u2019t know, or know little, about allergy; there is a lack of expertise in hospitals and a lack of knowledge or understanding of allergy in primary care. This means that very large numbers of patients are being seen by a doctor who has little understanding of their disease; and things are made worst by there being a small number of full specialists in allergy.",
