            "background": "The old Youth Training Scheme (YTS), had it's problems, but it helped lots of 16 and 17 year olds and gave them work and learning opportunities. \nToday employment and work experience is hard to find. College and university places increasingly expensive and limited. \nA new type of Youth Training Scheme (NYTS) would inspire the youth of today to learn a trade, gain a qualification, increase their education, be more  respectful, be productive and develop or make a career, or new business. This would revitalize the country and instill the work ethic back into the culture of the nation.",
