            "background": "At present patients who require long term medication of one drug have to renew their perscription on a monthly basis even when the GP only requires the patient to visit the surgery once or twice a year. The practice of providing up to 6 months perscriptions as of 10 years ago is no longer common practice. This means that many patients have had their perscription charges rise by over 6 times in addition to the annual increases.",
