Pontificating that we didn't need to know what they were claiming, only that they knew better and MP\u2019s could regulate their expenses themselves.\n\nThey had the chance to bring reform to the expenses system in July 2008, when MP's voted on their own expenses, but failed to do so.\n\nOnly now, when an insider has released the information, do they claim to want to change the system. Only now, when they have been caught with their hands in the till, stealing our money, do they repent and call for a revising of the system.\n\nWell, it's too late for \"oversights\" and \"administrative errors\u201d. You were caught, bang to rights and now it's time for you to go.\n\nCall a General Election now. Let the Great British Public have our say!",
