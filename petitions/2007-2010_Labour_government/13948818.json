They allow you to do things which, around ten years ago, wouldn't have even been imaginable. \n\nIn 2001/2002, around 33% of UK households owned at least one computer; this rose to 70% in 2007. 63% of UK households currently have access to broadband, whilst a fair percentage of those own an internet connection, but no form of device which allows them to utilise such connection.\n\nRecently, the government stated its plans regarding changes to modern, high-speed telecommunications infrastructures throughout Britain.\n\nThe logic being, why focus on the majority when there is still a large minority without access to the internet in the form of a computer?",
