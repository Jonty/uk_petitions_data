            "background": "some roots have been canceled so a journy that used to only involve getting on train my now have to be taken by two or more. \nthe decline in roots maybe because of the increase of the use of other forms of transport but this does not take in to account people with distillates that depend on the rail survive and discontinuing lines makes there jorney harder. also has there has been a lot of talk about climate chance and the effect the pollution from cars is having on the environment i believe if more train lines and roots were introduced or re-introduced the number of people using car would decline so there for the effect on the environment would be greatly reduced   \n\n\nin particular i think the rail way line from ormskirk to southport so made available again",
