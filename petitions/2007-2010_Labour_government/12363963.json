            "background": "The current number plate size for motorcycles are too big and a reduction in size is warranted due to improvements in ANPR technology. For example Australia use the same detection methods but issue much smaller number plates.  \n\nMany motorcyclists reduce the number plate not to avoid detection by traffic enforcement cameras but to change the aesthetics of the motorcycle. This has been recognised by the ACPO in several current documents and they advise not to prosecute. Unfortunately most policemen are unaware of these guideline therefore motorcyclists are criminalised. \n\nWe therefore propose a reduction in motorcycle number plates to a reasonable size that is still visible from the DOT approved distance of 20.5 meters. The proposed change would be from 228 x 178mm to say 170mm x 130mm with characters to suit.",
