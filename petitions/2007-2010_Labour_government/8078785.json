            "background": "Dog licensing is a fantastic idea; but why should other animals miss out?\n\nBring in a system for licensing all mammals, birds and reptiles; licences should be renewed yearly.\n\nLicences should differ in price for the various animals e.g. a licence for a large dog would cost more than that for a smaller breed, which in turn would cost more that that for a small     mammal.  Price should also depend on how difficult it is to keep an animal e.g. a  licence for a hamster would be cheaper\nthan that for an iguana.\n\nIf a licence isn't renewed the animal(s) will be removed from the owner & re-homed through a shelter which home-checks all applicants to ensure they are responsible and suitable.",
