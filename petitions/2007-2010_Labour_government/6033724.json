            "background": "In order to instill more responsibility into vehicle drivers & give them ownership of their mistakes which cause accidents and injury to other road users.\n\nRoad users, guilty of causing accidents, would have to pay all the charges that would otherwise be made to the public purse including victim compensation.\n\nCurrent culture encourages road users to feel safe, wearing a belt or helmet & protected by insurance, to take more risks without having a liability for causing an accident. Some road users are prepared to take the risk of an accident with a more vulnerable road user because of an insufficient liability threat. They incorrectly feel protected by safety legislation and a very low capped financial liability.",
