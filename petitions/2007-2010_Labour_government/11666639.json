            "background": "This petition is to oppose the introduction of an additional charge for broadband use as part of any plan to stamp out music and film piracy.\n\nThe creation of a quango, paid for by a charge that could amount to \u00a320 a year per broadband connection. Paid for by everyone who has a broadband connection to act as a broker between music and film companies and internet service providers (ISPs). It would provide data about serial copyright-breakers to music and film companies if they obtained a court order. It would be paid for by a levy on ISPs, who inevitably would pass the cost on to consumers. \nCopyright is a civil offense not a criminal one the government should not be allowed to levy this charge to enable companies to sue individuals.",
