            "background": "It was revealed recently in the New York Times that the US and the EU are close to an agreement about letting the American authorities have greater access to the personal information of EU citizens.  This would allow their law enforcement & security agencies to see more easily people's financial transactions, internet surfing habits & travel histories.  \n\nThough measures are being taken for there to be safeguards in place, I believe this is a gross invasion of the privacy of British citizens.  I believe it is wrong to hand over our personal information to a foreign power, even an ally.",
