        "background": "Would it not be cheaper to pay off everyones mortgage in the UK rather than throw billions to banks who then waste it.\n\nThis would then give people more money to spend so that high street stores like Woolworths etc do not go bust.Banks would then have money to lend to businesses and people, and those\nwho wish to buy their first home.\n\n\u00a380 million pounds is cheaper than 30 billion pounds. which is the money being thrown at some banks!!!!!!!!! and it seems there's more money going to be thrown their way as well.",
