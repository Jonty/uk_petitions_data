            "background": "Most stories of child sexual abuse never become public. But as many as 95% of cases, where a child does make a disclosure of sexual abuse, never make it to court because the child is an unreliable witness. On best estimates only 10% of offenders are prosecuted and only half of these are actually convicted. Obviously somethings not working! We need to protect our children better. Make polygraph testing mandatory and give our children the chance of a silent witness and the justice they deserve.",
