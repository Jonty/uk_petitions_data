We are asking the Prime Ministerto propose to parliament an investigation into the possibility of a MP's Hall of Residence in the capital.  Giving all MP's a London base from which to live in when in the capital on business.  This would replace the need for second homes in London and also ensure that MPs are working for their constituants and not for their own personal gain.  If an MP decides not to take up this offer of accomodation then they have to pay their own expenses for a London home address.",
