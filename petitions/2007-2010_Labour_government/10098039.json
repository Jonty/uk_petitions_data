            "background": "Crown servants, e.g. Customs, Immigration and, presumably, the new UKBA/UKBF are generally trustworthy members of Government Departments and Agencies. It is inappropriate for their efficiency, effectiveness and, indeed, image to be impaired by having to comply with the same restrictions imposed on cleaners and baggage handlers, particularly at \"Thiefrow\", often in plain view of the public. It is noted that similar procedures are not enforced on the police following their insistence that it was inappropriate for individuals holding the Queen's warrant, as the procedures are being operated by employees of a public company. If it is inappropriate for the police, it is equally inappropriate for Crown servants that the police are legally required to assist. The Department for Transport should be censured for their part in imposing restrictions on their Crown colleagues.",
