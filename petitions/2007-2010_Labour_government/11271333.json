This cowardly terrorist attack killed 21 people, injured 182.\n\nA warning was given but far too late to evacuate the pubs which were full of young people enjoying a night out.\n\nNo one has been brought to justice.\n\nWith the advancement of Forensic Science and DNA profiling , we feel that now is the time to reopen the case and bring some sense of closure to the people of Birmingham and to the families of the victims who have been all but forgotten.",
