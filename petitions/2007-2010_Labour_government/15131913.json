            "background": "to change the way social housing is funded instead of all the rent being taken by the social housing provider, but instead have an individual repair pot for each property. So that each property has a pot which is toped up each week from rent paid and the remainder of the rent is used for over heads.\n\nThese individual pots of money would then be used by the tenants to decide what works are needed for instant if new windows are required the works would be carried out once the repair pot has sufficent money to cover the works then the tenant and the social housing would then take part in tendering for the works to be commissioned that way at least work would get done as the funing comes direct from the teanant rather than waiting years for essential repairs to be done and no one would be left out.\n\ni hope this matter would be taken on board and given serious consideration.",
