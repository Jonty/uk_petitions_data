        "background": "There is a concentration of data centres and ISP services in the London area, but growth is being limited by power supply restrictions until after the Olympics.\n\nTo encourage entrepreneurs, for resilience, and growth of services after the current downturn, there should be a wider distribution of net services and data centres, across the UK (built near power plants), thus providing for new services, and backup, in case of power cuts or failures in the South East.\n\nFurther, to encourage small businesses and have an environmental benefit (encouraging teleworking, and internet based services / shops) Rural areas should get faster broadband to \"level the playing field\" compared with urban dwellers.  Cities already have many higher speed services, at 16/ 24 Mbps, plus cable, and fibre too.\n\nFTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet) should be funded by Government as infrastructure development for Rural areas first, followed by cities.",
