            "background": "We have drug and alcohol addicts on Incapacity Benefit (which pays more than JSA), most have free council housing getting their rents and council tax paid.\n\nWe have immigrants housed in luxury homes in London getting their rents and council tax paid.\n\nYet those made redundant like myself with a mortgage only get help with mortgage interest payments after 16 weeks \u2013 this stops us doing temporary work because you have to start a new claim when the work stops and then wait another 16 weeks to get mortgage help.  I also receive no help with Service Charges on my leasehold flat \u2013 over \u00a3500 a year yet those renting in my block of flats get their full rents paid.\n\nThe social security system needs to be reformed so that it encourages work and penalises the work shy.",
