            "background": "If fuel goes up, the fuel duty also rises. The duty on fuel should be set at a limit, (pence per litre) and NOT a percentage. The governments revenue from fuel duty has increased from \u00a30.39 / litre to nearly \u00a30.70 / litre since 1995, mainly from increases in oil prices. The government should decide how much is reasonable duty per litre and fix it there.",
