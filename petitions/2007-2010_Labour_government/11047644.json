            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Baby P (who cannot be named) was the victim of the most horrendous abuse by the very people who were there to safeguard him. His mother, her boyfriend and their lodger have been found guilty of causing Baby P's death. Baby P received more than 50 injuries including a broken back, 9 fractured ribs, fingernails missing, a severe moth injury, a ripped ear, extensive bruising and many others. The worst part of this story is that the child was on the child protection register due to previous suspicions by health authorities but they failed miserably in their role of protecting this baby and he died a horrible death as a result. This is the 2nd child within the same area of North London to have died due to severe abuse and both of which the health authorities were aware off. It is now time that the government takes measures to ensure that this does not happen again and that Baby P's life is not in vain.",
