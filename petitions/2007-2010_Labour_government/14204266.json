        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current system for insurance for younger drivers makes the sensible young drivers suffer for the show off young drivers by charging every driver who is under 25 years of age, a very high premium for there insurance. \n\nThe system needs to be changed so that good, responsible drivers should be charged less for insurance than bad, irresponsible drivers\n\nOne way in which this could be done for young drivers to be offered background checks to help prove that they are responsible. These checks could include school/colleague behavior records, if the driver has a criminal record and if the driver has ever had (or still has) an asbo ect...\n\nIf these checks are passed, a discount should be offered to the driver.\n\nNot only will all this stop young drivers being ripped off but it will also make young people think twice about committing anti-social small crimes, showing off in their cars and reducing the amount of uninsured drivers on the roads.",
