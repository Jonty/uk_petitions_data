            "background": "I propose that the law be amended so local authorities can take action against dog owners who fail to keep their dogs under control. Dog owners who fail to keep dogs on leads and muzzled should face legal action and be banned from keeping dogs if they are re-offenders. Also dogs that are not kept under control and cause damage to property or kill or hurt other animals should result in the owner facing legal action and the dog re-homed if necessary.",
