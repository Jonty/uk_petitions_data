It is one of the few sports readily accessible to the blind, non-ambulant and able bodied alike of all ages. \nIt is the only sport that contributes to the maintenance of our environment, in-directly by the purchasing of a Rod Licence and directly by the actions of its participants cleaning up the lakes and rivers they use. Furthermore, the collective pressure from anglers has forced the re-generation and cleanup of many polluted waterways which would otherwise have remained in their neglected states.\nAngling is for life, not just the angler\u2019s life but all life and as such should have the backing and support of all governments now and in the future. \nPlease support this petition?",
