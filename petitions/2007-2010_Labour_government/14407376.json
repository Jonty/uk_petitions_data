            "background": "We the undersigned request Prime Minister Gordon Brown to compel Warrington Borough Council to pay a rebate on Council Tax as they have failed in their obligation to provide essential services during December 2009 and January 2010. Due to their failure to clear and grit highways there was widespread chaos over the whole of the transport network in the Town. They have also failed to make any acceptable refuse collections during this cold spell leaving rubbish to accumulate in the streets creating an obvious health hazard and feeding ground for Rats.\n\nFurthermore, the Councils failure to provide these basic services has resulted in many elderly citizens and those less able bodied being left stranded and vulnerable in their homes.",
