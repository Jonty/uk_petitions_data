            "background": "The fare for the Heathrow Express (Express train linking London Paddington to Heathrow terminals) and Heathrow Connect (Stopping service linking West London with Heathrow terminals) is criminally high.\n\nOften quoted as the highest fares, per mile, of any railway worldwide.\n\nThis damages tourism, entices airport wokers to use their own transport, ie cars, and costs businesses even more to use Heathrow effectively.\n\nIncluding Heathrow overground rail links within the TFL zoning areas, such as zone 6 (the same as current LU stations) will make this fair and transparent.\n\nThe current system just allows BAA to make more money from their monopoly over London's airlinks.",
