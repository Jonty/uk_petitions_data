It proposes de-institutionalising all children in a nil overall cost approach.   \n\nIt derives from our advocacy for social capitalism, delivered 12 years ago to President Clinton.  \n\nIt is regrettable to find so much obstruction within UK government, from government departments, MPs, APPGs and most recently our FCO who simply disregard that which the Prime Minister himself advocates. More regrettable still, that one of the signatories to the call for action hosts a smear blog  condemning a social business.\n\nWe ask that the government recognise and  support social business efforts which remain so far off radar, still.",
