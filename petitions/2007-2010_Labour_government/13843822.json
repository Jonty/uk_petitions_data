            "background": "VAT was meant to be for luxury goods and whilst I appreciate that owning a pet is a privilege I totally disagree with having to VAT on vets bills.\n\nIf an animal is poorly then it is a neccesity to try and make them better as soon as possible. By adding VAT on top of already high bills I feel the government is suggesting that owning a healthy animal is a luxury!!\n\nPlease could you consider removing or reducing the amount of VAT on all essential veterinary treatment.\n\nThank you",
