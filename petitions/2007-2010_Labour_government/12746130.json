            "background": "It is now clear that the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has lost control of his party and a portion of his cabinet. There have been four resignations from the cabinet for various reasons, some ambiguous and some not so. This culminates in our unelected Prime Minister (with no mandate from the electorate) with a chancellor he does not want. Alistair Darling appears to have blackmailed Gordon Brown in to allow him to keep his job. How can this be construed as being in any way good for the country?\n\nDo not sign this petition purely on the recent expenses scandal as this is a cross-party issue.",
