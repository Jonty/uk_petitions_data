            "background": "The current gift allowance of \u00a3145 per person travelling into the UK from outside the EU has been in place and unadjusted for inflation for more than 5 years. The amount is extremely low in relation to current goods prices and international practice. Since customs rarely enforce it they are effectively condoning mass law breaking by the large numbers of people who travel into the UK every year. This is surely not the intent of legislation and should be immediately revised to act in it's original intent which is to prevent the smuggling of goods, not effectively encourage it across the population! A figure in the \u00a3500-1000 ballpark might seem more appropriate.",
