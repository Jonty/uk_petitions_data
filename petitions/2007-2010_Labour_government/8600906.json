        "action": "oppose the biotech firms lobbying to keep GM trial site locations hidden from the public",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "By bowing to pressure from biotech firms and offering to hide GM trial locations from the public, our elected representatives are showing greater concern for the biotech industry than for their voters. Opposition to the introduction of GM food in the UK has been well-documented but public opinion has largely been ignored.\n\nEncouraging more firms to trial GM crops in the UK will benefit large corporations, many of which are based overseas, rather than UK-based consumers and the farmers and business owners who could suffer as a result of the introduction of GM.\n\nThe risk of cross-pollination would prevent food producers from labelling their products as organic, putting them out of business and giving consumers less choice. Farmers growing GM crops may eventually be dependent on the biotech firms who produce them, and the herbicides and pesticides they were engineered to be used with.\n\nWe do not believe the long-term consequences have been considered, and urge the Prime Minister to engage in an open debate with UK citizens, make information on GM trials publicly available, and to give UK citizens more power to oppose changes in the laws and policies concerning them.",
