        "background": "Mr Darling in his wisdom is giving everyone a \u00a3600 rise on their tax allownaces, how nice of him :-). For the low income this will mean they will pay \u00a3120 less :-), for the higher tax payer this would mean  they too would pay \u00a3120 less.\n\nBut Mr Darling is reducing the higher tax payers threshold by \u00a31,200 (sourced from inland revenue) to balance the books so there is no gain of the \u00a3120 for us.\n\nAaah but, Mr Darling by reducing the rate at \u00a31,200 is going to take off you the tidy sum of \u00a3480 more per year in tax, less the \u00a3120 that you cannot gain.  This means for all you 40p in the pound tax payers YOU WILL BE PAYING \u00a3360 more in tax for not gaining \u00a3120.\n\nThe reduction to cancel out the \u00a3120 gain should only be \u00a3300 reduction of the threshold.  \n\nIt doesn't take a genius to know that we are being ripped of here. \n\nSay no to the \u00a31,200 reduction and yes to \u00a3300. So all is fair.\n\nSend this on and register your vote.",
