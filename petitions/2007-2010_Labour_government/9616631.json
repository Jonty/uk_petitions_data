            "background": "Many churches who do not occupy listed buildings are doing a great amount of community work, paid for by volunteers, and they are still having to pay VAT on everything they purchase to carry out that work. Due to this, many churches find it no longer possible to continue with this valuable free asset to many local communities. This is definitely wrong and should be amended as soon as possible.",
