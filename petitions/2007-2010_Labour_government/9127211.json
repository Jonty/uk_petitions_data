        "background": "This is a petition against the Police shutting down a disproportionate amount of black own clubs and Urban themed events through loop holes in how night club incidents and situations are managed.\n\nFor Non black clubs if there is a spate of consistent trouble, the police COOPERATE with the clubs and offer their presence to ward off trouble makers. \nBLACK CLUBS ARE DUE THE SAME SUPPORT, not victimisation.\n\nThis is evident by actions taken by Brixton Police against Brockwells Wine Bar in south London (Featured in London Lite newspaper, Tues 11th March '08). Weekly occurrences of young HOODED gangs (about 20-30 strong) attempting to storm in without paying or getting searched. The Police were slow to attend, if they did attend.\n\nThen when drastic procedures were put in place by the club and WERE WORKING,\nThe Police then conducted 'Sting Operations' with the INTENT of finding grounds to shut down the establishment.\nMany more clubs have been shut down for no apparent reason\u2026Why?",
