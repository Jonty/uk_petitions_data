        "background": "The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 introduced a deadline for the recording of historic rights of way on definitive maps (the legal record of public rights of way).  After 1 January 2026 most pre-1949 paths which have not been recorded on these maps will be lost forever.  An estimated 20,000 paths could be lost because of this measure, including many in towns and cities.  The government funded project to assist with the researching and recording of these routes has been terminated without recording a single path but when the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill was going through Parliament the then Minister, Michael Meacher said \u201c \u2026 we do not intend to [bring definitively to a close the exercise of determining the rights of way network] without ensuring that there are adequate resources to make it possible for all existing paths that can reasonably be found to be found.\u201d  The public therefore had a legitimate expectation that something would be done to record the so-called lost ways.  Now that the promised resources have been withdrawn repeal of the cut-off date is essential.",
