            "background": "Low to mid income families are being punished for travelling. I have a 22 year old 4x4 which I need for off road. I do LESS than 3000 miles a year on road. Why should I pay more than a 1 litre eco car that does 10,000 miles a year? I am not using any more fuel in that year, my car has not needed to be renewed even once. The government knows it costs to build new roads, but it earns by taxation. So to remove cars from the road tax them off and they will not need more roads. The is morally corrupt as the rich can still afford to keep expensive big boys toys and chelsea tractors on the road. Road tax should be based on annual mileage recorded on MOT certificates, and fuel duty and vat on fuel should be totally scrapped as we all pay tax on our earnings already. ONE TAX so we can all understand it!",
