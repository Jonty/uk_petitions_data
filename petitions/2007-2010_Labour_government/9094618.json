            "background": "We believe that only The Stig is eligible to be the Minister for Transport.  Others have tried and failed to provide this country with an effective transport system and now Britain's motoring morale and trust is at an all time low.  We feel that the only way to help restore this great nation to it's rightful place as the beacon of worldwide democracy, fair play, stiff upper lip in the face of adversity, cream teas and all round jolly decent chaps is to start by making The Stig Minister for Transport for life.",
