            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Outsourcing contracts should only be allowed to be signed between EU member states - not countries outside of the EU. For example, no more outsourcing services permited from India, China. If companies want to outsource portions of the work force it must be done within EU member nations where common laws and understanding exist for consumer rights, quality and standards.\n\nOutsourcing from countries that lack any existance of consumer rights in their own countries, have been invading and downgrading customer rights in all fields of services in the EU, causing tremendous frustrations. It has had a disastrous effect where services and obligations for companies have declined to an all time low, not to mention safety issues where personal data is being stolen or lost.\n\nOutsourcing must also be reduced to a limited percentage of the actual work force in the company (ex. 10-20% in total). Not only would it protect employments in EU, but it would also demand companies to take more responsibility of consumer rights.",
