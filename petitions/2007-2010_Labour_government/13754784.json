            "background": "Many elderly people and those with disabilities cannot access conventional bus services and are adversely affected compared to more able bodied people, with concessionary bus passes. It seems unfair that those with the greatest need receive the worst treatment. Community transport schemes are more expensive to run and often users pay up to twice what they might pay could they use conventional bus services which they, could, of course, use for free.",
