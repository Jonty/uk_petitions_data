            "background": "Lane discipline in the UK is frankly awful. Few people drive as the highway code and the law demands by driving in lane 1 except when overtaking. Such behaviour is wasteful and dangerous. Sections of the M1 and M25 have recently been widened to four and five lanes at the cost of hundreds millions of pounds but are effectively reduced to two lanes, by drivers travelling at slow speeds along in lanes 3 and 4. This encourages overtaking vehicles to either break the law by passing on the left, or to filter past in the only available outside lane. At best it negates the massive investment in our road system, at worst it provokes dangerous frustration in other road users.\n\nThe government should make enforcement of good lane discipline a priority for the police forces who patrol our crowded motorways.",
