        "background": "Why should patients have to pay to park in a hospital car park?? As an out-patient myself I think it's ludicrous that we have to pay to park. As I have to go to the hospital once a week for physio and to pick up my medication and every 4 months for a check up. As a disabled person it's very expensive from \u00a32.00 upto \u00a38.00. I can't believe I have to pay \u00a32 everytime I need a blood test. It's very unacceptable, so therfore I think all UK hospital should have free parking!!!",
