            "background": "The Ministry of Defence has announced plans to move the Squadron from or current site on Stanley Road in Teddington, and collocate us with the Army Cadet Force in some new premises being built on their site on London Road in Twickenham. Having viewed the plans, it is clear if this happens, we will lose our band as we have nowhere to practice lose our Flight Simulator have nowhere to keep our Minibus that is essential for many of our activities have to change our Parade nights and be restricted in some of the activities we currently offer our 40 cadets. Firstly the background. We have been in discussions with Strawberry Hill Golf Club, from whom the Squadron leases the land we occupy. Negotiations have since continued between the Golf Club and the Ministry of Defence but no agreement has been forthcoming: hence the proposal, by the MOD, that the Squadron moves. Our Squadron was formed in 1941 and we have been at our current site for 35 years.",
