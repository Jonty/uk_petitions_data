        "background": "we feel as a pagan community that the Ban witchcraft petition on your web site locating http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/Ban-witchcraft/ is a petition of religious Hatred and intolerance, if we were any other religion such as Muslim or Christian this petition would have been removed within moments. but the same courtesy is not given to pagans and our rights are repeatedly breached As far as I am aware the promotion of religious hatred is illegal now in this country and therefore the aims and publishing of the above petition are verging on illegal and not something peoplr would expect to see on a Government web site being advocated at public expense, So please Remove the ban-witch craft Petition from your site.",
