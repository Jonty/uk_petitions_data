            "background": "I have noticed a trend of recent where general discontent regarding Immigration into the UK has been focused upon Eastern European Workers; they seem to have become the Reporters' 'soft target' for immigration 'discontent reporting'.The Television and Some Newspapers seem to feel they can comment in any way about Eastern European workers in a way that would be consirered Racist and inflammatory if it was targeted against other Immigrant groups.\nThe government should have the power to prevent the Media from stimulating hatred by the use of inflamitory reporting of Easten European Workers activities within the UK.",
