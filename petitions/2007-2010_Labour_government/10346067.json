        "background": "The Gurkhas have fought as part of the British military forces, and died for their loyalty. those that have survived should NEVER be denied the option to settle in this country, and there should be no question that they have earned the right to do so..it beggers beleif, when we hear that terrorists are being given asylum here, when the government know, the motives behind their claims to be allowed to settle. Yet a Gurkha, who has fought for the honour of this country, and died beside regulars of our own armed forces are being scrutinised, and even having to take legal action to secure their right to live here..this is wrong, and their request to settle here in Great Britain should not be questioned, opposed or even considered for rejection. to do this is to turn our backs on a faithful and honourable race of people. i urge the government to allow any request to go un hindered",
