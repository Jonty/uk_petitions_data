Yet a Gurkha, who has fought for the honour of this country, and died beside regulars of our own armed forces are being scrutinised, and even having to take legal action to secure their right to live here..this is wrong, and their request to settle here in Great Britain should not be questioned, opposed or even considered for rejection. to do this is to turn our backs on a faithful and honourable race of people. i urge the government to allow any request to go un hindered",
