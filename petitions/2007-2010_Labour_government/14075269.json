        "background": "To create standard application forms for all schools across counties, governments and NHS departments.  Having sent approximately 20 applications a month for the last 6 months - it is time wasting having to fill out the a different application forms each time.  Also it must be hard for people with learning disabilities or dyslexia or similar problems going through the same processes.  None of them accepted a CV and I had to fill out a new form each time.  As I am 53 this year there is a lot of information on jobs and training that I just have to repeat each time and a lot of time spent on each application.  I think there should be a standard form across the UK that everyone has to use.  Meaning I only have to fill it out once.  It should also be computer friendly as I found some forms were not - having been \"hand made\" and able to be completed on the computer not just by hand.",
