            "background": "On 6 Dec, Crisis Group published \"Kosovo Countdown: A Blueprint for Transition\", a report analysing the time - tabled transition to conditional independence in 2008 and offering a detailed step-by-step guide on how this can be achieved and implemented. Kosovo\u2019s transition to the status of supervised, independence has been greatly complicated by Russia\u2019s firm support of Serbia\u2019s refusal to accept that it has lost its one-time province. Recognition of conditional independence has broad international, and certainly European Union (EU) and American, support, particularly given the strong military presence in Afghanistan.\n\nUnder threat of Moscow\u2019s veto, the Security Council will not revoke its Resolution 1244 of 1999 that acknowledged Serbian sovereignty while setting up the UN Mission (UNMIK). \n\nIf the Security Council is unlikely to approve Kosovo's independence, \ndevised by the Secretary-General\u2019s special representative, Martti Ahtisaari, authorising EU-led missions meant to implement that plan, the petitioner is calling on the UK govt to consider the options outlined in this report and outline policy. Hope this helps !",
