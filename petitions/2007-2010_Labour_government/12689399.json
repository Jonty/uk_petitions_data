            "background": "As a nation we (the public) are becoming increasingly frustrated with the poor sentencing of convicted child killers. Like many other country's, we (the british public) want to see execution brought back into play. This will not only provide England with a better financial future, but will free up the pressure of the over-crowing within our prisons (meaning criminals will be duely sentenced for other crimes)but will be the ultimate deterant towards minimising the deaths of approximately 4 children in our country each and every week. These killers are also entitled to new identites upon release (at the taxpayers expense) and are given a home in another country which is appauling, when will the government listen to us as good british citizens?",
