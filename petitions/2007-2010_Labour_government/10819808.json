            "background": "For 5 years government departments have been running with two separate systems for various areas. \n\nFor instance in the CSA there is an old system which is complex and needs expertise and input from staff and parents whereas the newer system is a simple calculation that would require minimum staff input and parent involvement.  The CSA rules mean that cases can't be transferred to the new system. Keeping two systems in any environment doubles the workload and is effectively job creation. A simpler system should stop as many errors, save time and taxpayers money. Transfers could easily be made when peoples circumstances change. \n\nThis is only one example where government departments are wasting taxpayers money. \n\nAs a start a firm commitment is required from ministers to push the changes to the CSA otherwise the department may continue to drag its heels. Other departments should address any duplicate systems and confirm to ministers there is no areas where two systems are employed where one would suffice. Real savings could be made in moving to simpler systems especially where they are already in place.",
