            "background": "Miscarriage is so very common.  Yet there is no specific counselling for women, partners and their families when this devastating event happens. Many women develop depression after miscarriage.  Depression can alter not only the life of the woman that has undergone the miscarriage but the  lives of the family and friends of the bereaved woman.\n\nA woman sitting in a doctors surgery awaiting to see a doctor due to the after effects of miscarriage is confronted with posters on whom to contact if you: are pregnant and a smoker, are pregnant and are aged between 16 -19, are pregnant and are considering abortion. Post natal help and guidance. Contraception advice.  WHY IS THERE NOTHING FOR THOSE WOMEN DESPERATELY NEEDING PHYISCAL AND EMOTIONAL HELP AFTER MISCARRIAGE?  \n\nAs we (the bereaved) are frequently reminded that miscarriage is so common. It would seem that we are we expected just to get on with it?  Not good enough...some of us need more.",
