        "background": "Professor Nutt was unfairly forced to step down by Home Secretary Alan Johnson on account of releasing evidence which didn't correspond with Government policy. The withholding of such information is frankly Soviet, as is removing all those who have any views different to those of the party. We petition the government to either reinstate Prof. David Nutt in his former, rightful position in which he has done nothing out of place, and we ask for a formal apology from Home Secretary, Alan Johnson.",
