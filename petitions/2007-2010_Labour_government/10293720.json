The next nearest offices, if closure goes ahead, will involve a    lengthy journey through rural countryside that will be costly for people struggling on benefits.   The Belper Jobcentre provides advice to the elderly and to other essential public services providing a signposting service for the most needy in society.  \n       It must remain open!",
