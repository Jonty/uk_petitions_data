            "background": "The current level of Carers Allowance is disgracefully low..and in no way covers all the 'additional needs' that carers of chronically sick individuals..have to pay out. For example children like my own who have their own oxygen-machine..unable to crawl or move at all..who need heating on 24/7..who need special equipment..with very little support from Social Services..it would cost 'The State' about \u00a34,000 a week to look after my daughter..so why can't we be allowed a bit more financial support? There are many, many families out there like us who are despeate for help. The Government talk about putting children first and at the same time are completely ignoring the needs of hundreds of thousands of families across the country..",
