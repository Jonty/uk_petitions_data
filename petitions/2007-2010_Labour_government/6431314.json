            "background": "The e-petitions system was launched in November 2006.  They seem to have led to no change in policy or direction by the Government and accordingly have wasted the time of many people who have believed that they are taking part in a serious process.  In some cases, even the Government response to an e-petition has shown a lack of understanding of the issue in question.\n\nQuite apart from this, the process clogs up e-mail systems.\n\nWe vote for our politicians to run our country to the best of their ability.  they should get on with their jobs, and we should get on with ours.",
