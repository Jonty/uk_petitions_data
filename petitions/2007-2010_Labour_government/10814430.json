            "background": "This vaccination could save lives!  One may object that regular cervical smears have prevented many deaths; this is true but they are not infallible.  No one has any control over who their parent(s) is/are or what his/her/their views on any issue might be.  There are some, possibly many, issues where that might be less important but I feel, very strongly indeed, that in a life-or-death issue such as this the welfare of the child(ren) is FAR more important than parental autonomy and should, therefore, greatly supersede it.  It would be illegal to deprive a child of education simply due to parental views; in my opinion the same stance should be taken on this.",
