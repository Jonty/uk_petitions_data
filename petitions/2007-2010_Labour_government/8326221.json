London, historically known for being the capital of England, in my and many other peoples opinions is now simply a tourist hotspot with the english culture being driven out of it to the suburbs. Living in Sheffield I see the celebrations for St. Patrick's Day with Guinness Tents and promotions everywhere, with everybody joining in. But when it comes to St George's Day the nation seems to turn a blind eye and its overshadowed by St. Patrick's Day, All I'm asking is that the country recognise on April 23rd its a time to look back at our heritage, how England used to be without all the problems that are arising today.\n\nBring . Back . England",
