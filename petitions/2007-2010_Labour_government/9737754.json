Everything we do is aimed ultimately at making ourselves happy whether it's getting rich or getting married.\n\nRecent scientific research has uncovered many of the mysteries of happiness, we know what people need in order to be happy, we also know what people can do to make themselves happy. Happy behaviour ties up with the changes in lifestyle that we need to stop climate change. Focusing on happiness rather than wealth could also help to solve many of our social problems.\n\nThe happiness of the population is measurable and the government should have targets to reach in increasing happiness. There is a limited amount of wealth in existence, but the amount of happiness available is only limited by our willingness to act.\n\nHappiness for all must surely be the ultimate goal of democracy!",
