        "background": "People who lie in order to get elected are fraudsters. \nPeople who have been elected and tell lies are fraudsters. \nFraudsters are not fit to hold public office and, by their fraudulent actions, they undermine the belief of the citizenry in democracy and the democratic ideal. They are, in fact, enemies of democracy. The law seems not to take action against these individuals despite the hugely negative impact they have on this nation. We, the undersigned, therefore call on the government to improve democracy by making it a criminal offence to knowingly tell an untruth in order to get elected, or to tell an untruth when elected.",
