            "background": "Since the rating was introduced some 50 years ago there has been no evidence produced to suggest the IMC rating is unsafe. \n\nIt would seem patently obvious that UK pilots should be entitled to undertake further training which at the very least would enable them to cope with un-forecast changes in the weather. They should also be able to plan their flight to take advantage of the safest conditions - for example flying at higher altitudes in good visibility rather than scud running beneath the base.\n\nControlled flight into terrain remains one of the greatest causes of aircraft accidents and almost always results in the pilot and passengers being killed. There is ample evidence to suggest that these accidents are far less likely to occur if pilots are trained and licensed to fly in IMCs.\n\nFor these reasons there are many pilots who consider the loss of these privileges to be disastrous. There are those who believe so far as UK pilots are concerned it will be the single most dangerous development in licensing that has ever taken place.",
