            "background": "I would like to say how I think that the school timings for secondary schools should be timed differant, it should be from 12pm to 6 pm. I have several reasons why I think this.\n\n- Children are too tired in the morning to have to work to the best of their ability.\n\n- Children will be more awake and ready for the school day.\n\n- Parents could pick there children up from school after they have finished work, so then children that dont have a oyster card wont have to pay \u00a32.\n\nPlease take this petition seriously, and reply as soon as posiible",
