            "background": "In an historic debate on 03/18/2003 Parliament took the illegal decision to invade and occupy Iraq.  The war that followed has led to the destruction of Iraq and the violent deaths of at least 1.2 million Iraqi citizens, including 400,000 children.  That massacre of innocent civilians now ranks as the worst atrocity in British history.  \n\nAll war is illegal - 1928 International Treaty for the Renunciation of War - to which Britain is a signatory is still in force. The advice that, essentially, the UN Security Council authorised 'all necessary means to restore international peace and security in the area,' is blatantly false: Res. 678 (1990) CEASED to apply once Iraq had been forced out of Kuwait in the first Gulf War.) In reality the UNSC is a PEACEKEEPING body forbidden by its charter to authorise or use military force - Articles 2.3. and 2.4",
