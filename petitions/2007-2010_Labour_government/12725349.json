            "background": "There are approximately 20million people in the United Kingdom aged over 50. The Government will pay each person aged 50 or over the sum of \u00a31million in severance for permanent retirement subject to the following stipulations:\n\nEach person must -\n\n*If in work, retire to create new job openings. (up to 20m new jobs - unemployment fixed).\n\n*Buy a new British car. (20m new cars, British auto industry fixed).\n\n*Buy a house for cash or pay off their mortgage (New loans available - housing crisis fixed).\n\n*Send their children/grandchildren to school, college and university (Crime rate fixed).\n\n*Purchase \u00a350 worth of fuel or drink or tobacco per week (Increased revenues, economy fixed).\n\nSuch a move will save giving billions more to banks and to squander on lavish parties and unearned bonuses, and MPs will need no longer feel shame for exaggerating their expenses once the economy recovers.",
