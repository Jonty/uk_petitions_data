        "background": "Much research has linked fluoride to brain disorders, bone cancer, thyroid disruption and further medical problems. Whilst some studies have linked a reduction in tooth decay with the addition of fluoride to water, other studies have shown that rates of tooth decay have reduced at a similar rate in countries where fluoride is not added to the water system.\nA more acceptable and ethical alternative would be to subsidise dental products for low-income families.\nTherefore we propose that the PM rejects  the plans to compulsorily medicate the UK with this known endocrine disruptor.",
