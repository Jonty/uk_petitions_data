            "background": "Suffolk Constabulary has removed the rights of Special Constables to use emergency vehicle equipment (i.e. blue lights) due to accidents of police vehicles occuring whilst being driven by Special Constables. This creates an awful public perception upon the police due to the fact that moving traffic offences can occur right infront of the Special Constables but are unable to stop vehicles due to the forcewide ban on using the emergency equipment. Therefore, Specials are required to call upon regular police officers to leave their present location and travel to the Specials unit in order to stop the vehicle. This is an awful waste of police time and resources dealing with minor crime which the special constables are more than capable of dealing with thereselves.",
