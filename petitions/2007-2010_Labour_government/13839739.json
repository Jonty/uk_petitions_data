She has worked extremely hard in supporting pensioners and if anyone can get our message accross she can. Pensioners are surviving on less than 40% of the basic wage, when immigrants, the feckless, and the layabouts are being rewarded for being lazy or bone idle. If this gov'nt really wants to earn our respect it must listen to someone who speaks up for us.",
