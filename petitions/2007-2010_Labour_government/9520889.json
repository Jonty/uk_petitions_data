            "background": "The November Queen's Speech is due to contain a Data Communications Bill, part of which outlines plans by the Home Office to create a national database storing records of every telephone call, text message, and email sent and received in the UK for up to 12 months. The Government claims this will aid security by speeding up law enforcement access to communications between suspected criminals and terrorists.\n\nSuch a proposal would be a hideous invasion of our privacy, belonging more to Orwell\u2019s 1984 than reality.\n\nInternet and mobile phone networks provide information security as a result of their decentralized nature; given the Government\u2019s proven inability to keep private information safe, a central database would be vulnerable to loss or theft.\n\nApproximately 57 billion text messages are sent in the UK each year, and 3 billion emails each day. The technology required to store such a volume of information would be extremely costly, and a gross waste of public money.",
