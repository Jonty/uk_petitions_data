            "background": "As a small business could we bring to your attention the devasting effect that the removal of rate relief for unoccupied premises has had and will continue to have on businesses,  The reason for the abolition of this relief has now been outdated by events and the economic climate.If relief is not re-instated, businesses which could otherwise survive will go under. The effect is one of \"kicking a man when he is down\" If the premises are not generating income, how can they afford to pay rates? Removal and storage companies have been hit harder than most as the collapse of the property market has preceeded the main recession.This is one that could put the long established companies out of business because of the abolition of the rate relief.",
