            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "LLU is the process of ISP's installing their own equipment into your local telephone exchange. This means that high internet speeds (the 20MB headline figure advertised) become available to you, instead of the 8MB of the BT equipment you are restricted to if your exchange is not unbundled. Current rates of unbundling in the UK vary from 98% in London to 28% in NI, with most regions at around 35-40%. However, within most regions, LLU is heavily biased in favour of larger exchanges because it has been left as a commercial decision of the ISP whether to commit to LLU on a given exchange. This has left many rural communities without any access to the next generation of high speed internet. With the Govt now seeing good quality broadband as important as basic utilities, will the Govt act on this and prevent a significant proportion of the UK population being left behind.",
