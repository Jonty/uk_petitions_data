For example the taxes and bills of a single person are almost the same as those for a family yet their benefits are nil. A single person is unlikely to use many services and obviously does not have children so by rights their taxes should be low. They should not be paying high taxes to subsidise families (especially those who continously produce children that they expect the tax payer to pay for) especially when no help is given to them. None of this fair.",
