        "background": "A certain amount of regulation is right and proper but complying with it can be expensive and it is always important to check whether a given piece of regulation has become irrelevant or disproportionate.  \n\nUnnecessary cost is something that businesses can do without just now.\n\nWe therefore call on the government to meet with representatives of businesses of a range of sizes in a range of industries from all over the country to discuss with them how the regulatory environment is working and whether any changes can be made.  \n \nChanges made need not end up costing the earth but may, in some cases, make the difference between collapse and survival for individual businesses \u2013 good news for their customers, employees and the economy in general.",
