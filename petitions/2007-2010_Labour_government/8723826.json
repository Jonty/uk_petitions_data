            "background": "All Councils are in a process of setting targets for Local Area Agreements (LAA's). Central government has given councils and the Local Strategic Partnerships (LSP's) until September to finalise the LAA's and how they will commission service delivery and from whom.  A number of voluntry organisations have been delivering projects funded by LSP's via NRF budgets - NRF finishes on 31st March 08. Although some larger Vol Orgs may have enough reserves to keep and relocate staff, most will need to make staff redundant. This will mean that the likelihood of a range of Vol Orgs being able to be commissioned to deliver services is a forlorn hope.",
