        "background": "Recently I couldn't use my meistro card at the airport. Reason given... It was being used at an airport..Truly!\nDays later in the machine declined paying out. Reason...I was using the card abroad..Astonishing! A bright manager agreed to pay me \u00a350 for my inconvenience.. \nToday I attempted to buy a flight from Croatia. Spent half an hour faffing with the online purchase before noting the carrier doesn't  accept the  Meistro when purchasing tickets priced in Euros. I then did a ring around to get family to pay for the card so as avoid the 15 euro fee(2 tickets) for using my barclaycard. 1o minutes later and with the new details in hand I attempted to make the payment.. Guess what..?? In the time taken the price had gone up. As I panicked and didn't want the plane to fill up I paid with my barclaycard costing me the extra 15 euro.  So.... Extra airfair plus extra card fees because Firstdirect only deal in secondrate cards.With a Barclays Connect none of this would have happened.\n\nI complained. I spoke to a number of poorly trained staff. One sensibly said a manager would contact me. Nobody  called. I rang. They said if I had a problem it is with the carrier..No apology was offered.",
