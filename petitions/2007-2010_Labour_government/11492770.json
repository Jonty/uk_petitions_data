            "background": "We the undersigned recognise that current street lighting is designed to illuminate both the sky as well as the ground and that more \u201csky friendly\u201d lighting would reduce electricity requirements helping to reduce green house gasses and produces savings in council tax for all citizens. A target of a 20% reduction in lighting costs should be set to be achieved before the London Olympics so that all visitors to the UK can see the night sky. Such savings can be made by reducing the hours street lights are switched on for, dimming lights down, replacing with different lighting systems, removal of excessive and over bright security lighting which only makes it easier for criminals to see where they are going etc. We call upon Her Majestys Government to require all local authorities to reduce their spending on powering of street lights by at least 20% by January 2012.",
