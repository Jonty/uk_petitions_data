The accomodation would be immediately forfeit once a member leaves the house. The accomodation would be as close to parliament as possible, but should not exceed being a one bedroom flat. A sofa bed, and en-suite within an MP's office would suffice. No payment, payment in kind, gifts or services will be received in lieu of accomodation. In view of the accomodations close proximity to The House, No travel claims would be honoured. No tax benefits are claimable. Should an MP wish to have other accomodation, then it is the MP's responsibility to fund it, No expense or tax claims can be made in any way shape or form on this accomodation.",
