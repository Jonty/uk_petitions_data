            "background": "Brian Haw on the 2nd June 2001 began a Peace Campaign on Parliament Square.  This witness has continued uninterrupted 24/7 since then \u2018For As Long As It Takes\u2019.  \n\nThe campaign of Brian Haw, and his most Honourable Colleagues, is for Love, Peace, Justice for all Versus Genocide Torture and the greatest crimes against Humanity. For Brian Haw Iraq was \u2018a Genocide too far\u2019. Dennis Halliday (Google him) called the U.N. imposed, USA/UK driven, sanctions against criminally destroyed Iraq, \u2018Genocide\u2019.\n\n8+ years on, after so many lies, wasted lives, it\u2019s time for truth.\n\nAll troops out of Iraq, Afghanistan et al, end rapacious wars of aggression (as per Nuremburg) that never should have started, restore Law, it\u2019s Time for Peace.\n\nThis steadfastness and determination to uphold this witness for peace deserves recognition and we urge that this recognition be his entry into The  House of Lords.",
