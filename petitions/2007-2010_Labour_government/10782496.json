            "background": "the farming of livestock is responsible for greater CO2 emissions than cars/planes & electricity combined. These animals produce methane and nitrous oxide which are a greater threat to the environment than CO2. It takes more food, feeding cattle, for human consumption, than is given back in the form of meat and dairy, and is a drain on the worlds water resources. People seem to think that by paying for trees to offset CO2 emissions they are doing their bit, yet quite happily & ignorantly continue   to consume animal products. If tax can be imposed on petrol and fossil fuels, then it should be also imposed on animal products. The biggest way any of us can make a difference is to stop eating these animals. It is about time the meat industries were forced to stop polluting this planet.",
