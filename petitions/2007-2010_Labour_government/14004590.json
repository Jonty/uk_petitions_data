            "background": "I would ask the Governmen to change the law on advertising on the TV / billboards / National Newspapers etc so that half naked women are used to sell products.  Women twirling around in bra and knickers to advertise stores should be only shown (if at all) after the watershed.  Our children should not be shown images that portray women with very little clothes on as a sex object which is advertising a perfume, a car, a brand of clothing from a shop etc...  How can women be taken seriously by men or indeed other women, if they are being bought up with images of car shows using incredibly scantily clad girls in front of the cars with absolutely no purpose other than to draw the croud in.  The way women are portrayed in advertising lines the way for this & the next generation to continue with the belief that women are there purely as beautiful accessories to use when a product need shifting from the shelves.",
