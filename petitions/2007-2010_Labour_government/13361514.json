            "background": "We request that there should be a ticket fare available for under twenty fives that has a thirty percent reduction on price at no extra cost. Unlike the young persons rail card that costs 29 pounds per year, We want a special rail fare available across the country that is specific for under 25's and that has a minimum of a thirty percent discount on the adult fare. We would also like the rail fare system to be looked at to accomodate young people.",
