            "background": "We believe people on income support/incapacity benefit need more leaniance. There have been a lot of cutbacks due to people who are actually not ill and not interested in finding work. This is having a dramatic effect on the people who are genuinely ill and recieve doctor's notes. This being the case, I believe the prime minister should have The Job Centre and related benefit companies reconsider some of the cutbacks, primarily the people who are actually ill and are being forced into work when not in a fit state to do so. Examples are people who have autism from birth and are suffering depression in later life. Many people with autism cannot handle on-the-spot demands and they simply cannot help this, and their problems are getting worse while being forced into work as they cannot keep a roof above their heads.",
