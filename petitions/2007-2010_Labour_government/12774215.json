            "background": "The RMT union (headed by Bob Crow) holds regular strikes that hold the country to ransom (please visit the news section of the RMT website for a 35 page listing of examples). The reasoning for these strikes is always flimsy and insubstantial. Each strike causes financial hardship for an already embattled British economy and I say that legislation should be brought in to make Bob Crow personally accountable for any financial loss suffered by the nation due to his union's irresponsible actions.",
