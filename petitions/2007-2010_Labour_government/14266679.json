Our family have now got to find another care home for him as Manorfields is closing down in March. Finding a new care home sounds simple..three other homes have closed already, the ones that haven't are private and my family along with many others cannot affford a minimum of \u00a3500 a week. Stop their home being closed down. These people who have fought for their country etc deserve a lot more than this.",
