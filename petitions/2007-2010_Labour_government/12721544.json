            "background": "Fuel prices are on the rise again; 98.9 currently near me and rising. This is, plainly and simply, totally unacceptable, especially for people (myself included) who have to use a car for work, and who have to commute a fair distance. It is also making life harder with regard to finances. I would like to see an immediate reduction in fuel prices (a permanent one, not just for 6 months), followed by a price cap. We pay enough (in some cases excessive) tax to keep our cars on the road as it is.",
