Cattle grids are extremely dangerous and potentially fatal to horses!\n\nEssex County Council is propsing the grids as a 'traffic calming measure' - something that could easily and cost effectively be achieved with the implementation of a speed limit.\n\nThere is no evidence that cattle grids are calming traffic - other than at the actual spot of the grid.\nThere is plenty of evidence as regards to how dangerous cattle grids are to horses and riders.\n\nSTOP THE CATTLE GRIDS!",
