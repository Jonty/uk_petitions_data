            "background": "This petition asks for a positive response in favour of the Goldstone Report and asks the PM and UK Government to support the Report, its adoption by the UN Security Council, and implementation of the recommendations made in the Report.  The seige of Gaza continues; a second request is to press (harder) for it to be lifted, on humanitarian grounds.\nThere are two existing petitions: to reject the Goldstone report, and to ask what is the UK government position.  Neither seek support for Goldstone, as this one does.  There appears to be no other facility in epetitions to vote against an existing petition, except to present an opposing petition like this.",
