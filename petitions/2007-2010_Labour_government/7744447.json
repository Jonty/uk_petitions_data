            "background": "While the penalty for using a hand held mobile phone remains so low many more accidents, injurys and deaths will occur.If the penalty were to be increased to \u00a3500 minimum it would encourage drivers to invest in a fully hands-free installation, costing about \u00a3150, therefore making worthwhile. Few drivers will pay out for a kit while its cheaper to pay a fine.The treasury would also benefit from the extra vat charged on the hands free kits.I call on the Government to increase the fine and promote hands free installations.",
