            "background": "Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Keith Whitehouse and I have been employed as a supply teacher for the last six years. I like many other supply teachers, have been made unemployed due to the policy of this Government in an effort to cut costs. Most parents are unaware that their children, are at some point in their timetable, being supervised and taught, in the majority, by unqualified staff (Cover Supervisors). Please be aware that while the Government speaks of 'Every child matters' and 'What's in the best interests of the child' reality is quite different! Please sign this petition and ensure your children are taught and supervised by qualified staff. Thank you for your support in this important matter.",
