            "background": "these types of vehicle are heavy so when it comes to accelerating into the fast lane they are slow at doing so ,which creates drivers already doing 70 mph on the motorway to brake which is dangerous ,also these types of vehicle are slower at braking due to their weight also making it dangerous for these vehicles to be in the fast lane of a motorway ,these type of vehicle are also very difficult to see around and see futher up the motorway.I think if the Government banned jeep's and mpv's from the fast lane of a motorway not only would it make driving in the fast lane safer , I think also it would affect peoples decision on buying jeep's and mpv's knowing they are not allowed in the fast lane which would result in a lower amount of gas guzzlers on the road thus saving the environment.",
