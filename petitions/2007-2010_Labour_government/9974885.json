        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The aim would be to introduce 2 or 3 booths in either direction at peak times to handle the large volume of left hand drive vehicles. During the night having 2 booths for R/H and 1 for L/H vehicles. Having this in place would also reduce the time wasted for british trucks queuing for foreign vehicles paying the toll. Some times as long as 5-10 mins. this is driving time lost and could be needed in order to complete the journey.",
