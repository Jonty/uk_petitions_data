            "background": "To lower the current rate of interest (4.8%) graduates working in the public sector have to pay on their student loans to fall in line with the incremental pay increase currently offered by the government of (approx) 2% (depending on sector).\n\nOr (and even better) raise the incremental pay increase of all public sector workers by 4.8% to become level with the retail price inflation - rate most commonly used in calculating rent, pensions, travel/transport, maintenance payments etc.\n\nPublic sector workers have been given a nominal pay 'increase' completely out of line with current inflation rates that will result in a continual cut in the real living standards of the most important, hard-working and under-valued members of the UK workforce.",
