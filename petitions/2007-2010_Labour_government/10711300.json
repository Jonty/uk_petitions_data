            "background": "Cord blood cells are \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 cells found in the umbilical cord of a baby, and have the ability to develop into bone marrow once transplanted into a patient. Because these cells are na\u00efve it means the risk of rejection and graft vs. host disease is reduced; it also means that donor-recipient matching is less stringent, thus making it easier to transplant rare tissue types, Asians and Afro-Caribbean patients.\n\nThe collection procedure is non-invasive and harmless to the mother and baby, and can save the lives of thousands of children. It is a shame that in a developed and technologically advanced country as the UK, we waste such a safe and readily available source of life. \n\nImagine all the opportunities missed to save children\u2019s lives when each day the NHS incinerates thousands of umbilical cords as waste.\n\nPlease help save lives by signing this petition, you have nothing to lose, but thousands out there have a lot to gain.\n\nFinally, when this petition becomes law, please remember to donate your baby\u2019s cord blood and save a life!",
