            "background": "I believe that as the Olympics are coming to London that they should show the best of Britishness. What is this country coming to the government is too politicaly correct and they do not want to offend other faiths. My point is that most muslims, jews, christians, buddists an sikhs in this country are BRITISH born and it is only a small minority that might be offended. Why? As they have choosen to come to this country to have an education, to find work and to use one of the best health services in the world, so why take offence when we want to display our patriotism in our own counrty.",
