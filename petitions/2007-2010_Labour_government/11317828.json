        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I am very concerned about the errosion of rights the recent spate of anti-terrorist laws have had on fundamental rights, such as that which has extended the period a person can be held without trial, or the laws against gatherings of people. These may seem useful at first glance but a closer look shows that these laws have erroded ancient rights that have protected the populace from persecution and bias from the people in charge. They were brought in without public consultation and little explanation of how they would affect life in the UK, which for such major changes to the law was highly disturbing. \nThese new laws can be used against anyone at any time, and provide far too great a licence for subjugation by anyone who chooses to use them. I object strongly to having my rights taken away and view it as the start of a slippery path to a dangerously unbalanced society. I would like my rights back and I believe I am not alone in this.\nI call upon the government to review the anti-terrorist laws, taking into consideration how they might be put to unethical and destructive use by future governments, organisations and the public.",
