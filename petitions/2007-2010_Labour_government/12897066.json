            "background": "GNER managed the East Coast mainline to the satisfaction of passengers.  National Express singularly failed to achieve the same standards of customer care , disrupting services and still failing to reach the premium agreed.  Customers must come before the simple achievement of unrealistic financial goals.  We want the ECML back to well groomed staff, smart trains and congenial dining and seating as a true alternative to flying.  We also want a premium level that is adjusted to reflect promised customer standards and the positive externalities of rail versus air travel",
