            "background": "I will attempt to the best of my ability to reflect the views of two extreme constituents with opinions on \"acceptable\" facial hair. I will begin with the thoughts of many creationists, \u201cI am in the image that God created for me.\u201d Many religions worldwide see the removal of any body hair as a direct insult to God, a good example of this are the Nazarene's thought to be close to Jesus Christ himself. It is also thought that shaving is an extreme act of supreme vanity showing superiority over the God who created him.\n\nThe humanist viewpoint does not differ greatly either with the quote, \u201cI am as I have evolved\u201d or more directly \u201cI am a man, as my DNA has destined me to be.\u201d Surely we males would not have been selected through millions of years of evolution if hair on the face or the body for that matter had not have been of some importance? \n\nThank you very much for your time and responses would be much appreciated.",
