            "background": "As a parent of three children I am sick and tired of my children coming home with head lice. Getting rid of head lice is simple, just buy a nit comb and then comb right down to the scalp every couple of days until the last nit is spotted AND THEN FOR A FURTHER THREE WEEKS to get rid of any growing juveniles that will slip past the comb.\n\nTHEN COMB REGULARLY (at least once a month) to check for new infestations.\n\nThe only chemical needed is a liberal application cheap hair condition to loosen their grip - other chemicals are a waste of time because headlice are immune to many so they don't always work and you have to comb anyway to check after you've used the chemicals so why bother?\n\nIf every new parent of every new school child in Britain was given a good quality (metal teeth) nit comb and the basic instructions to use it we could virtually eliminate these pests.",
