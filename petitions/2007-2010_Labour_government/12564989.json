            "background": "Students, who are generally quite poor and most unable, once again due to financial reasons, to drive a car have to pay full adult fare on bus services if they are 16 and over. \nThis is disgraceful as it is deterring students to travel into and around city centres, for either pleasure or educational purposes, for which matter a lot for young people.\n\nHowever, even if students manage to scrape enough money to get travel to their city, they will have no money with which to use in a struggling economy!\n\nNow, for example in my hometown of Southwell, it cost \u00a35.50 return to travel 15 miles and back to Nottingham. Whereas it only \u00a32.30 return for under 16's. Bus prices have become highly inflated recently, for the 100 service, as 3 years ago it was \u00a33.00 return for adults and only \u00a31.80 for under 16s!\n\nThis is mirrored around the country with high bus prices, which discourages students to spend their money in the city centres. \n\nThis needs to be addressed as it will make a lot of young people very happy with the current government, something you are in dire need at the moment!",
