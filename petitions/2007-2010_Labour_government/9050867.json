            "background": "Research conducted into assaults on healthcare workers shows that the most likely time employees are assaulted is after visiting. Violence against NHS staff is increasing and the ward door is often crowded.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to remove this source of friction and give better guidance to patients, relatives and the professionals caring for them in respect of :\n\n1. Bedside numbers\n2. Visiting times\n\nOverseas, where there is a lack of trained and suitably qualified personnel, relatives are the main care -givers, so this isn't suggesting that there is a valid health promotion role, but the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to make this more consistent and remove the conflict. Please clearly set and standardise hospital visiting. What does the rest of the nation think ? What is the greatest happiness of the greatest number here ?\n\nThank you.",
