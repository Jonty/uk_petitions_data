            "background": "In this country we still have a law written in the statute books that anybody who commits an act of treason i.e terrorism can lawfully and legally be executed. Therefore anybody who plans/plots terrorism should fall into this category. Terrorism is ideological. How can a prison sentence in todays 5***** hotels courtesy of HM and the taxpayer, reform these fundementalists. They carn't!.\n\nThe system at the moment doesn't work!.\n\nBut execution annilates the glorification of terrorism,therefore eliminating promotion to many 'Wannabe' terrorists. This of course will dilute extremism.\n\nBRING BACK HANGING!!!!.",
