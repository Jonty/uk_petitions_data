        "background": "The incompetent angler Robson Green who is apparently and ambasador for angling is making a mockery of the sport and single handedly ruining the face of angling with his ridicolous comments such as '9 out of 10 Coarse fish returned die'. He is an absolute disgrace to angling and the though of having him shown as an angler on national television should never have even been discussed. Thousands of anglers are disgusted with his behaviour and the programme should not be shown.",
