If one partner is made redundant and the other works more than 24 hours a week you automatically do not qualify.\nPlease sign my petition to encourage the waiting period to be lowered and those who can prove the total household income is less than their mortgage payments should qualify.\nHere is more informmation....Support Mortgage Interest (SMI) pays the mortgage interest for those on means tested benefits, such as Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance.  \n\nThe Government has cut the waiting period to qualify for the benefit from 39 weeks to 13 weeks and has increased the mortgage limit from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3200,000 with effect from 5th January 2009.  Those with mortgages over \u00a3200,000 will still be able to claim but will only receive relief on the first \u00a3200,000.",
