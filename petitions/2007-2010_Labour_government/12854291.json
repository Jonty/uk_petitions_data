            "background": "Pressure sores are estimated to currently cost the NHS up to \u00a34 billion a year, with up to 1 in 5 hospital patients suffering from one, yet reporting of their prevalence in our hospitals, care homes and in the community remains voluntary and sporadic at best.\n\nYour Turn is working with MPs, health professionals, patients and carers to make reporting of all incidents of pressure sores mandatory \u2013 to make clearly visible the scale of the issue, and ensure that the number of patients suffering from this painful and often fatal condition is greatly reduced.\n\nA pilot scheme recently conducted in a UK Trust enforced mandatory reporting of pressure sores resulting in a decrease of occurrences. We are now looking to use this pilot as best practice for other Trusts to help strengthen the case for mandatory reporting.\n\nWe are working with health care professionals providing them with an educational awareness campaign that they can use locally to reduce pressure sore prevalence.\n\nWe are working with carers and patients to promote awareness and understanding of how pressure sores occur, and how they can be avoided.",
