        "background": "Each year in the UK, supermarkets give away 17.5 BILLION plastic bags. All of this goes to landfill (otherwise we wouldn't continually be carrying our shopping in new plastic bags). Imagine a world where supermarkets just stopped providing plastic bags - you would just bring your own or buy an eco-friendly alternative. In India, you can be sent to prison for up to 7 years for carrying a plastic bag. If this government is serious about environmental concerns, it would ban plastic bags in the UK.",
