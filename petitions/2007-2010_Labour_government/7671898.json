            "background": "Legislation concerning the removal of 'costs protection' in matters of Divorce was introduced in 2005, to discourage spurious matters in Divorce dragging cases on longer than necessary exposing the Legal Aid system and the other-side to unnecessary legal costs. Removal of cost protection was to make a claimant think twice about matters, as they could be pursued for the other-side's legal costs.\nThe opposite is true!\nClaimants on Legal Aid are, by definition, below a certain wealth level, therefore any claim for costs by the 'other-side' will fail due to limited resources of the party on Legal Aid.\nRather than remove 'costs protection' the Government should re-instate it as 'cost protection' for the 'other-side'. If claims in divorce are exposed as spurious but have unnecessarily protracted the case (e.g. to Final Hearing), the other-side should be entitled to claim their costs through the Legal Aid system, and the Government should reclaim their funding through the claimant's Tax code and National Insurance payments.",
