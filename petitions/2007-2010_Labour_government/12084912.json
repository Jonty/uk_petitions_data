            "background": "We ask that it be made illegal to demonstrate against, make offensive chants against, or show placards, that may offend, or undermine the morale of our returning servicemen and women, asked to march through our towns and cities, after seving in war zones around the world. We find it offensive that such demonstrations that took place in Luton in March of this month, can be allowed to take place in front of servicemen and women. Who have lost comrades whilst acting under orders of Government, wether right or wrong. These service personell, deserve only our respect. And taking part in public demonstrations against such, whilst in public view of such service personell, whilst on duty, should be made a criminal offence. All such service personell have ever done is thier duty, and they should never again be allowed to suffer such humiliation.",
