        "background": "In August 2009 i was hit while on my motorcycle by someone using a mobile phone while driving.I was in hospital for 2 months with 2 smashed legs,broken arm,hand etc etc. I underwent 9 operations,reconstructive surgery and had part of my thigh and calf removed aswell as a large skin graft and am disabled for life,relying on a wheelchair to get about.I am seriously disfigured/mutilated for life.The person who did this to me got an \u00a385 fine and a 12 month ban.I have read of many similar cases.The punishment is no where serious enough to be a deterant.A \u00a360 fine does not put you off using your phone.A far more severe fine/punishment is what we need.The person who hit me gets back to normal after his 12 month ban,my sentence is for life.We strive to make cars safer and greener,but its all wasted as soon as we allow someone like this to take the wheel.Phones reduce reaction times,distract attention and turn your car into a potentially lethal weapon.We need to bring this to the attention of those that can make a change to the law and make our roads a safer place",
