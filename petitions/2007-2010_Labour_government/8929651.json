The purpose of this petition is to campaign for this to happen. We, the undersigned, believe the public has a right to know how MPs are spending our money. While other petitions exist campaigning for reductions in MPs' salaries or the abolition of the 'John Lewis List', the purpose of this petition is simply to campaign for transparency in this area. In short, the public has a right to know.",
