            "background": "Women were born naked the same as men but devlop bumps/lumps were men do not and vice versa. Men can freely roam topless when they wish, as do women in under-developed (and some developed) countries. Let's develop Britain and progress by permitting ladies to be topless, if they want to be, anywhere they want to be. Sexualising breasts to the extent we do in Great Britain, detracts from equality and over-sexualises what are in fact glands and a natural part of life. If breasts are desexualised due to daily exposure, there will better equality, better sex (quality)  and more tolerance for nursing mothers. Women should not feel attacked for exposing breasts at any time, nor should they feel exposing breasts a sexually provactive act, but a very natural one. I am not suggesting it be mandatory as we also like to dress up in nice underwear at times.",
