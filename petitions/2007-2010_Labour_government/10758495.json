            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If the government made it easier for UK adults over the age of 24 to get help ie funding to gain the skills needed to fill the roles currently being filled mainly by migrant workers not only would it better the lives of many UK citizens but also fill the gap in the labour market.It is currently too expensive for most people to even consider going into further education or courses to gain the necessary licenses and so many people are living in poverty in low paid jobs or on benefits with no hopes of being able to better their circumstances by gaining the skills and qualifications needed to help them fill the roles that make up the gap in the labour market.There are provisions put in place for 16-24 year olds but after this age if you cant afford it you cant do it. I think that if the government were to put better provisions in place then people would take them up on it which would in turn reduce the levels of unemployment and enable UK citizens to improve their quality of life and boost their morale",
