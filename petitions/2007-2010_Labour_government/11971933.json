            "background": "The new Animal Welfare Act has not addressed the issues relating to Animal Rescues / Sanctuaries. Although this may be addressed through secondary legislation certain important issues need to be implemented now. It has become all too easy to set up an animal rescue / charity with no experience and for these persons to take in all manner of animals from pet mice through to horses.\nThere are no restrictions to seperate those who take in both domestic and wildlife and it is paramount that new legislation seperates domestic animal rescues from wildlife rehabilitation centres.\nWildlife rehabilitation is a very specialised field and needs to be kept seperate from domestic animals.\nCombining both domestic and wildlife on one premises is both stressful to wildlife and can see the spread of disease.",
