How many times have you been more than aware than being able to travel in the opposite direction down a one way street would save a massive detour? It appears that the local councils ideas of traffic management are failing the general public. One of the greatest failures is the 'one way system'.

If the road is wide and safe enough for a lane in either direction then it should be.",
