            "background": "At present certain types of fertility treatments are only available in localised areas within the UK.  Fertility treatment, like all other services provided by the NHS, should be available equally to all UK residents.  IVM (In Vitro Maturation)is currently only available in Oxford, however could help thousands of childless couples in other parts of the UK.  It is also safer for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and more cost effective than IVF.  There has been recent coverage in the press about the twins born following this treatment, however, although this does bring hope to people like myself who would benefit from this treatment there is no further information about when or where we can expect this treatment to be widely available.",
