Moreover, the Student Complaints Scheme is wholly inadequate in dealing with this sort of institutionalised abuse. The Prime Minister should support the Queen who as Visitor to the Federal University has written to the First Minister of the National Assembly for Wales on the subject of proper complaints procedures being in place.",
