        "background": "The soldiers who fight for our country and freedom have to pay for food as they eat. This means that they can run out of money to buy food and end up living on toast or cereal! Before they paid every month direct out of their wages for food and could eat as much as they required. This ensured our soldiers always had a balanced nutritional meal at least once a day. The meals are now more expensive which forces our soldiers to survive on snack food or junk food. The forces have introduced food vouchers which soldiers can use to get food in the mess hall which is then taken from the next pay packet. Eventually a hard working soldier could end up owing the forces money by he time he is discharged. These soldiers give their lives for our country, why can't the government give something back.",
