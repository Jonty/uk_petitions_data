            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We feel that attempts by the Bank Of England to kick-start the economy by reducing the Base Rate are continually undermined by the profiteering of the major banking institutions. At the time of writing (1pm on 06/11/2008) the Bank Of England has just just announced a reduction in the Base Rate from 4.5% to 3%. The immediate response by one Lender, The Mortgage Works (a subsidiary of Nationwide Building Society), was to withdraw ALL Base Rate Tracker products with IMMEDIATE effect - and they mean it. Brokers, and therefore, the British public are given unrealistic timsescales in which to submit the business - in this instance, the email to confirm the withdrawal of products was recieved at 12:51, the deadline for new applications was 13:00. 9 MINUTES NOTICE!!!! As already witnessed after the 0.50% reduction last month, we suspect this action will be mirrored by the majority of the lending intitutions, with new increased margin rates subsequently released. The effect being that the consumer does not benefit either at all, or to the extent that they should. The government needs to act to regulate these actions which simply negate all efforts to boost the economy.",
