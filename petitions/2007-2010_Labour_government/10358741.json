            "background": "When marriages fail and parents split up, some parents decide to stop the other parent from seeing thier children. The parent not seeing the child has not been abusive or threatening to the children it is purely done out of malice. It America it is known as child abuse. The parent not seeing the child may never see them for the rest of thier life but has to pay child maintenance (not a problem if they are seeing them. They do not know where they live or what they are doing. The pain to the parent not seeing the child is worst than if the child had died because they know they are somewhere, but do not know where. The CSA and schools will tell the absent aprents nothing. I believe if a parent wants to do this to another parent there should be some punishment for them either child payments stop until the parent sees the child or there is some way of forcing the parent to allow the absent parent to see the child. Allowing this type of brainwashing of a child is completely inhumane. A Father (this also sometimes happens to a mother) should be a father for life whether the marriage ends or not and should not have their rights taken away. The government should do somthing about it.",
