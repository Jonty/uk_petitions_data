        "background": "As the world\u2019s 4th largest economy it\u2019s time we recognised the importance of defence and fully support our armed services. It is clear that the RAF is overstretched with personnel leaving in droves and aircraft breaking under the stress such as the C130k and Puma fleets. I propose we cut spending on non-essential projects and buy more helicopters, more transport aircraft and an increase in personnel.",
