Mancini said that his van was in neutral with its handbrake on when he was signalled into a parking bay by an approaching policeman Stuart Gray.\n\nThis pathetic and pointless prosecution of a law abiding citizen should be dropped as it will;\na) bring the Scottish legal system into disreptute\nb) further erode any respect the public has for the Police and the legal system\nc) be a waste of public money\n\nFor all these reasons and for common sense and fair play, this ridiculous action should be dropped.",
