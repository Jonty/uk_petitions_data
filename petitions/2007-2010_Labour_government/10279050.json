            "background": "Tower Hamlets council is proposing to sell  the former Mile End Vestry Hall in Bancroft Road to Queen Mary College, University of London. Bancroft is currently home to the East End's local history library and archives, considered the second finest in London behind Westminster's. Queen Mary College proposes to lease part of the building to the Wiener Library which needs to move from its home in Devonshire Street by the end of this year. Two years ago, Gordon Brown promised to help find the Wiener and its Holocaust records a home. Tower Hamlets council says it does not have money to repair Bancroft Road so is willing to see the Wiener displace the borough archives. Government money would help prevent the East End's collection from being broken up and allow it to remain at Bancroft.",
