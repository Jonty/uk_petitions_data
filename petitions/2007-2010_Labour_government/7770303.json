            "background": "I believe that this would severely limit the opportunities for fraud by criminals altering the mileage on cars which are then sold to unsuspecting members of the public. I also call on the VOSA to check previous milegages whenever a vehicle is presented for MOT and only issue a certificate once they are satisfied the odometer has not been altered. A V5 should be made proof of ownership, not just a keeper which has no meaning in law",
