        "background": "There are large numbers of matters of detailed routine in tax matters and in dealings with HMRC that are inefficient and waste a great deal of time. Accountants, tax payers and advisers are well aware of many of them, as are many HMRC staff.\nHMRC should be required to have a web site where such matters could be posted. Postings would be restricted to matters of administration and procedures. Postings on individual cases or on taxation policy would not be permitted.\nHMRC would not be obliged to take account of requests made for changes. They would however be required to explain why aspects of poor administration were allowed to remain unchanged.",
