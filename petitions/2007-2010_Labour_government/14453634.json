            "background": "The option to legitimately select No Suitable Candidate would be available for anyone eligible to vote in the United Kingdom. The object of voting No Suitable Candidate is to allow a true representation of public opinion whilst being constructive. Based on the principles of allowing the majority to make decisions effectively and efficiently, while ensuring fairness towards the minority, this voting option gives an individual the right to voice an opinion. In such a case where the No Suitable Candidate were to receive a majority of the vote cast a variety of formal procedures may be invoked which would include beginning the election process again with the original candidates excluded. The petition is made with No party agenda or political bias. Support is sought in the interest of treating the public fairly, especially by those that seek to govern us.",
