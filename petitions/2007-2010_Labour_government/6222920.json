The \"ludicrous decision\" in the case of the Philip Lawrence case is an ideal example of the judiciary making stupid decisions in favour of the perpetrators of crime as they often do, instead of supporting the human rights of the victims. It is high time that the judiciary were made to understand that they are employed by the British public and should answer to them and carry out their wishes.",
