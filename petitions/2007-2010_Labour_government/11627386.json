            "action": "Introduce legislation to relieve all business enterprises employing less than five staff from having to comply with all current maternity, discrimination and compensation legislation.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Women of childbearing age are now burdened with so many legal rights and privileges that few small companies dare employ them, mostly because owner-managers possess neither the knowledge nor the skill to properly comply with all the procedural complexities related to maternity, discrimination and compensation laws - and can\u2019t afford to employ HR staff who do. Fact is, all women would stand far more chance of securing a job at any of the 4.3 million UK enterprises which employ less than 4 staff if they didn\u2019t have to comply with current employment legislation. Which should please everybody, especially women and the government.\nNote: MHL Support, a leading employment lawyer, says that 90% of Employment Tribunals occur because of procedural errors made by employers.",
