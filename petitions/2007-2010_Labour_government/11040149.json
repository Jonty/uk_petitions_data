            "background": "When the alleged incidents of neglect within the Classroom were first reported, details were given telling of multiple daily incidents of injury to the Children and were supported by documented evidence, proving the abuse continued for many months.\n  \n\nFrom those allegations, a crime report number was generated and should have been linked to both the documented evidence supplied to the Police and their investigation that followed.\n\nInstead, it was used in relation to a single, one-off incident within the Playground that was not part of the original reporting, had no supporting evidence and to no surprise ended by the Police closing the investigation, with nothing proven.\n\nThe original alleged neglect within the Classroom, reported to Kent Police is still not on record, has never been investigated and after many requests, Kent Police still continue to refuse to record and investigate it.\n\nIt begs the question, had these Children been outside the care of the Authorities, would this alleged situation been instantly exposed and the perpetrators dealt with?\n\n \nDisabled Children are entitled to justice too, please support this petition.",
