            "background": "I wish to petition for the prohibitation of Craig Burley from expressing his views or opinions about anything to do with football to the general public, which would mean the immediate sacking from his current job at Setanta. As one of the most hated figures in Scottish Football history (even by his previous clubs) Craig Burley has no right reporting on a sport which he retired from aged 32, claiming he was 'fed up with it'. The time has come to wave goodbye to Burley and his doom stick.",
