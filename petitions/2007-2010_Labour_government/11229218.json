I am paying \u00a355 an hour for a football pitch, seriously what are you guys thinking. I thought \u00a3130 for my Xbox was expensive, actually its cheap compared to playing sport. \n\nKids are in the streets fighting etc, well I didnt have a disposable income of \u00a35+ per day when I was young (the the cost of an hour of sport if you share a court) so what should they do???? They like to go out everyday you know, so 1 hour per day (which isnt long enough anyway) would cost almost \u00a32000 in a year, seriously were should teenagers get this sort of money?\n\nI cant even afford to do sport's now as a 23 year old, so what on earth do you expect from your populace?????",
