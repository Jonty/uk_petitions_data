            "background": "I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to the lack of motorcycle parking facilities in Secondary Schools across the UK. Both teachers and pupils would benefit from a secure designated zone to park motorcycles, as this mode of commuting is becoming ever more popular on today\u2019s congested roads.\n\nSecure motorcycle parking on the schools premises would not only ensure peace of mind for the rider but would also avoid unnecessary aggravation to the local residents where parking outside the premises often causes obstructions. \n\nThe benefits of a few allocated motorcycle parking spaces in each school are worthy of the relatively low cost or physical space taken up by the designated zones.",
