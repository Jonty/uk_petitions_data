            "background": "Please stop penalising Middle England. Why is it that those of us who want to work, to provide for our families and save for our retirement consistently get punnished by higher taxes, to fund those who don't want to work, to keep those who commit crimes in comfortable prisions (which quite frankly appear to be no deterrent to them)?  Recessions never affect those on benefits, or those who are in prisions - instead they affect those of us who work hard to provide a better future for our families. \nUnfortunately you are developing a society who will never work, who do not see crime as wrong, who will never contribute to society - this is wrong!!\nThe proposed means testing for childcare provision is unfair and yet another example of penalising those who are prepared to work - why should we be penalised for working hard by having to pay more childcare, when we already pay more taxes!!!",
