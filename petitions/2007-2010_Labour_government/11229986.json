            "background": "Britain proposes to construct two new aircraft carriers, the largest warships which the Royal Navy will have ever had.  Currently the names of these carriers are expected to be \"Queen Elizabeth II\" and \"Prince of Wales\".\n\nIt is proposed that one of these mighty ships is named after the father of English democracy, John Lilburne, also known as \"Freeborn John\", whose beliefs and actions gave us the freedoms which we enjoy today, and which gave an impetus to the creation of the United States of America. Sadly, John Lilburne did not live to see his dream realised. \n\nThis proposal would show the world that freedom and democracy are valued in this land, and that our ancestors are honoured appropriately.",
