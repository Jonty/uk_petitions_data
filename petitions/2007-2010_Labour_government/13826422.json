            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I have started this petition to highlight the situation of single parents of children serving in the armed forces who are then prevented from claiming the 25% single occupancy discount council tax.\n\nChanges need to be made to council tax single person occupancy discount of 25%. Single parents of serving military personnel are not able claim single person discount of 25%. Government legislation says that they can return home at any time, so their parent\u2019s home is classed as their main home, not the barracks where they pay board. They pay CILOCT (cash in lieu of council tax). So this means the government are receiving money twice for council tax. This needs to be changed. If the young men and women were in prison or university/college, their parents can claim single person discount of 25%, even though they too, in theory, could return home at any time. Do we not value our armed forces and their families? \n\nIf, like me, you feel this is wrong, please sign my petition.",
