        "background": "SAY NO TO CHINA GATEWAY DEVELOPMENT, KENT.\n\n1:   Will be a huge warehousing hub for distribution of Chinese goods throughout the UK.\n2:   If all 3 phases are passed Thanet would lose 275 acres prime farmland in a time of global food shortages.\n3:   Buildings will be seen for miles.\n4:   Warehousing built on top of Thanet's natural drinking water supply. No contingency plans if water supply is irretrievably damaged or polluted.\n5:   17,000 trucking trips PER DAY would be required to distribute goods.\n6:   Totally inadequate roads in Thanet. Possible gridlock for Kent.\n7:   1000 direct jobs promised. 10% of these for the Chinese. No evidence that the other 90% will give locals quality jobs.\n8:   2000 secondary jobs. Developers' Rep. suggested local people required for grass cutting, window cleaning, signage, blinds, vending etc.\n9:   With other \"regeneration schemes\" locally there would appear to be more jobs than unemployed on paper.\n10:   Quality of life ruined by noise and air pollution. Kent already has a high incidence of asthema.\n11:   Tourism destroyed.\n12:   Rural heritage, environment and wildlife destroyed.\n\nDEATH of Thanet. Say NO to China Gateway.",
