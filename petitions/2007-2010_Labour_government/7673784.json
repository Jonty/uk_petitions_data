            "background": "With the recent deluge of reports about how government departments, public institutes and private corporations have quite farcically lost thousands upon thousands of British citizens' personal, medial and financial details and exposed them to serious fraud it is clear the government needs to set down clear rules for handling said data, and to hand out adequate penalties for people who disregard them.\n\nThe majority of the reports that I have seen state that none of the data was encrypted. With the vast range of encryption software available, both Free, Open Source and commercial, and with minimal training and investment needed to implement the technology, there is no excuse whatsoever for putting our data at risk.\n\nThe government should legislate to ensure that data held by at least governmental departments/agencies and the public sector is sufficiently encrypted so that when data is lost in the future (as is bound to happen; we're all human) it is protected.",
