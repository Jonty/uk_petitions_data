        "action": "ask Greenwich Council to continue funding for local black and ethnic minority supplementary schools to pay for rental of mainstream school buildings",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Save our Supplementary schools please.  \n\nFrom April 1st, Greenwich council has without consultation or warning, decided to cut funding to all local black and ethnic minority supplementary schools.  This has meant that we will need to pay rent to use mainstream school buildings. It is very unfair and will mean the closure of the schools.  \n\nSupplementary schools benefit the local community by educating the young generation. This reinforces their identity, builds their self confidence and prevents crime as well as promoting integration between ethnic minority and majority communities in UK society.   We promote lifelong learning and promote cultural activities, which helps the young generation to become good citizens.\n\nWe urge you not to cut our funding.",
