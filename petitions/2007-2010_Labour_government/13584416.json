            "background": "Gordon Brown announced plans to scrap the childcare voucher scheme, stating too many higher rate tax payers benefit from it. He plans to replace it with 10 hours' free childcare for 2-year olds - which is OK if you have a 2-year old... The UK lags behind the rest of Europe when it comes to helping working parents and this move would be a further step backwards. Penalising working families to help other families go back to work makes no sense at all. If you're a working parent finding it hard enough with childcare vouchers, let alone without, please let Gordon Brown know that you do not agree with his plans by signing this petition.",
