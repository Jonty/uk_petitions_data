            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The government has recently introduced several proposals on putting a levy on plastic bags and other inititives to force out the plastic bag.  Some environmentalists had argued sucessfully that plastic bags are a danger to our countryside and wild animals.  Which is true to some extent.\n\nHowever the hidden cost to our environment is the distruction of our wild bird populations due to the over population of the domestic cat.  \n\nIt is argued that an environmental levy put on cat food will increase the costs of owning a cat and thus protect our wildlife by reducing the impact of domestic cats.\n\nFinally it can be argued that plastic bags have never killed at the same scale as our cats and that a debate on what is damaging and what is not should take place.",
