            "background": "Identity theft is a serious problem and every year millions of people have their Payment Card Details stolen. The problem is caused by the Banks not implementing proper security for Card Holder Not Present transactions such as transactions over the phone or over the internet. It is entirely possible to issue Card Holders with a small calculator sized PIN entry machine thats generates unique authorisation codes to secure telephone and internet purchases. The government need to act to force the banks to introduce this. The Banks are putting their profits first and polluting society with fraud. Lets make them act responsibly, please sign this petition.",
