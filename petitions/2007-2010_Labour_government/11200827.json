            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Wirral Borough Council proposes to close practically all of the amenities enjoyed by Wirral taxpayers. Libraries, sports and community centres, and the Pacific Road Arts Centre are the targets of the council's grossly insensitive and philistine proposals. Replacing these centres with newly-built centralised ones completely misses the point of community services: centralisation will have a damaging impact on the lives of Wirral citizens. Environmental and diversity issues are also ignored: for some, centralised, all-under-one-roof centres will necessitate the use of a car or expensive local transport to visit and use them. For young people, the elderly, and the vulnerable, there are also safety implications which might mean they discontinue using services that have been at the heart of their communities for years. All signatories of this petition are attempting to safeguard their local heritage, health and educational needs. Meeting these needs is essential to healthy and happy communities. The people of Wirral should expect nothing less than the continued provision of these services.",
