            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current licensing regulations on private car parking firms do not seem fit for purpose, and lead to exploitation of private citizens with car-clamps and fines which are difficult to stomach. Private car parking companies appear to have extraordinary amount of self-regulation and autonomy when it comes to fares and fines. This needs to be regulated to protect motorists from unscrupulous car park owners who can clamp vehicles (for amazingly weak reasons such as being 5 minutes late when returning to your vehicle) and then charge what they please for the removal of these clamps (sometimes \u00a375 or more).  It would be so easy to create clear legislation to protect motorists from being exploited and ripped off in this way. It seems criminal to me that private companies can clamp vehicles in the first place!",
