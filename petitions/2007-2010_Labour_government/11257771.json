            "background": "Criteria used for new gypsy and traveller sites are resulting in locations being chosen that bring significant disadvantage to the existing community.  This petition seeks to require Local Authorities to put impact on the existing community at the top of the site selection criteria and to remove proximity to local services and facilities from consideration. \nAccess to facilities is Dacorum Borough Council\u2019s first listed criteria and is driving selection of sites in and adjacent to urban areas. The need for a buffer with existing housing is the last listed criterion. The interests of the gypsy and traveller community are thus taking precedence over the interests of the settled population. \nGypsies and travellers have a chosen mobile lifestyle apart from the settled community. A consequence of this choice is reduced access to facilities and services. Having made this choice, it is unreasonable for the settled community to be disadvantaged by this access criteria being used as a key determinant of development sites. Removal of this criterion will result in sites being located further but not necessarily remote from existing urban areas.",
