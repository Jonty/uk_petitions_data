            "background": "Dear Mr Brown.\n\nIt is of great concern to teachers, parents and most importantly pupils of the above named school that traffic calming measures and a safe crossing point are provided around the school.\n\nThere is currently a 30mph speed limit in place in the village of Whitton which is largely ignored by the vast majority of road users. \n\nThere is not even the obligatory 20 mph limit in place which is commonly seen around schools and patrol crossings which has been overlooked completely by Powys County Council.\n\nWe simply ask for traffic calming measures and the installation of a pelican crossing between school and car park to ensure the safe crossing of pupils, parents and staff.\n\nWe the undersigned politely ask for your attention in this matter at your earliest convenience with a view of recommending a course of action with Powys County Council executives, planning chiefs and local members of parliament. \n\nKind regards.",
