            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I believe that there should be a minimum speed limit for cars on public roads as these drivers are causing as much danger as speeding motorists. Car drivers that are driving well below the speed limit are causing drivers who follow much frustration and the need to make dangerous manoeuvres.  This is particularly an issue on 'A' roads where some drivers travel at 40mph on a national speed limit stretch, this causes a build up of traffic and other motorist frustration and the need to make a sometimes dangerous overtake.  \n\nWhy should there not be fines and penalty points for those motorists that are inconsiderate to other road users in dictating the speed they are travelling at.  Is it not the case that drivers that can only travel at 40mph in a 60mph are not really capable of driving safely on our roads?",
