            "background": "The UK nuclear deterrent is no longer required for the purpose it was intended for. The UK nuclear deterrent now has no purpose at all except funding the nuclear arms industry. The money will be better spent on the NHS, education, the homeless, work charities have taken on which used to be funded by the Treasury, full time Carers of relatives, school meals, more schools with smaller classes, better pay for the low paid public sector, more forces personnel with more and better equipment and better housing, there is a long list where the UK Government must invest more. The \u00a325BN suggested by the Government is a starting price, it may double before a new deterrent is fully implemented.",
