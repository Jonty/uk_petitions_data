            "background": "Save the Trafalgar Square Pigeons (STTSP) is frequently made aware of culls of pigeons by local authorities and others that contravene the terms of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 and the DEFRA General Licence system.\n\nWe are not aware of any serious attempts to enforce the law, and believe that millions of birds are being cruelly, unnecessarily and illegally killed each year.  We maintain that ignorance of the terms and conditions of the General Licence, particularly the limited circumstances under which birds can legally be culled and the requirement to use alternatives to culling wherever these are viable, is widespread.\n\nWe call on DEFRA to abandon the General Licence system and to require anyone wishing to cull wild birds to apply for a specific licence.  The onus must then be firmly on the applicant to demonstrate, as part of their application, why alternatives to a cull are not viable and that all the other terms and conditions in the current General Licence are met.",
