        "background": "I recently read that Thames Water announced record profits and yet they intend to vastly increase prices (and no doubt they also plan to cut salaries or perks for their staff in some way).  Apparently the rationale for this is the cost of repairing or renovating water services in some way but surely they should use at least some of their profits to pay for this; why should it always be the consumer, and/or the staff, who have to have their incomes reduced?",
