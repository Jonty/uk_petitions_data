            "background": "In 2007 I was a victim of crime when I was viciously assaulted by four women. During that attack I was systematically punched and kicked. I sustained a broken nose and a stiletto heel stab wound to my inner thigh. As I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety mental health problems, the Compensation Agency has denied me the right to any compensation to be awarded.  Therefore the Agency is stating that any individual who suffers from depression or anxiety, does NOT hold the same rights within society, to any other individual.\nPlease give me a voice, please add your name to this petition and support someone who has suffered, who continues to pursue an acknowledgment of this. Not only for myself, but for all of those who suffer from depression, anxiety and mental health disorders.\nPlease give us a voice, and support this petition request for equality.",
