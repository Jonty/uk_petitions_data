            "background": "To legalise the importation and retail of coca leaf products from South America.\n\nCoca leaf is currently illigal in the UK but in South America it is legal and  used widely by the people in cooking, beverages, ointments and medicines that can alleviate conditions such as altitude sickness, ulcers and asthma.\n\nThis move would also provide income for poor coca farmers in South America and give them a chance to legaly sell there products instead of being bullied by the cartels to selling there products for the manufacture of Cocaine and would intern reduce the amount of material they can acquire and possibly reduce the world supply of illigal Cocaine.\n\nA debate will be held in the European Parliament in Brussels on March the 6th on the subject.",
