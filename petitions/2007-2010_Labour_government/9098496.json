It makes vision through the affected to become blurry and sensitive to light. In the early stages of keratoconus, normal glasses can be used. I have keratoconus in one eye. Another classic symptom is that the prescription of the affect eye changes more frequently than a normal eye. I have been diagnosed with keratoconus in May 2007 and had my prescription changed 3 times in that time. I cannot claim any help at the moment.",
