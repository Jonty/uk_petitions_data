But how can it possibly be fair when we bought vehicles within our budgets, with regards to fuel economy and tax at the time that we now be penalised for that choice. We arent talking about extreme sports cars - just normal family cars. Are we to expect extra tax on clothes we bought 2 years ago next?? We understand environmental concerns - but in the showroom we have a choice -but two years ago buying a car within our budgets we didnt. Stop this ridiculous retro-tax before it ruins the working family",
