            "background": "The decision to discard thousands of injured service personnel at a time of high unemployment is inhuman and at variance with what has been promised in the past.  This policy must be revised.  Many of these people have been injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, and can still perform valuable services in non-operational roles within the Armed Forces.  Options for redeployment into civilian posts should be should explored with priority for vacancies going to suitably qualified ex forces personnel.  We owe these people a debt of gratitude - for once let the Ministers recognise this and uphold the military covenant.",
