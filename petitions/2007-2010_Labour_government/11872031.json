            "background": "For quite some time now PAS (parental alienation syndrome)has been accepted in the USA courts and have procedures to prevent this form of child abuse. We feel that it is about time the UK courts take this in to consideration in child custody and contact cases. In many cases the courts have turned a blind eye to parents who show clear signs of PAS(Parental alienation Syndrome)as there is now law or guidelines to prevent this. PAS is the systematic denigration by one parent by the other with the intent of alienating the child against the other parent.",
