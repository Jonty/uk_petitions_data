        "background": "The leader of the Roman Catholic church is due to visit the UK in 2010. It should be explained why someone who preaches hate is allowed into the UK, when this Government introduced Laws to prevent this. Will he be arrested when he lands on UK territory? Or is the leader of the Prime Ministers faith automatically protected?\nHow much will this visit cost? The security needs will be huge, and this will be funded by the tax payer when we are facing HUGE public debts. How is this visit economically possible? \nThe timing of the announcement is questionable, just before the Labour conference '09, and the visit it's self will be post election. If a reasonable Government is elected the costs must be called into question, but the Religious aspect causes problems. Is this just a cynical trip-mat for a possible new Government, and if so, how can a Roman Catholic Prime Minister use his religious leader so cynically?\nThese questions should be answered, and explained. We who sign this petition want these questions answered.",
