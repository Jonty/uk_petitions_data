            "background": "Government information and services are increasingly provided over the internet.  Examples are obtaining all  kinds of forms, applying for a car tax disc, registering to vote, paying for a TV license and getting a state pension forecast.  This is puts members of the public without internet access in their homes at a disadvantage.  Some may be able to access the internet at public libraries but libraries are confined to town and suburban centres.  Providing internet access in all Post Office branches will support rural and local communities and help restore the Post Office as a point of access to government services.",
