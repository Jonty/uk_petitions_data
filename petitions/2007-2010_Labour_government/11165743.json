            "background": "Most people over the age of 60 or with medical conditions would like to travel - unfortunately it has become an astronomical cost to get insured to travel abroad.  Most people who are on medication are probably better off health-wise than those that are not as their health is being monitored.  \n\nAs an example someone I know wanted to travel to Canada for 3 weeks they were asked a lot of questions and were then told that they could not be insured for the current illnesses that they have already (hence you will have to pay for it yourself anyway if you get ill) and that the cost would be \u00a31,000 plus.\n\nWe need to have a fairer system.  You pay for travel insurance most of your life and then when you get to the age where you might need it you cannot have it.  Surely the government can make arrangements with other countries, especially Canada and Europe where the health care is available for British Citizens whilst on holiday as long as they don\u2019t do crazy things.\n.",
