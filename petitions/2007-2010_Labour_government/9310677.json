            "background": "with everything happening in the world today i only think it is right that Birmingham council should let people who have  brought there council homes from there that they will be allowed to sell it back and rent back from them, or be able to go back on the council list as not everyone these days can afford the mortgage rates as they keep goign up, in scotland they allowed people to sell there property back to the council and then rent it back but they dont anywhere else. this is unfair and why is it the Scottish Law is better for the less fortunate. i think you should have the right to go back on the council list if you lose your home, its okay for a lottery winner to have millions and then lose that then go onto the council list for a home, how is that fair, we should be allowed to do this as it is common now for everyone to lose there homes.",
