            "background": "Please remove the two feminist extremists (Blears & Smith) from your cabinet. Making it a criminal offence for a man who enters into a financial arrangement with a fully consenting adult is strictly of no concern to any other person or government, only between themselves. Do these two potential brownshirts propose to criminalise women who occasionally pay for sex? There are better ways of dealing with the lowlife who traffic genuine unfortunates into the sex industry without destroying the lives of 'normal' decent men who have no alternative to a needed sex life.",
