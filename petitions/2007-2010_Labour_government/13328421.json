            "background": "I wasinvolved in a serious car accident in January of this year, the accident was not my fault. I have been off work since, and I have bad anxiety when driving, Because the company I work for cannot find me work locally, I have decided I cannot drive any distance, and so I need to work and have decided to work for myself, with very little driving involved. I have been told by my solicitor that because I left my employment I cannot claim for loss of earnings, which could be four to five thousand pounds. I left only because they could not find me work locally and I suffer very bad anxiety when driving. I would like to see this rule changed to benefit the victims.",
