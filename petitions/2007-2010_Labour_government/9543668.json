            "background": "Reports about crime committed by freemasons to my local constabulary have been ignored.  Police officers involved in covering up a crime have a vested interest in making sure that the reported crime is not investigated especially when it is their freemason brothers who have committed the crime. A national service which automatically references and emails a copy of the reported crime to the person who reports it and which also promises to investigate the crime would provide documentation to the victim and prevent this situation happening with any local police forces. At the moment if I make a crime report to police in another county they refer it back to my local police who then ignore it again.",
