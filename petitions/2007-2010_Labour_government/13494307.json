            "background": "In this country there needs to be a serious change in the judicial system, so that the punishment fits the crime.There is nothing in the law as it stands now that would deter the offenders from committing crime, they often have a better life in jail, because they have access to things in there that they would never be able to afford on the outside. As for the murderers, rapists and paedophiles, for this I suggest the death penalty is reinstated in this country, if it is proved 100% that the person has committed that crime,the only reason it failed in this country last time was because people weren't given a proper trial.The murders and especially the horrific abuse of the children just cannot be allowed to continue.",
