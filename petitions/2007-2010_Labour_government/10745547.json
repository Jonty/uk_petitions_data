        "background": "GBL can cause seizures, blackouts and even death and has been banned in the USA. But shockingly it is still legal and readily available in the UK.\n\nGBL became popular after it was discovered it had the same effects of as GHB, banned in 2003. Low doses are used recreationally by clubbers, but when this colourless, odourless chemical is mixed with alcohol or taken in high doses, it leads to terrifying blackouts - making it the ideal spiking substance for sex attackers.\n\nThe Government has announced plans to look into whether this chemical should be criminalised. But this process could take several years\u2013 leaving hundreds more women at risk of date-rape attacks.\n\nIf you believe they should make this a priority, add your name to this petition.",
