            "background": "Too many services have had their buffet cars scrapped and replaced by a trolley service. Passengers prefer buffets over trolleys because:\n\nConvenience -  they can purchase refreshments when they need them, rather than waiting for the trolley to come round.\n\nRange of products - a buffet can sell a wider range of goods than a trolley, including hot snacks. \n\nQuicker - with buffets, its just a matter of queuing for a few minutes at most, whereas a trolley can take more than an hour to do a full round of the train.",
