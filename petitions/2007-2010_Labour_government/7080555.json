            "background": "With 10 million more people predicted in Britian in 10 - 20 years why not take Dubai's example and create three new and highly competitive world cities.  New infrastructure and tax breaks would attract the best people and industry.  Two cities could be located in Northern Scotland (one with 6 million and one for two million people) and one in mid Wales.  This new infrastructure and the jobs that it creates will pull people in and it will enable the whole UK economy to thrive. It will also help to ease the pressure on areas around London and the North of England.",
