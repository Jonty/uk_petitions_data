            "background": "Brighton has introduced a lottery system for allocation of secondary school places. The number of children in Brighton has increased steadily over recent years. Unfortunately the local council has not taken account of this in its forward planning. The result of this is a lack of local school places for children. Parents are now restricted in the choice of schools they can apply to and subject to the random allocation of a lottery system. This policy is is short sighted and not practical. Children could be sent to schools some distance away from their home and to a different institution to their sister or brother. This is not only impractical and anti-social, think of the increased traffic and 'green' implications, but unrealistic. This is not a solution to Brighton's problem but a counter productive measure that will drive our community apart.",
