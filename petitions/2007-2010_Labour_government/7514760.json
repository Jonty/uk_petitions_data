This award would be for brave acts performed throughout the year by the general public, the armed forces, police, fire-fighters etc.They could have letters after there name. Why should such a large number of celebrities be recognised for just doing a job like everyone else?\nIf this is not possible then anyone who has past convictions or live abroad so as to avoid paying taxes to Her Majesties Government should not be recognised in the New Years Honours List.",
