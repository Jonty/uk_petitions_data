            "background": "Some children and young people go through school feeling like a failure, like they don't belong and odd. They feel frustrated as they know things but they can't put them down on paper or project them verbally. Not knowing they have a learning difficulty hold them back in school and in life.\nBeing screened for a learning disability will help children and young people to access help that is needed. This will help them to achieve more then they otherwise would have achieve. \nThis in turn will help the understanding of learning, which in turn will reduce negative atmosphere that surround learning difficulties. In turn this will help children and young people to feel more positive and happy about their learning difficulties and also toward other people with learning difficulties. \n\nLet\u2019s take dyslexia as an example.\n\nAt least 10% of children in UK schools have dyslexia. Government census figures on Special Educational Needs has only identified 1% of children in UK schools as dyslexic.\n\nOne in five children left primary school without a basic grasp of reading, writing or math\u2019s. This is no coincidence. More than 40% of these children later found out the they have dyslexia.",
