        "background": "Westminster Council have proposed that they would like to extend pay and display hours to midnight and charge motorists \u00a35 an hour to park on single yellow lines at these extended times. Night workers traditionally find it difficult to use public transport between midnight and 6am as it is considerably reduced during this time. Residents will also find they pay twice if they can't find a resident parking space.",
