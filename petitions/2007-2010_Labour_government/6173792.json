            "background": "The Mary Rose is a very important piece of our English heritage and indeed a National treasure.  Many battles had been fought on this ship to protect this country and it's sinking was witnessed by our own King.  We should be funding this project so that a real solid piece of history can remain for our future generations to see and learn how our then, \"Royal Navy\" sailed and fought. We cannot allow the magnificent effort of the salvage teams to be wasted by not having enough funding. To see what was saved and preserved is an absolute wonder. There's a lot of money given to groups and projects and this MUST be one of them.",
