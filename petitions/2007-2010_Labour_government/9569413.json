You are already telling companies not to discriminate against age, rascism, or disabled people and you have also increased the wage scale and holiday pay, so in a sense you are telling companies what to do. Is it not possible for you to go that one step further and stop the feeling of intimidation of interviews, being interviewed by a panel of 3 people and being bombarded by constant questions.  For disabled people, that is total intimidation, if they are also feeling very vulnerable then surely this kind of interviewing will make them feel worse.  This is a definite bar to all people wanting to return to work but cannot.",
