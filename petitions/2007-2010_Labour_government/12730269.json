            "background": "We request that if staff Have to work on a Public Holiday then we should Have to be paid Bank Holiday Pay for doing so. It is not a normal working day, it is a Public Holiday, we should be paid incrementally for working these. All we ask for is Basic Pay + Single time (lets not be greedy, we have, after all been given an extra 7 days Holiday a year!) How many people do you know who have the day off and are being paid for it, or are working it and being paid double time and get a day in lieu!! These seem to be a select few. For us who work in smaller companies we are being victimised. How much more are we going to lose by being in the EU? How much do we have to lose before we stand up, it's our right to be entitled to Bank Holiday Pay!!!",
