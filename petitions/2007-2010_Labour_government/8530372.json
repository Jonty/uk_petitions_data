        "background": "The people, irrespective of their political affiliations, are sick to death of bad Government and inept, bottom-feeding MPs who engorge themselves at the taxpayers\u2019 expense. \n\nNeither Government nor MPs are to be trusted and wholesale change is demanded before the people take it into their own hands and revolt.\n\nA good start would be a complete review of Parliament and its role \u2013 to make it more democratic and cost-effective \u2013 for example a maximum number of 300 MPs and a complete removal of the party whip system.  Expenses and junkets abroad must be cost justified and first class air travel banned, just as in the commercial world, with receipts given for all expenses over \u00a35.00.\n\nFurthermore, election expenses should be limited to \u00a320,000 per candidate and \u00a31 million per party in total.  These limits are quite adequate to convey whatever message is required by the electorate and the limitations will reduce lobby influence, spin and hyperbole of which the people are heartily sick.",
