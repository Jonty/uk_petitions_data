            "background": "The FA has seen in their wisdom that the clash between Blackburn Rovers players and Newcastle players on the 1st of March was completely Blacburns fault and therefore they have been fined and Newcastle have got away with nothing (another example would be Ashley Coles recent show of disrespect in which they got away with it). This is just one example were the FA constantly do nothing to punish the so called \"big\" clubs and it needs to stop as football is clearly becoming rotten as a result. The smaller teams do not need these constant fines as they need all the money they can get yet the FA see fit that these are the teams that are always in the wrong, Therefore something must be done to make the FA the unbiased association  they are supposed to be.",
