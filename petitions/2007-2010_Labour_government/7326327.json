            "background": "The recent HMRC loss of 25 million people's details receiving child benefit is the latest in a long line of incompetent management decisions by MPs, senior & local civil servants. Their mishandling & inefficiency not only means severe security breaches affect citizens in the most regressive way possible, but that waste is rampant in the system.\nThis petition proposes the creation of a law where the people can claim no confidence in an MP, civil servant or any government worker. If the call of no confidence is carried, by petition, above a defined number of signatories, then that individual/individuals will be removed from office. In the case of the civil service or government body the individual will be removed & banned from working in the civil service or any state-funded body, such as a quango. \nAccountability is important to true confidence in government; both lately have been lacking, making direct accountability all the more important.",
