On this day in 1992 Armenian military forces brutally murdered civilian inhabitants of the town of Khojaly in the illegally occupied region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The day of Khojaly is not only a day to mourn the dead, but a reminder of the Armenian aggression that continues to this day. The world media condemned these atrocities, with the UK's own Times newspaper remarking how 'the refugees had been shot down as they ran.' 18 years after this fateful day we remember those who died that day in the face of an illegal occupation that still claims almost 20% of Azerbaijan's sovereign territory.'",
