            "background": "A Halls of Residence comprising self contained flats of differing sizes to accommodate MPs not ordinarily resident within commuting distance of the House would in the long term save huge amounts of public money, avoid the need for expanse claims and the checking thereof and provide additional security for MPs while in London and not in their constituencies. They should be fully furnished and equipped with standard items including all the usual kitchen appliances. They would be rent free, even utility charge free if thought reasonable,with no expense claims allowed; repairs maintenance and replacements where necessary would be paid for centrally, administered by a management office. Flats should range from studio type for single MPs, doubles for married MPs if they wish their spouses to be with them, and family sized for the same reason.",
