        "background": "The Police are able to hack the PC of anyone suspected of a crime which carries a sentence of 3 years or more.\n\nThe problem is that they are not required to obtain a Warrant in the same way as they would to perform any other kind of domestic search or wire tapping.\n\nThey are allowed (but not limited to) to send malware to your computer via e-mail or sit outside your house and try to hack your computer via your wireless internet connection if you use one.\n\nThis is the computing equivalent of the Police being able to walk into your home and have a look around purely out of suspicion.",
