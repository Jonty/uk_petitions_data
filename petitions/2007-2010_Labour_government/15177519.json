            "background": "Greenwich Mean Time is the standard by which time in Britain is defined.\n\nBritish Summertime (BST) is simply GMT plus 1 hour.\n\nWhy not stay on GMT the whole year round, every year?\n\nHaving to change clocks may have been useful in the past but now it is simply a nuisance.\n\nIt is supposed to save money by promoting more effective use of daylight hours but it costs the economy money because every year there are always some who get caught out and miss work.\n\nIt may have been prudent in World War 1 when it was first introduced, but nowadays everybody keeps the lights on inside in offices all day regardless and a little darkness - or light - really doesn't stop anyone getting on with what they've got to do does it? Not nowadays. Most countries abandoned the system after world war 1 - Britain lags behind.\n\nSo why put up with the nuisance any longer?!\n\nSign this petition!",
