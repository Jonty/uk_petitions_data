            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This would apply to all HGVs not registered in the UK (approaching 2 million per year), to mitigate the damage they do to the environment and infrastructure of this country. The levy should be collected by the cross channel carriers when the booking is made, or at the check-in desks at the port of embarkation (if you don't pay you don't travel), and passed to HM Revenue & Customs, who could carry out spot checks on the manifests of the relevant carriers.\nThis practice would bring us in line with other countries in Europe such as Germany and France, where British trucks are obliged to pay for the use of their roads.\nThe resulting revenue should be used to reduce the cost of fuel to the transport industry, which is being throttled by the current high price of diesel and faces decimation with the abolition of the cabotage restrictions.",
