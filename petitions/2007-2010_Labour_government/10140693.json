        "background": "To abolish ALL tax free pay, Tax Credits and perks and charge everyone a fair 10% of all income earned across the board.  This will ensure the lower paid have more in their pockets and the wealthy will actually pay their dues.  The system will be easier to monitor and control, there will be no need to have as many civil servants who are unable to operate our far too complicated income tax system.  Everyone will be able to calculate exactly how much tax they should and will pay each week or month.",
