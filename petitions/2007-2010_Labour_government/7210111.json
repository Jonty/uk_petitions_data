        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Getting into Liverpool City Centre from end of the M62 is an absolute nightmare, probably the worst accessible City Centre in the whole of the UK. \n\nEdge Lane Drive, which is the main gateway into the city will still only be 2 lanes wide after its so-called upgrade. So it is safe to assume the queues of traffic, the misery, and the time taken to get from one end of Edge Lane to the other will still be the same as it is today. \n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to extend the M62 Motorway from its present terminus at \"The Rocket\" over the Queens Drive Ring Road, on a fly-over. The new motorway would have to be raised (like the new M74 extension in Glasgow) and should run directly over the railway line between Edge Hill and Broadgreen stations. This should avoid demolishing unnecessary amounts of housing along the route. The extended motorway would continue into Liverpool City Centre past Wavertree Technology Park to a new terminus. The new motorway should be no less than 4 lanes wide in either direction.",
