        "action": "Stop rationing  salt stocks to local councils during this extreme period of bad weather and to help local councils to maintain their own areas without rationing essential salt stocks.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Due to the lack of salt stocks in most areas central government seems to feel that they should now dictate who gets further stocks and has asked local councils to start rationing to maintain their stocks, do you think it right that central government should be telling local councils how to deal with icy roads/pavements in their local area? Surely central governments job is to ensure all local councils have what they need to deal with the current conditions without jumping in to ration salt stocks to areas who are obviously in need of essential gritting materials and equipment. Rationing does not solve the problems most councils are experiencing but could make it worse.",
