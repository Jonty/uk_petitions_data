            "background": "The BBFC is responcible for classifying and censoring all film releases in cinemas and on DVD in the UK.  During the early 70/80s there were concerns over the effects of the \"video nasties\" - causing viewers to re-enact deviant behaviour or \"corrupting\" the youth. As a result, the BBFC were handed guidelines by the government to censor certain materials. These measures saw a massive decline in the production of \"video nasties\". Although any film could be labelled a \"nasty\", the ones particularly targeted were so for their disturbing portrayal of sex, violence, sexual violence and real wild animal violence. However, despite research, there is no conclusive proof that events portrayed in the movies have any significant effect in altering the moral values or behavior of the veiwers, whats more animal violence occurs in nature naturally and is merely being documented. Therefore, I petition the PM to take the initiative, lift the censorship laws that are not in place to protect unwilling participants, liberate the British film industry from censorship and allow the general public to choose what they WANT to watch for themselves.",
