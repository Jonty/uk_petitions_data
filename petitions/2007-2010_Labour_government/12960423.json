            "background": "Our present Prime Minister and Government have gravely damaged Britain's economy and standing in the world; they have placed an intolerable financial burden on future geneations; they have put our armed forces at unacceptable risk without adequate resources and have betrayed the British people by surrendering our sovereignty to an alien power. In so doing they have lost the confidence and trust of the British people and so they no longer have a mandate to govern; but by hanging on to power are likely to cause further damage and civil unrest. We need a General Election and referendum on Lisbon Treaty urgently by 1 Oct 2009.",
