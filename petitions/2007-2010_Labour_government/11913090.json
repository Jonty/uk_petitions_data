        "background": "The bank of England is acting irresponsibly on the global stage by taking the step of quantitative easing which will devalue the pound and shake the already battered confidence that foreign investors have in our economy.\n\nThe impact of rate cuts has not been given the time to show any effect. Compounding the move by using QE may have the consequence of either devaluing sterling completely or triggering another boom and bust cycle. We need to let the economy recover gradually.\n\nQE is a dangerous step and has no guarantee of success. It should not be an option in a fair and developed economy.",
