            "background": "This beach, once in public ownership, played its part in the defence of the country. We request that it be returned to the people of Portsmouth now that it is no longer in use by the UK military.  As is the convention with land commandeered for defence purposes, it is expected that all or part of said land be returned to public ownership. \n\nIn line with the aims Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, we believe that no beach should be controlled by a corporate entity, unless it is for the good and benefit of the nation. We feel that privatisation and profit should not come before protection of the environment, and unhindered public access, as outlined in the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. We ask that QinetiQ return Eastney Beach to the people of Portsmouth OR that funds be made available for a compulsory purchase, to best protect the environment and the interests of the people of Portsmouth.",
