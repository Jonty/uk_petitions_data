            "background": "Bearsted is a busy station on the Ashford - Maidstone - London route and serves a large number of commuters and leisure travellers.  The station car park is currently too small and is full by 7am each day, leading to overflow parking on unsuitable roads near the station, and travellers driving further to alternative stations.  There is a large area of disused land next to the station which has lain idle for many years and creates an eyesore.  This land could be used to expand the car park but Network Rail and Southeastern Trains have stated recently \u201cOur research shows that there is sufficient capacity at Bearsted and we currently have no plans to increase capacity\u201d.  This has been a problem for over 20 years in Bearsted so I would like to show there is a demand for more car parking spaces at Bearsted station with this petition.",
