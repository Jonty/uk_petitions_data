        "background": "I would like to know how many parents or otherwise would agree on a choice basis to have their children microchipped, with a GPS tracking system included, to help in cases such as, runaways, abducted, or general missing kids under 16.\n\nIf this was available it would be able to cut down the time it takes to find a missing child, any medical conditions could be stored on the chip enabling the emergency services to administer meds needed when the child was found and would hopefully deter abductors from abducting.",
