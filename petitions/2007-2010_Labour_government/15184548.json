            "background": "It has emerged that up to half of the Specialist Children Heart Surgery Units Across the Country face Possible Closure. Potential Units based at Oxford, Leicester, Southampton, Newcastle, Bristol and Leeds perform life saving operations on Children throughout the year, often extending and giving them a better Life. It is criminal to close these units to save resources when more resources should be invested to upgrade their facilities. If this happens, Parents living in Devon and Cornwall could face a 300+ mile trip to London for their childs Heart Surgery.",
