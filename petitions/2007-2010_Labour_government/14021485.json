This is the risk run every day by policemen and women and although rare, these tradegies occur.\nIt is important that we the public show some measure of gratitude to these public servants and I believe renaming the bridge which should be unvieled by his widow or his children will give them comfort that the public at large do respect their work and indeed their courage.",
