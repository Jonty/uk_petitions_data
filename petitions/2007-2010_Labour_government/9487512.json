            "background": "The cost of Diesel Fuel has increased by approximately 30% in the last 6-7 months and is currently topping around \u00a31.30 per litre as of the 15th May 2008.\n\nDiesel is around 12% more expensive than Petrol in the UK compared to France where diesel is 12% cheaper than petrol.\n\nHigh Diesel costs are pushing up the cost of virtually everything that we buy including basic foods and other essential items that people are struggling to afford, including travel to and from work.\n\nFor the sake of our struggling economy, rising inflation and the future of Britain we implore the Government to act now and lower the duty on Diesel Fuel to levels comparable with France and Belgium.",
