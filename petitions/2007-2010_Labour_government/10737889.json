        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The manufacture of goods in China and the far east is contributing to climate change through the need to transport the goods long distances and through the need for the developing countries to build \"dirty\" coal fired power stations to fuel their economies. Additionally resources for the far eastern manufactures may be sourced illegally eg timber or non-sustainably.\n\nIt would be far better for the British economy and climate change if all goods were manufactured as locally as possible using sustainable resources and the cleanest technologies available to us.\n\nThis policy will help Britain become more sustainable, resilient and able to meet our carbon emissions targets.",
