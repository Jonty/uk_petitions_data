            "background": "it would prevent so many people being able to get out and about if pushchairs are banned from being  used on a bus without being folded why should pushchair users be discriminated against. why can't the pushchairs use the wheelchair space freely but if a wheelchair user wants to board the bus the pushchair must be folded or moved if there is room for it to be moved. and if parents are not willing to move/fold pushchair to enable a wheelchair user to board they should be fined. banning pushchairs from wheelchair friendly buses unless they are folded will cause alot of people including myself to not go out if you do not drive how do you get out? the buses are a lifeline if you do not drive.",
