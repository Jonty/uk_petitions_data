            "background": "By making larger retail outlets close on Rememberance Sunday we will make the day special for many more people than currently happens. Easter Sunday has now become a very quiet day with most people spending it with family and friends. If my proposal is accepted I would predict many more people would become aware of the true purpose of the day. We would have time to remember, to join in the two minute silence and reflect on what sacrifices were made to keep our freedom",
