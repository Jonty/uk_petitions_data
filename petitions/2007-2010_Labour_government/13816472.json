        "background": "Jon Lord is the former keyboard player with Deep Purple, Whitesnake and other bands. He is now Britains greatest living composer. He is also a gentleman. If Mick Jagger can be knighted then Jon Lord is well overdue. Back in 1969 Concerto for group and orchestra was performed at the Royal Albert Hall, Jon Lord composed this piece which incorporated both a rock band and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It was a groundbreaking composition. That is still played around the world 40 years later. He also recently composed the Durham Concerto to celebrate Durham University's 175 anniversary. It's unbelievable that Jon Lord has not been honoured over the years. I hope this is corrected very soon.",
