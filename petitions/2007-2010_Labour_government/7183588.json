            "background": "On 24/10/2007 three people observing a pair of rare hen harriers flying over the Sandringham Estate saw them both gratuitously shot. Despite a police inquiry and suspects, no charges could be brought because \"the bodies of the hen harriers have not been found\".\n\n- Was a search team with dogs sent to the Sandringham Estate immediately after the crime to start gathering vital evidence with a thorough search?\n\n- Were the clothes and weapons of the main suspects and estate staff examined forensically?\n\n- If it wasn't the suspects as implied by the CPS then how is it possible that armed trespassers other than the suspects could have been on the Sandringham estate whilst the third in line to the throne was out hunting without the knowledge of the Royalty Protection Unit?\n\nAn enquiry should be able to answer these questions and understand why the Police failed to uphold the law which applies to all of us regardless of wealth, status and ancestry.",
