            "background": "Given the exposure of the plans to increase the rate of VAT after the next election, and the subsequent statement from Mr. Brown that VAT will not be raised beyond 17.5%, my concern is this:\nIf the government has been forced to rule out this method for repaying some of the increased debt, how will they do it now?\nBefore it is too late, I believe that the electorate should have the opportunity to assess the economic proposals from all parties, and democratically choose the most appropriate in the form of an election.\nI would ask for your support in this matter by signing up to this petition",
