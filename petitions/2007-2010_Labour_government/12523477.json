        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The British chicken/egg farming industry produces thousands of chicks a year. The majority of these are Male and so useless for egg production. Instead of being kept for meat production the majority are culled by inhumane methods.\nFor example:\n\n*Maceration, using a large high-speed grinder into which the chicks are fed.\n\n*Burying alive. \n\n*Gases or gas mixtures, often carbon dioxide is used to induce death.\n\nThese methods seem fit for Nazi concentration camps than for a British Industry. In the wake of World Food Crisis I put it to the government to Ban the culling of Male chicks; and so I propose that it must be mandatory by law to use them for meat production. So they are not wasted and killed inhumanely",
