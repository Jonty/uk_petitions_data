            "background": "After deliberatly undertaking a complicated series of moves of her designated second home that allowed her to take advantage of looser tax rules for MPs she sold the property in south London for \u00a3200,000, about \u00a345,000 more than she paid for it. Revenue rules at the time of the sale stated that any profit made on a second home is subject to capital gains tax at 40 per cent. Miss Blears paid no capital gains tax because she had declared the home her primary residence.",
