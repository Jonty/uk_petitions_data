Whilst there is protection from the banks for credit cards that are used fraudulently, or mistakenly, there is absolutely no protection for you if your mobile phone account is debited either by mistake or with a deliberate reason to defraud or steal. Banks are responsible for the charges on your credit card and bank account. In a similar way network operators need to be made responsible for costs charged to your account, which are ultimately debited to your bank account, as too often it is impossible to identify who these companies actually are, to be able to recover the money.",
