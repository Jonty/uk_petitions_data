            "background": "After 10 years it is obvious that privatisation of rail has failed. Government subsidies have rocketed but it is not providing a service that is cheap, reliable or efficient. Renationalisation in the old form is not an option. It would  mean a return to the failed era of British Rail. Mutual ownership, with majority control by the most important stakeholders, the passengers, would be popular, democratic and efficient, since we are the customers. It works for building societies and for John Lewis Partnership, so why not for the railways?",
