We feel that this is a valid scientific dilemma and is worthy of further investigation. Should this problem be solved it will benefit the population of the UK, and eventually, solve the problem of awful bands on a global scale. There may even be the possibility of considerable medical and social benefits. All scientists involved may need to wear sunglasses and ear protectors.\n\nPeter O'Neasden\nRupert Bear\nMicky Rouke\nThe Ghost of Christmas Past",
