        "background": "I would like to urge the Prime Minister to strongly advise and pressurize president Karzai to negotiate with the Taliban in Afghanistan. This will not be negotiations with terrorists but with those people who are disappointed from government and have been left with no choices but to join the terrorist organization. This will benefit the NATO troops, the Afghan Government and Afghan people. The negotiation would also ease the efforts to build the country and to bring peace, stability and democracy in Afghanistan.  In addition, it will help to avoid Afghan soils to become a camp for terrorists, who could then change the way of our lives either in Afghanistan or abroad. Karzai`s government is failing to provide better protection to Afghans and trying to avoid to negotiate with the Taliban. We petition you to make these changes to bring peace, stability and democracy in Afghanistan.",
