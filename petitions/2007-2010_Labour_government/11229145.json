            "background": "We wholeheartedly oppose Wirral Council's proposal to close Guinea Gap Baths, thereby removing a vital leisure centre from a community that desperately needs it. This is a section of the Wirral that has large numbers of underprivileged families, many of whom do not have the resources to travel long distances to enjoy their leisure pursuits. The closure of this facility will also end the long history of Wallasey Swimming Club, which has encouraged thousands of children to swim, both for fun and competitively. These children have nowhere else to go if the closure is allowed to take place.",
