            "background": "Having a member of our family serving abroad limits how we can vote in the UK. Under the current system our ballot slips take to long to send back to the UK in time for the elections, or never come in the first place. We can vote by proxy but there is no guarantee that they will place the vote you want.\nHowever, there is also the issue that the MP in the constituency in the UK does not understand the specific needs of our community and is elected to represent a geographical area in the UK. Therefore we want an MP to represent us as we are abroad and have little say in what goes on in our constituency.",
