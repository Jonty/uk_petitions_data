        "background": "All student police officers go to training school for roughly 6 months and get tutored for another 10 weeks or so. They are then left to work independently for the remainder of their 2 year probation. However, if they do not complete their SOLAP (student officer learning assessment portfolio) they can not pass their probation. We request the SOLAP be terminated as it is so widely dispised by all student officers and serves no real purpose. Those who know what a solap is will surely agree.",
