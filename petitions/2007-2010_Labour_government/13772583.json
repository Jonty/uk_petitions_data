            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Due to the nature of road traffic accidents in the UK, including many of these resulting in death and the cause on many occasions being down to the driver,I would request that the PM and his Government consider making it a legal requirement for all drivers to be retested on their knowledge and practical driving skills periodically. (perhaps every 5-10 years).\n\nHaving a driving licence for LIFE in my opinion is ludicrous. (you need to renew a TV licence regularly for example and yet you can have a licence to drive a potentially lethal weapon well into your later years).\nToo many drivers on the road get into bad habits or are just down right negligent.\n\nThere is also the financial element where whatever revenue is raised from these legal re-testing requirements, is pumped back into the Roads Department to allow our roads in Britain to be maintained and to do away with the horrendous states of some of our roads.\n\nI strongly urge ALL drivers with a thought for public safety to strongly sign this petition and get the ball rolling.",
