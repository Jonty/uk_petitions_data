            "background": "Many companies are now outsourcing their call centres to foreign countries such as India.  This creates problems as foreign call centres have serious problems dealing with technical enquiries and accents that are used in the UK.\nThere is also the added problem of theft of personal data, which has happened several times.\nFinally, there is the problem of UK jobs being lost to foreign shores which in turn is harming the UK economy.\nIt is requested that all call centres for businesses operating in the UK have UK call centres which it is believed will be far productive than outsourcing.",
