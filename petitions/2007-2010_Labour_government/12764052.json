        "background": "On the 31st May 2009, the Spanish government tricked the EU into granting them control over Gibraltarian waters. The Spanish challenge British rule on the rock, and by granting them the ability to patrol the waters of Gibraltar as part of its environmental protection zone, the EU has recognised Spains claim to these waters, as a nation cannot claim for waters that it does not own.\nHaving held the rock of Gibraltar for over 300 years after the Treaty of Utrecht, it is not right that the government is not activly and publically tackling this challenge to its sovereignty of Gibraltar. We the undersigned, would like the Prime Minister to take a more active and public stance.",
