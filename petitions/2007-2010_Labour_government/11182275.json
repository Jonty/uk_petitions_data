            "background": "The fact that Baby P was allowed to die despite 60 visits\nfrom Haringey Social Services is a national disgrace. in which this poor little boy was allowed to be abused so violently every day of his short life with no one to love him or protect him, and the people that should have proctected him were the ones that killed him. his mother sat there and allowed this to happen \ni do not think she should have the right to have a new identiy i as a member of the public and  thousands of others we do not agree with the fact that baby p's mother may be given a new identiy  this is disgrace we as tax payers would have to pay for her to have a new name which isnt fair she allowed this to happen and should now face this for the rest of her life which unfortunately baby p asnt got anymore ...  people are not going to  be very happy about a person given special treatment and lots of money spent on them when they have committed such an evil crime.\u201d \nI personally find it rather offensive that the taxpayer may end up picking up a huge bill to protect this woman\u2019s human rights, given the complete disregard she showed for the human rights of her baby.\u201d",
