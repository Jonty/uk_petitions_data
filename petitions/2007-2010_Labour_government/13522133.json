            "background": "The increase of windfarms in the longterm, is not sustainable. If the government increases the opportunity of installation of photovoltaic cells to all properties in the UK it will go a long way in alleviating our reliance on fossil fuels. It would also decrease our fuel costs,i.e. not making us totally reliant on the energy companies who are holding this country to ransom?\nIt would also decrease the visual impact of windfarms.\nThere are photovoltaic cells that can look like roof tiles.No visual impact, and after initial cost.The energy is free?\nWe therefore petition the government to instate a photovoltaic system of energy in all acceptable properties in the UK.",
