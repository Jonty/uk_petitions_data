            "background": "The committee in the Westminster Union Parliament called \"The Communities and Local Government Committee\" has just recommended that local authorities (i.e. councils) be allowed to charge businesses in their areas a supplementary business rate.\n\nThe petition asks that such a proposal be strongly resisted.  Business in England already faces some 25 potential taxes, all with differing compliance regimes and in total imposing a heavy economic burden on our real wealth generating activities. \n\nThe tax revenue raised by this ill-thought through proposal might amount to some \u00a31.5 billion per year and would represent a direct transfer of resources from business and real jobs to councils for them spend on even higher pay and index linked pension entitlements for their Equality, Diversity and Health & Safety officers. \n\nEngland - when left to its own devices - is a unified, fair and well-run nation state.  The last thing we wish to see is more English tax revenues being raised, and sent to subsidise the other home nations.",
