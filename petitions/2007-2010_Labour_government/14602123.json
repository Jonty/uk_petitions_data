        "background": "The UK would save a lot of money if benefits were stopped for immigrants coming into the UK. Its ridiculous that people who have contributed nothing to the UK economy can come here and are provided with money to live on and housing. All immigrants should be able to support themselves for at least 10 years before being able to claim any kind of benefit. If these people are unable to support themselves then the government should send them back to the country they came from. This would be a lot cheaper than supporting them.\nNo wonder we are the laughing stock of the world - come to the UK and get paid for living here!",
