            "background": "With the recent institution of the Elizabeth Medal, awarded to next-of-kin of personnel killed in action, the matter of recognition to those who are wounded or invalided from the armed forces comes to light. These people have given service to their country and it deserves to be recognised. The injured and disabled are often ignored, even hidden away. These people should be awarded a full military medal, that they can wear with pride in company with campaign medals, in the same way as injured and disabled servicemen in the United States are awarded the Purple Heart. It is a very small price for our government to pay for the loyalty and service so many have given.",
