        "background": "The age relation of a vehicle number plate merely serves to create an artificial economy through increased vehicle sales following a perceived but artificial age related value depreciation. This is a \u2018green\u2019 petition designed to encourage longer ownership and hence less wasteage which would be naturally supported by manufacturers through tax incentives at first (more durable goods to receive tax breaks petition).\n\nManufacturers could be encouraged to provide durable vehicles with no obsolescence nor expected failures through design. Ultimately, this approach will increase leisure time and reduce waste. The economies founded on consumerism are artificial and unnecessary, designed to keep workers maximally occupied and therefore distracted from noticing mass population related agendas.",
