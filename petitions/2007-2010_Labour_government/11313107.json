            "background": "Please call an end to the human rights disaster which is the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine. In the name of the defence of Israel the occupation forces impose mass punishment on the people of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This involves road blocks restricting the movement of all vehicles including ambulances and fire engines, curfews lasting months, destruction of property and the murder of innocents. The UN has done nothing, America funds it and this issue is one of the primary causes of tension between the West and the Middle East. Stop it now. Stop all Israeli aggression against Palestine.",
