Someone has decided this is unfair on the prisoner!\nWas the prisoners crime \"fair\" on the victim? Did the prisoner not know the possible repucussions when the crime was commited? \nDid the victim get access to support when needed after the crime?\nThis shouldn't be about what is fair on prisoners - but what is fair to the victims and society as a whole\nWe, the undersigned, petition the the government to appeal against this ruling - so that indeterminate sentences can remain.",
