        "background": "We are calling on the government to provide the Environment Agency with more resources to effectively police the UK Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. \n\nCowboy traders are illegally exporting hazardous and toxic electrical waste (e-waste) out of the UK, fraudulently claiming consignments consist entirely of electrical equipment destined for productive re-use, and then dumping it in developing countries such as Ghana, Nigeria and China. \n\nThese fraudulent traders are posing as legitimate re-use and recycling organisations, and enticing unwitting UK businesses and consumers to use them to dispose of electrical waste. \n\nThe government must provide the Environment Agency with the resources to prosecute anyone involved in a supply chain that results in the dumping of e-waste and remove licences from organisations in breach of the WEEE legislation.",
