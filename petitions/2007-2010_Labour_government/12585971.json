            "background": "Many food products contain animal based ingredients, such as gelatine, despite there being readily available vegetarian and vegan alternatives. \n\nFood production companies regularly choose the animal-based option (gelatine etc) in order to make small savings on costs, making products unnecessarily unsuitable for vegetarians and vegans.  If the animal friendly alternatives were to be made the cheaper and more commercially viable option, companies would choose these instead.\n\nWe would like to see a tax reduction (even if only a small fraction of a percent of VAT) for products that are fully vegetarian/vegan, in order to incentivize companies to use animal friendly vegetarian/vegan alternatives wherever possible.",
