            "background": "Having trained and taught in London for fours years I had hoped that a move back to my native South West would be a simple enough task. It has been far from it. With around fifteen jobs in the Glous, Bristol, Somerset area this year for male staff this year, around eighty NQT and teaching staff have been applying for such a limited pool of jobs. UWIC, Exeter, Bath Spa, MarJons, Bournemouth, Cheltenham etc all supply around fifty students each year. Where do they all go? Please help the trained staff in finding their feet rather than University\u2019s filling their pockets with extra funding they get from running 'sports' courses. Teacher training is one big empty promise with regards to PE. My pension is suffering, I can\u2019t pay the bills at home, but nobody seems to care.",
