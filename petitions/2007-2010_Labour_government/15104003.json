            "background": "i would like chnages to the way housing associations uses rent to improve social housing. I would like to see a percentage of a persons rent, kept by, for repairs to that persons home. For instance, my housing association has told me that my double glazed windows which are 30 years old will not be replaced. If a percentage of my rent was kept aside to cover the cost of repairs to my home then once i have enough money in my personal pot then major repairs, redecoration, new windows etc could take place.\n\nI see that all my rent goes to building more housing stock and my repairs are left outstanding while other properties are getting new bathroom and kitchens, i'm using a lot more gas on trying to keep my house warm, my energy bills are getting greater due to drafty old windows which need replacing.\n\nSo would it not be better to have individual money pots for each residents properties rather than one pot that covers the 15,000 home that  broomleigh housing association (now called affinity sutton)owns. So i can imagine that i will never get the windows replaced due to this housing association owning too many houses.",
