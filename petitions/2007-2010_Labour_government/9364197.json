            "background": "The price paid for motor fuel includes an unusually high level of taxes and duties in comparison to other commodities.\nMotorists are unable to take an informed position in any debate on what constitutes an acceptable level of Government revenue from fuel sales, because the figures are not clear. Sales receipts in USA and Canada have included this breakdown of what is paid in taxes and what goes to the fuel companies, for many years. This information should be made available to motorists in UK now.",
