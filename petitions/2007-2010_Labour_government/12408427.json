        "background": "To remove MBW Training from the goverment new deal contract. Due to the fact they can not provide relevant work placements for the customers as per their contract, they are arrogant towards their customers in that they dont listen when a placement is wrong for the customer and seem to think that sending a customer to a work placement detailing manual labour and then not training them before hand is acceptable practice.  This company should be shut down before someone gets seriously hurt and the goverment is responsiable.",
