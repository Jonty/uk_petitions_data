            "background": "The Prime Minister says he wants to put cash in our pockets to help with the current cash crisis, the best way he could help the people of merseyside would be to take over the Mersey tunnels and make them free.\n\nAt the current price of \u00a31.40 each way it cost's \u00a31456 a year to go to work 5 day's of the week never mind if you have to cross to see family members.\n\nIf the goverment took over the tunnels like they have with some toll bridges and made them free, It would save the people of merseyside \u00a31456 a year allowing them to spend it on other things like food.\n\nIt would help regenerate and create jobs on the Wirral where the cost of the tunnels is a huge barrier to business.\n\nAlso as it stands now the voting system on tunnel price's is unfair, there are only 4 representatives for the wirral where as there are 12 for Liverpool.\n\nThis Means votes are prity point less as there is just two voting blocks Wirral and Liverpool, with Liverpool beeing 3 times the size of the Wirral an 8 year old can work out who wins all the votes.",
