It is a matter for the police to investigate whether IWF are breaking the law in any respect.\n\nIf you would like to re-submit the petition, please do so but take out any potentially libelous statements. Asking the government 'to provide open and clear regulations for IWF to follow' is fine.\n\nKind Regards\n\nE-Petitions Team",
