            "background": "MPs are now well paid, yet many MPs of all parties accept payments from private companies for consultancies, advice and non executive directorships which create a conflict of interest. They are meant to serve only the electorate who pay them, but are in practice being influence by payments by private firms. \n\nThis is clearly a conflict of interest - and one that costs taxpayers heavily as firms are given government contracts at rates highly favourable to the companies and highly unfavourable to taxpayers.\n\nThis petition requests the Prime Minister pass a law making it a criminal offence for MPs to accept any payments in future from private companies. It should also ban former Ministers from being employed by a firm which got contracts from a government they were a member of for a period of 5 years after they stand down as a minister or MP.\n\nThis would help ensure that MPs and ministers serve all of their electorate equally and ensure the best deals for the taxpayer. It would also help reduce any perception of financial corruption in politics by keeping the public and private sectors separate from one another.",
