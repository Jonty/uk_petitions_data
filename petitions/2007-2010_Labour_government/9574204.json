            "background": "Many people, myself included, are extremely ill because of mercury poisoning from silver/mercury fillings. It's highly expensive to have them removed by mercury free dentists, who know the correct procedures, and it can take several years to recover even when they're out. People can end up in wheelchairs and sometimes it's life threatening. The medical profession doesn't recognise our illness because there are no tests and we're often misdiagnosed. The closest diagnosis is ME/CFS but diagnosis is incomplete because they don't recognise mercury poisoning as one of its possible causes. Dentists are currently not allowed to place fillings containing mercury in pregnant women and young children so why put the rest of us at risk of this horrendous and debilitating condition? Several European countries have banned it.\n\nIt must be banned immediately!",
