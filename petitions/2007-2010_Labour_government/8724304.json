            "background": "I would like the government to consider helping all families with childcare costs.ALL parents not just those on low incomes.\nI am a working mother who earns \u00a36 per hour, most of which goes on childcare. Because my husband earns a decent salary, we get no help with childcare costs (it doesn't matter that he pays ALOT of tax and we have to keep a roof over our heads). It seems that the government does not want to reward those of us who want to work. There are many incentives for those who do not. The government think that just because you're not living on the bread line that you don't deserve any help.  If the government were to bring in a scheme to help all families with childcare costs, more mothers would be willing to work as childcare costs is one of the biggest worries any family has. This would benefit the economy, as it would retain many highly experienced workers who do not return to work due to childcare costs. With more mothers in the workforce our children would learn from an early age that all parents work and hopefully would help the future economy of our country.",
