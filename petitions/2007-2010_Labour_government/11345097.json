            "background": "Coal prices in the UK have risen by 80% since September 2008. The government has no fixed price agreements with the British coal industry. They are effectively allowed to charge what they like to domestic consumers, and this week they intend to increase their prices a further 10%. \n\nGiven that oil prices have gone down, will the government please bring into force price regulations on coal to prevent families from freezing to death and being driven into poverty.",
