Ambulance chasing is a scourge on our society and should be stopped. The only people who benefit are accident management companies, lawyers and solicitors. It is a disgraceful situation. Stop solicitors/Lawyers advertising. Stop people approaching you in the street asking if you have had an accident and stop Accident Management Companies from chasing you 3 years after an accident to see if they can make what amounts to false claims.",
