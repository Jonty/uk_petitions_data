This was the first time she had tried it.\n\nHer dad Bryn, 43, believes she'd be here today if she had been educated about the dangers of solvent abuse.\n\nThis is very likely NOT the first case but for god's sake let it be the last. \n\nI ask you, that we make the awareness of solvent abuse of EVERY kind to be explained in every detail in secondary schools.",
