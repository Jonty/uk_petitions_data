            "background": "I know that it is under the LA and council's discretion to close schools. However i believe that it would be highly detrimental to close the school. It provides an excellent education to those with learning difficulties espeically with government policy of closing speical need schools. In addition it would close a school with small numbers which is very beneficial to students as it creates a family atmosphere, more important also as it meets the needs of many military children. I believe that the focus on Academies is destructive to all students as it impedes the creation of a school spirit and interaction with students and staff. In addition Academies have not proved their effectiveness in league tables and it is an outdated, outmoded and superannuated idea used previously to poor effect.",
