            "background": "The government proposes to fluoridate  British tap water to help fight tooth decay. The choice of whether you then ingest this artificially added chemical is therefore taken away from you, unless you can afford to purchase bottled water.  Fluoride should be a choice and can be taken by the individual at their discretion.  It is NOT risk free and has been linked to tooth pitting & staining, and bone cancer in extreme cases.  If there is any risk at all then the decision cannot be taken out of our hands.  Say 'No' to fluoridation.",
