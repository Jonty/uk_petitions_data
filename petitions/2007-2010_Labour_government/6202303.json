        "background": "so that we are not taxed by the Local Authorities on income that has already had tax inflicted on it! This could also be applied to other fixed housing costs like the standing charges on fuel bills and items like the Oyster card for Londoners which would help low earners who do not get paid a London Weighting.......... \n\nBasically though if this sort of incentive to be in employment and law abiding is too cumbersome to apply then\nthe basic income one can earn before tax should take such items into consideration more and be raised so every one can earn at least \u00a3100.00 a week untaxed!  Thank you",
