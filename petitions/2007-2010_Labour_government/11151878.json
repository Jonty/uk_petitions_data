They have been held captive for 80 days now (Today 27-11-08)\n\nThe major reason for their continued detention is the Prime Minister, Mr Gordon Brown's pledge to assist the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s' military with assistance & training.\n\nThis has angered the militants who are holding these 2 men. The British Government and media has remained extremely quiet about the plight of these two captives.\n\nAll efforts must be made at the highest level to secure the release of these British subjects.\n\nWe are blogging this story and these lines that we are sending to No 10 today all over the planet in the next few days..\n\nAction to receive this petition or reaction for not, your choice, we know politics..\n\nThank you and good night,\n\nRegards,\n\nPastor Byron\n\nPS.
