            "background": "the universal library project began in 2002 and is a joint project being undertaken by chinese, american, indian and egyptian universities. it aims to scan copies of every book possible and put them online for all to read. \n\nthe specific focus is on university/education related books, and so far over 1 million books have been scanned, which is sign of the project already on it's way to achieving it's significant and vast goals.\n\nso far europe has rejected cooperation in the project - surely a collosal mistake. this project could open up education on an unprecedented global scale, allowing the impoverished access to books that could have never previously been possible\n\ni therefore propose that the government offers funding to universities in britain who wish to partake in this project, for the good of not just ourselves but as much of humankind as possible\n\nsee google for \"universal library\" for further details",
