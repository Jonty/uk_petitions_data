The people of Iran have been participating in peaceful protests to call for a re-election and have been met by brutal attacks. \nWe, as citizens of this country, believe in fair and democratic elections. We therefore petition our government to engage more seriously and urgently in dialogue with the Iranian government and to press for a re-election with international monitors in Iran. We insist that the British government should refuse to recognize Mr. Ahmadinejad as the elected president of the Iranian people. We demand that Britain object to the EU's acceptance of Mr. Ahmadinejad's presidency.",
