With any change to the system loopholes will be found that will be exploited for financial gain. We as the taxpayers who finance these claims and the constituants of the MPs who are making these claims we should be able to view where claims have been made. Technology allows these claim to be published the minute that they are approved. This will reduce any politican that feels they can make interesting claims in the weeks before an election.",
