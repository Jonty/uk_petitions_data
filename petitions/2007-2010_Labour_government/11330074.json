            "background": "As seen on Panorama...97% of teachers have a disruptive or challenging pupil in their class and only a small percentage of schools provide specialist teams to support these children who are unable to be present in the classroom either because they are disruptive or are a risk to themselves or others. This is where the government needs to step in and help. Instead of teachers spending a lot of their time stopping lessons to sort out constant behavioural issues, there should be more support in school to help teachers out. Not just once a week but continually available every day to ensure that whilst these children are out of the classroom, they are still learning and developing and getting support where it is needed, rather than being made to stand out in the corridor where nothing is achieved or resolved.",
