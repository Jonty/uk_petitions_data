It is incompatible for members of racist organisations to be employed in these sensitive roles.\n\nWhilst there is a ban in the Prison and Police Services there are currently no restrictions on members of the BNP, Combat 18 or the National Front from being employed in the Home Office or UKBA.\n\nPlease sign this petition to demonstrate your support for the campaign to instigate a ban.  It is unacceptable for asylum and immigration policy to be implemented by members of racist organisations.",
