            "background": "The cost of DVLA is enormous. Building maintenance, furnishing, computers, supplies, staff (incl support, admin and maintenance staff), advertisement, pursuit of tax dodgers incl sophisticated technology and so much more. Scrap DVLA, put .5p on a litre of fuel. No-one can avoid paying, visitors from overseas will contribute, gas guzzlers will pay more than economical users, reduced queues at post offices, reduced paper waste, no fines for late patment, and so on. Just .1p per litre would raise more than \u00a3150 per year per average motorist. And we won't have to get time off work to buy a disc.",
