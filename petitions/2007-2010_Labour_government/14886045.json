We know there is no cure for them so why let these evil people out of jail to rape and abuse babies and children again.  The people who agree to let them out of jail are as bad as the ones who perpetrate these heinous crimes as they are allowing them to abuse again! This has to stop.  Our children are precious and no-one should ever, ever hurt them.",
