The DCSF has no right to withdraw a vital public resource without consultation as Councils are obliged to keep Public libraries open for the good of the whole community (UK Libraries history started in 1847 and for public benefit under the Public Libraries Act of 1850). Therefore can only by changed by parliamentary legislation and not a self appointed DCSF committee. I ask the public and MP's to sign this petition if you wish to keep your local and national Public libraries open for all.",
