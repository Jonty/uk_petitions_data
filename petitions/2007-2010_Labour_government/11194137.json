            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Small businesses are paying VAT on a tax limit that doesnt take into account large overheads ie: premises, council tax, stock purchasing, etc but only have a small profit margin forcing owners to claim benefits to survive personally. allow us some respect to earn a full wage without having to tax the resources of the goverment thus saving them money by dealing with our requests. Most business owners work very hard for what little they have but get penalised by a low tax limit, by the time we pay rent, council tax, amenites, vehicle costs, waste disposal, stock purchasing, then dealing with customers and eventually earning a profit there is very little left for a wage and then we have to pay VAT. My VAT bill would increase my wages to a normal working person.",
