            "background": "Female pensioners aged 60-64 are discriminated against as they are unable to receive the higher tax allowance until they are 65. Men receive this as soon as they become pensioners, but female pensioners have to wait 5 years, and this can cause considerable hardship, especially with the abolitition of the 10p tax rate. Thousands of female pensioners in this age group are still suffering.",
