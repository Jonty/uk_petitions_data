            "background": "The Janjaweed are rampaging round Darfur - acting like lords and masters and as if they owned the country - attacking, raping, and killing innocent citizens who have had to become refugees in their own country.  The African Union is doing its best but they can't do very much and, in any case, do not plan to stay for much longer.  The situation is absolutely horrific for the Darfuris - they can't even leave their refugee camps to look for firewood without risking gang-rape (including young girls and old women) and/or death - please act as you would if this were happening to British people and do everything you can to help them!",
