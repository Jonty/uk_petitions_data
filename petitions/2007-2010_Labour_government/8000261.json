        "background": "The animals Act 1971 protects farm animals such as sheep and cattle from being worried or killed by dogs that are poorly controlled. Recent incidents in the UK where alpacas have been savaged and killed by Dogs have not been able to be prosecuted because  the act does not include Alpacas and other camelids such as llamas. We call upon the Prime minister  to rectify this anomaly by Primary legislation or order in council and protect these beautiful and valuable livestock which are classed as normally domesticated in the UK by DEFRA.",
