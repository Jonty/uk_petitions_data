No large scale development should be considered until the outcome of the A46 is decided and the dual carriage way is in place linking Newark to Leicester. Only 3 years ago a Planning Inspector ruled that Newton is an unsuitable location for any major development and that the infrastructure needs in the area were urgently met. \n\nThere have been no improvements, only gridlocks and weekly accidents backing up to and from the M1 30 miles away!",
