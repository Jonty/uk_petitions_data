            "background": "There are many speed humps on UK roads which exceed the national limit of ten centimeters. These should be removed as they cause damage to cars and the environment. Councils do not respond to complaints to remove these illegal bumps and I would like the government to implement a system whereby these bumps can be reported and then investigated. Once a bump is found to exceed the limit that bump should be removed or reduced to below the limit.",
