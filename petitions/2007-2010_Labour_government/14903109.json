            "action": "introduce legislation to prevent seasonal surcharges (seasonal pricing) for water supply",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Some Water companies are proposing the introduction of higher prices for water use in the summer time.  Their justification is that it will reduce consumption at a time when supplies are lower.\n\nThis is not likely to reduce useage by any significant amount.  The wealthy with large gardens and swimming pools are likely to just pay up.  Other large users are not likely to reduce their useage e.g. golf courses.\n\nThis will penalise those who can least afford the charge: families who use most of their water for hygiene and cooking.\n\nEffort should be directed to water efficiency by the water companies, preventing leaks, stopping development in drought prone areas and better policing of hosepipe bans etc.\n\nThis requires a National approach to stop this.  If some companies are allowed to introduce this, others could be expected to follow suit.",
