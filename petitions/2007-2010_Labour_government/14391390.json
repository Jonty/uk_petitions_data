            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The requirement for a daily act of worship of a broadly Christian nature in state schools discriminates against people of other faiths and those with none. The current situation where parents can opt-out of these observances singles children out which encourages divisions. Each school should decide whether to include a daily act of worship to allow parents to choose a school that was acceptable to their beliefs, or to petition their child's school for a change. There is currently no option to choose a school of no religious character which undermines the government's aim to give all parents choices in their children's education.",
