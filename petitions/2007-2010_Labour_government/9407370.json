            "background": "Government gas and oil central heating Grants for the elderly & people on income support should be allocated to the householder so they can choose the most cost effective CORGI or OFTEC approved installer in their area.  \nAt present for full grant work, the job is often passed to a company owned by the company that issues the Grant in the first place.  The work is allocated on a territory basis and therefore there is no direct competition for this type of work.  Often the prices are significantly higher than a local CORGI or OFTEC plumber would charge.  At present the Grant Approved installer is often a long way from the householder having the work done and often problems are not resolved very quickly.  \nSurely this is not helping smaller local businesses, the Grant customer is not getting the service that they want and the tax payer is not getting a fair deal.",
