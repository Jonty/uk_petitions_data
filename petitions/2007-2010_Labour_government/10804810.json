This extent of this concern can be seen in on the Internet, for example a Facebook group aimed at signing a petition to ban the live skinning of animals quickly collected over a quarter of a million signatures. It is the responsibility of every moral person to work to reduce this level of suffering and it is incumbant on the Government to make the feelings of many of its citizens known to the Chinese Government. The Government should introduce an immediate ban on ALL fur products as much Chinese fur is imported mislabelled and via third parties.",
