        "action": "introduce reforms that will require financial services organisations not to discriminate against those failed debtors (funts or financial untouchables) who are able clearly to show they have used their best efforts to  repay as much of their debt as they can reasonably afford.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many people who have had difficulty repaying their debts are treated by the financial services industry as funts \u2013 or financial untouchables.\n \n We believe that those who do their best to repay their creditors should be offered the incentive of no black marks, no being treated as financially untouchable and no waiting six years for credit blemishes to be overlooked. \n \nBeing a funt can mean losing your home, being denied a mortgage or even rented accommodation. It can mean not getting a new job, being denied insurance, not getting a credit card \u2013 and being denied access to lower cost internet shopping.  It can mean being denied a pension or savings account.  \n\nFor most funts, who have learned a lesson and are proving they are willing to do their best to repay their debts, it is an unfair response.  We hope the Government will help them..",
