Even comedy show highlights  portray characters waving guns and laughing as if this the norm.\n\nSurely our broadcasters should be uplifting those whom they serve not reducing all to the lowest common denominator.\n\nIf you aspire to raising the standard of Television programmes please submit your support to this petition.",
