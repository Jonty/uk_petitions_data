            "background": "I am increasingly frustrated at the progress of the police investigation, the way it has been conducted and the fact that if this had happened in the UK Madeleine would inevitably have been found by now.  I can only liken the attempt to now implicate Kate McCann as akin to the Sally Clark case.  Have that family, and particularly Madeleine's sister and brother not been through enough?  We as private citizens feel impotent, what can we do except stay vigilant and spread the message, the Government surely have the power to do more.",
