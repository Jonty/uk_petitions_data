            "background": "i would like to see long serving tenants in pubs given the 'right to buy' option like that which is give to council/private house tenants. \n\na tariff of percentages should be made by law, so the pubco's would have to follow them, i.e\n\n10 years of service = you can buy your pub for 80% market value, (not pubco estimated value)\n\n15 years service = 70% market value\n\n20 years = 50% market value\n\n25 years and over = 40% market value\n\nWe have been a serving tenants in the same pub for 23 years. And for the last 18 years we have been wanting to buy the pub off of whichever brewery/pubco owns the pub at the time, but all have refused because it earns them too much revenue.  \n\n i think it is about time we (the tenants) are legally entitled to have the option to buy from the pubco's.",
