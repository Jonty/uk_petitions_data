        "background": "I've just read a petition asking for A.D.H.D. not to be classed as an Emotional and Behavioural Disorder (E.B.D.) partly on the grounds that children with such a disorder receive less help with their education than those with asthma etc.  In my strong opinion children with E.B.D. should be entitled, as of right, to exactly the same support as children with any other disability or disorder; E.B.D. is just as debilitating and difficult to live with as other disabilities, etc., and suffering from it is also as little within the control of the children affected.",
