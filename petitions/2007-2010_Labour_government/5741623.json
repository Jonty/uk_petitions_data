That information is not trivial, it is all our financial data.\n\nThis information is for companies to make an informed decision as to whether to give us credit, and can be useful to stop us overstretching ourselves. The trouble is fraudsters can use this too to find out all about us, and when they want to use our identity to get credit, there is no way of stopping a search.\n\nAllowing us to lock our credit file, and only open it when we want credit would be a solution to both fraudsters fishing for information, and getting credit without our knowledge.",
