            "background": "The Mohuiddin Trust has bought the old Burnley College, in order to invite Muslim Women aged 16-35 from abroad, to reside and be taught in it. After the race riots, all faith schools in Burnley were closed and amalgamated, in order to bring about cohesion and integration and we feel that this College would damage the still delicate relationship between the different cultures and cause further resentment. The Trust already have Islamic Colleges abroad and so we question why they need to bring thousands of Muslim Women to this small Town.",
