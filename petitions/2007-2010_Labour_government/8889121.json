            "background": "Now that MP's have had their expenses pegged back and rightly so, I totally agree with what Nick Harvey MP quoted, \"I think in this day and age, it's just not really a sensible situation for MPs to be buying television sets and washing machines with taxpayers' expenses\" they need to go one step futher and stop the subsidising of MP's meals and drinks in the Houses of Parliament. I work as a field service engineer covering the whole of the UK and HAVE to produce receipts for all my outgoings and don't earn anywhere near the wages MP's earn, sorry take home. It's about time MP's etc etc started to set an example to the rest of the nation, once they have maybe the rest of the overpaid can start to do the same.",
