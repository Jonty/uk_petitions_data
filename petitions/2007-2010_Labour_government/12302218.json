        "background": "This is a major campaign by the CIWF (Compassion in World Farming).\n\n\nWe need to act now to urge the European Commission not to abandon legislation which benefits animals and consumers.\n\nBy the end of next week, the EU Commission may propose scrapping legislation requiring eggs to be labelled according to farming method. Current law requires battery eggs to be labelled as \u201ceggs from caged hens\u201d - legislation that Compassion in World Farming and our supporters fought so hard to bring about. This would mark a devastating backward step for both animal welfare and consumer freedom - making it more difficult for us all to make informed choices about our food.\n\n\nPlease, let's stop the EU with this ridiculous backward step - we should be going forward not backwards, cruelty to animals is unacceptable.",
