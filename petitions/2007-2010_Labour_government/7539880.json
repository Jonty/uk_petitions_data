Government rule in the present form is not something that has been around for a long period of our history and is not as natural and established part of humanity as is thought.  A debate is needed, whereby the limits of government rule and its rights to it are established. \n\nFor example:\n\n- To what extent can the government interfere in individual lives, past that of preventing injustice to others?\n\n-To what extent can the government tax someone involuntarily for another\u2019s benefit?\n\n- To what extent can it claim the right to be privy to the private information of an individual, be it relating to identity or actions or other?\n\nand so on.",
