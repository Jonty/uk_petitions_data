            "background": "We are one people, since 1707 we are all British. For centuries we have built a reputation for being amongst the most accepting and fairminded people in the world. Integration of different peoples have been an unstoppable and entirely natural development; throughout the history of our country. It has enriched our culture, changed our language and contributed to our broad minded attitude of others. Everywhere in Britain there are signs of natural adaptation, yet increasingly there are also signs of deep division. The very notion of a united Great Britain is being eroded by the tainted views of minority groups and even some of our own  politicians. Therefore we petition that Parliament should recognise the British as one people, to steadfastly oppose anything that would divide us. Furthermore we petition that government should make every effort to reunite us, as a single proud people and not to use official government forms and documents to highlight our racial and religious differences.",
