        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is to make the government look at the unemployment rate and to show how it can be fixed. Most of those not in work are in that position because they have a lack of skills, qualifications and/or experience to pursue careers that they might enjoy. Most of these, for over 18's, are not free, and for the unemployed, un-afordable. If they were free, or an income could be supplied while in these training schemes, then more people would be in them, and therefore more people would become employable. This should apply to all college courses, apprenticeship and private training provided by organisations and companies.",
