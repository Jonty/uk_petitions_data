            "background": "At present voting in parliamentary elections is restricted to British citizens, along with citizens of the Republic of Ireland and commonwealth countries who are resident in the UK.  Lord Goldsmith has proposed removing the right from Irish and commonwealth citizens, disenfranchising many people who have lived in this country for many years at a stroke.\n\nAccording to figures in Hansard from 29 Oct 2007 there are currently nearly 1 million working EU nationals in the country, who under the current system have no parliamentary voting rights.  As EU citizens are automatically entitled to live and work in the UK it makes sense for them to have an automatic right to vote if they are so resident.  They already have this right in European and local government elections, and we propose that this be extended to parliamentary elections.",
