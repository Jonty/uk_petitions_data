Partially filled boxes increase transport cost, waste fuel, increase road traffic, and increase storage and handling costs, as well as producing extra waste when the package is disposed of.  Partially filled containers are bad for the environment and burden the consumer with unnecessary cost and waste.  With modern packaging machinery, settling in transit is no longer a valid excuse for half empty packages.",
