            "background": "DRM software, falsely labeled \"copy protection\" by various media groups, has been shown to unjustifiably restrict legitimate and fair use of purchased media.\n\nThis software is mislabelled \"Digital Rights Management\", a mislabel due to the fact those using it have no business managing any person's rights, and can be far more accurately defined using the word \"Restriction\".\n\nThis software is often installed without consent or knowledge, and can cripple the legitimate use of computers to back up data.\n\nWe the people demand that usage of DRM in all forms of sold media be prohibited, for the common good.",
