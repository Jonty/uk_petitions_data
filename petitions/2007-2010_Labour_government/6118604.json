        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Prior to April 2004 GPs were required to provide an out of hours service between 6:30pm and 8.00am on week days and over the weekend.\n\nA GP can opt out of this responsibility in return for giving up on average \u00a36000pa. Given a GP \u201cearns\u201d over \u00a3100,000pa, the attractiveness of the opt out becomes apparent. Further, trying to get a GP to visit you out of hours is almost impossible.\n\nBeing a GP is a vocational job and in the service of the public. Unfortunately most maladies don\u2019t recognise a GP's day time hours. A patient can find themselves debilitated by many illnesses that require a professional to assess. This should be in their own home and at any time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nFor this reason I petition that a GP's salary is cut by 50% if they do not provide an out of hours visiting service.",
