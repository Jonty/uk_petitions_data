        "background": "Stratford Road in Alcester flooded in 1998 and 2007. Houses there were flooded to a depth of 2'6\". There were plans to install pumps in 3 places in Alcester, including Stratford Road, but  it has been dedided to not do the Stratford Road one because there is only a 1 in 150 year risk. This clearly silly as we have flooded twice in 10 years.  In 2007 the river water came trhough the town and came to the lowest point in stratford Road and was inable to escape because of the flood defences!.The stratford road pump should be re-instated in the plan with the highest priorty",
