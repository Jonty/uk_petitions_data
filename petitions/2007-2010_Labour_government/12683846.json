In thanks for his fine service to democracy and transparency in our country, we the undersigned request he is suitably honoured. \n\nA knighthood has been suggested and would be welcome, but I would suggest a peerage would be better. That way, Mr. Wick could sit in the House of Lords which would put him in an excellent position to keep a watchful eye on expense claims of fellow peers and of MPs, which might serve as a useful deterrent to Lords and MPs to making more ridiculous claims.\n\nIf Mr. Wick was made a peer instead of Speaker Martin, the public would be shown that Parliament is serious about reform.",
