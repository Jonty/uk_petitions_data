        "background": "Ex-SAS hero John Wick was instrumental in exposing the scandal of MPs expense abuses. In thanks for his fine service to democracy and transparency in our country, we the undersigned request he is suitably honoured. \n\nA knighthood has been suggested and would be welcome, but I would suggest a peerage would be better. That way, Mr. Wick could sit in the House of Lords which would put him in an excellent position to keep a watchful eye on expense claims of fellow peers and of MPs, which might serve as a useful deterrent to Lords and MPs to making more ridiculous claims.\n\nIf Mr. Wick was made a peer instead of Speaker Martin, the public would be shown that Parliament is serious about reform.",
