            "background": "There are many problems with Education Maintenace Allowance (EMA) at the moment, and this is one of the most unfair. According to the 'Guidance Notes for EMA Year 2008/09', \"The amount of EMA you will get depends on the amount of income that came in to your household in the tax year 2007-08\"; i.e. those whose household income last year was above \u00a330,810, but are going to earn below that amount this year, will receive no EMA. This is a ridiculous requirement - why should anyone endure a year of financial difficulty before qualifying for assistance? For example, I'm in the second year of Sixth Form now, so by the time I will qualify for EMA, I will have left full time education!\nSign the petition to ensure that people get money WHEN they need it, not a whole year after!\n(I am not suggesting ALL students get EMA, just those who need it most - i.e. those whose income is below the amount specified in the CURRENT financial year, not the last!)",
