            "background": "The inclusion of crudity and vulgar swearing is not acceptable under ANY circumstances. The quality of broadcast content declines on a daily basis. It is  major deterioration of the English language and the standards which we are prepared to accept. Lord Reith would turn in his grave if he could hear the  content of todays programmes. At least the BBC had ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS in the earlier days of transmission. It is time to bring back the quality of our  language and cease to pander to the lowest common denominator. Failure to carry out major improvements should (as stated) cancel any demand for the payment of a TV license.",
