            "background": "Members of the plant genus Lilium produce a chemical, present throughout the plant, that can cause a cat to suffer fatal kidney failure within 36 to 72 hours.  It can be deadly for a cat to simply bite into a leaf or petal, lick the pollen from its paws, or drink water from a vase containing them. Easter, Stargazer and Asiatic lilies are the most hazardous.\n\nRecently a cat was reported to have simply brushed past a vase of lilies, getting pollen onto her fur.  She began licking herself clean and within minutes the horrendous symptoms began. She became lethargic and dehydrated, vomited continuously before suffering kidney failure, blindness, paralysis and death.\n\nWe recently suffered this tragic event ourselves when our beloved cat, Kayla had to be put down at only 5 years old.\n\nThe lack of this information has lead to many pet owners losing their cats in a tragic and distressing way, and correct informative labelling would go some way towards eliminating this awful tragedy altogether.",
