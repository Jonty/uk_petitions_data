        "background": "On 24/10/09 staff at the Identity and Passport Office in South Molton were informed that their office would be closing from May 2010.\nWe recognise that the current office is inaccessible for customers and expensive. Staff have been campaigning since 2006 that a low cost 'mobile' service could be provided in the region by utilising existing Government department space, EG.\nHM Revenue and Customs(HMRC) Offices, Barnstaple whose Customer Enquiry Centre only opens 3 days per week.\nApplicants face round trips in excess of 100 miles to attend a 10 minute interview.\n \nWe the undersigned strongly believe that a mobile co-located service offers a solution that is:\nCost efficient,local to the community, accessible for the disabled and provides a greener solution (a huge carbon footprint is created by people driving 100miles for a ten minute interview).\n\n \nPotentially other IPS Offices could follow suit thereby saving thousands (if not millions of pounds) without\nany redundancies or loss of services.",
