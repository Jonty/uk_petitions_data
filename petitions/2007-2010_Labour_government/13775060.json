Staff have been campaigning since 2006 that a low cost 'mobile' service could be provided in the region by utilising existing Government department space, EG.\nHM Revenue and Customs(HMRC) Offices, Barnstaple whose Customer Enquiry Centre only opens 3 days per week.\nApplicants face round trips in excess of 100 miles to attend a 10 minute interview.\n \nWe the undersigned strongly believe that a mobile co-located service offers a solution that is:\nCost efficient,local to the community, accessible for the disabled and provides a greener solution (a huge carbon footprint is created by people driving 100miles for a ten minute interview).\n\n \nPotentially other IPS Offices could follow suit thereby saving thousands (if not millions of pounds) without\nany redundancies or loss of services.",
