            "background": "The First Great Western route between Portsmouth Harbour and Cardiff Central is suffering from severe overcrowding, even though trains are being formed of three carriage Class 158 DMUs.\n\nThere are spare trains with more capacity in the form of Alstom Class 180 Adelante, which are being made redundant by First Great Western and being placed into storage at Oxley Depot. Around six Class 180 units would be required to offer the hourly timetable.\n\nThe benefits of the Class 180 are as follows:\n\n* Newer, quieter and more reliable train\n* Excellent build quality\n* Smoother ride quality\n* Higher top speed - 125 MPH compared to 90 MPH of a Class 158\n* Four Standard Class carriages\n* Buffet counter service available - more convenient than a trolley service\n* Fully RVAR complaint wheelchair accessible toilet\n* First Class carriage - the Class 158s do not offer any First Class provision.\n\nThere will be enough Class 180s left for Hull Trains and national express East Coast to use.",
