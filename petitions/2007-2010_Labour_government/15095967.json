            "background": "We would like the rules for Income Tax and Tax Credits changed as they are currently unfair. At the momment Tax Credits are based on a persons GROSS, before deductions of Income Tax and N.I etc, pay. We feel that Tax Credits should be based on a persons NET, after deductions, pay as this is fairer. Example- My wife currently loses \u00a32500 a year which she pays in I.T and N.I. This is NOT part of her income so why is it classed as income for Tax Credit purposes?? Please sign if you aggree.",
