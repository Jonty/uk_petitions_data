            "background": "Jim Fitzpatrick, the current roads minister, plans to reduce the national speed limit from 60mph to 50mph, enforced by average speed cameras. The stated aims are to reduce casualties and emissions.\n\nWe argue that a blanket reduction in the limit is unnecessarily restrictive and inflexible. It will slow traffic on currently safe roads, causing frustration and delays. It may well result in the exact opposite of the aims.\n\nThe 'speed kills' policy is a fine soundbite but is simplistic and fails to acknowledge that the vast majority of accidents are caused by bad driving, with excessive speed being the main factor in a tiny percentage of crashes. The culture of simply slowing traffic down is resulting in a generation of poor quality drivers who are transfixed by their speedometers, lack judgement to cope with varying conditions and who just 'drive by numbers' come rain or shine.\n\nJim Fitzpatrick's proposal serves only to exacerbate this problem and should be rejected in favour of a more intelligent, more localised approach to accident reduction and emission control.",
