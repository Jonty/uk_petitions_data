            "background": "New laws to legislate against more strongly against things that are already illegal will simply not work. For instance making additional laws covering knife crime will do no good. Carrying an offensive weapon is illegal. But criminals - by definition - simply don't care. Criminals break the law and will still do so. To put it simply if we outlaw guns only the outlaws will have guns. So stop simply making more laws and try to find a solution to this morally bankrupt society or if you have no solutions give up and let somebody else try.",
