            "background": "We need to start pulling our funding out of this so called \"war\" so far it seemed to be a 'slaughter-fest'. \n\nWhy are we even at war? \n\nTo help America, in what? Revenge?, for oil? Or more to the point, money.\nSo far, this whole \"war\" has been about money, why should we help them US of A. Yes I understand we are \"partners\" or what have you, but why, for help, we haven't needed alot of help, they just use us, for money, and for soldiers, surely if we stopped putting funding into this was, it would stop the deaths. But we don't, all because of the money, we always complain when a single soldier is lost, but so many other people have died, just for money, maybe just maybe, if we pull out, or even if i could explain in person about this, it would be alot of help.\n\nMany Thanks",
