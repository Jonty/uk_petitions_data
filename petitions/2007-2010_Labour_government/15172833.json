            "background": "The purpose of this petition is to give a voice to the disillusioned youth and demand change from the incoming government.\n\nThe Youth Minister, above all, needs to be someone who understands the issues. There needs to be more facilities and amenities, better funding for youth clubs and, in particular, more mentor programmes that will introduce strong inspirational role models into the lives of young people and show them that they have a choice.\n\nRevolver have been working with the Damilola Taylor Trust on projects and workshops to highlight the negative affects of knife crime on society.",
