            "background": "This petition calls for the sacking of Hazel Blears from the Cabinet and as a Member of Parliament. The recent newspaper reporting of her manipulation of the \"rules\" governing her \u201cpersonal\u201d expenses shows she lacks the necessary integrity and moral fibre to hold a position of trust. She has acted against the interests of her constituents and the wider British Public and disgraced her office. In addition, she has added to the growing feeling of distrust in all MP's integrity and honesty. Her position is untenable and she should be removed from office.",
