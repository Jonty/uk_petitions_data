            "background": "The use of service charges, obligatory or optional, by restaurant owners has a negative effect on both the paying customer and the waiting staff.\n\nPrices on menus should be fully inclusive of all taxes and charges applicable to dining at a particular establishment.\n\nGratuities (tips) should be entirely at the discretion of the customer and not form part of the waiting staff's core wages from their employer.\n\nThis policy will ensure a transparent cost to the customer and will encourage staff to provide the highest level of service in order to receive discretionary gratuities.",
