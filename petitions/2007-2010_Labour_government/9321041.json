            "background": "Many employees use their own car or van for work journeys. When the advisory fuel rates were set in 2002, fuel costs per litre were much lower. On average diesel was 82p per litre, HMRC calulated the costs based on this rate, which were 40p per mile for the first 10,000 miles, and 25p per mile thereafter.\n\nThe average price of diesel in April 2008 is 1.17p per litre, which is a 30% increase. HMRC have these rates under consulation and reveiw, having contacted a local HMRC office no decision has been made.\n\nPlease join in and add your comments.\nHMRC are quick enough to tax us, but very slow in making fair policy decisions.\n\nYour veiws, comments and support for this petition are much appreciated.",
