The original RSS produced by the unelected South West Regional Assembly in 2006 proposed that 45,000 houses should be built in Cornwall up to 2026, but an \u201cExamination in Public\u201d (unelected panel) has increased the proposed number to 68,700 \u2013 the equivalent of one new house for every four existing properties in Cornwall. This would have an unacceptable impact on Cornwall\u2019s communities, environment, and infrastructure. Cornwall\u2019s democratically elected representatives should be empowered to deliver a housing strategy which focuses on providing affordable homes to meet local needs.",
