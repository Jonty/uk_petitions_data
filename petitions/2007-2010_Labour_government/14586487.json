            "background": "By using wave energy generation we remove the kinetic energy from the waves, and the force that they impact on the coast is reduced. It is easy to then infer that by using wave energy generation around the parts of our coast where property and livelihood are threatened (by the sea eroding the land) we would reduce the damage this causes and generate clean energy to power those communities.\n\nMore projects should be enacted where the focus is not solely green but is driven by general efficiency seeking to solve multiple issues at once rather then single ones. The quest for efficiency is the reduction of waste if waste is resolved then there is no green debate.",
