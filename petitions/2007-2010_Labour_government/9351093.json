            "background": "Australia, New Zealand, Canada and others are making Britain\u2019s crime problems worse by \u201cPoaching\u201d our Police Officers who are fed up with pointless paper work, red tape and generally feeling let down by the public and the governments they vote in \n\nEven Plastic \u201cHalf Cop\u201d PCSO\u2019s will soon get \u201cpoached\u201d. Queensland Police who took 1000 UK officers last year) have made their own version of PCSO and soon will start poaching British PCSO\u2019s!\n\nSubsequently manpower turnover in Britain\u2019s Police is at an all time high, average estimated service for new recruits is only 5 to 7 years at best. This leads to the number of recruits being trained increasing to replace those leaving costing more for the taxpayer plus officers are becoming less and less experienced affecting the quality of the service provided. \n\nThe government must do the following:\n\n1.Make it illegal for Foreign Police forces to recruit in the UK and make it illegal for British Citizens to join them.\n\n2.Improve conditions for Police Officers so they can do their jobs and don\u2019t leave.",
