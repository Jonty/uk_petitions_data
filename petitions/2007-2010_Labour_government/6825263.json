            "background": "We oppose that ID cards, an unpopular goverment policy, should be paid for by the individual. Many of us may support the idea of an ID card, but believe that if the government wishes to enforce it, it should be paid for via Tax and not via an additional cost to citizens. We oppose the fact that citizens will have no choice but to pay for something they oppose or embrace, due to the fact that we the electorate haven't demanded ID cards, we already pay a high rate of tax, and because the proposed system has faced mounting criticism.\n    We the undersigned believe that abiding by the governments wishes is enough of a cost, and if they wish to do it they shouldnt make us pay beyond taking the money out of the Tax we already pay.",
