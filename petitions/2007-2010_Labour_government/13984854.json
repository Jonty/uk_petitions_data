            "background": "This petition is to highlight the details of a proposed Domestic Abuse Register. \nYes a very large percentage of domestic abuse is towards women and children, but to specifically limit the scope of the register to men is a backwards step. Women are capable of domestic abuse as well and not acknowledging this sets back the causes of both abused men and women. Do we claim that women aren't capable of child abuse or men can't be raped? Where do trans-gender people fit in? The register should cover anyone who is accountable to the law. \nFinally, such as register shouldn't become a scrap-book for unproven allegations.\nPlease make legislation reflect the century we are meant to be living in and the legal principles our justice system is meant to uphold.",
