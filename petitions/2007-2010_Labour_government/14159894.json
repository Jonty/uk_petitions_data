This is a disgusting distortion of the truth - Women and Men can bring about exactly the same Evils - And should be treated in exactly the same way - Contempt and prison if it is deserved.  Just because women have children does not mean women are nicer, less responsible then men or do not perform the same crimes.  We all know that\u2019s rubbish the same as the rubbish spouted for years women do not abuse children - This Idea MUST BE Stopped!",
