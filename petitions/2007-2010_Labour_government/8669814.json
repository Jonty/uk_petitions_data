            "background": "Companies now take advantage of their right to apply a fair usage policy to a service/product. I am basing my argument on telecommunication networks, mobile and fixed line. Companys for example can now say that a broadband connection has an unlimited data transfer allowance in an advertisement, although the small-print will more often than not put a low restriction on this, and if the user tops this amount is charged a ridiculous charge for the extra data. For example a certain mobile operator offers a \"unlimited 3G data\" package, but this is capped at 3GB which makes it limited. This is not the most extreme example. Using the Fair usage policy in this way is very misleading and should not longer be permitted.",
