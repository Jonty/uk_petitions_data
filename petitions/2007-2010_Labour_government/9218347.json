I am single under 60 years old and medically retired, receiving a very small pension of less than \u00a38.000. I expect to be about about \u00a3100.00 worse off. I am surprised that a Labour government; of all things, should preside over policies that penalize the poorest people in our society. I urge the gorvernment to be reasonable &\n'Please relent,reinstate the 10p rate'!",
