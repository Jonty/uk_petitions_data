Parliament has had excellent MPs in the past who did it for the public service and not for money. Now we are led to believe that politicans who accepted the salary when they joined Parliament have awarded themselves huge pay increases now just to ensure that people in future will think about becoming a MP. \nAny salary/pension increase for MPs must be controlled by a totally independant group which cannot be influenced by the Prime Minister in any way.",
