            "background": "Vehicle Excise Duty is a regressive form of taxation. It purports to tax based on usage and emissions according to engine size etc, whereas this is more effectively exercised via taxation at source; that is, via fuel duty. \n\nThe collection of tax via fuel duty really is a tax according to usage as you pay according to the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle you drive plus the way that you choose to drive (harder acceleration / braking etc uses more fuel than gentle usage of the pedals, keeping engine revs as low as possible and maintaining a steady speed). \n\nPeople will contribute taxation via fuel duty according to their chosen vehicle and driving approach: the lower the MPG of the vehicle you choose combined with the aggressiveness of your driving style determine how much fuel you consume; thereby the amount of tax paid.\n\nWhilst the current fuel price is excessive and based more on speculative behaviour than any real market forces, the basic principle of pay-per-mile/kilometre is sound and once that most people can readily grasp.",
