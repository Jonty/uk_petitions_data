            "background": "Society within the UK is suffering due to an increasing 'compensation culture'.  \n\nThere is no discipline in schools because teachers might be sued if they do / say the wrong thing to a child, sports days are cancelled because schools may be sued if someone gets sunburn, flower baskets are being taken down in case someone sues....these are a few examples that are contributing to a crazy system of political correctness and ultimately to a breakdown of society.  It is all about greed, and has nothing to do with common sense or justice - people need to accept responsibility for their own actions, if I walk into a lampost why should I be given the opportunity to sue the council??\n\nPeople and organisations are too scared to do anything because of the risk of getting sued.  \n\nThis needs to stop for all but the worst cases, and common sense must prevail.",
