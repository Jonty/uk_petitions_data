            "background": "Every year at least 10,000 greyhounds retire from racing in the UK. \n\nMany of these simply 'disappear'.  \nAn inquiry, carried out by the Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare revealed:\n\n* A minimum of 13,478 greyhounds bred for racing are considered 'surplus' to the industry in England and Wales each year. \n\n* At least 4,728 greyhounds in England are unaccounted for each year - these are presumed to be killed by the age of three or four - when their racing days are over. \n\n* At least a further 2,478 British-bred pups selected for greyhound racing each year never make it to the track - and are also unaccounted for. The Retired Greyhound Trust rehomes just 3,500 each year. About 1,500 more ex-racing greyhounds are rehomed annually by animal welfare charities, as well as others going to private homes. \n\nWe want independent tracks to be licensed by local authorities and for them to be responsible for their racing dogs even after retirement by ensuring that their dogs are either kept as pets or rehomed adequately.",
