        "background": "Having just been to my sons sports day it is a great shame to see 200 children taking part in activites that no one is enjoying and no one knows why they are doing them. \n\nRight at the end of the afternoon the head mistress announces the team with the highest score and suddenly the children become interested because they realise there is competition involved.\n\nWe need to bring back the competitve sports days (Sack Races, Egg & Spoon, 50m sprint, 100m sprint etc) racing down a track alongside other children so that your children have something or someone to compete against.\n\nNot only do the children not understand the format of a 'non-competitive sports day' but neither do the parents. There is very little support for the children in this type of sports day from the parents, they need the screaming and chanting of adults in a proper sports day race.",
