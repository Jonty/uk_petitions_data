        "background": "Criminal Record Bureau checks are supposed to be job specific, however people who have had false allegations made against them or have never been convicted of any crimes can still be punished & disclosed due to police officers \"discretion\" regardless whether or not the information is even relevant to the role often organisations do not understand this section of the disclosure and therefore on the basis of this tend to be risk averse. Strictly speaking under the Data Protection Act only RELEVANT information should be disclosed however in practice anything could be disclosed which again disencourages organisations to employ innocent people. I would like the government, the police and every organisation to review the CRB disclosure procedures to protect everyone's basic human rights.",
