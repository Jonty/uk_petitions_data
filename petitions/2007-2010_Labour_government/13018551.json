            "background": "I would like Social Security removed except for those unable to work through disability or illness. Instead I would like the local councils to employ out of work people and offer them work for pay. So that the public can get their park keepers, road sweepers, bin men etc back. And people out of work can keep their self respect, self worth and working habits. I think this would be better than simply giving people money to sit at home. When they do that it lowers their self esteem and gets them out of the habit of working.",
