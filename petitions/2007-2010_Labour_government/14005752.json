            "background": "The concept hinges on two factors:\n\nOne - Even if you are a morning person you still would rather not get out of bed at such an insanely early hour, and even if you do get up, you'd surely spend the time lazing about in PJs and generally relaxing at home instead of working.\n\nTwo: Your best work is generally done towards the end of the day and into the early hours of the next day. Anyone who has ever attended any educational institution knows that the time spent working in to the early hours of the morning fueled by nothing other than caffeine and adrenaline produces our best work and gives an unstoppable work ethic, allowing you to forgo limiting factors such as comfort, hunger, social contact, daylight, the need to blink, and many other distracting features of the human body.\n\nThus based on these 2 factors i suggest that the standard working hours of 9am - 5pm hereby are relocated to a more comfortable time of 5pm - 1am or for the more hardcore; 7pm to 3am.",
