            "background": "There is also a disused airfield in Madley.[2] It was built in 1940 by Welsh contractors and opened as a training centre for aircrew and ground wireless operators on 27th August 1941. In 1943 the grass airfield was reinforced with Sommerfeld Tracking and the centre's population rose to about 5000. The site was visited in 1944 by George S. Patton, and later by Rudolf Hess on his way to the Nuremberg trials in 1946. Today only a few hangars remain, and Madley Communications Centre now occupies part of the site.\n\nI would really like to see this Airfield re-opened and for civil flying to be brought back to Madley. This would benefit the local area and economy and give a boost to tourism in the area. THe communications company currently on the site could move to a more suitable area such as Moreton-On-lugg",
