        "background": "Today young adults are achieving things of much greatness, and should be awarded the responsibility of being able to vote at a younger age. They have thoughtful and intelligent views and opinions which we need to generate new ideas to make our society into a better place. Giving 16 year olds the right to vote would show the world the youths can make intelligent decisions, and can use their vote wisley. We are living in a new modernised world, and it is incredibly important to show others we are ready to change. If Britain made the first step to global reform, many others would follow.",
