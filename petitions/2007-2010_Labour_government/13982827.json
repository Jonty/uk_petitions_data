            "background": "They let in San Marino and Andorra but they won't let the Boys from Nuuk play ball.The Greenland FA want to be able to play international games without being forced to depend on the Danish FootballAssociation. Since 1979 Greenland has tried to develop more autonomy and ways to be accepted as a nation equal to other nations. One of the ways is through sport. The Greenlandic Federations of Taekwon-do, badminton, handball,volleyball and table-tennis have gained full membership of the International Federations but the two largest federations, ski and soccer, are still denied membership. In 1998 Greenland applied for membership in FIFA but was refused, where as the Faroes Islands application a few years earlier succeded,even though Greenland has greater autonomy than the Faroe Islands, FIFA changed the rules again!.lets get em in this time!The Greenland F.A. just want to be allowed to play friendly matches to improve not to play in the World Cup! FIFA has a monopoly of football and who can play who, it is not allowed for FIFA members to play matches against non-members and thats just not right, the greatest game in the world should be for the whole world.",
