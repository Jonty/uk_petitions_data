We have taken all Japanese shop stock of our shelves and will not be using any Japanese suppliers whilst they continue this abomination. And we want YOU to join us in helping to stop the hunting of whales by BOYCOTTING ALL JAPANESE PRODUCTS THIS CHRISTMAS.   \n\nThe Japanese won\u2019t listen to reason and they won\u2019t listen to their international peers so the time has come for us all to stand up and say \u201cENOUGH\u201d.  Then perhaps they\u2019ll take some notice.",
