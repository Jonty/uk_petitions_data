        "background": "As a voting citizen of the UK, I have slowly had my patience taken to the limit by the continual poor service that we get from International call centres.\n\nThere is nothing more frustrating that hearing an Indian or other ethnic voice on the end of the line when you are frustrated about a banking transaction or error as an example.  \n\nThere is an importance that people's problems, especially when it comes to money, is dealt with by people in the UK.  People who can deal with frustrated talk. Most importantly, re-establishing the jobs that have been removed from Britain.\n\nIt is noted that these International citizens, mainly in India, are well trained and their grasp of Dictionary English is moderately good, but when people of the UK have problems, their grasp of Dictionary speech is forgotten and often stumble their frustrated way through the difficult conversation with these call centre staff.  This gives a very poor service and leaves you wondering whether your call was successful and if your questions were answered.\n\nBring back the call centre jobs to the UK and restore the faith in the banks, building societies and other businesses that is slowly being destroyed by poor service.",
