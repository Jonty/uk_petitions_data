            "background": "A lot of no notice is taken of the law banning handheld phones whilst driving. I see as many people using their phones now as I did before the ban was in place. This morning a van nearly hit my car on the bend of a country road as the driver was holding his phone to his ear and not fully in control of his vehicle.\n\nI think it would concentrate the mind wonderfully if one was automatically banned from driving for 3 months for violating this law, except in emergency, of course.",
