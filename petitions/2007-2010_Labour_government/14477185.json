No funds would come from English, Welsh or N.I. taxpayers to go towards Scotland. At the moment the Scottish are having free university places. Scotland gets  better health care such as drugs and treatments that are thought to be too expensive south of the border. Why should Scottish MP's be able to vote on taxation and laws England when the same cannot be said for the English MP's on Scottish taxation. It is time to cut Scotland free.",
