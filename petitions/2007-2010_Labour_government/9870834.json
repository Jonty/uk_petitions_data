        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Wiltshire County Council proposed to sell the site at Stoneover lane (opposite Churchill House)to local residents. The Council withdrew their offer because a commissioned survey discovered Great Crested Newts. Bats and slow worms have also been located on this site, all of which are Priority Species on the protection list of the Biodiversity Action Plan. Any development would have an impact on these endangered species.\n \nThe site is also unsuitable because it is next to a busy main road leading to Junction 16 of the M4. Children from the Gypsy site wondering on to the road could result in a fatality. \n \nThe noise and disruption of their commercial business during the day and night would be of an unacceptable level to local residents especially those with young children\nThe access to this site would also be through a quiet residential area and would cause major disruption to the existing pond and pathway.",
