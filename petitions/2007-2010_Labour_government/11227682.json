        "background": "Dear Mr PM,\nI'm 18 years of age and even i can see the problems that the future brings. Global warming, lack of oil, water shortages, famine and other monsters from within pandoras box. All of the above problems are caused by the human race, and what sickens me is the way we deal with this. By patching up the holes of a sinking vessel. We need to tackle the problem of population with methods like birth control and other policies. The world is simply not large enough for all these people. This is a major problem in store for mankind in the future. Thanks",
