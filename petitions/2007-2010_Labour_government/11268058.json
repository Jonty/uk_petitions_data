            "background": "I am currently working in the supply industry of the british motor industry and want to support our own industry, however i am now having to replace my current company car, a landrover with another vehicle. I wanted to have another Land Rover.Despite the vehicles being carbon offset for the first 40,000 miles or so, thus effectively making them carbon neutral, the taxman does not recognise this and the punitive emission taxes on company cars like this leaves me no option but to go for a BMW, therefore the silly taxes raised under the guise of preventing global warming, which has been created by politicians to keep climate scientists in a job to make us feel guilty about a concern that in 10 years time will be found to have no substance, are killing the car industry in this country.\nI demand that these taxes are removed forthwith, or at least the carbon offsetting by Land rover is recognised by HMRC in computing tax liability",
