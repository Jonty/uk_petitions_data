        "background": "If vehicles were invented now, no sane government would allow them to be used. The sheer danger inherant to man, child and beast in being hit by any type of vehicle, motorised or otherwise, is so astronomical that no government could rightly allow its citizens to take that risk, without resort to the benefits. The only reason we allow any vehicles at all is that they have been around for more than two centuries and we have all got used to them, from bicycles in the 1700s through to steam powered vehicles, and then the internal combustion engine in the early 1900s.\n\nVehicles are dangerous to all pedestrians, are frequently driven recklessly, and cause a disproportionate number of deaths and serious injuries. Their removal would benefit averyone. And don't get me started on the environmental impact of vehicles. Even bicycles, if used as a sole form of transportation, involve higher food consumption, higher waste, and merely exacerbate the problems of factory farming. Can I ban that as well please?",
