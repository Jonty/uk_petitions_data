            "background": "In the UK, 1 in every 3,000 young people will develop anorexia nervosa, of which 10% will die, making it the most fatal mental disease in the country.  Another 1 in every 3,000 will develop bulimia nervosa, which also has serious health effects.  Although the NHS can cure these illnesses, this is often AFTER the patient has been severely psychologically and physically damaged, and sometimes isn't enough to save their life.  It is therefore vital to teach children about eating disorders and what to do if they think they're developing an eating disorder, so that eating disorders can be prevented before they need to be cured.",
