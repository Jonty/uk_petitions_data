            "background": "The UK smoke control areas were set up by the \u2018clean air act\u2019 to reduce pollution. If you are in a smoke control area you cannot try to help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint by installing a biomass stove or boiler.\nBiomass when burnt is carbon neutral because the CO2 that the biomass takes in when growing is equal to the amount it releases when burnt.\nAn average household could cut their CO2 emissions in half if they switched from heating their homes with fossil fuels to a biomass option. \nThis petition is to get different rules for biomass appliances; anything that helps reduce CO2 which is apparently the government\u2019s aim should not be rejected.",
