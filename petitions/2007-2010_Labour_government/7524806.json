            "background": "The Office of Fair Trading has imposed fines totalling almost \u00a3116m on major supermarkets and milk suppliers as a result of price fixing.  Supermarkets claim in their defence that they were trying to ensure a fair price for the farmers.  According to the National Farmers Union of Scotland, however, \"not much of the money had gone to the farmers\".  The dairy farming industry is in a desperate state and it is proposed, therefore,  that the \u00a3116m in fines to be levied by the OFT be distributed pro rata and in full among all the dairy farmers in the United Kingdom.",
