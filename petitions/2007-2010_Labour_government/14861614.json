The most fair way to do it is to distribute all the bank shares held by the taxpayer free of charge to Child Trust Funds which belong to every British Citizen under 18. A number of sensible measures must also be taken by the Prime Minister to prevent the Banks from recklessly diluting these shares or otherwise failing to perform their fiduciary duties.",
