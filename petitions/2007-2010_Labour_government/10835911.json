If it has a driver, why does it need to be guided?\n\nDriver-less systems, like ULTra, are cheaper to run, especially at night and during bank holidays. The existing installations at Heathrow and Cardiff prove that the technology works.\n\nI don't have any financial interest in BAA or ULTra. I just believe in the product for the transport needs of Britain's towns and cities. Check out the website.",
