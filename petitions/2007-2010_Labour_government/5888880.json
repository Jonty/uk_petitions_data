            "background": "The speed limit is a maximum of 70MPH. Why do we need vehicles that go over it? Inexperienced drivers should be restricted in power as well as speed. It is done for motorcycles so car manufacturers could also do it. More drivers are on the roads increasing the risk of accidents. It is proven that experience counts for driving. Most driving infringements involve young or inexperienced drivers. This is intended to reduce risk on the roads today, and increase safety for everyone.",
