Showing kids a puppy drowning in the centre of what looks like a British town is beyond fiction. It shows a weakness of argument for a government to have resort to fear to bring the public \"in line\". This advertisement should be pulled immediately.  \n\nIn the current economic climate, surely the government can find something better to spend six million pounds of taxpayer\u2019s money on.",
