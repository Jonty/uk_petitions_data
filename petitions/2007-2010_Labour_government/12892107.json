        "background": "Most large on-line companies supply no contact information. Whilst it is an inconvenience for these companies to deal with their customers, I believe it should be a right of the customer (paying or otherwise) to have proper communication when circumstances demand. For instance, not being able to contact a company such as Yahoo! or Google directly when you have been subjected to identity fraud severely hampers ones ability to deal with the situation. In this case, I believe the company should have a legal obligation, being the holder of such a large amount of your personal data, to fully engage in a reasonable manner.",
