            "background": "By abolishing the existing footbal associations of the 4 former nations, the United Kingdom could possible have a genuine national football team and possibly win the World Cup. In 1966 football was not played in so many nations, but is truly world wide now, so the old country names now have little meaning. It did not take the teams of West Germany and East Germany to become one team when the two countries merged. So Prime Minister of the UK nations, lets have a UK football team and compete with the best in the world, even if it's 300 years overdue.",
