            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Since the new security measures of carrying on-board liquids have come into place, it is now essential to carry any liquids in clear plastic bag distributed by BAA. Heathrow alone last year carried 67,527,923 passengers. Even if only half of those passengers carried liquids on board, that would mean a significant amount of waste plastic generated by this new rule at only one UK airport. If these measures are essential for security reasons, then please ensure the environmental impact is minimised by the use of bio-degradable bags and ensure they are suitable to re-use to limit to only 1 bag for more than a single journey.",
