            "background": "If you drive a car, then you are highly likely to have noticed that your average speed on a dual carriageway or some sections of motorway is reduced to around 50mph as opposed to 70mph when articulated lorries begin overtaking each other. There are journey time trials where lorries are not allowed to overtake in existence on certain dual carriageway roads but nothing further appears to be happening, so I believe that it is time to do something about it. My proposition is simply to make it illegal for any vehicle over 7.5 tonnes to overtake between the hours of 06h00 and 20h00 Monday to Friday. This would substantially cut down travelling times on roads that are currently notorious for traffic jams (like the A14, A1 and A38) caused by slow-moving vehicles. Some roads are already close to gridlock without heavy vehicles adding to the problem. Let's get Britain moving again.",
