        "background": "In the Government\u2019s White Paper Care Matters: Time for Change the government recognises the key role played by family and friends carers in raising children who would otherwise be in local authority care. However, research demonstrates that these carers are likely to be experiencing financial hardship.\n\nAt the moment only family and friends carers who been approved as foster carers are entitled to financial support. For all others, including those on the brink of care, it is at the discretion of individual local authorities. There is evidence of wide variation, leading to a postcode lottery and financial hardship for many carers and the children they are raising. \n\nWe propose that a national non-means tested allowance, to cover the real costs of raising a child, should be paid to family or friends who are raising a child for more than 28 days continuously, where there is judicial or professional evidence that the parent is unable to care for the child.",
