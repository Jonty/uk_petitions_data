        "background": "Myxamatosis is a vile disease, created in Government laboratories,  which causes wild  rabbits to suffer for weeks and then die.  Owners of pet rabbits have to get their pets vaccinated annually to prevent this disease affecting their rabbits and killing them.  The Government agreed for rabbits to be infected in this way to decrease the wild rabbit population.  Rabbit owners now have to pay between \u00a320-\u00a330 TWICE a year to stop this disease affecting their pets. Considering you can buy a rabbit for \u00a310 this cost is ridiculous. The vaccine is less effective after 6 months, so vets are advising to get their rabbits vaccinated twice a year.  The Government should subsidise this cost for rabbit owners.  Rescues rely on donations but still have to bear the cost of this vaccination for rabbits they take in for re-homing. Please either make this a free vaccination or reduce the cost to \u00a35 per vacinination.",
