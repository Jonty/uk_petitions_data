            "background": "In the UK there are many charities that work with victims of the human traffick trade. This involves people being abducted from their homes, mainly in the eastern block, but also in South America and China. They are then forced into either prostitution or slave labour, and are subjected to terrible abuse involving being beaten, and raped.\nThese non profit charitys rely entirely on donations, they do not currently recive any government funding, which I think is a travesty that needs to be addressed.
