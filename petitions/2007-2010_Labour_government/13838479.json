        "background": "The government created The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs - THE advisory council to the UK government - to advise on drugs policy.\nThe government has then ignored the advice of The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, and now, because the chief drugs adviser Professor David Nutt has spoken out against the government ignoring the advice of The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, he has been sacked.\nThis petition is for the reinstatement of Professor David Nutt, as his advisory council more accurately represents the will of the people, than the government that has chosen to repeatedly ignore their advice.",
