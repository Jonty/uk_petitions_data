            "background": "Whilst the Government is trying to ease the economic slowdown by reducing interest rates, banks are failing to pass on this full reduction to their customers.\n\nThe whole point of these rate cuts is to ease the financial pressure and burden on british households who are struggling with high mortgage, food, gas, electric and petrol costs.\n\nPlease Mr Brown put pressure on banks to pass on BoE rate cuts immediately to their customers as this will ease the burden on families facing home repossession unable to keep up payments on their mortgage.",
