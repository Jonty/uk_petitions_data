            "background": "The current market forces are killing off rural and seaside communities as well as putting a great strain on major cities. Communities in particular in West Wales and South West England are virtually ghost towns in the winter. The family and first time buyers of local residents who live in these areas are priced out of the market by people who only use their properties on Bank holidays or annual holidays. My proposal would put a large majority of homes back into the ownership of the people who live and work in those communities and therefore contribute to that area.",
