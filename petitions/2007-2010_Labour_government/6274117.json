            "background": "Many student teachers work hard to train as teachers. They pay thousands of pounds to train as teachers as they are told that we need teachers, only to find out that they cannot get a job when they qualifify.  Many NQT's work onb supply for over a year and some still without a permanent post. many posts are temporary due to funding, seeing many teachers not being kept on in a school without another job to go to.  there are now many NQT's and teachers without jobs.  this is very disheartening after spending thousands of pounds on training to become a teacher.",
