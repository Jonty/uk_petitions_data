        "background": "Every year, two million dogs are inhumanely caged, tortured and consumed in Korea. These dogs are intentionally beaten and tortured before consumption due to the myth that the adrenaline released into the dogs' bloodstreams, will have health benefits to the consumer!\n\nThe practice of killing and eating dogs is not because of some long-standing cultural tradition. In fact, most Koreans eat very little meat. Yet the cruelty and killing of dogs for human consumption continues because profit-driven industry forces are aggressively promoting the myth that eating severely mistreated dogs increases male sexual prowess and general health.\n\nThe tragic reality is that authorities are essentially giving the dog meat trade their support through their silence and indifference. This kind of abuse needs to end. We need to stop the cruelty of the dog meat trade and close down the thousands of Korean stores, nationwide, dealing in this horrific trade.",
