            "background": "Currently the EMA acceptance is based on previous earnings from the tax year 07/08 . If your financial income has dramatically reduced from the previous tax year , this will not have any effect on the EMA approval process . This is very unfair on people who were earning above \u00a330,000 in the tax year 07/08, but due to redundancy / loss of job in 08/09 , would not be entitled to a penny in assistance for 08/09 to keep their children in Further Education.My petition is aimed at altering the rules to allow parents with low incomes in 2008/2009 to get access to financial support to assist their children to maintain their further education ,regardless of their parents income in 2007/2008",
