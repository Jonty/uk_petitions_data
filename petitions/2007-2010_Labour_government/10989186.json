            "background": "I propose that a car manufacture can lease use of the M4 bus lane for one model. The manufacture will only be able to apply for one of their models. The car will need to be manufactured in the UK and registered in the year of the lease. This scheme will boost new car sales. Manufactures will be invited to put in sealed bids and the lease will be for 12 months. This scheme will generate revenue. The M4 bus lane will continue to carry its existing traffic plus all the cars permitted under this lease. This scheme will  slightly ease congestion and be good for the environment. The M4 is only one road and used by a minority of UK citizens but the current congestion and benefit of this proposal will attract a lot of customers to the winning manufacture. \nIt\u2019d be in the manufactures interest to apply for this for one of their models with the right volume of sales to make this work for them. Number plate recognition cameras can enforce this.\nThe scheme could also be extended to include free use of the M6 toll road and free use of the Dartford crossings.",
