Should we not extend the same to genuinely rehabilitated people? \nShould criminal records not only reflect unspent convictions, especially in cases when people have genuinely turned their lives around?\nSafeguards can be put in place that are proactive - preventative, not unecessarily retroactive. It is the occurrence of present and future abuse that we must protect against, and most people had clean records before they abused someone. \nThe extent to which we have been barring people is now ridiculous, and MUST stop.",
