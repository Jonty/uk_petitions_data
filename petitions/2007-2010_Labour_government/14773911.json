            "background": "Most of the other juntions of the North Circular Road already have names, which are displayed above the road sign. This enables clear location advice in traffic reports, maps and Sat Nav screens.\nThe A406/A1000 intersection is not named, and would be in memory of the historic Green Man pub that stood on the site, and in recognition of the Green Man Community Centre that now stands there.\nGeographically, these roads pass through what was Finchley Common, with all the myths and legends associated with the Green Man of the forest.\nThis is not just a local authority issue, as too many organisations are involved because of the different classes of road.  This request needs a top down approach to enable everyone involved to get this name approved.",
