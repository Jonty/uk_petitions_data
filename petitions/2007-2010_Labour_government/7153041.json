            "background": "The 2012 olympics is not far off they have started the build and are wanting to find more sports to be added into the olympics i recommend skateboarding as a skateboarder myself i no that the skateboarding comunity over the past few years has risen quite a lot but there are not a lot of competitions and if there are any they are in places that no pedestrian would see them, but i want people to see the skills of skateboarding,and how much we are devoted to the sport that is why i ask you kindly to take notice of this petition and help us involve our sport into a bigger community the olympics.\nThis petition could also have a big change for the way people think about skateboarders and how different we are from other young community groups and not what most people think and hopefully more people would take an interest in skateboarding. \nThankyou Ashley Davies (16)",
