        "background": "I believe that in response to Russell Brands disgraceful act on BBC radio last week, action should be taken against him.  Taking into account the damage he caused to Mr Sachs and the hoax 999 call he made earlier this year, it is evident that he is clearly out of control and shows no remorse for his behaviour. It won't be long until he performs his next act of lunacy. The only option remaining is to ban him from appearing on all television and radio. Any channel or station that wishes to associate with him should incur a fine.",
