        "background": "Is the saturation of soft-core pornography into the mainstream press and media having any impact on society at all, however mild or extreme?\nIs a young girl or woman staring provocatively at the reader, with her breasts exposed for public consumption, served up amongst our daily news having any effect whatsoever on our psyche?  So prevalent is the \u2018female as submissive sex object\u2019 in the British press and media, might society have been brainwashed into believing that girls and women exist purely for men\u2019s sexual gratification and titillation?  \nIs it not a bit sickening that these images sit amongst stories on war, terror, murder \u2026 rape? What message is this giving out?\nIn a country that has only just legalised the right for a woman to BREASTFEED in a public place, why should having young girls\u2019 naked breasts on public display be ok? Is this an indication of women\u2019s true status in society?\nHow can we really have true equality whilst Page 3 and other forms of soft pornography is in mass circulation and pushed in the public\u2019s face whenever we walk into a newsagent\u2019s or turn on the TV? This is sexist and should be stopped!",
