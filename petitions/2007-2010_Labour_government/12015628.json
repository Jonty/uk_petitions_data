            "background": "This is a stupid idea, the government offering \u00a32000 to owners of old cars to buy new ones.\n\nThe only people this will help is an industry that over produces, over prices!! What other industry could do that and get away with it?\n\nThis idea is just good money after bad and in the long term will benefit no-one. Well apart from non-UK owned companies.\n\nBecause of this over production the cars being sold will already have been produced and so will not help the suppliers to the car industry. \n\nNew cars are not essential, as 2/3/4/5 year old or even older cars are efficient and clean, if you want to go down the environmental argument.\n\nThis solution has been successful in a country with low debt, so to introduce it here would be a nightmare. But we are heavily indebted and even more so if this \u2018solution\u2019 is implemented.\n\nIf people can afford a new car they will buy them, but most people now realize that to buy a product that instantly looses 30% of its value as soon as they drive of the forecourt with high servicing charges is not as good an idea as it used to be.  A good quality second hand car with choice over where to service, is what people are looking for?!!?",
