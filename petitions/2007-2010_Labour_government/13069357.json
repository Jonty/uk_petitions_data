        "background": "Our target is for people who have been diagnosed with coeliac disease to be entitled to a medical exemption certificate. The reason for our target is because people don't ask to be diagnosed with coeliac disease and it is very expensive to buy gluten free products from supermarkets, with the cost of prescriptions in England currently being \u00a37.10, this is also too expensive. Coeliac Disease is a life long illness and people shouldn't have to pay for medication, which is what the gluten free foods basically are.",
