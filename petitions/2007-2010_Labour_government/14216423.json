        "action": "provide grants to incapacity benefit and ESA claimants for online training courses where no other funding exists",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In September after feeling demonised for way too long, I decided to return to college to train to work with children. I went to apply only to find that there was no longer any suitable part time courses and even if there was I would have to pay for them. I'm now applying for work through Pathways and whilst they are helpful, they can't help me get the training I so desperately need. There are plenty of online courses which I could do and I have plenty of voluntary experience and all I am asking for is a \u00a3500 grant so that I can get off benefits, into work and be able to use my own experience to help others. \n\nIt seems grossly unfair that incapacity benefit and ESA claimants are demonised week in week out and yet we can't get the training we need. I therefore propose that grants be made available for online training (as this is far more accessible to disabled people) so incapacity benefit and ESA claimants have the skills and qualifications necessary to return to work.",
