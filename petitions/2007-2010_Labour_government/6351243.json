            "background": "There are moves by pressure groups to ban angling and increasingly anglers are being denied access to previously used fishing marks.\nThe public have enjoyed free access to the shoreline for hundreds of years and the revenue from sea-angling keeps thousands of people in employment. Eating of self-caught fish contributes to a healthy diet and does not deplete fish stocks in the way that commercial trawling does. Will the prime minister please enshrign the right to fish in perpetuity.",
