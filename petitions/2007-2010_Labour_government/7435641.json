Why are these petitions being refused?  Presumably because the current government wishes to remain in power.  If, as Gordon Brown says, he wishes to develop an open government that listens to the electorate, he should also allow those who wish to see a change of government register their petitions to see whether or not there is a general mood for change among the population of the United Kingdom.",
