            "background": "Energy firms are not passing on reductions in wholesale energy prices and have many different tariffs which are constantly changing. These tariffs also run for fixed time periods only and consumers are then automatically transferred to more costly or inappropriate tariffs.\nThe system needs to be regulated and controlled more effectively, controlling prices, and reduce the vast number of tariffs offered by the companies to ensure a simple structure of comparable tariffs are supplied across the industry as a whole.   \nThe priority is to enable the consumer to easily and effectively compare the rates offered and select the optimum tariff for their situation.",
