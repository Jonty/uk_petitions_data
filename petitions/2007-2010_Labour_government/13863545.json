            "background": "These job cuts fall in the wrong place.They cut frontline staff who add the most value to the group and customer service.This is ill thought out and narrow minded.These job cuts if needed should fall on those roles that add no value to the business.I would suggest the various layers of new management recently added (Senior Banking Manager).These are generally overpaid individuals that add little value and get paid about 4 times the amount of a typical cashier.Removing roles like this will return more savings both short and long term, additionally less roles would need to be removed in order to make the savings, a better use of taxpayer cash, especially considering that taxpayer cash is now being used to fund redundancy payments.",
