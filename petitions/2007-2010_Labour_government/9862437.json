        "background": "The current law on fuel tax is unfair. There is a double tax on fuel!!\n\nWe are paying around 50p in fuel duty and there is a VAT on top making the total tax is 58.75p!!\n\nThe current rate of VAT is 17.5% - when the oil companies increase the fuel prices we automatically pay more in tax by VAT.\n\nGordon Brown is going to put 2p extra on fuel duty - he already got more than 2p by VAT!!\n\nI think it is time to abolish the VAT and make the tax into a single tax!!\n\nDo not forget that we also have to pay the tax for the fuel tanker's fuel which is already being double taxed.",
