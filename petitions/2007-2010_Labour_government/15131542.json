            "background": "It is obvious that the United Kingdom needs all its Armed Forces, equipped to the highest possible standards and with the highest possible quantities, for the defence of this country and, where necessary, for the furtherance of UK interests and policies throughout the world. Where economies must be made, the British people should be consulted through their representatives. UK defence, and that of our Overseas Territories, should be every Government's highest priority. The size and equipment levels of each of our Armed Forces should each be three times their current size. The Armed Forces cannot fulfil their current commitments properly and another commitment or a threat could not be met. 1000 combat aircraft, 1000 Challenger 2 tanks, 200 warships together with all the support vehicles and equipment necessary is what is needed. 60 years of general peace should not lead us to the same mistakes as those of the 20's and 30's. Remember how the remainder of the EU came to our assistance in 1982.",
