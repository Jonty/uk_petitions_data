        "background": "British Energy is one of the biggest electricity suppliers in the country. Few UK energy companies can afford to buy it due to them being stopped from expanding into countries such as France, Germany, Spain etc. Why should these foregn countries be allowed to buy a strategic asset of ours when this is not allowed in their countries? They have already bought the majority of our electricity industry for which we are now paying the price.\nThe EU only plays fair when it suits certain major countries.",
