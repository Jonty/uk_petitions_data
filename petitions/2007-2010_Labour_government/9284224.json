            "background": "In November 2008 this government will increase the cost of Marine Red Diesel by over 100%, overnight. This will generate only a few million pounds for the government but will jeopardise many jobs in the UK\u2019s Pleasure Marine Industry. The vast majority of motor boat owners do so, on a budget and choose to spend their hard earned income around the coast of the UK, not only berthing and maintaining their craft but also holidaying in the UK. The knock on effect of this tax will have a significantly impact on the UK\u2019s marine industry and will result in job losses and is yet another example of this governments ridiculous tax policies. Please vote to stop this tax!",
