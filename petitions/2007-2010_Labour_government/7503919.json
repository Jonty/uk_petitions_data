The government do not care about health because the ever increasing financial worries on the workers causes constant stress and worry and this puts more of a burden on our GPs this is good for the drug compainies who provide anti depresents millions each year are spent on these drugs. Of course we need to pay tax to maintain the nation but this governemnt is killing us with financial worries. It does not effect the rich or the lazy who will not work it is the people on less then \u00a350,000 a year who are under the most financuial.pressure.",
