            "background": "Unemployment benifits where brought out in the 50's, designed as a short term measure to tide people over after becoming unemployed. It has since then created a stigmatized underclass of 'long term' unemployed people. This working class subculture, is alienated from employment, and sink into apathy about their prospects. Leading to deprivation and crime.\n   What is required is a radical reform of the job center, with compulsary rapid retraining as a condition of benifit payments. As well as the long term sick and unemployed recieving help, not pressure, to achieve their potential. \n   The other alternitive is to give up the ideas brought about after the 2nd World War, and do like America did when they scrapt the benifits system.",
