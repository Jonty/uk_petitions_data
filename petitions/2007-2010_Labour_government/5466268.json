            "background": "The recent announcement regarding the permitted subjects that are to be reported in the School Performance Tables disadvantages schools that have followed Government advice to broaden their KS4 science offer to students. A contradiction exists between government advice and the acceptable qualifications. The STEM agenda (as emphasised by Mr Brown as Treasurer and PM) requires a greater uptake of sciences but the reporting requirments will narrow the curriculum and possibly the uptake.",
