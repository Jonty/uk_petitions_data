If they no longer wished to remain British then we would talk, but otherwise we will not contemplate making them become forcibly colonised by Argentina.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Falklands are currently a self-determining dependency of Britain much the same as Gibraltar. Why, if this is how they want to live would we sit down with Argentina (at the will of the US) to discuss forcibly making them come under the control of Argentina? How is this a solution to anything that we fought for and servicemen died for in 1982? It is selling their lives and families short.",
