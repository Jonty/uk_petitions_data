            "background": "consider rebate on council tax for a Plumbing courses, which has been refused for a full-time vocational course.\n\nReasons given are illogical and unfair:\na)  not higher education\nb) not in a prescribed educational establishment\nc) not an apprenticeship(though it may lead to one and  it certainly leads to employment\nd) It is part-correspondence course(with 6 weeks in the college workshops)  - \n - \n1. The only  relevant criterion is that I am a full-time student \n2. The Plumbing course is being run by the UK\u2019s largest Distance Learning Organisation, Train 4 Trade Skills, with 50 years continuous operation, with access to loan free tuition grants. \n3. In these times of hardship, this refusal to encourage retraining in a trade while, for example, helping in an MA in Creative writing,seems typical of government\u2019s failure to help those in most need.",
