            "background": "We believe that the Government should consider instigating the JPA system, as used by the Ministry of Defence and our Armed Forces, for all MPs submitting expense claims.\n\nClaims submitted by the individual will be better tracked, anything that is deemed inappropriate will immediately be rejected, and the taxpayers will have their trust regained as the level of inappropriate and disallowed claims is reduced to zero.\n\nJPA is clear cut, easily audited, and claim regulations are black and white.  You either can or cannot make a claim - no room for manipulation of cheating.\n\nIt has proven itself to be the best system for the Armed Forces - so it should be the natural solution to bringing an end to bogus claims from MPs.",
