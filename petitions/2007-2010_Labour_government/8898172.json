            "background": "Powergen unlike the majority of electricity companies have not adjusted their meters for a period of 2 years. this has allowed pre-payment meter users to get into debt without any knowledge of the fact Powergen have not made any effort to adjust the meter putting the customer in unecessary debt.\nPowergen refuse like many other companies to cancel this debt because they failed to adjust the meter.\nThis should apply only to acessable meters not those which are inside a property where powergen cannot gain access. This does not allow pre-pay customers to shop around to find the cheapest energy supplier and ties them to Powergen until the debt is payed. the very purpose of having a prepay meter is to either get out of debt or stay out of debt not as powergen see it to create debt.",
