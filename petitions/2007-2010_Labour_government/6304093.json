The music facilitates the gang atmosphere we currently have in our streets.\n\nPeople nowadays are that moronic to be influenced by music, unfortunately the most easily influenced people are those that listen to RnB and Hip Hop.\n\nIt's time to ban this juvenile form of music and the culture that goes with it.
