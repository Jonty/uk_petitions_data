            "background": "The Government bought a controlling share of RBS to save it from failing. We the people of Britain now via our government own this bank. The heads of this bank now want to divvy up over a billion pounds as bonuses while the economy is still very fragile and public services are to suffer savage cuts to redress the imbalace in borrowing. The bankers think they are worth it. Alistair Darling has a veto to make them limit any bonuses to \u00a325k ( just about the average yearly income for most folk). Please sign this petition to make him use the veto",
