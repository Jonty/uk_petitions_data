        "background": "i believe that everyone should have the right to help by giving blood, if there is a test before giving blood then whether as man has had homosexual sex or not, he should be able to give blood, i have many people all over the country willing to help me with this cause and a dedicated page on facebook, heterosexual couples get HIV too! i hate the fact that i cant help with the world even though i know i dont have HIV and many homosexual people also dont have HIV, i see it as stereotyping and discrimination that homosexuals cannot give blood, anyone can get HIV this is UNFAIR, women fought for their rights, as did black people, so i will fight for mine! please support me in this",
