            "background": "Did you know that there is currently no Ombudsman for the UK travel industry?\nHanding over your hard earned cash can sometimes turn sour for thousands of holiday makers each year who did not receive what the glossy photos in the brochure promised, and results in thousands of complaints from people who are trying to reach settlement with tour operators, via small claims courts and arbitration whilst trying to hold down a 9 - 5 job.\n\nAre you just as surprised that the UK travel industry enjoys such freedom away from any Ombudsman, which explains why the travel industry runs rings around its customers with its complaints procedure?\n\nPlease sign up to this petition to get the UK Government to set up an Ombudsman for this multi billion pound industry.",
