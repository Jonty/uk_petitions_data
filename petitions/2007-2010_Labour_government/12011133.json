It needs to be looked into offering routine screening as the number of deaths and serious disabilities could be lowered greatly by offering screening tests. The pain of loosing a baby is the worst pain in the world there are no words to describe it and when that death could of been prevented it makes it even harder to bear. If the deaths of these babies could be prevented then every effort should be given so that they are.",
