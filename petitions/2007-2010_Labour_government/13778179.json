We believe that this shows no respect or recognition for our soldiers' bravery in returning a second, third or fourth time (or more!) to a war zone and therefore petition the Prime Minister to express the country's thanks to our Forces by presenting them with a medal for every tour of duty so that their efforts can be remembered with honour, dignity and respect.",
