            "background": "It would make more sense to allow arguments along the lines of -  'dispute facts' = 'no I didn't do it'; 'facts are correct.. but' and then allow arguments about the law involved, 'Yes but you've got the reasons wrong' or 'Yes but so what' to allow argument about maybe the law itself - in a society with increasing expectation of public intellectual capacity. The point of pleading not guilty but having remorse as a mitigating factor seems a little silly. Surely the language is arcane and over limiting in its confrontational sense so better legal minds might have better ideas for a form of words for the modern day.",
