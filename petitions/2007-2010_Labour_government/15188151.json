            "background": "NHS PCT\u2019s have asked doctors to reduce prescribed drugs to one months supply per prescription. This has caused an increase in prescription charges for those patients on long term medication.  \n\nFor example my local PCT has requested that the HRT packs of 3x28 tabs be broken into 1x28 tabs. This has the effect of requiring the patient to order, collect and pay for 3 prescriptions instead of 1. \n\nThis cannot be fair to the patient or cost effective for the NHS. They will need to process 3 times the paperwork, involving doctors and pharmacists time, open and repackage the drugs and provide the safety paperwork with each package. In the example above the cost of the HTR drug is 2/3rds the cost of the prescription!\n\nWe ask the government to prevent local NHS PCT trusts from rationing the supply of prescription drugs to patients with long term medical conditions.",
