        "background": "I think that the Government needs to enforce large businesses and councils to reduce their carbon emissions and footprints. This can be done by fining them and ensuring that the money from these fines is put towards helping home owners purchase renewable energy products for their own homes.\nAlso local planning officers need to enforce new commercial buidings to be built with at a minimum solar panels installed on their roofs, and maybe even their own wind turbines to generate their own electricity.",
