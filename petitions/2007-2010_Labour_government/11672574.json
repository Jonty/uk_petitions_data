        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Male piglets are castrated because the hormones they produce as they mature gives the meat a foul taste called 'boar taint'.\n\nAlthough we used to castrate all male piglets in the UK, these days commercial pigs grow so quickly that they are usually slaughtered within the first year of their lives before they mature and therefore there is no need for castration.\n\nOnly 1% of UK pigs are castrated and this usually takes place on organic or rare-breed farms where pigs grow at a slower rate. In Europe, 99% of pigs are castrated as they like to grow their pigs through maturity to a bigger size.",
