        "background": "Many Ex Servicemen and women have served their country for many years and do not have any award or medal to show for it. A Ex forces medal should be instigated to award all ex forces personnel who served their country for 6 months or more. The current Veterans Lapel Badge is an insult to those who served their country valiantly. Other Commonwealth countries award medals for regular service, why doesn't Britain.",
