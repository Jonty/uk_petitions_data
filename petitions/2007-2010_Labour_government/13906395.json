            "background": "Complex regional pain syndrome(CRPS) is a chronic neurological disease characterised by severe burning pain which is out of proportion to the triggering injury (if there was one) though there are many symptoms which span virtually every area of the patients lives.It is estimated that 11,500 people in the UK have CRPS yet it is often under diagnosed because awareness is so low. Often people wait years for medics to arrive at the correct diagnosis which is extremely detrimental to the patient's prognosis as early treatment is essential to recovery (50% of cases go into remission within 6 months IF treated).Because of the lack of awareness almost all sufferers have been accused of \"faking\" illness or making things seem worse than they are simply because people do not know that ilnesses like this exist.Furthermore this causes problems with employers, schools and when applying for disability living allowance.The limited awareness in the UK means that CRPS patients are at a disadvantage compared to countries where events such as CRPS/RSD awareness month(November)are promoted by local government. Please help the sufferers of this horrible disease by raising awareness.",
