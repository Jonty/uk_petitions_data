            "background": "The UK job market has lost several thousand jobs to overseas branches of UK Companies in a cost saving exercise  called off-shoring. This means that a service is performed abroad either the phone or using a computer to communicate with a internal or external customer based in UK effectively providing a service for UK person but remotely; the best example of this are the call centres at banks and software development. The UK job market has not received any benefit from this and many people have been laid off as consequence of this practice. The damage that this cause to the economy should be reduced by imposing and additional tax of between 40% and 50% on the profit generated by companies that send jobs abroad, and to use these taxes to contribute to the funding of education grants and unemployement related benefits.",
