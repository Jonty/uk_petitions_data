        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe the child support agency needs more power to investigate the income of a non resident parent when the lifestyle does not match the said income.\n\nEg: After having a case with CSA for the last one year, a earnings deduction order was sent to his employer ( his brother in his case).\nThe same month he declared, his income decreased to \u00a3100 or less.\n\nI believe that this was done to avoid paying the arreas and stop them chasing further payments. Also his lifestyle does not match the income\neg:Gym memberships totaling \u00a3250\n cinema membership\nfairly new car and a 3 bedroom house.\n\nWhen I asked csa to investigate his lifestyle, I was informed that I had to proove his income did not match.How am I supposedto do so, when i have a restaining order agaist him!!!!\n\nMy question is,\nShould it not be CSA conducting this investigation ??",
