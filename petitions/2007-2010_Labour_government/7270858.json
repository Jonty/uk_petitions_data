            "background": "As alcohol abuse and drunkeness are such huge problems and there is no public or commercial appetite to control access to alcohol, the reduction of alcohol content in all drinks will achieve a reduction in damage without harming prices, taxes or enjoyment. Beer no stronger than 3% by volume, Spirits max 25% by volume, Wines max 5% by volume. That will alleviate drunkeness and liver disease whilst maintaining the right of all to drink.",
