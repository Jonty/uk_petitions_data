            "background": "We believe that it is unfair that those people who choose to eat or drink themselves into ill health are often prioritised when many people who have no control over an illness or disease are refused or sidelined for treatment.   \n\nIf someone becomes obese, and needs treatment, they should prove that they are serious about changing their eating habits, and that they want to lose weight.  If an alcoholic develops a liver disease, they should prove that they are not drinking, and are committed to change before action is taken.\n\nNo one in this country should expect to be housed, cared for and esentially paid for, without making considerable effort to change their behaviour.",
