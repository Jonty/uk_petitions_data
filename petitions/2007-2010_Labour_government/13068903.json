        "action": "Abolish Stamp Duty completely, replacing lost government revenue with increased income or council tax as this would be a much fairer system.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Those who move house frequently are subject to repeated stamp duty tax of significant amounts eg \u00a312,000 per move on a \u00a3400,000 house. A person with the same income who does not move is not subject to this tax. \n\nThis is firstly unfair as the tax system should be based mainly on ability to pay. Secondly it also creates an incentive not to move house, reducing the geographic mobility of the labour force, contributing to higher unemployment and greater inequality between regions of the UK.",
