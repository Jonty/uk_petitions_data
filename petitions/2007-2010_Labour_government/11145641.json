        "background": "Many small property developers have been using a company structure to raise finance for conversions of existing properties into multiple units (up to 5 or 6).  Typically the only shareholders are the developer and maybe members of his/her family.\n\nSince the price of these units has now fallen heavily, many of us are trying to refinance the debt incurred for the units' construction by letting rather than selling them and raising longer term funding until the market improves.\n\nUnfortunately, very few lending institutions are now prepared to lend to these companies and only on very unattractive terms.  There is a much wider choice of lenders and better terms available in the individual buy to let market.\n\nHowever, it is very expensive to move these properties into a personal name of the company owner because HMRC treats all of the property transfers as one transaction.  This brings these arrangements into 3 or 4% stamp duty bands.\n\nWould the Prime Minister/Chancellor consider amending the linked transaction rules to give some relief to smaller developers?",
