This is a good thing and there have been less people playing music out loud. But there are some inconsiderate people who play their music so loud through earphones that all people around them can hear them. This is anti social and infuriates those around them. You are also subject to abuse if you question them. That is why we need some sort of regulation or penalties for those who make other peoples journeys miserable.",
