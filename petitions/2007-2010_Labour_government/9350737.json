The Fair on Fuel campaign urges the government to remedy this through the reduction of duty.  \n\nWith over 70% of fuel cost going to the government it is simply not acceptable to say nothing can be done. The American government has recently reduced the duty on fuel as a means of controlling prices. For the good of the vast population of the UK we believe our government should follow their lead.",
