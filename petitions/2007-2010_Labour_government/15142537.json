            "background": "The British Embassies in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have indicated they will no longer issue passports in the UAE with effect from August 2010. All applications will have to be sent to Dusseldorf, Germany for renewal, taking up to 4 weeks for completion, plus additional costs of postage and courier. As many British expatriates living in the UAE travel around the Gulf and further afield, this will have a hugely negative impact on their business activities. Travellers are already under pressure to obtain visas from GCC Embassies to facilitate travel in the region. To have to wait 4 weeks for a passport renewal - a process which currently takes less than a week - is both inconceivable and unacceptable.",
