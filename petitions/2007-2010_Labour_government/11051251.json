            "background": "With more British car jobs being made redundant, it makes sense and it is imperative we buy British built vehicles for the Common Purse procured fleets. Namely for the, NHS..Police..Ambulance..Fire..\nEnvioroment Agency..Goverment vehicles.\nJust consider, the more British vehicles bought, more staff are kept in employment and they in turn, pay more taxes and NI into the Common Purse, along with their employers owning the Companies?\nIt's not responsible by you, our Goverment, to indicate that the EU rules require competitive tendering, as it would seem Germany, France and Italy choose to ignore this directive, and favour their respective home built vehicles for their Common Purse bought vehicles. Why can't we?\nWhy have the our procurement Managers of the publicly financed fleets, have this obsession with Foreign sourced vehicles, when it is planely obvious British built vehicles as as good as any in the World?",
