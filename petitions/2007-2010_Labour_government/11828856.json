Given this, we would like Gordon Brown to overturn the ruling that Jack Tweedy has to reside at his mother;s address on his wedding night. We are aware that he has commited a crime and his release was granted on the condition that he remain on curfew between 7pm and 7am. We are simply asking that you grant one act of kindness for Jade Goody that she is able to spend her first night as a married woman with the man she loves.",
