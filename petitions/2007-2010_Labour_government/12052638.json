            "background": "An animal is a living creature. I have recently read stories about animal cruelty where animals have been killed and the MURDERERS have only been given 6 months, a fine and 2 years of not working with animals! How is this justice for the animals!? It isn't & if you take a life, you should be treated with the same discipline as you would for taking a human life. We need to set an example for the rest of the world. don't stand back and let nothing happen. Let us ensure that sentencing is increased, ie jailtime and of course, let us ensure these people never own or work with any animals again.",
