            "background": "The results of the British voting for MEP's clearly show that the British population is fed up with the treatment we get from the EU. Far too much of our legislation comes from Europe and much too much of our taxation goes to Europe. Now is the time for you to make a stand and show the British People that enough is enough. Repeal many of the laws that have been imposed on us, also the rules and regulations that restrict what our fishing, agicultural and manufacturing industries can do. Many of our citizens have their freedom restricted by the output from Brussells. Stop the outflow of millions of our hard earned cash each day. Tell Europe that we will trade with them but not be ruled by them. The people of Britain will be behind you if you make a stand.",
