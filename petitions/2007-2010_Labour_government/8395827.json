            "background": "It seems to me the government and politicians never used to take notice of people when they raised 'green issues', for example: 'car polution', 'waste management' etc.\n\nThis was until some bright spark said 'we can make millions from this!'\n\nPeople in power sat up and took notice of this and have taxed us (the normal worker) and business to the hilt.\n\nFrom ridiculous congestion zones in London (anyone who lives there knows it is a con, and the price is going to rise), to a possible charge for us to drive everywhere!\n\nWe're not stupid, as the goverment seems to think and here we should stand up and be counted!\n\nWhere does all this money go to? Who knows? But we should care!\n\nI am all for recycling and saving our planet but look carefully at what they are doing to us.\nWe are the highest taxed country, when you take into consideration indirect tax \n\nSo act now. They will just rubbish it as they always do and make lame excuses for taxing us into an early grave.\n\nThis petition is against governments profiting from us and NOT a rant against issues of environmental welfare, of which I am very passionate.\n\nSIGN THIS AND LET US BE HEARD!",
