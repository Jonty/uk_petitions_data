        "background": "It is appalling that someone who kidnapped their own child for the purposes of claiming the reward money be given a state-of-the-art entertainment device. As someone who pays taxes, goes to great pains to retain a paying job and has never kidnapped a child I find it offensive that she be given an expensive games console because she is 'unpopular' with the other inmates. As I understand it, the purpose of interring social deviants is to rehabilitate them so that they may rejoin society as productive members - not entertain them while they wait for their sentence to end.\nTo this end I suggest Karen Matthew's PS3 be removed and she be given educational books that will aid her in becoming a better person.",
