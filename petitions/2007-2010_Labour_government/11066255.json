            "background": "After watching the TV interview which Mrs Shoesmith did the other day, when she praised her fellow social workers who worked on the case, I , along with the interviewer, and i would imagine many thousands of others, could not believe what she was coming out with, not a word of regret, she just kept saying, the responsibility is with the parent concerned and the other two males involoved, although, yes it is true, but she was taking no resonsibility for the way Haringay Council carried out the case. \n\nSo i am starting a petition to put pressure on her to resign, as i feel she feels no remourse and no sense of responsibility for the death of this poor young lad",
