        "action": "help savers who invested in good faith in ISA plans which were marketed by FSA-regulated firms as being ISA-compliant but which have now been discovered to be non-compliant, by ensuring that HMRC does not remove ISA status from such plans, nor seek repayment of income tax or capital gains tax from such individual savers.",

        "background": "Savers who subscribed to ISA plans invested in Keydata Secure Income Bonds, and similar products, have recently discovered that these do not fully comply with ISA rules. Savers invested in good faith in these plans, which were marketed as ISA-compliant in successive issues since 2005, and individual savers had no control over the management of or underlying investment of their funds. The potential loss of shielding from income and capital gains tax poses a serious financial loss to such innocent savers, also the ability to transfer plans to other ISA managers, and it is only fair that these plans should be treated as valid in all respects which affect individual savers.",
