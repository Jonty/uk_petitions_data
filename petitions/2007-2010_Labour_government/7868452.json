            "background": "Although he is purely a fictional character, Randle Patrick McMurphy, fits the bill/fills the shoes perfectly as he is already an inmate in a lunatic asylum - surely a pre-requisite for the job. \nBoisterous, ribald, and ultimately shattering, Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is the seminal novel of the 1960s that has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time. Here is the unforgettable story of a mental ward and its inhabitants, especially the tyrannical Big Nurse Ratched and Randle Patrick McMurphy, the brawling, fun-loving new inmate who resolves to oppose her. We see the struggle through the eyes of Chief Bromden, the seemingly mute half-Indian patient who witnesses and understands McMurphy's heroic attempt to do battle with the awesome powers that keep them all imprisoned. \nSurely R P McMurphy deserves a crack at the \"top job\" with a resume like that? Chief Bromden can be his V P.\nSo, to quote R P, \"How about it? You creeps; you  lunatics; mental defectives; Let's hear it for Bull Goose Randall, back in action... You ding-a-lings! The Mental Defective League, in formation! Vote for me!\"",
