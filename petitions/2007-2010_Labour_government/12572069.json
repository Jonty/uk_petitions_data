This will now leave my new family with a negative income of over \u00a3200 pm once all the other essential bills such as heating are paid.\nTheir reply is your in the military so we can take 40% no matter what your situation.\nThis is after i have always paid as directed and co-operated with them fully. I am as most paying NRP's are, easy targets and will be better off giving up a career and claiming unemployment! (Their words)\nAll for serving the country!",
