            "background": "How can the government expect to defeat terrorism when it is too scared to call terrorists 'terrorists' and instead favours terms such as 'militants', 'extremists', 'insurgents' or 'radicals'?\n\nThe time has come to stop being afraid of offending certain people by using the term 'terrorists' when it is appropriate and instead show a strong firm stance to address the problem.\n\nThe need to be consistent is particularly important - stop being afraid to label Palestinian terrorists as such. \n\nThe war on terror is a noble cause. Please dont denigrate it by being politically correct - such a concession to terrorism does not help the fight.",
