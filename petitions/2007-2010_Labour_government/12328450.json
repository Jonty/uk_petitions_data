This is not safe for a lot of people so there for I think we need buses running 24 hours a day especially on weekends when lots of 18-45's go out socialising.\nI am sure that many other cities across the UK have the same problems. If we have clubs and pubs open till 2 am why can we not have public transport at the same time? That would save people walking home at such hours when they cannot afford a taxi. Think of the vulnerable people! Think of the mothers who are woken up at 2am by there 18/20year olds who need a lift! Think how there parents worry! Give 24 hour public transport in the major city's in the UK and then think of the people who are safer and happier.\n\nIf in doubt why not give it a try in Manchester and see how it goes?",
