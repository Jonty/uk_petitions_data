        "background": "In 1982, in a short-sighted cost-cutting effort, the then transport minister decided to reduce the Hereford to Malvern Line to single track, with a passing place at Ledbury:\n*The line is now over-capacity, with too few rush-hour trains, which are standing room only.\n*If one train is delayed, there are knock-on delays and cancellations to trains coming the other way. For example the 16:50 to Birmingham ALMOST never runs on-time because of this.\n*The guards physically exchange a \"token\" at Ledbury/Gt. Malvern, which in 2008 is a joke!\n*Delay and Maintenance costs exceed the savings of the single track (one signalmans salary!)\n*The poor services make Hereford an unattractive place to work and visit for people from Worcs/Brum.",
