            "background": "I strongly disagree with the fact that Over Time worked is also taxed. Tax should only apply to a person's basic pay. any Over Time clearly stated on a payslip should not be taxed. If a person chooses to do over time why should the government get a percentage of their money, when it was their choice to do those extra hours anyway. Because the more money you get paid the more tax you pay. When I work over time, once tax has been deducted it ends up the same anyway because I get taxed more; it just does make sense.",
