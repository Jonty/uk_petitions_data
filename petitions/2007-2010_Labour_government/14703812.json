            "background": "Lord Madelson has said \"Students who miss out on a university place this autumn should take up an apprenticeship or college place\". If more people are applying to attend University then all English people qualifiying to attend a University in England should be given preferance above over sea's applicants. The people of England voted in a Goverment to protect the welfare of this nation.\n\nVice-chancellor of the University of Worcester Professor Green said the government had strayed from its own policies of widening access to higher education. \n\nHe said: \"One of the most important principles in higher education, for almost 50 years, has been the Robbins principle - that 'courses of higher education should be available to all those who are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and who wish to do so'.\"",
