            "background": "With the final switchover to digital TV broadcasts taking place in 2012, this petition has been created to put a stop to the \"creeping malaise\" of having irritating channel identification icons permanently displayed towards the top LH corner of the screen. Within the last few months, Channel 5 has craftily introduced their logo during programmes but removes it during adverts! These are very annoying as they are both a distraction to viewing pleasure and obstruct the picture, something which the present analogue service is fortunately free from. Given that the changeover is being forced on us by the Government, licence payers should be entitled to enjoy a picture that is not spoilt by such intrusions. With todays generation of television receivers, it is easy to identify the channel in use via the digital menu system & thus these icons serve no useful purpose other than \"advertising\". As a bare minimum, all BBC & ITV stations should be made to remove existing icons & prevented from adding further ones or, at the very least, technology be introduced to allow viewers to be able to de-select them via the remote control, thus giving us a choice as to whether they appear or not.",
