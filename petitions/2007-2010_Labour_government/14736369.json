The Blue Badge or proof of DLA is not always accepted, nor can all disabled people get them anyway.  Not all Local Authorities hold a database of registered disabled people.\n\nWe would like the government to introduce a single centrally placed governing body where disabled people can register as disabled and receive a credit-card sized Nationally recognised means of proof of registration as a disabled person.  This ID card should then be accepted as proof of being registered disabled by companies, services and organisations who offer concessions to the disabled.\n\nRegistration should be on a voluntary opt-in basis for those who qualify and those who want it.",
