        "background": "At present, there is no one single means of registering disabled that is accepted as proof of disability.  The Blue Badge or proof of DLA is not always accepted, nor can all disabled people get them anyway.  Not all Local Authorities hold a database of registered disabled people.\n\nWe would like the government to introduce a single centrally placed governing body where disabled people can register as disabled and receive a credit-card sized Nationally recognised means of proof of registration as a disabled person.  This ID card should then be accepted as proof of being registered disabled by companies, services and organisations who offer concessions to the disabled.\n\nRegistration should be on a voluntary opt-in basis for those who qualify and those who want it.",
