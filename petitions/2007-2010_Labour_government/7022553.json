            "background": "Over recent months there have appeared a number of stories in both financial journals and programming that have made serious errors in fact. Examples include the reporting of the SIV market, as well as the coverage given to Northern Rock. There has been a serious lack of diligence in verifying the accuracy of these stories, although they have been presented as fact not opinion. Accordingly, we call on the Prime Minister to ensure that the financial legislation governing Market Abuse (Distortion and Dissemination) is appropriately applied to these journalists by the FSA.",
