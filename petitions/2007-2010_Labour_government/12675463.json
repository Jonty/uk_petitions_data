Even more immoral and disgusting than paying for a house for ducks or maintenance of 500 trees or even evading capital gains tax is the ability for MPs to use taxpayer pounds (including those taxpayer pounds taken from pensioners who have to decide whether to eat or heat) to pay for groceries for themselves and their families.  This is an item which taxpayers CANNOT continue to be charged for, under even the wildest mistake or most ludicrous error of judgement and any and all audacious excuses for getting it wrong which may be put forward by any current or future MP.",
