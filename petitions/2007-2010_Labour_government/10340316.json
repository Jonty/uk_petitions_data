For more complex work I might have to pay \u00a344.60 or \u00a3198.  \n\nThere are charges beyond dentistry - if I need a prescription, that's \u00a37.10 from my pocket.  An NHS sight test, to decide whether I need NHS glasses is \u00a319.32.\n\nThis is hardly free at the point of use.  NHS Sight tests, NHS dentistry, prescriptions written out by NHS doctors, these should all be free.",
