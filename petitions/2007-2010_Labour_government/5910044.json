            "background": "the proposed glass and ceramic extension to the classically designed, bath stone, listed building is out of keeping with the building itself, the listed pleasure garden that it would be built into, and the surrounding environs of the World Heritage Site of the City of Bath. Veiwable from the main road and the public park this structure is intrusive and completely at odds with its surroundings. They should build an extension that is more appropriate or move to larger premises. That is, after all, what the rest of us have to do when we have outgrown our space.",
