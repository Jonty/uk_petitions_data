I feel we need to have something faster paced and more of a spectacle.\nWe as a nation have had great success over the years in inshore circuit racing with little or no recognition to our drivers.\nIt is possible without much effort to hold the racing at the same course as the rowing is held, I myself have raced on the Holme Peirpoint rowing course.\nIt would make a great event and would generate the publicity that i feel this exciting sport needs",
