The European Parliament has called for the release of the many Syrian political detainees [resolution P7_TA-PROV(2009)0024 passed on 17 September 2009].\n\nIt cannot be right that an EU Agreement, which can be suspended for human rights violations, should be signed when the UN and the European Parliament have both made clear statements on gross human rights violations currently ongoing in Syria.\n\nHM Government should demand the immediate release of all Syrian political prisoners.",
