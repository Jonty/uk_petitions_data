            "background": "EU auditors have now refused to sign off the EU accounts for the 15th time. This suggests serious irregularities in acounting procedures and corruption in the EU. \nThe British Government cannot justify use of taxpayers money to fund the EU until such time as the accounts are approved and signed off; in doing so they may well lay Westminster Parliament open to charges of corruption or aiding and abetting a corrupt organisation.",
