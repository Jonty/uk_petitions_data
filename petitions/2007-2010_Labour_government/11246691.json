            "background": "Simply having the legal limit at a certain age is not good enough. Just because somebody is eighteen years old, it does not mean that they are mature enough to drink responsibly. The correlation of age and maturity is apparent, but anomalies still exist. These anomalies are usually what cause the problem. The amount of crime linked to alcohol is horrific and must be reduced. I propose that we introduce a 'controlled substance' license system. This would incur a series of tests taken by anybody over the age of eighteen who wishes to buy or consume controlled substances. Upon passing their test, the candidate will be issued with a digital swipe card, a unique ID number and have their photograph taken. Upon buying controlled substances, the card must be swiped and the details downloaded from a server for verification. All licensed premises will be issued with swipe machines. I know this idea is still in its embryonic stages, but in the right hands it could become so much greater.",
