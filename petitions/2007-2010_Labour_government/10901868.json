Whilst serving in the Falkland Islands my wife met someone else and when I got back to UK we were divorced.  My new wife is not entitled to any of the widows pension for which I have paid. Neither am I entitled to have any of my payments returned to me. I request that the widows pension be instated in such circumstances.",
