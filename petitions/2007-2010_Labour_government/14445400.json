            "background": "Lord Mandelson has recently proclaimed that all scientific research funding shall have guaranteed economic gains for government and industry.  This fails to recognise the importance of fundamental or curiosity based research, which develops into these well tested and understood technologies.  By limiting ourselves to a quick-return based funding culture, we will run out of marketable research, leaving us behind other leading nations.  Unelected and uneducated politicians should perhaps think about whether they are the best people to dictate funding directions.  Incremental gains do not have the same return compared to marked innovations.",
