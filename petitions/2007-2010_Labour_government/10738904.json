            "background": "Too many children sit at home on consoles and watch tv. Too many of them are being stabbed on our streets because they get involved in crime and drugs. Why? Because there are few alternatives. Youth centres are a thing of the past and sports access costs money that most working parents cannot afford. With the olympics coming to our nation in 2012 we are crying out for new athletes that can fly the flag for our proud nation.  Wouldn\u2019t  it be better to be able to pick the best from every background? Too  many talented children slip through the net because their parents cannot afford to send their children to local sports facilities.  That\u2019s why we are asking the government to help to give our children a fairer chance. To become the best at what they\u2019re good at and provide alternatives to hanging around street corners drinking and getting involved with drugs.",
