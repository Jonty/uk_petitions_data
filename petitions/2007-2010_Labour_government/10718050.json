            "background": "In 1696 6 people in Paisley were persuaded to confess to witchcraft, at the trials which followed they were found guilty and sentenced to death. One of the accused killed himself in prison, and the other five were strangled and then burnt on the Gallowgreen in Paisley. These trials were the last major witch trials in Scotland. The site of the Gallowgreen is marked with the shape of a horseshoe in the centre of the road at the junction of Maxwellton Street and George Street in present day Paisley.\n\nWe wish this travesty of justice to be overturned and the law of the land that be, Pardon these so called witches who were unfairly trialed and executed at Gallowgreen Paisley in 1696.\n\nThis petition was inspired by the Hallow Fest, Festival a commemoration of the last ever witch trial in Scotland. This Festival will be staged every year in Paisley, Scotland and will be promoted by the Hallow Fest Festival Supported By Paisley on the web, community website",
