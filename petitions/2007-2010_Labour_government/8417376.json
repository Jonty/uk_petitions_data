        "action": "Cause retailers to accept Personal Cheques, as Legal Tender, when supported by an approprite Guarantee Card.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Supermarkets, in particular, are gradually phasing out their acceptance of Personal Cheques in payment for goods.  The most recent example is Tesco Stores.  \n1. A Personal Cheque is LEGAL TENDER and is in effect 'variable cash'.\n2. The move from Personal Cheques to credit and debit cards is an unethical invitation for individuals to lose control of their spending and to move into positions of debt.  The cheque book provides a set of stubs that act as a 'ready reckoner' of one's account status.\n3. Elderley people fail to remember their Pin Numbers and become socially flustered.\n4. Elderley people are therefore likely to carry cash instead of using their card and are thus prone to easy robbery - perhaps with violence.\n5. We urge Government to consider ensuring that supermarkets rethink their attitudes and allow transactions to be completed legally through the writing of a Personal Cheque - which IS LEGAL TENDER.",
