            "background": "New parents (particularly mothers) often have to go back to work after the birth of their children.  However many parents would like to work part-time so that they can spend time with their children and avoid costly childcare charges.  At the moment we have the right to request part-time hours, but not the right to go back to the same position on part-time hours.  For many of us this means that we have to demote ourselves voluntarily to a part-time position, on a much lower salary (often minimum wage.)Tax credit bands also need to be narrower and more frequent in case one parent decides not to return to work (there should be no pressure to return to work)- there is a massive difference between \u00a325,000 and \u00a350,000!",
