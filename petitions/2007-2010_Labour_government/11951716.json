            "background": "Archant Norfolk - publisher of the Eastern Daily Press, Norwich Evening News, and several weekly titles \u2013 is proposing to cut 54 editorial staff from a total of 179 workers. \n\nLocal National Union of Journalists(NUJ) members believe that this is a threat not only to the individuals concerned, but also to the quality of local journalism and will have a direct, negative impact on the communities these titles serve. The Archant media group recorded a \u00a322m profit last year.\n\nNUJ members fear that the hard-won trust and competence of the newspapers is at stake in the plans, which could see photographers, feature staff, sports writers, sub-editors, chief reporters and editors slashed.\n\nPlease sign this petition to urge Archant Norfolk bosses to think again and to put people before profit margins.",
