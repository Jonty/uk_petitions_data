            "background": "we want to stop the merging of year groups in uk primary schools, we believe it is unfair our children are being forced to learn in mixed year groups with children who are a whole school year older and therefore a at a higher educational level to them. This puts pressure on the younger pupils in the class to keep up with the older pupils, they have enough pressures already without adding to them. Why put them into year groups if you are then going to merge the groups into one big group? We want this stoppping and more money to be spent on education by the government to stop this from happening altogether.",
