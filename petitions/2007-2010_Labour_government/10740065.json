Students are increasingly getting into more debt and with the economy nearing recession the cost of living has grown so much that students will be in debt for longer. Surely every person in this country has the right to if not a free education a reasonably priced one? The only way to get a good job in this country is to do a degree so surely reinvesting in the nations future is worth it?",
