        "background": "Surely there's more that Gordon Brown can do about the rising food prices and fuel prices. All that he seems to be doing is blaming us, the consumers of wasting food, i speak for myself but i dont have the money to waste food. I know that in some circumstances people do waste food, but this is likely to be because these people have the money to waste food. I was completly shocked by the recent statment that retailers should stop '2 for 1' offers these help many families including my own to save money and i assure you it is all used. Gorden Brown doesnt seem to be tackling the real problem in hand, he seems to be finding alternative reasons which aren't the point that is so clearly shown. He should be focusing on issues such as excess packaging as this would make the prices of food lower straight away and if special equitment is needed because of the lack of pacaging it will pay of eventually.. surely this is what we all want. I'd just like to remind you of all the banquets the Government have. Can you imagine the food they waste? This is an issue that EVERYONE is having to face.",
