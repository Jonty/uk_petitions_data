            "background": "In the 21st century this hat and the uniform belongs exclusively to a fancy dress party. Soldiers strutting around in a bearskin hat is just escapism for tourists and armchair generals who grew up playing with napoleonic war toy soldiers and reminisce about the 'good old days' of empire. I suggest soldiers would prioritise equipment to keep them alive such as body armour rather than the skinning of bears for vanity.",
