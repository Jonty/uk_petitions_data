        "background": "This petition is for the government to change the lack of funding for training purposes for 2012 British Volleyball players both Indoor Volleyball and Beach. \n\nWith over \u00a327,000,000 given to rowing, \u00a326,000,000 to cycling and \u00a325,000,000 to swimming. Yes, they were all very successful sports at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but why cant you give other sports the chance to shine. \n\n\"Volleyball is the world's 2nd most popular sport. There are more registered volleyball players in Italy than footballers. And yet time and time again, the people who run our funding agency feel there is no need to give us a fighting chance of joining the world of volleyball proper with quality teams from the seniors right down the age levels\"- Andrew Pink GB Senior Men's Team Vice-Captain\n\nPlease give funding to British Volleyball\n\nThank You\n\nAlex Clare, on behalf of all volleyball players",
