        "background": "The toughest sentences that can be handed out currently, to dog fight organisors is six months in prison,while some who are caught and convicted are merely handed a fine.Those who are caught spectating at such events are at most handed fines.I recommend a doubling of current sentences with regard to the act of organising and arranging dog fights, and/or training dogs for the purposes of fighting for sport .Simaltaneously mandatory custodial sentences for those convicted of attending these events,will serve to deter potential audiences of dog fights.Such systematically trained dogs also become more dangerous to members of the public,and their pets.",
