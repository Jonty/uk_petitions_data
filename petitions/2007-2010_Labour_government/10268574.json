        "background": "The wildlife has a home. The plants and trees have a home. And it is the Green Belt Land. If people start building houses, warehouses and other buildings on these areas then all the wildlife we have will go. There will no longer be a tree in sight and we will soon be living in a concrete jungle. Soon we will have no where to walk our dogs, no parks for the kids to play in etc. But tall buildings, more roads which cause traffic and chaoes. We need our countryside. We don't need more buildings.",
