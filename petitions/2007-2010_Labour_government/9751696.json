            "background": "We constantly hear the government saying that they want motorists to leave their cars at home and use the train.\n\nThe problem is that the DFT is not interested in reopening mothballed lines that would have a positive impact on the way Britain moves around.\n\nReopening these lines would take more cars off the road and will enable the people who drive for a living to get about without much delay, it would also allow people to move between places where there may be no direct route by road.\n\nThere are many places around Britain that need their railways restored such as Oxford - Bedford, Luton - Dunstable, Northampton - Brackmills and March - Wisbech.\n\nThey are just some of the many mothballed lines that could start providing revenue making services within a year.\n\nIf the Prime Minister is serious about our railways then i urge you to reopen our mothballed railways.",
