This would enable them to provide answers under the Freedom of Information Act, about what action has been taken, if any, on submitted petitions that have expired. To date, such answers have been 'this information is not collated.'\nSuch auditing action would give some credibility to the petitions site, and go some way to disarming the widely held perception that it is just another instrument of Government spin and subterfuge to make the Electorate think that they have a voice, when in reality they have none.",
