        "background": "The imprisonment of Gillian Gibbons for naming a teddy bear Mohammed has appalled all decent people. It is time we stopped pretending that diplomacy will bring her release and took strong action against Sudan. The immediate suspension of aid and the imposition of economic sanctions are the minimum response appropriate. Pandering to Islamic fundamentalist with words like \"innocent mistake\" will do nothing to bring forward Gillians release, the Suadanese government will only act under the threat of strong action.",
