            "background": "The rationale for this petition was that some people oppose abortion; and even contraception!  Having looked through the petitions on abortion it's obvious that quite a lot of people who use this site are opposed to abortion (though I would say that if someone isn't born that's hardly a tragedy: they don't exist to know that they weren't; and I would add that being born to endure an abusive childhood - which of course one WOULD know about - would be much worse).  But opposing contraception?  What do they expect people to do if they don't want a pregnancy: abstain?  There could be all sorts of reasons why this might be difficult or impossible: ranging from rape down to not being assertive enough (due to low self-esteem caused by an emotionally-abusive childhood) to refuse.  These people who like to impose their views on other people's lives should be forced to take the consequences THEMSELVES rather than ruin the lives of others!",
