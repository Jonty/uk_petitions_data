            "background": "It is unfair that young people mainly between the ages of 14 and 17 are treated like children in some situations and like adults as soon as money can be squeezed out of them. The majority of people of this age are in full time education and then even if they do have time for a part time job are paid less than over 18's. Therefore it is unfair that they should have to pay adult fares if they are being paid only a child's wage. \nYoung people are exploited financially then denied the rights of adults such as the right to vote.\nEssentially what this petition asks for it a standardisation in the age that young people become adult. If, as presumed, this age remains 18 then people under 18 that are on child's wage and have no right to vote, should be given the financial benefits of being a child.",
