In previous years, Tom Jones, James Brown and Tony Bennett have been just some of the legends to have graced the Pyramid stage in the Sunday afternoon 'Veteran' slot. 2009 can be just as legendary. I urge the governement to support the Eavis family to do whatever they can, whether it be extra funding or in a 'bridge building' capacity (after recent confusion between Mr Eavis and Mr Knopfler). Money for Nothing, Sultans of Swing, Romeo and Juliet, Walk of Life... all deserve the Pyramid platform before it's too late. Please sign up to make this happen. Seriously.\n\nOr Status Quo.",
