Make it illegal for any person under the age of 18 to consume alcahol. If this is done then the Police could arrest these people and have them dealt with through the courts, instead of just pouring the alcahol away and moving them on.\n\nAnybody under the age of 18 suspected of being drunk and disorderly should be able to to breathalised, and if found to have consumed alcahol be dealt with through the courts.",
