            "background": "Make a new law forcing employers to recruit applicants provided they meet requirements. The employee would be given a trial period to prove to be a worthy employee.\n\nThis may reduce unemployment and save taxpayers a mint. \u2018Spongers\u2018, who are currently forced to apply for jobs in order to receive benefits, will end up with a job. Moreover, it will benefit people on the dole who genuinely want to find a job.\n\nSince a lot of people will want the same vacancies, which will be taken quickly, the process of applying would be changed:\n\nThe applicant gives their details to the Job Centre (personal details, qualifications, experience, licences etc). The applicant can apply for any job they meet the requirements of. It should be the duty of the Job Centre to manage waiting lists for specific vacancies/sectors. The employees details are given to the employer when recruited.\n\nWhilst listed waiting for chosen jobs, the applicant must use an computer job search which will display every vacancy he/she meets the requirements of and has no waiting list. The applicant must choose or be allocated one of these.\n\nIdeally, every vacancy in the country must be recruited by Job Centre by law.",
