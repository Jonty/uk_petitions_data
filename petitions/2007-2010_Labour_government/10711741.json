        "background": "When someone dies from mesothelioma, an asbestos related cancer, it is classified as \u2018an unnatural death\u2019 and a coroner must carry out an inquiry. \n\nAs was highlighted in the British Lung Foundation report \u2018An Unnatural Death\u2019, when a death from mesothelioma occurs outside of a coroner\u2019s working hours the bereaved can be visited by uniformed police in a marked police car, sometimes in the middle of the night. Many relatives say that this leads them to feel under suspicion during a distressing time. \n\nWe welcome the inclusion of the Coroners and Death Certification Bill in the Draft Legislative Programme for 2008-09 and the publication of the updated Charter for the Bereaved, which states that a Chief Coroner should be appointed and set minimum service standards for mesothelioma inquiries.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister to ensure that the Bill is passed in the next parliamentary session and that coroner\u2019s inquiries are consistently sensitive to the needs of families bereaved by mesothelioma.",
