            "background": "If the prime minister speaks to british airways about the sale of concorde, BA are more likely going to listen and cooperate with the prime minister than anybody else.\n\nConcorde was designed and paid for by british tax payers and now british airways are planning on selling the supersonic aircraft, so that it can sit next to the QE2 in dubai.\n\nWe used to be a country of great things producing marvels of engineering that shocked the world. We produced Concorde with the French, but it still represents British brilliance.\n\nSo please sign this petition and help put our last engineering masterpiece back where it belongs,and that is where it used to stand at London Heathrow Airport.\n\nAfter All, British taxpayers and not British Airways, paid for its development. Help make Britain great again by keeping Concorde in Great Britain.",
