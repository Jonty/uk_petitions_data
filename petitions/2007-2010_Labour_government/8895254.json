            "background": "From a student's point of view, we, the undersigned, believe that university fees are astronomical, and whereas they provide university students with the money they need to complete their chosen courses, they do leave students struggling with debt for many years after they have left university. We believe that reducing the costs of university would encourage more young people to go on to higher education, and in turn give young people the chance to go further in life. We request that you sign this petition on behalf of students everywhere.",
