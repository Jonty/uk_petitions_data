        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Even though the manufacturers of the Artificial Sweetener named Aspartame or AminoSweet claim there is no evidence to prove it is unsafe, there is still doubt. We would like the UK Government to be a world leader by taking immediate action and imposing an Outright Ban on the use of the substance in all food and beverage products sold within the UK. We understand that such a step would impact big business but we would like the Government to consider that Public health, the health of our children and the possible burden on the NHS. Public Health and Safety is far more of a priority than forcing manufacturers to find an alternative. If an outright ban is not possible, we would like to see any product containing Aspartame to have a health warning such as seen on Cigarette packets. This would then enable manufacturers to decide for themselves if using this substance is good for their business.",
