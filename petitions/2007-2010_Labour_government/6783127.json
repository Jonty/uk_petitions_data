            "background": "When donating blood, you are forbidden if you are a man who has participated in anal or oral sex with another man (with or without a condom) or if you are a woman who has had sex with a man who had performed the above.\n\nThis is based on archaic belief that homosexuality is synonymous with a carrier of HIV or another Sexually Transmitted Infection.  The fact remains that a heterosexual performing unprotected promiscuity could donate blood unquestioned, while a faithful homosexual male who uses protection could not.\n\nIt would seem wise therefore to base the suitability of a donor on screening for infection; as opposed to innate sexual preferences.  This unjustifiable rule is preventing many from performing an altruistic action that may save lives in a time when blood donations are so desperately needed.",
