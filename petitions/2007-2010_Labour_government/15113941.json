        "background": "This is not a joke and the fact that this petition was initially rejected as a joke shows clearly how insensitive employers have become. The term \"human resources\" is offensive and degrading because it implies that an employee is no more than a piece of office equipment, like a desk or a computer. In a free country, the government cannot ban the use of the term but it could set an example by not using it in government offices.",
