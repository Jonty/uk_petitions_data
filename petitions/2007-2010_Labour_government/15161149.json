            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The rising birth rate and pressure on NHS budgets has led to a major crisis in the provision of maternity services nationally. Maternity units are struggling to provide adequate care without sufficient midwives to meet the demand for home and hospital births. Units are often forced to close due to staffing shortages and lack of resources. Many midwives are leaving the profession with some opting to practice independently. High standards are delivered by independent midwives, with a single midwife providing pre-natal and post-natal care, as well as assisting with the birth. We call for urgent additional funding for maternity services nationally as well a guarantee of future investment for establishing midwife-led units across the country.  We request that an independent inquiry reviews and makes recommendations on: 1, Improving working conditions for midwives; 2, More community midwives to provide home births and ante-natal and post-natal care; 3, NHS collaboration with independent midwives nationally",
