            "background": "The percentage of UK wealth held by the wealthiest 10% was in the 40s ten years ago but is in the 50s now. Inheritance tax is clearly failing in its purpose of redistributing wealth. It should be more focussed on the top 10% and the rate of transfer from them should be increased. I would suggest a threshold in the first year of \u00a31 million unless the tax rate would then exceed 80%, which I consider a reasonable maximum.",
