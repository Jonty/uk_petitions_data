        "action": "Require all powered watercraft operators resident in the uk to undergo a proficiency test by law, and be subject to drink drive style regulations.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Small powered vessels such as Jetski's and power boats can be operated by anyone, with little or no training at present. The operators of these vessels are generally unaware of speed limits, and common marine signals such as SMB's, and buoyed swimming areas, at times treating said items as slalom markers, some routinely operate unseaworthy vessels while intoxicated, and with inadequate lighting. Placing lives of themselves, and the general public at risk with their recklessness. Therefore we the undersigned feel that a compulsory proficiency test should be introduced, with a marine \"Highway code\" test, a requirement for liability insurance, and a Motorised Vessel License which can be revoked if misused.",
