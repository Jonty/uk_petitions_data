            "background": "Dear Gordon\n\nI have a suggestion regarding the unpopular abolition of the 10% starting rate.\n\nYou already have made a welcome concession for pensioners \u2013 i.e. the Personal Allowance for people aged 65-74.\n\nThis has a limit of \u00a321,800 for the current tax year, and helps anyone in my age group whose income is modest. \n\nWhy not apply this allowance to everyone?\n\nObviously it will not affect higher earners, but will allow relief to a group of people, such as many NHS and Local government workers who in many cases perform valuable public service for low rewards.\n\nThis would enable you to resolve this issue simply, and to silence the vocal hypocrites of the Opposition.\n\nPlease let me know what you think.\n\nBest regards\n\nBernard Durkan",
