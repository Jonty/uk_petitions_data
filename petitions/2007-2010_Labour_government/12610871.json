            "background": "Thousands of motorists sit needlessly clogging up the M25 either side of the Dartford crossing every day in man-made queues caused by the collection of toll charges.  These queues are regularly over ten miles long and add at least an extra hour to journey times.  This needless cause of extremely high pollution would be abolished at a stroke if the charges were abolished.  Also, the health of the people caught up in this endless madness would potentially be improved due to the huge reduction in stress that would follow.  Finally, part of the agreement for the building of the Queen Elizabeth Bridge was that once it had been fully paid for through the collection of tolls, which it now has, the tolls would be abolished.  Instead of this however, they have recently been increased by a massive FIFTY percent.  Time for some honesty from you Mr Brown.  Meet the original commitments and abolish the daily misery for the folk of Kent and Essex and end the daylight robbery created by these tolls.",
