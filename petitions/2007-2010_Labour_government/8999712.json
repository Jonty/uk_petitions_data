        "background": "Easter Sunday is arcanely defined as the first Sunday following the first full moon following the vernal equinox.  This is not only absurd and even pagan, but has the consequence that it can randomly fall on any one of 35 different dates.  As a result, Easter wanders through the calendar like a drunk at closing time.\n\nFixing the date of the holiday as the second weekend in April, and renaming it if necessary to avoid minority group objections, would enable school term lengths to be regularised and everyone to know where they stand.  It would also ensure the break falls later than average, when the weather is likely to be warmer, and more evenly spaced from the next bank holiday in May.",
