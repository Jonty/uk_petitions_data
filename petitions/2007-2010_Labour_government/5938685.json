        "background": "I feel that members of the Armed Forces should not be paying tax whilst on Operations of any sort abroad. None of the other countries make their men and women pay tax whilst away so why do we? We are spending more and more time away from home and something needs to be done. Is it not the case that when criminals are locked up they do not pay tax so why should we when we are away from our families serving and protecting our country. It is disgraceful how we the Members of the Armed Forces are being treated. Even when our men and women are killed in action it only deems a mere minute on the news. Have we forgotten the sacrifice made?",
