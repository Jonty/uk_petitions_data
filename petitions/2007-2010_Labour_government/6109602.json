            "background": "The current rules on this issue are unfair as, in most cases, places of work are closed on Bank Holidays, therefore the employees can't work and, as a result, don't get paid. Also, you can't help sickness and yet, agency workers are continually penalised for genuine sickness.\nSome agencies will pay for these circumstances out of accrued holiday entitlement. This practice should be outlawed and we ask the Prime Minister to take action.",
