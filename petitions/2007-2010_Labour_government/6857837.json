            "background": "The DCMS has allowed William Hill and Ladbroke to offer bingo, roulette and blackjack in bookmaking shops (which do not have regulated entry to prevent under-18s) but will not allow bingo clubs and casinos (which do have regulated entry) to offer sports betting.\n\nThe government has been unduly harsh on bingo halls and casinos.  Legislation that has meant that activity's that have subsidised bingo halls and casinos are no longer permitted and alternative activity's that are good for the goose are unduly not permitted for the gander.\n\nThe legislative affect means that bingo hall business model is not economically viable and all operations will eventually have to be wound down. Causing loss of jobs, loss of preservation of many great historic/grade listed buildings, loss of entertainment and internal UK money flows.\n\nThis seems somewhat illogical, protectionism for one part of the sector and unfair regulation on another.  The government needs to allow the bingo halls to do some sort of activity that will allow them to survive.",
