            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In practical terms, if you receive a state pension of \u00a3520 per month, and you have private pension of a lesser amount, you will only receive a maximum of \u00a3520 per month, the private pension being deducted from the state pension.  Your private pension is no longer added to your state pension.\n\nIn 1997 the Prime Minister as Chancellor raided the pension funds of ordinary working people in a short sighted money grabbing spree and against advice. Subsequently the level of pension funds has fallen from bad to worse and the current economic downturn has severely compounded the problem. The money was never the government's to take; it had been set aside to pay for retirement in a country thats' State Pension scheme does not provide a living income. The raid was akin to legalised theft. Those facing retirement in the short term can expect a grim future and it is time for the Prime Minister to rectify his previous misdemeanors and return this money to its rightful owners, either by direct injection of cash into the pension funds or by substantially increasing tax relief on pensioners income.",
