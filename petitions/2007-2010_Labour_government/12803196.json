        "background": "Potential owners of cats should be obliged to purchase a licence before they are able to become the owner of such an animal. This licence should be of significant value as to render the owning of that animal a major expense. This, I believe, would go some way in deterring the frivolous and irresponsible ownership of cats which results in the deterrence and destruction of wildlife in our gardens and would be of some help in the health and safety matter of feline excrement deposits.",
