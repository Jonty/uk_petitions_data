        "action": "increase taxes on the future profits of the banking industry to eliminate the rise in the National Debt caused by the financial crisis",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "What the banking industry has done to our economy is tantamount to a terrorist act. On the one hand, they had asked for less regulation and were granted it, and then on the other, they failed to police themselves effectively thereafter. I don't see why the tax payer has to pick up the major portion of the bill for their errors and I'd like a new tax to be raised on all future profits from the banking sector specifically raised to ensure that they pay for the disaster they caused; and not the UK tax payers. After all we've underwritten their operations to get them out of insolvency and like any investor we want to clear a profit. We'll never clear any profit until the banking sector have repaid the loans we gave them with interest and also, as I'm proposing, pay back the full cost that the financial crisis had upon our UK National Debt.",
