I saw a man being tied up in the back of a truck, obviously distressed, tired and confused. I was sickened that the farmers were so keen to continue this behaviour. These are crimes against humanity caught on camera. Please intervene and get the South African government to arrest these farmers and send a clear message that cruelty will not be tolerated. Zimbabweans have been through a lot, they need protection not abuse.",
