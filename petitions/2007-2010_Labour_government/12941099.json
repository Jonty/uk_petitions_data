As much as we the people understand the importance of our soldiers being in Afghanistan, we do not find it acceptable for mp's to sit behind their 'safe' desks and decalir that such loss of life is acceptable and inevitable when they do not provide the correct and/or the much needed equipment. Please help us to make a stand in 'hope' of getting the government to support those they send out to war zones and see the soldiers as people and not just statistics! Please help support or troops!",
