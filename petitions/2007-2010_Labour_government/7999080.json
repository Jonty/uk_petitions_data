Many people look at what or who is on offer and decide that another evening watching celebrity cooking, singing, dancing, skating or maggot eating is far more appealing than endorsing any one of half a dozen likely lads, or lasses who we know will either end up representing their own or their parties views, which are rarely those held by the people that helped put them there in the first place.\n\nWhen presented with NO CHOICE, we should be allowed to register the fact that we DO CARE about who represents us, but NONE OF THE ABOVE appears to be woth voting for.\n\nSo instead of being counted as an apathetic voter, the option to vote for NONE OF THE ABOVE should be included on all ballot forms at general Elections.",
