Likewise, our rights under the Declaration of Human Rights 1948AD are also in threat through oppressive legislation by this and previous Governments, which has to end.  We remind the Government that any laws contrary to the Magna Carta 1215AD are null and void.  The Magna Carta is enshrined in English law forever!",
