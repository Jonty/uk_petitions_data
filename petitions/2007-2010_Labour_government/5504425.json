I went to my sons passing out parade and I could not believe the rubbish they had to eat.\nWhen I was an NCO and we had passing out parades or family open days the Army Catering Corp really put on a great show of catering to display their skill in the kitchen. Food when I was a soldier was not 5 star but it was good and a good selection to choose from. These private catering companies are out to make a profit and standards drop when motivated by money.",
