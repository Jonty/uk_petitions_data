            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "the reason for my petition is because on the 11th july 2009 i gave birth to a baby girl faith and because i was 23 weeks pregnant and 6 days i was told that i had a miscarriage and not a still birth. My daughter never got to breathe outside my womb but she had breathed inside for 23 weeks and 6 days, she weighed 1 pound 3 ounces and 3 quarters and was 30cm long. She was perfect in every way and i didnt  know that this law existed until she was born. I would like to say how very disgusted i am and shocked that you could even put my daughter into this category. I know babies who have been born before 24 weeks and survived so its a disgrace that this law even exists. I will do everything in my power to get justice for my beautifull baby faith",
