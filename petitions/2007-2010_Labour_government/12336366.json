            "background": "Walsall Council plan to part-privatise the historic Walsall Market, which dates back around 800 years. \n\nThis is a short term, short sighted, penny pinching exercise and holds no benefit for the people of Walsall. \nFurthermore, it will complicate any improvements to the market and could constrict development of the town centre, should that partner refuse to accomodate any revised town plan.\nIt could cost the people (via Council action) more money to compensate any part-private owner.\ne.g.loss of earnings due to temporary relocation or poor access due to roadworks.\n\nWhy not have a 3 year lease to an established market operator - similar to what rail operating companies have to do. i.e. Meet the service level agreement (e.g. number and diversity of stalls)\n\nPlease sign the petition NOT to privatise or part-privatise Walsall Market",
