        "action": "Force the Midlands to spend more on encouraging a range of different employment industries to the area.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Midlands has seen a decrease in useful productive industries. \n\nHowever the growing service industries are reliant on prosperity from the other industries so that people have the spare income to use the service industries. This means in the event of economic downturn these jobs become unsafe.\n\nThe Midlands as a whole is home to a number good Universities and colleges. For example in science subjects the Midlands will be producing many 1000s of scientists from HNC through to PhD level per year. However, most jobs for scientists are found outside the Midlands. Why are Midlander taxes supporting the teaching of such subjects using the LEA funds if there is little benefit to the region job wise? \n\nWe are in effect subsidising the South East and other pockets of the UK so they may have good scientists and therefore good economic growth. These regions are benefiting from growth of the kind that might new create money through exports of innovation and high quality goods rather than uncertain recycled money in our service industries.\n\nNote that the Midlands has many sites for redevelopment so there is little need to rip up green sites to achieve this.",
