            "background": "We the undersigned call upon the Prime Minister to introduce a minister for men to fully demonstrate the Government's commitment to equality. Despite assurances that the Government is committed to combatting discrimination it has become increasingly clear it is only concerned with discrimination against women. See response to previous petition here for the dismissive and inadequate response provided . vehttp://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page13989.asp\n\nThis reiterates the same  tired arguments regarding equal pay and domestic violence while dismissing discrimination against men as the Government clearly thinks this isn't important enough. If the EOC or its replacement exists to promote equality  for all as they claim then there can be no more need for a separate minister for women than for men - to claim otherwise is an admission that the EOC is not fit for purpose as can clearly be seen by it's own pro-female bias.",
