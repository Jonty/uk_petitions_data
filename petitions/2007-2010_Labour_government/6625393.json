        "background": "Having recently been abroad to a country where the Government sets a fair uniform price for petrol throughout the country, I believe this would be a good step forward for everyone.  Whether you purchased your petrol in Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, London, Southampton(for example), the price would be the same.  This would also assist the independent garages who struggle to compete with the larger chains - particularly supermarkets.  The price could be set by a panel including interested parties from: Government, Road Hauliers, General Public, AA and RAC, etc.  The present system seems crazy as one can literally drive along a road with a garage on either side of that road charging two different prices. Then there's the difference in prices from one region to another.",
