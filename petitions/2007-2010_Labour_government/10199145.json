        "background": "Brown wants us to cut the amount of petrol we use...... \n\nThe best way to stop using so much petrol is to deport 3 million illegal immigrants! \n\nThat would be 3 million less people using our petrol. The price of petrol would come down..... \n\nBring our troops home from Iraq to guard the Channel.... \n\nWhen they catch an illegal immigrant crossing the Channel, hand him a canteen, rifle and some ammo and ship him to Iraq .... \n\nTell him if he wants to come to Britain then he must serve a tour in the military.... \n\nGive him a soldier's pay while he's there and tax him on it..... \n\nAfter his tour, he will be allowed to become a citizen since he defended this country..... \n\nHe will also be registered to be taxed and be a legal resident..... . \n\nThis option will probably deter illegal immigration and provide a solution for the troops in Iraq and decrease petrol prices at the same time.",
