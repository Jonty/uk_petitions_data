        "background": "My 7 year old daughter was raped by our 14 yr old neighbour - although the police, social services and all professionals involved acknowledged it had taken place the lack of forensics meant that it didn't qualify for court proceedings. As a result, we have been left to wait until another of his victims finds courage to come forward. The D.C in charge of the case used the words 'when he does it again'. He abused his own 7 yr old sister at the same time as my daughter and is not only a danger now but a serious risk of worse as he gets older.",
