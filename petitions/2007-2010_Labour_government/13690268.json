            "background": "The proposed sale of the M25 Dartford Bridge and Tunnel is not moral or sensible or economical or in the best interests of the tax payer. We are asking the PM to make a bold decision and restore the public's faith in politics by keeping to the promises made when the bridge was built 20 years ago. It has paid for itself 10 times over.The bridge and tunnel's daily jams are amongst the worse in Europe, thousands of local residents are suffering and dying as a result of millions of tonnes of carbon emissions  from vehicles using the crossing daily.Please keep the bridge public and end the pollution by ending the tolls. Selling the bridge off will raise peanuts in the current climate, given the 600 billion given to failed banks,selling the crossing will mean more congestion, cost and carbon foot print-pollution is choking people slowly to death. We just want fairness and justice for the taxpayer. Folk are struggling to make ends meet.Help the masses:Please stop this sale & madness.",
