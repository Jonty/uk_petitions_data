            "background": "Paul Clarke, a former soldier living in Merstham, found a sawn-off shotgun dumped in his back garden with some live ammunition.\n\nHe took it to the Police station and handed it in.  He was arrested for possession of a firearm.  He was found guilty of this charge on 10th November 2009, and is to be sentenced on December  11th.\n\nThe minimum term available to the judge is five years imprisonment.\n\nIt is scandalous than a man doing his civic duty should pay for that with a five year term in prison.  Gun crime is very serious, and the penalties should be harsh.  Mr Clarke was trying to reduce gun crime.  This does not deserve any sort of penalty.  He should be pardoned as soon as possible.\n\nThe story is reported here:\n\nhttp://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/news/Ex-soldier-faces-jail-handing-gun/article-1509082-detail/article.html",
