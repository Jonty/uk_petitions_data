There should be a real threat to the comfort of these people. They commit these offences upon these vulnerable people because they have no fear of punishment for their crimes and anti-social behaviour. A more severe impact on those who are proven to have committed an offenseis required. Therefore a hefty \"on the spot\" fine might be in order, or a prison sentence.",
