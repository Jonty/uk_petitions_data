            "background": "Now that all London Underground station carparks are run by private companies can the Government not impose the capping of fees to stop the unfair high pricing of the system. These prices are not uniform and differ from station to station. Underground fares increase yearly and it is unfair for commuters and passengers alike to be unfairly charged again to park there car to use public transport which the Government champion as a preferred mode of transport.",
