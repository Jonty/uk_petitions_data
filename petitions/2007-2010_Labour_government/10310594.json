            "background": "The PM is already making thousands of families struggle to make ends meet, with the exhorbitant rises in petrol, food, electricity, gas, domestic oil of which all are essential to life in the 21st century. He now decides to burden families further by increasing Road Fund License for more than 9 million road users and make their vehicles worthless  , to boot. The PM doesn't seem to realise that we are not all MPs who can claim extra expenses which are paid for by the already overburdened British Voter/Taxpayer.",
