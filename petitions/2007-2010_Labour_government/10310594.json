        "background": "The PM is already making thousands of families struggle to make ends meet, with the exhorbitant rises in petrol, food, electricity, gas, domestic oil of which all are essential to life in the 21st century. He now decides to burden families further by increasing Road Fund License for more than 9 million road users and make their vehicles worthless  , to boot.
