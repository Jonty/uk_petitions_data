            "background": "The present system typically allows criminal to have unlimited public money via the legal aid scheme to put up representation in our courts. It is totally impracticable to allow this to continue. It is obvious to anyone that, given the current legal aid system, solicitors are encouraged to request innumerable adjournments for these repeat offenders merely to increase the amount of legal aid they collect.\nAltering the system to 3 strikes & you're out would vastly improve the system.",
