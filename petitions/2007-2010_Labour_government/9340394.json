            "background": "With the current cost of living going up massively over the last 12 months its about time people got some relief. Although the government claim inflation is around 2.5%, but petrol prices have gone up by far more than this, so has electricity prices, gas and other household prices, leaving people with less money to spend on luxuries.\n\nThe Tv license is a major strain for a lot of households and students, and people are fed up of having to pay for the right to watch/receive a television signal.\n\nWhat is needed is to force these channels to go private and raise their own revenue, to run efficiently, as currently corporations such as the BBC know what they can spend, not what should be spent to run efficiently",
