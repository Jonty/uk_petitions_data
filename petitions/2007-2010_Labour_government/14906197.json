            "background": "The Government must ensure that athletics benefits from the Olympics through a new National Stadium and home as promised to the IOC.\n\nAthletics should not be bypassed again, as with Picketts Lock in 2005. West Ham United do not need the Olympic Stadium, athletics does desperately.\n\nThe GB Athletics Team, with little funding, has far exceeded the performance of the \"national game\".\n\nWest Ham have made it clear they will not compromise and would relocate athletics to an unsuitable 5,000 seat arena. Athletics is prepared to share-football is not.\n\nWith reference to sutainability, football is in no position when its system is not sustainable at all, as seen in the collapse of Portsmouth.\n\nUse of the stadium should include use as an athletics high-performance training centre, use by universties, national stadium for athletics hosting national, european, world and commonwealth championships and GP meetings, which regularly attract crowds in excess of 40,000 in suitable stadia across Europe.",
