            "background": "At present the rail links between north and south wales mean that the traveller has to travel out of the country and then back in again to get from North to South Wales. And so the majority of people will use their car to travel instead. Rail links in Welsh rural areas are few and far between. \n\nLinks between for eg Caernarfon and Porthmadog; Aberystwyth and Carmarthen; were closed years ago. If links between areas in wales were opened again and other links between areas improved, this could significantly improve public transport in Wales. \n\nThe price of the train fares for eg a ticket from Porthmadog to Abergavenny (North to South)is appalling! If the government is attempting to get people to use public transport they should make it a practical way to travel (one which doeesnt take twice as long as it would in a car) and also a cheap way to travel.",
