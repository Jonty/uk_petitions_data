            "background": "Allow those people on Jobseekers allowance to benefit from other benefits not currently available to them. Winter fuel allowance is paid to everyone over the age of 60 except for people on Jobseekers allowance who do not get a single penny over and above JSA rate.It is just as cold for the poor in winter as it is for those better off. But JSA is below poverety level and ever increasing fuel costs mean unpaid bills or no heating in winter. Only those on the lowest incomes should get Winter Heating Allowances and that should include those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed.",
