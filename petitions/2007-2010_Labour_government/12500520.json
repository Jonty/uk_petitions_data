            "background": "The defence of doli incapax and the rebuttable presumption are two different things, which often coexisted. Following the House of Lords decision in R v JTB [2009], it is now trite law that both elements were abolished by Section 34 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.\n\nI hereby petition that this section is repealed. I do not petition for a return of the rebuttable presumption; however, I advocate that the defence of doli incapax should return to the statute books ( thus providing a reversal of the presumption).\n\nTherefore, a Court would start with the presumption that a child between 10-14 was capable of forming criminal intent, and it would be open for the defence to disprove this on the balance of probabilities.",
