        "action": "re-introduce the BCG innoculation nationwide",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the past 20 years, the BCG for tuberculosis has been phased out, whilst the number of people entering the country with the condition, either legally or illegally has risen to an alarming rate.  It is most distressing to know that my children are at risk because someone decided that there was no need for it anymore.\n\nClearly there is, or it will be rife, with no chance of cure.  Is it government policy to remove  all these safeguards from our children?  Will they start withdrawing the polio vaccine too?\n\nThere is some cover, but mostly in the areas with high multicultural diversity.\n\nIT SHOULD BE NATIONWIDE!!!\n\nI had the benefit of the BCG jab when I was at school in the 1970's and 1980's, and I want my children to have the same.\n\nStop spending the money on new boardroom tables and fancy lunches!  Help us to protect our children....please!!",
