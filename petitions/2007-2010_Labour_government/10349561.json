Take \u00a319,500 out of your savings account and put it into a current account for the deposit, therefore loosing interest, organise a mortgage, take yet another day off work to attend the auction, only to find that your maximum bid of \u00a3195,000 is less than the reserve and the property remains unsold, how annoying is that!!!\n\nThe Guide price should reflect the minimum selling price and the highest bidder above that price should secure the property. Simple, open & honest.",
