            "background": "Scouting For Girls cause great pain and offence to the ears of people through their inane, amateur songs. The standard of lyrics and arrangement is incredibly poor, and the band are a stain on this nation's great musical history. I, and others, experience a great sense of trauma whenever I hear any of their music. The fact that popular radio stations appear to play them in heavy rotation makes the situation worse. Therefore I feel it is only right to ban the broadcast of this band's material, in order to protect the nation from their heinous crimes against music.",
