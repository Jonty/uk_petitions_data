            "background": "I hereby ask the prime minister of the united Kingdom to ensure Merseytravel re-instate the Trio-Plus pass scheme in Liverpool so that students can travel from Liverpool to Ormskirk without paying excess of \u00a390. I feel the students travelling between Liverpool to Ormskirk should be taken into severe consideration. You are always talking about how we should ensure we use public transport. If you want us to use public transport take everyone into consideration and please do not take advantage of the fact that some of us have to. Shouldnt we be rewarded for this surely. I am awaiting your opinion and decision. I hope all other students who are  being taken advantage sign this petition so we can state exactly what we want and how public transport should not be taking advantage of us. \n\nThanks in advance\nKen Wynne",
