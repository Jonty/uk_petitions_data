            "background": "Private sector prisons operate on far fewer numbers than that of HMP prisons (x2 officers to 63 prisoners) they are not equiped with anything other than radios.  It is only fair that they should have the same right to deffend themselves as HMP officers.  It is just a case of money, profit and not caring for the staff.  3 officers were recently badly injured by violent prisoners.  The situation could of been prevented or at the very least, the injuries lesser if the use of batons were granted by the private company itself.  This is why it should be made the law for officers to carry batons.",
