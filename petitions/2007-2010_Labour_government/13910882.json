            "background": "Housing at RAF Brize Norton is appalling. The majority of housing was built in reponse to the Cyprus Invasion over 30 years ago and has exceed it's shelf life. Since being posted here in 2006 we are in our 2nd property which is also riddled with mould and other problems. \nApparently due to the subsided rental scheme it is acceptable for my family to live below the poverty line. \nNew building work is meant to be happening however there are leaks that their is no money or planning permission in place.\nThese men and women put their life on the line on a daily basis yet their poor families are left to sit and rot. \nI'm sure these conditions are contrivening their basic human rights.",
