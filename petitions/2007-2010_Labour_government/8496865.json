        "background": "The 10-15% deposit at the point of exchange does nothing to prevent either party pulling out of the purchase/sale of a home, by which stage both parties have incurred significant and largely unrecoverable costs (solicitor, search, mortgage, HIP etc). \n\nIntroduction of 2% deposit as soon as the final price has been agreed would at the very least reduce gazzumping, and without any irrecoverable costs. In case of a sale falling through, the party which suffered a loss would keep the whole, or at least part of, the 2% deposit.\n\nDeposit payable at the point of exchange could be at the same time reduced by the said 2%.",
