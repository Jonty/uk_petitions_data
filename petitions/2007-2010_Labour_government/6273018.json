            "background": "The current equal pay rules allow females to claim for equal pay for work of an equal value. This is entirely correct however, this act does not allow males to enforce the same act. Surely this is sex discrimination itself, denying someone the right to claim equal pay because they are the same sex as another person.\n\nexample: If a male was earning \u00a320,000 a year and a female was earning \u00a315,000 for doing the same job, she would be entitled to bring legal action to claim equal pay (including back pay) however if a male doing exactly the same job was paid considerably less, he would not be entitled to claim equal pay nor back pay. This is sex discrimination.",
