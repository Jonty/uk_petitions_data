            "background": "A mother with three children wants to buy them some crisps.  She can buy six packets of low(er) fat crisps for \u00a31.18, or she can buy 18 packets of 'full' fat crisps for 99p.  Is it any wonder that we have an increasing number of obese children in the UK?  People talk about fat TAX.. but that word, 'tax' gets people huffing and puffing and stropping.  Whether the Government puts up the price of non-healthy foods (based on fats, sugars, salts), or whether the price of healthy fruit and veg and other healthy foods are subsidised, the balance has to be redressed.  \n\nPlease please PLEASE take this seriously.  The crisps was just one example in a supermarket where the cheapest foods are often the most unhealthy.\n\nIf we can put resources into this now, then perhaps in the future we can help lessen the burden placed on the NHS because of illnesses caused by excessive weight.\n\nHave a Heart.",
