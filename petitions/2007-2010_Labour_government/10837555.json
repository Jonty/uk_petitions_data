Having sent my child to a non-faith school in the UK I find my child is being encouraged to participate in collective worship broadly Christian in nature.  I have the option to remove my child but feel that this puts unnecessary pressure on myself and my child within the school and our community, therefore our views are not understood, respected nor tolerated by them or the Government and this isn't just.  Please take collective worship out of non-faith schools and leave it for faith schools, places of worship and home.",
