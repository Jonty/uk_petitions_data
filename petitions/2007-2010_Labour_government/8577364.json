            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In 1989, Dr. David Kelly was involved in investigations into the Soviet violations of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and was a key member of the inspection team visiting the USSR on several occasions between 1991 and 1994. His experience with biological weapons at Porton Down led to his selection as a United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq following the end of the Gulf War. Dr. David Kelly's work as a member of the UNSCOM team led him to visit Iraq some thirty-seven times and his success in uncovering Iraq's biological weapons programme caused Rolf Ek\u00e9us to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1996. Although not a member of the intelligence Service, they regularly sought his opinion on Iraq and other issues. David Kelly became a member of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith around the year 1999.\n\nI believe in view of the work Dr David Kelly did before his tragic and untimely death, that he was a man pre-eminent in his field and that his work for both his country and the United Nations should be acknowledged by the government and that he be awarded a posthumous knighthood.",
