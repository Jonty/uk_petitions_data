            "background": "Recently there has been news of some companies stating the products to be \u201cSuitable for Vegetarians\u201d but they accepted that they were using small amount of alcohol. \n\nPlease note even a small amount of alcohol is considered Haraam (Not Halal) according to Islamic Sharia. Stating just \u201cSuitable for Vegetarians\u201d is not enough.\n\nHence majority of Muslims in United Kingdom request the Prime Minister to enforce all Food related companies to state clearly that:-\n\n-There are no animal ingredients included and its Suitable for all \nVegetarians.\n\n-The alcohol or ethanol has not been used as ingredient.\n\n-If they use any chemicals in manufacturing that ingredients could come into contact with and if they ensured that there was no cross-contamination with haram ingredients. This also include any chemicals used to clean the machinery.  \n\n***This will also give people trust on UK Food industry and foreign imports will be limited, because at the moment a huge amount of Halal food is being imported.\n\nThanks!",
