A warning email for a first offence, temporary suspension of service for a second offence, and finally, termination of their contract.\n\nThe Internet should be an open platform, the music industry earn millions of pounds in revenue even after their claims that they are losing millions in revenue because if illegal downloading.\n\nRecord corporations need to learn how to use the internet for promotion and marketing instead of complaining about, the Internet is the greatest invention of the 21st century it must be for the people and not controlled.",
