This commitment is part of its wider programme to combat climate change\"\nWhat better way to run in in line with this response, than for all members of government to lead the way by using electric 'green' cars. \nImproving public transport wouldn't go a miss as well, considering it actually works out cheaper for some people to drive to work, despite the excessive fuel costs, than to catch the bus for example.",
