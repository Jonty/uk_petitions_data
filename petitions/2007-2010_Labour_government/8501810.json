View closed e-petitions, most signed first, & it is impossible to find a Government response upholding the petition\u2019s motions. Instead, a long-winded explanation is given eventually implying the Government\u2019s position is correct, or that the issue is under consideration & the option people least desire is not ruled out. Approximately 20% of closed petitions reaching the needed signature threshold fail to receive an official response. 1.8 million Motorists requesting a road pricing scheme not be considered fail to have their request upheld. The e-petition site appears to make no obvious contribution to Parliamentary decisions, nor \u201cdirect democracy\u201d. So long as no petitions are upheld, confidence in the petition system will be undermined, with flippant petitions like \u201cmake Jeremy Clarkson PM\u201d being most interesting. Surely constituent\u2019s opinions are of some importance?",
