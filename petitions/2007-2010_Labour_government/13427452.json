        "background": "As a battling compulsive gambler, I feel that advertising of internet gambling is highly inconsiderate and wrong.\n\nThe advertisment of internet bingo and such like in every day television can do nothing but increase the likelihood of more gambling problems. The rise of women becoming addicted to gambling is one such issue, with these adverts being aimed at day time TV where possibly bored mothers may view them and get caught out by their curiosity.\n\nThe government was willing to ban tobacco advertising, and is now pushing for the ban on alcohol advertising. Whilst compulsive gambling may not have a direct reaction on physical health, the damage incurred in mental health is massive. \n\nGambling destroys families, marriages and financial gain.",
