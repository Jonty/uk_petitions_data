            "background": "I am petitioning that the government provide access to computers and broadband internet services for all old people, as a right, as has been done for schools.\nMany old people in this country are isolated from friends and family by declining wealth, health, and mobility. They spend their days alone. They have free bus passes but many of them are not robust enough to travel.\nInternet based social tools can counter all of those issues, providing access to far more social contacts, worldwide, at low cost, and in a way which can adapt to their own lifestyle and frailties. It can also make their experience and wisdom available to society as a whole.\nThe objection that old people may not be able to cope with the technology is easily solved. Get children to help them through school. School children all understand these things and don't need expensive vetting or training. An hour a month would help to broaden their experience, looks good in their personal statements, and strengthens the community.",
