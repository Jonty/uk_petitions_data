        "background": "The public smoking ban, while to be mainly welcomed, has an unfortunate implication that Council tenants are banned from smoking on open air communal balconies. A location where the smoker is only harming themselves and should not be subject to a \u00a350 fine. \n\nA consequence of this element of the ban, particularly in tall blocks, will be to encourage people either to smoke in their own flats, where there may be children. Some may choose to walk out of the building entirely which is not ideal and not an option for the elderly or very disabled. Further some Councils have suggested smokers should not smoke within their own flats an hour before a visit by a community worker which implies these groups are being given an ultimatum to either give up smoking, be denied services or be criminalised. \n\nWe the undersigned believe the smoking ban should be enforced, but pragmatic. Council tenants who choose to smoke should be allowed to do so outside on their own balconies, communal or not.",
