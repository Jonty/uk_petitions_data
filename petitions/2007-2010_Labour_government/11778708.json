        "background": "I think we should create an online House of Parliment. Individual avatars (aka representatives) for an individualistic age. The Lords only represent themselves ( they dont represent a constituency), why cant we also represent ourselves in an Online House of parilment. \nGoverment and parilment are unrepresentative in general. There are no chavs in parilment. If parilment is unrepresentative then it's policies will also be.\nThere is no longer a need to send representatives to a building in physical space when we can represent ourselves in a construction in digital space. This does not replace any houses of parilment which are existing but just adds another. Niether does it negate the need for paid politicians.",
