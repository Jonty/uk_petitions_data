        "background": "Currently, there does not exist a single international standard for, or regulation of, arms trading. Irresponsible arms transfers fuel conflict, poverty and human rights abuses. \nThough leaders have agreed in principle to the idea of a Treaty, some governments continue to disrupt and delay progress. And while meetings rumble on, armed violence costs an estimated 2,000 lives every day.\nDecision makers are set to come together at the UN in New York next month for the next round of meetings. At these meetings, they must take the long overdue step of moving forward from talking and stalling to negotiating and deciding \u2013 and the UK government must use its influence to get serious negotiations started and do all they can to set 2012 as the completion date for UN negotiations on the Treaty.\nPeople under threat from armed violence need less talking and more action",
