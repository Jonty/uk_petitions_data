        "background": "At present, if a house is listed, modern ways of saving energy such as double glazed windows, solar panels and so on are not allowed even if they do not adversely affect the building. Many listed buildings are not particularly original and might only be listed because they are in a certain place.  With the need for all of us to save energy and if it can be shown the work would not be unsightly or affect others, I hope the rules can be changed so listed houses can be improved to at least meet the current energy saving requirements for new build.",
