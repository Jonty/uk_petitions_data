            "background": "I have found that there are a lot of concerts that under 18s are not allowed to attend and also competitions that they are not allowed to enter because the venues do not want people to attend who cannot buy alcohol. I don't think this is fair. Having more under 18 friendly venues will help to keep teenagers off the streets and if they are at official places they can be kept an eye on and are less likely to get into trouble or endanger themselves.",
