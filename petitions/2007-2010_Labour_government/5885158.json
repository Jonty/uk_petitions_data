        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Dear Sir, \n\nWe believe that the problem with cannabis lies within the 'skunk' type grown in Britain as a result of the strict trafficking laws that make it difficult for naturally grown varieties to be imported from other countries. The latter variety is far less dangerous than alcohol and, if regulated by law, could be sold, grown and used legitimately in the UK without problems. The 'skunk' variety is dangerous to both physical and mental health, grown using chemicals and sprayed with fibreglass to make it weigh more - this needs to be criminalised. \n\nWe ask that normal, natural strength cannabis should be legalised and regulated for use by the public and that hydroponically grown 'skunk' strains should be criminalised and classified as a harmful and dangerous drug.",
