            "background": "Rabbits are one of the most abused pets in the UK. Neutering and microchipping would prevent breeding of unwanted rabbits and allow abandoned rabbits to be traced to their source or reunited with their owners. Breeding should only be allowed under license. Vaccination against VHD and myxi would prevent many unnecessary deaths. Sellers frequently provide misleading information about costs, accomodation and feed, if any information is given at all. This would save rescue centres millions of pounds which could be better spent. This should be considered for all other pets also.",
