            "background": "It is most frustrating that in this day and age there are still areas in the UK where you cannot get a mobile phone signal with one network but can with another.\nEach network has hundreds of masts on which to relay their own signal, if they were to share their masts then you should be able to have a mobile signal on every network where-ever you go without the need for the mobile companies to install new masts all over the place. This would be a lot fairer on the consumer as then you could be free to choose which network to go for based on price and service instead of which network gives you the best coverage in a particular area.",
