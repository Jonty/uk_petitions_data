        "background": "After years of debate, it is finally time to do away with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and keep British Summer Time (BST) all year round. That means no more putting the clocks back - instead we could all enjoy an extra hour of afternoon/evening daylight from October to March. It would be better for business, better for people's general well being and would reduce the number of fatalities on Britain's roads. Please sign this petition to show your support.",
