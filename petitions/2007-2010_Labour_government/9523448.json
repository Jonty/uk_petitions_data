Surely after the first time, they have learned from their \"mistake\". From watching recent documentaries on abortion, it seems to me that no-one gets out of it without trauma. We need to have better sex education for the school age, but as much for adults who supposedly know better. I, personally, am against abortion in any case, but this would at least be better than it currently stands.",
