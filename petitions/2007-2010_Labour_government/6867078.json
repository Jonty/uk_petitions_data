            "background": "Upgrade the A1 between Edinburgh M8 junction and Berwick-upon-Tweed so that we have the same benefits as the west coast to Glasgow. Having 2 roads of high safety standard in Scotland from the English border would ease some of the problems on the roads. The capital of Scotland also deserves a decent road from England to help heavy transport and visitors. The section of Berwick to Dunbar A1 should be dualed and is dangerous going from single to dual and back again for all traffic. Remove roundabouts and install flyovers with slip roads. The section from the A1 around the Edinburgh bypass should be made 3 lanes with flyovers instead of roundabouts. It must be confusing for visitors to this country to find a road so dangerous because of piecemeal dualing on the A1.",
