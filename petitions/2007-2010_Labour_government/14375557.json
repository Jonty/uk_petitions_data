            "background": "There are a large number of job adverts, particularly on job websites, that do not specify the employers name or contact details - usually when advertised through an agency, who will usually not reveal the company name even when asked.  Also, it is well known that some agencies will create fake job postings in order to attract job seekers to sign up on their books.\n\nThis is unacceptable - it makes it impossible to verify if a job is geniune, and whether you have already applied for the same job previously, or indeed whether you already work for that employer.\n\nWith the current rate of unemployment, and a growing number of scam and non-existent job adverts, something needs to be done urgently to protect and help the unemployed during these tough times.",
