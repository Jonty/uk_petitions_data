            "background": "Debbie Purdy again was refused to have a clarification on the law, on whether or not family members would face legal punishment on assisting suicide, abroad.\n\nThe simple fact is, the answer from the DPP and courts (in effect) of 'no clarification is needed as the law is clear' is total nonsense - this very case came about BECAUSE it ISN'T clear. \n\nSince 1992, over 100 people have committed suicide abroad and family members have not been subject to criminal prosecutions, when they assisted with the suicide, despite the Act saying they should be - LOGICALLY it is therefore NOT clear.\n\nLet us be clear, this is not a moral debate on the rights and wrongs of suicide - it is about clarity of law - the two subjects should not be confused.",
