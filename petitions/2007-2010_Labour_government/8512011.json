        "background": "Beagle dogs and puppies are being bred for, and used, in experiments and drug trials throughout British labs.  In accordance with the Report of the Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures, paragraph/section 26 calls for replacement methods (to animals) stating they would have commercial as well as animal welfare advantages. We believe it is well time therefore, as this report was first published in 1986, that Beagle dogs are replaced and legislation is set in place to ensure they are not bred and used for any experimental or testing purpose.",
