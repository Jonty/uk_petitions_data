            "background": "People with certain medical conditions, like epileptics, are not permitted to drive unless their condition is well under control. I think this should also apply to people who abuse alcohol and drugs.\n\nAn alcoholic in our neighbourhood goes on benders every few months, and then attempts to drive his car. So far the only damage he has done is to himself and his vehicle, but it is only a matter of time before he injures or kills someone else. The police can only act if they actually catch him driving under the influence. He has one conviction for drunk driving some years ago. If his licence was taken away from him and others like him, then the police could arrest them if they attempted to drive and the roads might be a bit safer!",
