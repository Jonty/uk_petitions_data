            "background": "I would like the government to stop training people for sectors in which there are no jobs and stop the feeling of disenchantment and the giving of false hope. Rather than raising aspirations the government has raised disappointment and disenchantment at a different level. People who have made sacrifices, invested time, money and hope for the future. The recent government initiative to train teachers in six months as well as the constant advertising campaigns send out the message that jobs in teaching are plenty and actively entice people into a profession where there are simply very few permanent jobs. If there are not enough jobs why are you training more and more Teachers Nurses, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists etc. The vast numbers of people with degrees means that you now need a degree to do the most basic jobs - why?",
