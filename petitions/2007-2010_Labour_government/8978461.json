            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "the proposal to ban swords with a curved blade length of over 50cm is a joke, due to several crimes last year involving \"samurai swords\" all swords featuring a curved blade of over 50cm in length will be banned, this will include \"samurai swords\", cavalry sabres, officers swords, essentially pieces of British and worldwide culture, even licensed replica swords from movies will be band. sword collectors, martial arts practitioners and even fans of movies will be hard hit by this ban, and several companies relying on the sale of these swords in the UK will have to close. we are told that due to a increase in crime involving cheap \"samurai swords\" all curved bladed weapons will be banned for our safety. how many crimes were committed last year with a car, yet no car ban has been proposed, and swords that fall in to the category of this ban are hardly concealable.\nif the government feels that these swords must be banned then only ban cheaply made \"samurai swords\" and leave all other swords with curved blades alone.\nwhen this ban was  revealed to last year, it was implied that that the ban would only affect samurai swords, yet now the ban has moved on to envelop all swords with curved blades.",
