As this land could not serve as usable green space, local councils should obtain this under compulsory purchase and sell on serviced plots at agricultural values to local people willing to self build low/neutral carbon homes either as a community or individually. This would create \"real\" affordable housing with an instant community ethos as well as contributing to the reduction in CO2 emmisions.",
