In order to be able to ride safely and not be a danger to other road users (cyclists, pedestrians and car drivers etc.) cyclists need to use their eyes AND ears.  The use of headphones/earphones to listen to music whilst cycling prevents cyclists from hearing what is happening around them (e.g. police/fire/abulance vehicle sirens, nearby cars/pedestrians etc).  Listening to music is also distracting which also presents a risk to the cyclist if they choose to use headphones whilst cycling. Earphones these days have been built for music quality, which means background noises are filtered out. Perfect for those using headphones at home, but not cyclists!",
