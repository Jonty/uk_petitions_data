            "background": "The investigation into discovering the identity of the mole who leaked the information which sparked the MPs expenses scandal is a waste of public money and is nothing but a witch hunt. The leak was in the public interest, as the uproar that followed indicates. The failure of parliament to accept this is indicative that MPs are out of touch with public opinion and reality.\nWasting even more money on this matter in the current financial climate is not providing taxpayers value for money.",
