            "background": "Christmas as we know it, and particularly the family occasion is being destroyed by the insistance of retailers to open on Boxing Day. One such store is openly bragging about opening at 7am!\nFamily life in this country is being destroyed for the sake of the pockets of large retailers and their shareholders. Surely people can manage for more than one day without the shops being open!?\n\nI urge everyone who has family working within the retail trade to sign this petition and stop the money making greed taking over the Christmas celebrations in this country.",
