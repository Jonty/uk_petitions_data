        "action": "impose a strict and mandatory quota for the maximum amount of emergency services workers striking at any one time",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The emergency services are obviously absolutely vital for all of us, as we never know when we might need them and they save thousands of lives on a daily basis.\n\nThey deserve our utmost respect for the work they do, however when they go on strike, notwithstanding the understandable reasons they may have for striking, people who are in need of them are dying due to their refusal to work.\n\nI am not proposing that they should be forbidden from striking - that would be against their rights and completely unfair. I am proposing that there must be a very strict quota dictating the number of workers from each of the emergency services who are allowed to strike at any one time. This is because they are needed 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, and it is absolutely unacceptable that people have died as a direct result of an ambulance workers' or firemen's strike, while they would normally have been saved easily.",
