            "background": "The people and town of Wootton Bassett have shown prolonged and dedicated patriotism by lining their streets in a dignified manner to proudly welcome home our country's fallen heroes, and have come to represent our country as our ambassadors in this sad task. The current honours system means it is impossible to nominate a town rather than a named individual. We feel it is fitting that the Government and Crown, on behalf of the nation, recognise these exceptional circumstances and exceptional community spirit by awarding the town and people of Wootton Bassett with the Order of the British Empire in a similar way that Malta was awarded the George Cross.",
