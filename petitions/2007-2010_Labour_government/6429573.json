        "background": "Recent press reports have claimed that the Government is again looking at the matter of prostitution and a feminist Labour MP speaking on a radio programme said she thought prostitution should be made illegal.\nWe have, and rightly so, laws regarding people trafficing, underage sex, gross indecency etc, but beyond this anything which goes on between two consenting adults in private should be their own business and not a matter for the State. \nAnd just how would it be enforced? Would payment in kind be differentiated from payment in cash? Most men pay for it in one way or another.",
