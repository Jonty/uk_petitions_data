            "background": "Senior military and political\nfigures say Trident is irrelevant to the security challenges Britain faces in the next decades. We wish the money saved from Trident renewal to be spent on providing recently retired people with a full Basic State Pension of \u00a3124 a week and \u00a3140 per week for the over 75s.   The Institute of Fiscal Studies puts pensioner poverty in the UK at 2.2 million. Half of these pensioners live in deep poverty, well below the official poverty line.  3.6 million women pensioners have lost out on pension rights because they spent time caring for children or in low paid part-time jobs.   With the value of private pensions plummeting and employers cancelling final salary schemes more and more older people will come to depend on the State for an income after retirement. Trident cancellation is the public expenditure cut that we, the public, want.",
