            "background": "At present the law ties the hands of the authorities if a parent leaves their children with someone under the age of 16 for more than a standard babysitting evening.  This means that 11 and 12 year olds can be left for 5 days with only a 15 year old and no intervention can be made by the police if the other parent or another party is concerned.  The police need to have the support of a clear guideline with age defined and also time limit.  Thus ensuring the well being and safety of children under the age of 16.",
