            "background": "As an A-Level Government and Politics student about to complete my final exams, I believe that our government must introduce a system of proportional representation to elect our MPs to the House of Commons.\n\nAll of the major political parties agree that Parliament as our legislature must be given more power in terms of executive scrutiny in order to prevent the ever increasing level of executive dominance or elective dictatorship currently seen in the UK.\n\nConsidering the UK's system of fusion of powers and parliamentary government, it is clear to see that we will not be able to achieve the same level of executive scrutiny which the US Congress has over the President and his government, but I believe that a system of proportional representation for Westminster Elections would go a long way to address this highly undemocratic political situation we have at present.\n\nNew Labour promised a referendum on proportional representation for Westminster Elections back in their 1997 election manifesto, as well as commissioning several studies into the possibilities, but nothing as yet has happened in terms of introducing this most needed of parliamentary reforms!",
