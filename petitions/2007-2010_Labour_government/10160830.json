            "background": "the csa are allowed to use a means tested benefit in order to calculate how much maintenance the non resident parent has to make.this is meaning that the parent with care is recieving child tax credits of their own and a portion of the non resident parents, which means they are recieving it twice.this decision means that the childrens human rights act is being contravened by making the non resident parents children whom live with them  suffer due to the lack of money for food and general living costs.this is sometimes causing families to loose their homes as they can no longer afford to live in them.the children rights act states that all children have a right to a home healthy lifestyle and to join groups with other children.this is impossible with the demands that the csa make on families especially if the non resident is the sole earner.",
