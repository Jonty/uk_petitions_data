            "background": "On the Pakistan High Commission website it has been highlighted that Britain is to increase its International Development fund for Pakistan to \u00a3665m.   The British Pakistani Christian Association petitions the UK Government to ensure that effective accountability and traceability of the usage of these funds is guaranteed.   \n\nWe commend the Government\u2019s fund towards overall holistic improvements to the Pakistani Education system.  However, we petition the Government of the UK to ensure that a portion of these funds from the educational reform segment of the grant, are utilised towards eradicating the disparity of educational and employment opportunity for minority faith groups in Pakistan.  Only 7% of Minority faith groups in Pakistan are literate, compared with 50% of the majority Muslim community.  \n\nMinority faith groups in the main live in impoverished communities and over 85% of them work as domestic labour.",
