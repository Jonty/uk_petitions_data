        "background": "Britain needs another military base in the South Atlantic Ocean. The base on the Falkland Islands is not big enough if another Argentine invasion force tries to once again take the Isalnds. I being a descendant of a Falklands Islander I feel it is more important to protect these Islands than other may. We need a base that can hold around 2000-3000 troops, along with the already 2000 British troops in the Falklands Islands already. Please sign this petition and give the Falkland Islanders the support they need.",
