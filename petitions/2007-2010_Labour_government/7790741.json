        "background": "Public sector workers have been repeatedly told that their payrises must reflect the governments target for inflation.  The government has consistently claimed that restraint in public sector pay is required in order to control inflation within the UK.  This has led to recent pay rises of below 2% for a number of organisations within the public sector.\nHowever MP's are now being given the chance to vote on a payrise that is not only way above inflationary targets but will, in fact, mean a 10% rise over 3 years.  \nThis is a clear example of a \"do as I say, not as I do\" attitude amongst politicians who, let us not forget, have put themselves up for election and have been voted in to represent the public, not their own selfish interests.",
