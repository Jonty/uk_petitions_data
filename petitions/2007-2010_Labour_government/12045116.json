            "background": "During this high period of unemployment, people with a wide variety of skills can not find work. Unemployment rises as people can not find the specific jobs to thier skill set. Job agencies look for very specific candidates. People who perhaps lack skills to search in places other then the jobcentre become demoralised and feel that they will never find work. \n\nBy making it law for every single job to be posted in a central place paves way for those out of work to find a greater variety of jobs and for there to be more diversity in the workforce. It allows people to be judged on their own merit and companies to find a greater diversity of applicants. In doing this you give the general populace more opportunities to work and provide for their families thus supporting a greater quality of life.",
