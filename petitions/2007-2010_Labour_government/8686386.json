            "background": "People have now lost confidence in the Police, CPS and the Judiciary, as innocent and vulnerable people are brought before the Courts and the jails are full of those having committed minor, technical crimes, whereas those who commit serious, physical, crimes are roaming the streets.\n\nThis is confirmed by the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who has 24 hour police protection, admitting that she would not feel safe walking in London after dark.\n\nThe laws seem only to apply to the law abiding citizens, as the police do not have the stomach to apply these laws to those who defy them.\n\nThe Government, having failed to recognise this and having taken no action so far to change these laws, and having also given draconian powers to Councils which criminalise those who do not pay Council Tax (a civil debt) as protest, as happened recently to a 74 years old man, have also lost the confidence of the public.\n\nHence, a vote of no confidence in this government should be presented to the Parliament immediately.",
