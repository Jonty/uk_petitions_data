            "background": "For years Banks have deducted charges from bank accounts as they see fit and sometimes in the process causing severe hardship to the account owner.   No-one should be allowed to take money from a bank account without the account holders knowledge.     I would urge this Government to think seriously about making it illegal for banks to deduct any charges without first giving the account holder notice with a date and narrative of what the charges pertain to.",
