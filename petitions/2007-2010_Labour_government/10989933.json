        "background": "With HBOS variable mortgage products, when the BoE interest rate goes up the customer mortgage rate goes up the next day. When the rate goes down the mortgage goes down at the end of the month. Although within the T&C's (changes to the mortgage rate can take place within 31 days) it is clearly another example of the consumer being unfairly treated. As taxpayers now own 40% of HBOS/LLoyds what is G Brown going to do about this?",
