Equivalent Electric Mopeds(Scooters) in the UK cost \u00a32000. Why are british Electic zero emmission, environmentally friendly, cheap to run electric vehicles over priced by almost twice as much. The British public are being overcharged to save the environment and this should be discouraged by the British government which should be helpingto to ensure greener more affordable transport is available to us all. Environmentally freindly electric vehicle Distributors are deliberately overcharging the British public and should be made to lower their prices immediately",
