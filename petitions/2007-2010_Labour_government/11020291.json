            "background": "This petition calls on the Government to reduce the number of Members of Parliament for two reasons\n\nFirstly it will reduce the burden of cost to the tax payer for an over representative national Government and secondly it will promote devolution and greater local government.\n\nDo we really need 650 MPs and 700ish Lords, along with their associated expense?\n\nIn the US there are 435 members of the House of Representatives and 100 Senators all serving a population much larger than the UK's\n\nIn the current economic climate cuts have to be made in public spending and surely the first place to look is at our Parliament and ways savings can be made there. More than \u00a31 million a year could be saved in cutting 200 MP\u2019s from our system and that is just on salaries so more would be saved in terms of expenses.\n\nSimilarly by limiting the Lords to just 100 members costs would be greatly reduced.\n\nWe need a political system that meets the needs of a modern society not an over bloated antiquated one.",
