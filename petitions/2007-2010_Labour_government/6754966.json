            "background": "In 1999, when Mr Brown was Chancellor, he said in his pre-Budget report: \u201cIf there are any real term rises in road fuel duties, the revenues will go straight to a ring-fenced fund for the modernisation of roads and public transport.\u201d\n\nThe October 1st 2p rise in fuel duty is going into the Treasury's consolidated fund for the general public spending rather than being earmarked for transport.\n\nThe motorist is an easy source of revenue for the government, and little is returned to improve their situation. Return these funds as real improvements to the transport infrastructure as was promised.",
