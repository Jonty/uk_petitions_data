            "background": "The DWP policy in force at the moment means ex serviceman/woman who has served this country for a full service of 22 years are not entitled to Job Seekers Allowance when they become unemployed because their small, well deserved, service pension cancels out their entitlement. They will have paid National Insurance Contrabutions and tax for the past 22 years of their service life but as the law stands when their 22 year contract with the armed services is complete, they are not entitled to job seekers allowance. This is wrong. They should be entitled as anyone else losing their job. \nThe law in 1996. Department Of Works And Pensions (DWP) did not take this into account.\nGiven where service personnel are now serving in the most dangerous situations I am sure they do not expect this when they complete their 22 years service.\nI am sure the PM, the MOD or the DWP are not aware of the current situation.",
