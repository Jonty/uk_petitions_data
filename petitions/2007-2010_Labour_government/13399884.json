            "background": "Pensioners living outside of the UK do not receive the same level of benefits despite having contributed the same into the system. This results in many expats having to return to the UK and therefore place an even larger strain on the social benefit system. Pensions should not be split into basic plus extras that are only paid to residents of the UK as this discriminates against those who wish to retire in an other country.",
