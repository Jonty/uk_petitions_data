            "background": "After seeing the case of baby P on the news (11/11/08) it occured to me that much child abuse goes on which someone could report. There were three people in the household of this child who could have come forward at any time to report this abuse and have the child moved to safety.The mother, her boyfriend and the lodger. \n\n\n\nMy idea may be unpopular at first sight, as it is to protect informants of abuse from prosecution, but I think in the long run it may save lives. \n\nThere must be situations where someone would come forward if they felt safe from prosecution even the abusers themselves. This would enable the removal of children from these situations and possible death.\n\n\nWhile my idea is sketchy it is just the bare bones of the idea and details would need to be worked out for different situations but it is time something radical was done to stop these babies dying such horrific deaths.",
