            "background": "Cheques will be phased out by October 31 2018, by UK's Payments Council.\n\nThe 15-strong body, comprising members of the banking industry, said cheques were in \"long-term, terminal decline\".\n\nCheques are only in decline because for some transactions particularly between company to company, or individual to company there are more efficient means. Yet cheque transactions still remain at a third of their peak level. \n\nFor transactions between individual to individual they still are relevant. For any other means (apart from cash) you need the recipients bank details. Think of all the ocassions you use a cheque where altrenative methods would not be as convenient.\n\nThe Payments Council has faced opposition from businesses and charities who argue that they will lose out when individuals can no longer use cheques for payments or contributions. \n\nThe public are barely aware of the issue. Make your voice heard against the bankers.",
