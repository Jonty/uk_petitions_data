            "background": "The law states that people entering the country on valid, but temporary, visas should have no recourse to public funds.  No doubt anti-foreigner people feel this is quite right - \"why should tax-payers' cash be spent on them?\" - but I want to tell you about one woman (probably typical of many) I learnt about from the current (Feb 2008) issue of Amnesty International news.  \n\nShe left her husband after months of physical, psychological, and sexual violence; she had attempted suicide twice.  A refuge worker tried to help her but no council department would intervene due to the \"no recourse\" law.  This worker was advised to take her to claim asylum but the Home Office detained her; they weren't interested in her particular situation.  \n\nShe was eventually forced to go back to her abusive husband but later left and now NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER SHE'S ALIVE OR DEAD; just because of the very restrictive and inflexible way this rule is applied.",
