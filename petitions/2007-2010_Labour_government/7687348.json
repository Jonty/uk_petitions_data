We sent our local GPs, dentists and police Superintendent photographic and camcorder information of smokers wilfully breaking the law \u2013the GPs and dentists will refuse future treatment. \n\nOur database of information has been passed to our police Superintendent. We also have the support, in writing of ASH, SCOTH, The British Heart Foundation, The British Cancer Society, and the BMJ. \n\nRemember that over 30,000 people die each year of \u2018passive smoking\u2019, (figures from ASH and Professor Robert West, an expert on tobacco addiction)\nProfessor West heads the Cancer Research UK health behaviour unit at University College London\n\nIf we want a healthier greener country\u2026then please support this petition.",
