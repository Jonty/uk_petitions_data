            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This site will be used to treat waste from the neighbouring villages of Boscastle and Tintagel, necessitating 8 miles of pipeline and 5 pumping stations. This is against government policy that all waste should be treated close to it's generation point and leaves the area vulnerable to contamination due to pipeline breakdown.\n\nTrevalga is not only an Area of Great Scientific and Historic Value, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a County Wildlife Site it also an internationally favoured holiday destination. People from all over the world visit to walk the cliffs where the site is proposed and surf the surrounding beaches.\n\nThese works will threaten the local environment and sea life, weaken the local economy which is reliant on tourism, reduce the quality of life for residents, emit a constant level of noise pollution and are both unnecessary and unfair as Trevalga is sewage self-sufficient.",
