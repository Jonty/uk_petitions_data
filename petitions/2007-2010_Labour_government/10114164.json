            "background": "On Thurs 24 April 2008, a High Court judge confirmed what campaigners had been arguing for two years: that consumer contract regulations do apply to bank charges, so can be 'unfair'. The high court decision is binding on the lower courts right now; and that means the law is currently defined and settled. But whilst the banks now have the right to appeal this decision, we the consumers are being prevented from pursuing our claims. On the basis that our cases can be heard on the grounds of fairness now, but may be delayed for months or years whilst the banks appeals are made through various court we believe it is unfair to hold our claims any longer and ask Gordon Brown to raise this issue as a matter of urgency and concern,  with the Financial Services Authority.",
