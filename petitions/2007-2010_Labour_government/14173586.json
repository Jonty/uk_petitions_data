            "background": "This petition is to lower the age of criminal resposability from the age of 10 to 7. Figures out from last year show that over 3000 under 10\u2019s have committed crimes and have not been prosecuted. If we do not dicipline the young offenders at an earlier age there is a strong chance of them re-offending later on in their teens (increasing teenage crime)",
