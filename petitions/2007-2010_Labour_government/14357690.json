However, dogs who have followed rigorous vaccination schedule and use the same vaccines as those approved by the UK authorities (e.g. anti-rabies vaccine like Rabisin) get bracketed with those who do not. Please consider if this rule can be waived for my pet, who arrived into UK on 08 Jan 2010, since she has been vaccinated appropriately, with detailed record. A blood test to confirm this will be welcome.",
