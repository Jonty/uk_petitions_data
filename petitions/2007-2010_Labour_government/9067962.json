            "background": "Despite the last review of compensation rates for servicemen and women injured whilst on active service the levels remain low.  For example, one brave young Royal Marine was recently badly injured in Afghanistan.  His life changing injuries have cost him his right arm and both legs, and yet his compensation award is just \u00a3214,000.  Although he will also receive a modest pension, this is pitiable recompense for his injuries and, when compared with civilian compensation awards, is an insult.  Unfortunately his treatment is not unique, and is part of a pattern that brings shame on our society.  \n\nThe brave service personnel injured whilst on active service for our country deserve better than this.  We urge you, Prime Minister, to do right by them and radically improve the compensation available to help them rebuild their lives.",
