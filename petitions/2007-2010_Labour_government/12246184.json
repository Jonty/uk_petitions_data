            "action": "withdraw the punitive guidance of September 2006 regarding Firefighters pensions and restore the former provisions.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "These guidelines have meant withdrawal of ill-health pensions from firefighters severely injured in the line of duty, simply because they are capable of discharging a small part of their former duties, such as being able to answer a phone. Quote from FBU website 'Under Government pensions guidelines issued in 2004 a disabled or badly injured firefighter would be given an ill health pension unless they could be redeployed to a job within his or her role. New guidance issued in September 2006 meant if they are capable of doing any single part of their work, even answering the phone, they would not get a pension regardless of whether they are, in fact, redeployed to those restricted duties.\n\nThat basically means no pension and no job.\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourselves.",
