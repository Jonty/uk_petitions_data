Unfortunately, noone in the position to help him stay in this country wants to help him. Which is why we believe Gordon Brown and the Labour party should openly declare their intolerance and prejudice against all members of society that suffer from any form of Autism, or give Gary McKinnon a job to make a better electronic defence against future hackers.",
