        "background": "It is amazing that, in 2009, women only make up just over 9 % of armed forces personnel. Furthermore, women are barred from holding 20 -30 % of jobs within the armed forces, including any role which may involve direct combat, or front line operations. Why so? If a woman wants to do this work why should she be barred? And why are women so under represented in the armed forces? \nIn these times of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, our brave armed forces need all the help they can get, and I am sure that there are many brave women who would want the opportunity to apply for whatever role they are fit and able to do.",
