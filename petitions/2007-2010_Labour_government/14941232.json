        "background": "We, the residents of Northamptonshire, being subject to the urbanisation development being imposed by Whitehall via the North Northamptonshire Development Company, which will increase the population of the North of the County by one third, object, not only to the 'rebranding' of Northamptonshire as 'North Londonshire', but also to the imposition of this expansion plan under the government's Sustainable Communities Plan. We object on the basis that it will not only significantly alter the character of the county, but will put an intolerable strain on roads, public services and employment and is therefore actually unsustainable.",
