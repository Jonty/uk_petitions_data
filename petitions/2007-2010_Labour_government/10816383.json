            "background": "It is a very busy and friendly Post Office which is in regular use, and has gained awards for it work.  It is easily accessible (parking etc) for the many businesses and houses in the area, which is more than can be said for the main PO in town. I understand that more houses are to be built in this part of the town, also our Business Park is expanding, which will bring even greater need.  I, for one, use Bengeworth PO regularly for my business. I am, also, Regional Secretary for our region for the Federation of Small Businesses.  As you have a Minister for Small Businesses, you must appreciate the sterling work which is done by them as the biggest business organisation in the country. Please, therefore, reverse your decision to close Bengeworth PO and keep it open. It is very much needed.",
