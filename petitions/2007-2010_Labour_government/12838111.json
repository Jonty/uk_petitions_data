            "background": "London exercises too much influence over the UK Government in comparison with the rest of the country.  On top of that it is too big, very smelly and the people are rude.\n\nBy building a wall around the Greater London area and filling it with water, we will be helping to reduce overpopulation by drowning millions of people and the construction of the wall will create many needed jobs during the downturn.  So, it is a win-win solution.  Lake London will provide a new form of tourist attraction and MPs can meet on a giant floating duck house.",
