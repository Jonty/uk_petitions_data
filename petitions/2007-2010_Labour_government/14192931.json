            "background": "Items such as mobile phones, cameras, drawing tablets, webcams, wireless broadband etc. are only supplied with Windows and sometimes Mac drivers; very rarely Linux. It should be made law that any manufacturer bringing goods to market should include software and support for any operating system which has at least 1% market share. To do otherwise is anti-competitive and prevents upcoming operating systems from even gaining a foothold in the market place. People who choose any operating system other than those favoured by the manufacturers, are thus penalised for their choice and the operating system market place becomes stagnant. This is allowing domination by whomever the manufacturers favour and removes customer choice and fair competition.",
