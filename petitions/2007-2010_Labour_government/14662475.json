            "background": "A ban on products, toys and garments that exploit and promote the harmful premature sexualisation of children.\n\nMany UK high street shops and super markets are now selling products and clothing which promotes the premature sexualisation of children. \n(For example - clothing which is branded with inappropriate logos, childrens shoes with high heels,  make-up aimed at pre-teens, pole dancing kits for children, dolls which wear sexually provocative clothing. )\n\nRecent research has shown that promoting premature sexualisation and a pressure to grow up too quickly greatly affects childrens mental health and emotional well being.  \nTherefore a ban on the sale of products which emphasise or exploit the sexuality of children would allow children the space to grow up without this negative influence.",
