            "background": "I believe that it is iniquitous that Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs can vote on bills that do not affect their constituencies.  Any legislation passed by the Westminster parliament in areas such as health and education does not affect the people of Scotland, so why do Scottish MPs get a vote?\nThe government should introduce, and support, a bill to prevent these MPs voting on any legislation that is not applicable to their constituency. As the devolution arrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are different, the MPs for the constituencies in these areas should be able to vote on different ranges of legislation.",
