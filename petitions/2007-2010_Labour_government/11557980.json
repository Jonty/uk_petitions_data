        "background": "Arriva Cross Country was handed the UK's longest distance franchise on the 11\u2019Th of November 2007. Since then, they have done nothing to improve the services, with nearly all there services running late or not at all, the Voyager Fleet is in dyer need of extra coaches, The Onboard Shop really needs to be retained - and not to be replaced with a measly Trolley Service, They have changed the timetables and have made cut backs all over the network and most of all, THEY ARE THE MOST OVERPRICED Train Operating Company IN THE UK\n\nRecently AXC have put up the fares by a whole 11% - on top of the previous High Prices. And all US Passengers Get in return is a pathetic service where you rarely get a seat or Food.\n\nThe only investment AXC has done is to bring back HST sets - set in the franchise plan by the DFT - and to refurbish there 170's.\n \n\nThis petition is to Ask the Goverment to look into the AXC Franchise and either pose heavy Sanctions on them, Or to Re-tender the franchise, and give the passenger a more comfortable and Cheaper ride on Long Distance intercity services.",
