This will help business by aligned us with our European colleagues, and with the extended light evenings in the Summer give all our Tourist and Outdoor Event places a huge boost.\n\nMaybe best of all will be the uplift to the people living here in our country.\n\nYou may wish to consider letting Scotland decide separately whether they wish to follow our lead.\n\nSee the RSPOA website for details on the life saving and safety aspects.",
