            "background": "The Chief Constable of North Wales Police should be sacked from his position becuase of his comments about 'legalising class A drugs' on the 15/October/2007.\nThis statement that the police are loosing the battle against drugs and it would be easier to legalise them makes the law abiding citizens of the UK ask 'what do we pay for a police force for ?'.\nMr Brunstrom would rather his force go after the easy target (the motorist), rather than do the real police work that the public in general want from his force.\nThis man even goes against the ACPO at every turn. Why should the people of North Wales pay this mans wages ?\nThe home office or whoever are his superiors should dismis this man ASAP.\nMr Brunstrom is harming the general publics oppinion of the British Police Force.",
