            "background": "As a mobile phone user, I am astounded at the waste created by mobile phone companies because they do not have standardised batteries or chargers for their equipment. Phones are expensive and yet it is cheaper to throw a phone away when a battery fails. Retailers have encouraged me to buy a new phone rather than search out a battery for an old phone that still works well! Further to this is the requirement to use a new charger that fits only this new model phone. This churning of electrical components is creating ecological waste that is expensive, harmful to the environment and could easily be avoided.",
