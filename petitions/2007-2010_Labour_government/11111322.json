            "background": "The Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) system is a complete and utter mess and it is about time something was done about it!\nStudents have been waiting too long and rather than debating in parliament about the most ridiculous things such as reality television, it is time to get a grip and sort this system out once and for all - Looking into how the EMA is run and how the contracts are gained for the companies responsible.\nMost students are long overdue payment and it's obvious that the company and the department cannot cope and it is time for an investigation into where our money is.\n\nThe E.M.A. is supposed to encourage students to stay on to higher education but it is doing the entire opposite, if students cannot claim their bonus nor afford the books required.\n\nSo we ask you, Mr Gordon Brown, to look into this matter as this has gone beyond a complete joke.\n\nPlease sign this petition, if you are a student or parent with experience with or claim from the E.M.A., or you support this pledge.",
