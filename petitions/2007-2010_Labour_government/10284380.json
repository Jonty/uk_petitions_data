            "background": "At present the benefits section does not take into account single people who do not have children or dependants.\n\nSingle people have the same overheads to live as those that are married.\n\nSingle people who are long term sick are not eligible for extra benefits.\n\nIn the current climate of high food and fuel costs, single people without children will suffer the indignity of not being able to heat their homes and feed themselves. They will have to choose between heating or eating.\n\nThis petition is to bring this to the attention of the Prime Minister, in the hope that some kind of benefit can be put in place for single childless people.\n\nAt present a single person who cannot work due to long term illness has to survive on just over \u00a32,000 per year. The poverty line is \u00a315,000 per year.\n\nIf you are also in the same position, and cannot survive on your benefits, please take the time to sign this petition, in the hope that the Government will adjust benefits to take into consideration those of us who cannot survive on \u00a360 a week.",
