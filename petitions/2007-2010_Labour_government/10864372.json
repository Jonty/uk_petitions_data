            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As there is no current legislation to prevent mobility companies charging what they like for mobility equipment, many disabled people struggle to fund the equipment themselves.  What companies charge seems excessive.  For example, I need some Alber e-fix wheel to turn my manual chair in to a powered chair.  They cost 4,500! There are the same as normal wheelchair wheels, but with batteries and a joystick, so why are they so incredibly expensive?  In my opinion, it is because there is a huge demand for mobility products, meaning that companies can make huge profits!  Many other vital products, which in some cases could improve independence, are excessively expensive... wheelchair accessible vehicles, are another example.  I feel that the Government should draft a bill to prevent excessive charging.  Unless you have compensation money and you are a millionaire, how are you supposed to afford equipment that you need and could potentially change your life?",
