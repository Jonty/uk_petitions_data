        "background": "The amount of financial resources which aim to support paedophiles (intensive therapy, cognitive behaviour programmes, cost of imprisonment, aftercare etc) far exceeds the financial input towards the care and support of childhood abuse survivors. This is both unfair and irrational, for if money was spent on aiding the victims of abuse then there would be less subsequent need for support from services such as drug / alcohol, mental health and adult social services.",
