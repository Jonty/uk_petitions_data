            "background": "We should be allowed to know where paedophiles live and to see pictures/photos so that we can keep our children away from them. \n\nAs a mother myself I'm petrified of someone harming my son and I'm dreading the day when he wants to play outside with his friends because you never know who's watching them.\n\nMy partner will not let him go to play school when he is a older as hes scared that someone will be watching him in the playground when we are not there to protect and care for him. The magic and freedom of childhood seems to be disappearing.\n\nAlso we should know where other sex offenders are to help protect our older children, teenagers and every one else whichever age or gender so that we can reduce the risk and the danger of experiencing abuse and/or attack from anyone.\n\nPlease sign the petition if you believe that we should be able to veiw pictures and details of dangerous people so that our children and everyone else are more safer in this cruel world.\n\nAmericas taken this step so why aren't we????",
