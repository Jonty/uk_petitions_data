Now today (11/9/8) you have announced a fuel bill which will save low income families money with the offer of insulation and more energy saving gimmicks, which amount to vote grabbing from a dead man walking.\nDo you not realise that the tax payer will pay for this as the energy cartels will ahve to increase pricing due to you asking them for 'assistance'.\nThe UK tax payer has had enough of years of Labour inepitude.\n\nEnough is enough. More and more people want to quit this CCTV'd, over taxed hell hole and more and more are going to benefits as it pays more.\n\nResign now and call an election.",
