        "background": "We in Bradford cannot find jobs. There are tens of thousands of Bradfordians unemployed, yet regeneration of our city is being built by Rumanians. WHY - when there could be hundreds of jobs created for our people and these people can come off the dole and do something constructive instead of sitting at home doing nothing when they could be proud of regenerating our city. Please I emplore you to intervene. There should be less people unemployed.\nAlso we want our people to be trained to build the windfarms in our country. Please if we are to get unemployment down in our country, then we create new jobs and training for the unemployed of all ages to do the jobs that are being created. It really is not that difficult to figure out how to shorten the unemployment numbers and make the people feel good about themselves and not end up committing crimes because they have nothing better to do. Finally draft our criminals to the frontline in Afghanistan, thus reducing the people entering our prison system.",
