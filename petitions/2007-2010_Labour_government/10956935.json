            "background": "It is very unfair that many people willing to attend a music festival or concert will have to pay over the odds. Most tickets sold from the distributer go straight onto eBay at hiked up prices and people who genuinely want to go can't afford to compete with some of the bids. The sale of football tickets is prohibited on eBay; it's time that concert tickets were too.\nToo many people are making a living out of this practice, and in these difficult times hardworking individuals should not be forced to pay more than they have to, to attend a concert.",
