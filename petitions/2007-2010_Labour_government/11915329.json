            "background": "The HFEA have brought into effect starting from January 2009 that every clinic offering IVF must reduce their statistics from 25% of multiple births to below 10% by 2012.\n\nTo do this clinics are giving the majority of their patients only one embryo transfer instead of the usual two which in turn is decreasing the average success rate by over a quarter.\n\nIf the HFEA are to enforce this policy they must first have every PCT give the recommended 3 cycles of IVF available on the NHS. NICE guidelines state three cycles should be made available for the 'SET' plan to work.\n\nI believe the issue is going to be about compensating for the reduced success rate by giving people the number of cycles that Nice recommends, which is not currently happening.\"",
