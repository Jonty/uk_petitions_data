        "background": "Do you remember to hilarious, good old days when children's television was a riot of fun? I for one certainly do. Back in 2002, a revelation in comedy hit the TV screens. \n\nThe well known Dick and Dom in da Bungalow spread through Britain in a hurricane of humor and spontaneous laughter. It brightened the dull Saturday mornings of bored youths,  and in some cases, adults too! Adapting to many audiences, I saw no reason as to why the show was taken off the screens. The reason I write to you is that so much trash has been aired on the BBC in the mornings, the British public as a result are becoming worse in day to day routines, like consuming breakfast for example. Without tummy tickling fun to stimulate brain functions, where will we be in, say, twenty years time? \n\nWe, the British public need to laugh. What better way to do it than broadcasting the hilarity of Dick and Dom again?",
