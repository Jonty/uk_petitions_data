            "background": "Meredydd Hughes, former ACPO Head of Road Policing Business Area, was last year banned from driving for reaching 90mph in a 60mph zone, his third speeding offence. As the case emerged, ACPO announced he was to step down from his road policing duties. However, he effectively continues to perform the same duties as Head of Business Area for Uniformed Operations including Road Policing. A three-time convicted speeder with responsibility for road policing at this level undermines any Government road safety message with regard to speeding. All possible pressure should therefore be placed on ACPO to relieve Mr Hughes of all road policing duties.",
