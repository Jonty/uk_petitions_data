        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Over the last few years the age for cervical smear tests has increased from 20 to 25, I personally know several women between 20 and 25 who have had 'abnormal' results when tested before the age went up. Women are routinely invited to have regular cervical screening tests. The tests are done to prevent cervical cancer (and not to diagnose cancer as some people wrongly think). During each test some cells are scaped from the cervix. The cells are looked at under a microscope. In most cases the cells look normal. Abnormal 'pre-cancerous' cells are found in some cases. If necessary, these cells can be treated before they turn to cancer. We need to bring the age back down to 20 to help detect any abnormalities in the cervix.",
