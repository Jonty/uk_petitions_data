            "background": "The new Animal welfare Act has sadly failed to reduce or control the increasing numbers of pets that are dumped and abandoned. We have become a throw away society with animals increasingly becoming objects of cruelty and abandonment. The credit crunch has become the ideal excuse to discard peoples` unwanted pets but in reality has little to no truth as cutting down on a few small personal luxuries would easily cover any increased pet bills.\nTraceability and accountability are key in addressing the increased abuse of our beloved animals and with charities facing a bleak financial future the outlook for abandoned animals is very grim.\nSimply licence and register ALL dog / cat owners to help reduce impulse purchases and ease in which these animals can be tossed aside.",
