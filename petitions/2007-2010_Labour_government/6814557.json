            "background": "Currently the national speed limit is 70mph on all motorways, but this the limit is sometimes to slow and also, at times, too fast. Each road needs to be individually assessed so that the speed limit given to it actually matches what the possibilities are. For example a dangerous road with a speed limit of 70mph could have its speed reduced to 60mph, whilst a very safe road with a limit of 70mph could have its limit increased to 80mph. This would save lives and boost the economy at the same time.",
