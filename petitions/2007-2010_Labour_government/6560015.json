        "background": "I urge the Prime Minister to review the age limit for buying alcohol. So many young adults are binge drinking at so called \"house parties\" etc. This in my opinion is due to the demand that is present for an outlet to socialise, such as in bars and clubs. With an ever maturing young population, lowering the age restiction would simply promote sensible sociallising and rid so many alcohol related problems with regards to parties (alcohol related 999 calls) and even teenagers in the park (Anti-social behaviour). However this petition does not include off-licenses. I feel the restriction should remain in such places to keep bulk consumption down.",
