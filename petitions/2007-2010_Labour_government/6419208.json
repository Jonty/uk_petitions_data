            "background": "I have recently noticed the fact that our country seems to be sliding into an intellectual black hole where the majority of the population seems to be virtually uneducated. I would hate to guess what the average IQ in the UK is nowadays, but I fear it may be well below 100. What has happened to real education and progress? In a modern society with excellent learning facilities and resources, why is it that meeting with a truly intelligent and interesting person is such a rare occurrence?",
