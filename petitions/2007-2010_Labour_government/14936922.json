            "background": "Mr and Mrs Chandler were sailing on their British registered yacht in international waters. Under the UK Merchant Shipping Act (Registration of Ships) they are entitled to the protection of the Royal Navy. They were taken forcibly captive and have been held to ransom for many months now. We feel it is deplorable that, as bonafide UK citizens, we have abandoned them. It is a sad indictment on the state of affairs in our small nation that we can no longer offer protection to UK citizens.\nIt is telling that the Somalian population living within the UK are more active in trying to secure their release.\nWe would urge the Prime minster and his government to act to secure their release using any means necessary.\nWith regards\nThe Vardy family",
