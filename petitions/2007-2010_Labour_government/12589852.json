            "background": "It is my opinion that the government should use spare athletes and officials accomodation after the 2012 olympic games for M.P's who need a second base in London.These tax payer funded apartments will already be furnished and are grouped together so it would be a saving on security too.This will save a great deal of taxpayers cash and stop the \"snout in the trough\" culture that we see today,Call it a free hotel and no expenses needed, the tax payer only need pay for upkeep.",
