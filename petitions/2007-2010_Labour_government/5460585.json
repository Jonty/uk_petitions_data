            "background": "Today we live in a world of fear from terrorism. Much of this is because of problems with education and integration.\n\nThere are no parties that place campaigning for the gap to be bridged between different cultures at the top of their manifesto.We need tough but suitable measures to limit terrorism but so far there has been little progress in stopping this horrible activity.\n\nWe need a party that can campaign for not only unity but safety in Great Britain, one that firmly puts the public first and not one that is more bothered about how it looks in the public eye.\n\nWe need a party that is not unwanted in society and one that is totally seperate from parties such as the BNP and the NF who have no future in this country, we want an honest party that will not have thugs who are more interested in a fight than stopping these deep rooted problems in our society.\n\nPlease sign this petition to help create a party that can solve problems in terms of integration and terrorism in our country",
