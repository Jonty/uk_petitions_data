        "background": "MANY ZIMBABWEANS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM BEING HONEST HARD WORKING RESIDENTS OF THIS COUNTRY AND GIVEN THE SAME STATUS AS THE REAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO COME IN BY MEANS OF THE SHIPS AND TRUCKS THAT COME THROUGH DOVER AND SUCH \nPORTS.\n\nWHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS THAT WHILE THE ZIMBABWEANS ARE HERE, GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO WORK. LET THEM BE A CONSTRUCTIVE PART OF YOUR SOCIETY. DOES IT HURT MORE TO STOP ABLE BODIED PEOPLE FROM WORKING THAN TO HAVE PEOPLE DESTITUTE AND ASKING FOR BENEFITS. IF YOUR PLAN IS TO SEND FAILED ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM ZIMBABWE BACK, LET IT BE BUT WHILE THEY ARE HERE, BEFORE YOU SEND THEM BACK, GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO WORK AND FEND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THEY WILL BE RETURNING TO A COUNTRY WHICH IS DESTITUTE, WHY START THEIR DESTITUTION NOW BEFORE THEY LEAVE. PEOPLE WITH MEANS TO REBUILD THEIR COUNTRY WHEN THEY RETURN.\n\n YOU ARE A HUMANITARIAN NATION AND THAT WE THANK YOU FOR, BUT SHOW YOUR HUMANITARIANISM WITHIN YOUR OWN BORDERS TOO.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR LISTEN.\n\nFROM ONE ZIMBABWEAN ON BEHALF OF MANY OTHERS.",
