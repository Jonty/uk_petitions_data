            "background": "The Government is implementing plans to allocate CSA and other debts of its citizens to private collection firms like Intrum Justica.\nThis is in blatant disregard of the Data Protection Act.\nDebt Collection Firms are also widely condemned for the disregard for the legal rule that bind them. They are threatening, abusive and in most cases, have no records of any debt an individual may or may not owe, whilst at the same time having little regard for this.\nIf this is not halted now, many families, individuals etc are about to be put under enormous and persistent pressure by being forced into paying debts at exhorbitant rates, and quite possibly to pay debts that do not belong to them.",
