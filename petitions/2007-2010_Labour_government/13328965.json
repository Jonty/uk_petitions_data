            "background": "This legislation means that, in order to for instance drive your kids & other local kids to football training on behalf of the club, you will need to be investigated & registered.\n\nIt's yet another big-govt infringement of civil liberties; an unnecessary intrusion of the state into our affairs; an expensive and pointless exercise which will do virtually nothing to protect children, but will deter volunteers. A state-appointed and state-funded commission will determine who is and is not suitable to look after your kids - why is this responsibility being delegated away from parents themselves? Also a total waste of money given our nation's financial state - abandon it now.",
