            "background": "Although parental responsibility prevents a childs name from being changed unless all parents agree or if a court order is in place in practice if a parent registers a child at school under one name and the school fails to check for themselves that all parents have agreed to this (the non-resident parent being carefully kept in the dark until they inadvertently find out after the change has been made) then schools do not have to revert back to the original name until presented with a court order or letter of agreement from both parents. This is unfair and costly to the non-resident parent who is already suffering alienation from their child by their ex-partner for no good reason.\nThere should be a policy in place for all schools where if a child is registered under any name other than that on their birth certificate the school should take reasonable action themselves to make contact with all people with parental responsibility to ensure there is agreement before using any other name on the records or as a \"known as\" name.",
