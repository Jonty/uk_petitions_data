            "background": "We all know about fuel prices and are fed up but why on earth has the government not taken this idea up which arose in Brazil years ago???? We still need cars and vans to transport heavy material and cannot dispose of them completely, electric cars are not going to work unless you have money, who is honestly going to swap their current car for a more costly one on top of our fuel prices and public transport is not very attractive with buses crowded with loud, rude, abusive youths and cyclists getting knocked down day in day out when just trying to do their bit and again theres the price factor!!!!Sugar cane fueled cars is a cheap and easy method of lowering fuel prices and attaining a more environmentally friendly Britain!",
