Both parents would be recognised as contributing equally to a childs upbringing and would be given equal rights and responsibilities. A legally binding Parental agreement would set out in detail all matters regarding finance, access, residency, care, etc (much like a contract) and would reduce the burden on the Courts in dealing with disputes.",
