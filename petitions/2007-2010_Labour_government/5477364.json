            "background": "I would like for the current Government to give increased consideration for greater availability of counselling services to individuals within the NHS. I feel that this is important to enable more patients to recieve help with underlying problems, which cannot simply be achieved purely on a medical model as presented in GP surgeries. I feel that it is important that clients have greater access to services within their own community and would like to see this as a legislated practice.",
