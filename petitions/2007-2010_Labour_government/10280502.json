            "background": "Upcoming changes to Road Tax in 2009 and 2010 penalise those on low incomes and is being applied retrospectively to everyone who has bought a car registered since 2001. \n\nFrom 2010 if your car emits more than 225g/km CO2, you will have the choice of selling your car (if you can - the tax changes have made many cars unsellable) or paying up to \u00a3455 EVERY YEAR in road tax.\n\nA majority of people see the sense in car tax being tied to car emissions: it encourages car makers to design and build low emission cars and will reduce CO2. But it should be applied to new cars as an incentive to change. As it stands ordinary families will be punished for owning a car that they could have bought as long ago as 2001 - long before green issues became the big issue that they are today.\n\nMany families will be substantially worse off as a result of tax band changes.\n\nTo make matters worse, the system is overly complex and the worst polluters aren't punished enough. There are to be 13 bands (A-K) covering emissions up to 255g/km, but nothing after 255g/km.",
