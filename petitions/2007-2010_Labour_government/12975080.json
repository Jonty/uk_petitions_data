Things have not changed people are still being hurt intimidated and abused.  Tsvangirai cannot do much, he is tied to Mugabe who will not allow democracy to take hold, he is only playing for time.  This is a charade and cannot work, it is time we all took more affirmative and long lasting action.\nYour Government is responsible for what has happened in Zimbabwe, it is time you stepped up to the plate and took responsibility.",
