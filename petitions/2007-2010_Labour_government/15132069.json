        "background": "The Government advertised both on their You-gov web site and in leaflets supplied to persons considering deferring their state pensions, many workers took up that offer with the promise that their pensions would increase by 10.4% for each year they put off receiving the pension.\n\nThe Government also clearly stated that the annual increased pension would be for the total amount including the deferred increase.\n\nThe Government have now mis-sold that scheme and betrayed pensioners in an attempt to booster the Treasury's dwindling finances.\n\nIt is not socially acceptable to steal money promised to people that have deferred their already most vulnerable in society.\n\nThe Government have pulled the wool the wool over people's eyes raising millions of pensioners hopes and then dashing them again.\n\nA wicked  deceitful and appalling action to take against people that have entered the agreement saving the government from paying their pensions for extra years.",
