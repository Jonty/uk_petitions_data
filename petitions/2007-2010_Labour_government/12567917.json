            "background": "Joanna was awarded an OBE in 1995.\n\nShe is the public face of a campaign to provide all Gurkha veterans who served in the British Army before 1997 the right to settle in Britain. They have served Britain for more than 200 years with over 50,000 dying in service, and 13 have been awarded the Victoria Cross. On 24 April she stated that she was \"ashamed\" of the UK administration's decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas' right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009 a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed.\n\nYesterday on the 8th of May the actress and Phil Woolas (immigration minister) came face-to-face in highly-charged scenes at the BBC's Westminster office and then held an impromptu press conference nearby. It followed the rejection of appeals by five Gurkhas for residency, rulings which Ms Lumley said were \"shocking\".\n\nWe, the undersigned, feel compelled to commend Joanna\u2019s selfless dedication and to voice our strongly held belief to Gordon Brown that \u2018those who are prepared to die for our country should be granted the right to reside in our country\u2019.",
