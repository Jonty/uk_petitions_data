        "background": "An appalling number of vehicle accidents happen in car parks, often caused by vehicles driving too fast. As well as the damage caused to vehicles, there is a substantial risk of injury to pedestrians, children included, leaving or returning to their vehicles. Speed reduction methods such as speed humps in public car parks would help to remedy this problem.",
