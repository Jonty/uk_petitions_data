(Despite it being their responsibility) Quite simply this in not enforceable - an exchange cannot be lawfully refused on the grounds of refusal to make this payment, and therefore it should be clear that the charge is voluntary.\n\nExcessive charges are resulting in many tenants being unable to exercise thier right to exchange, and continuing to occupy unsuitable housing.",
