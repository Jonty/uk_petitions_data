            "background": "This money was effectively stolen from the research council's budget in order to bail MG-Rover out of their financial obligations to British Nuclear Fuels. In the process a 1000 research jobs have disappeared from British Academic Institutions. This is an outrageous crime and cannot be justified in any way. This government should be ashamed at further undermining the incredibly high quality of research that is currently conducted with government funding.",
