            "background": "We encounter them almost every day of our lives - retailers, health service workers, hotel & restaurant waiting staff, even emergency services.  And yet the abuse of these groups of people continues!  Having worked both in Retail and in the Health Service I have experienced first hand the levels of abuse people in the service industry receive.  I ask you, is it right to allow these people to have to face others swearing at them, insulting their religion or intelligence, or being violent?  The very same people who carry out these acts would be appalled at the same happening to them yet they do it, and get away with it on a regular basis!  This has to stop!  Why have we lost all sense of respect for our fellow man?",
