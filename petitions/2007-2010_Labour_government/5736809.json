            "background": "Part of being a safe and competent rider is to be able to maintain your machine to a standard that it is safe to ride on the road.There are many motorcycle riding schools throughout the country, but there is little provision in the way of getting hands on experience with basic mechanics and maintenance.Surely, if not only to make the roads safer, there should be some provision for motorcyclists to gain a degree of proficiency in basic maintenance of their machines, available through colleges of further education if newly qualified riders don't feel confident enough to do this themselves. The courses should be affordable.They should be aimed at riders who have no mechanical knowledge,realistic in their content (ie basic maintenance, not requiring full garage facilities).",
