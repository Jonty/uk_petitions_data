            "background": "Raymond Bingham (aka DJ Grooverider) has been jailed for 4 years in Dubai after being caught with a small amount of hashish (2.16 Grams).\n\nThe RADIO 1 DJ was found guilty of illegally bringing in & possessing marijuana. He was arrested at Dubai Airport on November 23 last year after traveling to Dubai to play a set. \n\nThe DJ had previously told the court that he did not know he had the drugs on him and that he had no intention of bringing them to Dubai.\n\nAlthough ignorance is never a defense, this sentence is disproportionate to the offense committed. \n\nOther \"high profile\" drug offenders in the UAE have received the Kings Pardon & have been deported. US R&B star Dallas Austin was sentenced to 4 years after being caught with a gram of cocaine & ecstasy in July 2007. He claimed the drugs had been planted, but was pardoned immediately when convicted, following intensive lobbying by US senators and pop stars.\n\nWe would like the Prime Minister to assert diplomatic pressure on the UAE for the release of Raymond Bingham.",
