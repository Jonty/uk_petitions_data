            "background": "Manufacturers who sell products should state the typical 'expected' life of a product (average value for the majority of items sold,based on the item not being abused/mistreated etc.)\n\nMany manufacturers are selling products, that fail to operate after a unreasonable amount of time, certainly before its 'consumer' expected lifespan has ended.\n\n\nIf people purchase a high value item, then they should expect it to last a 'reasonable amount of time' and often \nproducts start failing in large numbers with the same faults.\n\nManufacturers should state that a product is expected to last x number of years, and if a large number of products  start failing before that time is reached they should be held liable for repair/replacement costs.\n\nYou dont buy a car expecting a large proportion of that model sold to fail in serious manner within say 3 /4 years - so why can manufacturers of laptops, flat screen monitors etc,get away with selling items that have design/manufacturing problems that cause premature failure.\nThe public have the right to know if a manufacturer has made a product they expect to last, or one that is short term use only.",
