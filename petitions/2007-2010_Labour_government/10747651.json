            "background": "The evidence is that compulsory helmet wearing for cyclists has an overall negative effect on the health of the nation. \n\nAccording to the BMJ (2000;321:1582-1585 ( 23 December )), \"The health benefits of cycling are so great---and the health injuries from driving so great - that not cycling is really dangerous. By telling people that they need helmets for an activity that for a century has been regarded as \"safe\"---and in fact has a fine safety record - you inevitably engender the impression that cycling must have become more dangerous than driving and walking.\"\n\nTo make cycling safer, we need to do two things:\n1. Treat cyclists as drivers of vehicles, and encourage them to act like they're part of the traffic.\n2. Promote cycling. There really is safety in numbers! More cyclists on the roads make drivers more aware of them, which in turn reduces the likelihood of collisions.\n\nIf people want to wear helmets, fine. Please, just don\u2019t make it mandatory.",
