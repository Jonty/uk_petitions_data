        "background": "Proton therapy is deemed more effective than current radiotherapy because it only targets cancer cells and does not damage healthy tissue surrounding the tumour.\n\nThe only machine in Britain that delivers the therapy is a low-energy variety used to treat eye cancers. It is not powerful enough to be used on other cancers.\n\nThe NHS estimates that creating a fully-equipped proton therapy centre in Britain would cost between \u00a350-100m.\n\nCurrently the only provision for this treatment is to travel to the US. Costing anything from \u00a3100,000 upwards per treatment cycle.",
