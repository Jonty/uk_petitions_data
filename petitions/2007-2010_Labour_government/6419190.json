Surely it is only fair that schoolchildren around Britain, including England, should leearn at the least some simple Welsh and Gaelic; some of the mixed feelings between Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are down to the fact that we don't understand each other's heritage, culture and identity enough, and language plays an important part in this.",
