        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Advertising products & services must not mislead the public. Increasingly we are being exposed to advertising which uses small print to validate misleading imagery/audio.\n\nThis affects a variety of industries, and is typified by recent cosmetic advertising for mascara. For example an advertiser shows a model using false lashes to demonstrate a volume or length increase. Misleading the viewer into believing the effects are more significant than they are.\n\nThe use of small print on the screen is unacceptable for a many of reasons including discrimination against:\nNon readers who may not be able to understand the small print\nSight impaired viewers who may hear descriptions and may not be able to read the shown small print\n\nThe only reason for this practice is to take advantage of impressionable viewers who may not read small print and will therefore believe that the visual/audio is accurate. This is exploitation and must not be tolerated. Appropriate restrictions & penalties must be put in place.",
