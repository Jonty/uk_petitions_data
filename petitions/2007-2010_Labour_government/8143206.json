This could consist of a trial period (similar to that adopted 1968 to 1971) and could take the form of a move to year round BST, or a 1 hour shift to GMT+1/GMT+2.  Research shows that such a move could reduce carbon dioxide emissions, reduce road deaths, facilitate business with Europe, potentially boost tourism, increase outdoor activity, promote healthier lifestyles and enhance the well being of UK citizens.",

        "background": "This petition seeks to rally public support behind a change of this nature.  Recent research by Cambridge University has estimated the cost of the current system to be 4 million MW-Hrs and 1.7 Million tons of CO2 over the last decade.  On road accidents, ROSPA show that the move would lead to around 450 fewer deaths and serious injuries a year, including between 104 and 138 fewer deaths.  There are many outdoor activities that are restricted by our dark evenings, from playing sport to family outings; this change would lead to a more active and healthier society.  There is a feeling that BST is British time, and that the annual adjustment back to GMT, making our post-summer evenings even darker, is without fully justified logic.  Overall, we are seeking to make better use of the limited daylight we receive.",
