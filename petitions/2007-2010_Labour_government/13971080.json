            "background": "Is the government being honest and fair to the disabled in leaving us with the uncertainty about withdrawing DLA from recipients who are receiving it indefinitely? If so then thousands and thousands of severely disabled people will be isolated in their homes and more pressure will be put on Social Services as these elderly people would end up in nursing homes. I thought the government stance was that elderly people should remain living independently in their own homes?",
