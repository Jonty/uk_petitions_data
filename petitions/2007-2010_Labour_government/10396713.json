            "background": "For a number of years children have had rights appointed to them which allows them to wander unsupervised causing distress to law abiding citizens.Parents do not appear to be aware that their offspring are involved in anti social activities, or indeed they dont care.\nI propose that unsupervised children under 16 should be under a curfew ensuring that they are indoors by 8.30pm.\nChildren 16-18 10pm.\nYoung persons upto 21 with a previous history of behaviour which is anti social should have the same curfew as under 16's i.e. 8.30pm.\nAny parent/guardian of a child who contravenes this should have punitive measures against them to encourage responsible parenting.",
