            "background": "I received notice from Atlantic Gas and Electricity that they are increasing their prices by 29% and 19% respectively. These increases are backdated to August 2008 (it is now October 17th). Having spoken to Ofgem, they have advised that an old law allows them up to 60 days to back date price increases. Apart from the fact that our own Prime Minister has called for reduction in utility prices just this morning in the media because of greatly reduced wholesale prices (or he will allegedly intervene), this archaic law means that utility companies can massively profit without justification or need. This practice must be stopped immediately, and regulations put in to place to ensure that users are notified in advance so they can make an informed decision. It appears that utility companies use the 60 day rule to increase their profit to cushion the exodus of customers migrating to another company when they spring a price increase.",
