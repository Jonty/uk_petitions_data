            "background": "In the current financial climate we believe that the banks should be forced to stop charging customers for going overdrawn and missing direct debit payments. The fact that public funds are being used to keep the banks going should allow the government to stop such charges. This will help the thousands of people who are now struggling to make ends meet and stop people from being unfairly punished.",
