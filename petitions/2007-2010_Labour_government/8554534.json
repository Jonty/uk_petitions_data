        "background": "In reference to the Mosquito device that has recently been discussed in the news.\nIt is targeting anyone with good hearing from newborn babies, teenagers & adults\n\nThe claims by the inventor and retailers that \"The Mosquito is essentially a sounder unit that emits a very high (ultra-sonic) tone that is completely harmless even with long term use\" is a complete lie.  Long term exposure to any high decibel sound destroys the ability to hear at that frequency\n\nI submit that:\n\nFirstly it will damage people's hearing at that frequency range no matter what age they are.\n\nSecondly it is a sonic weapon (not ultra-sonic as the inventor claims) and should not be allowed within the UK\n\nThirdly it is damaging to the environment.\n\nFourthly it will be useless as people will go deaf to it.\n\nThankyou for reading this, please sign this petition if you care about our country at all, our children are our future after all, or if you are affected by this.\n\nSuch abuse of our own population should be banned",
