If the electorate is given the power of recall, then anyone who is seen to be behaving in an improper way can be removed. The most open way to do this would be - once misconduct while in office has been identified - to have a set number of signatures that needs to be reached by petitioners in order to spark a recall election.\n\nThe Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will only serve to make British politics more expensive and less democratic.",
