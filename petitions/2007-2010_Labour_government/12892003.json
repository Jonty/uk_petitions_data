        "background": "The only independent body that should oversee MPs' behaviour and expenses is the British electorate.\n\nFull transparency is the only way of showing that MPs are behaving in a proper way and only making claims for expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties. If the electorate is given the power of recall, then anyone who is seen to be behaving in an improper way can be removed. The most open way to do this would be - once misconduct while in office has been identified - to have a set number of signatures that needs to be reached by petitioners in order to spark a recall election.\n\nThe Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will only serve to make British politics more expensive and less democratic.",
