            "background": "Late night licences can be tolerated in city centres,urban areas or out of town premises. Late night drinking in quiet residential areas and small villages is badly affecting communities where there are families with young children, elderly and people who want a good night's sleep! Crowds of noisy drinkers in a village street till 2am night after night is intolerable. It upsets the young, frightens the old and exhausts those of us who have to work. \nLate night licences should only be granted to premises where this would not have an adverse effect on the welfare of the community.",
