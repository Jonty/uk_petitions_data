They are targeting all the sports clubs\n     that saved up and built a clubhouse on their grounds, and then\n     through some clause in the landlord/tenants act, they claim the\n     right to charge a huge rent on the clubhouse. This puts so much\n     finantial strain on the clubs, they are forced to close down.\n     We need to club together to stop this, it is already too late\n     for several bowling clubs in Harrow; it could be your clubs\n     next!",
