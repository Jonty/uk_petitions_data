Another point is, of course, that some people don't hold bank accounts; where does this policy leave them? (And they tend to be the poorer members of society who can least afford these fees).  \n\nI pay these bills by cash and yet I am charged \u00a35 a month for this; surely it can't cost the company anything like that much to process these payments.  Why should I, and everyone else, have to pay these excessive charges just because we choose (in what is supposed to be a free country) not to pay by direct debit?",
