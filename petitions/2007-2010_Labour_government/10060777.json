            "background": "Ensure joint working between all agencies dealing with child abuse and animal abuse.\n All studies firmly reveal that those who abuse animals,are more likely to abuse children,than are non-animal abusers .\nThese abuses are a part of the same psychology.\n We request,that it be mandatory that information be shared between the agencies dealing with animal and child abuse.\nGovernment must provide full funding for these agencies,to carry out this work.\n Also create legislation which directs the police towards automatic investigation of child abuse,when animal abuse is discovered,and vice versa.\n This will prevent many more cases of abuse.",
