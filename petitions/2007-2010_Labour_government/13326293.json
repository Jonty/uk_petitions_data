            "background": "Thousands of Beagle dogs and puppies are used in laboratory experiments and tests in the U.K. each year, often being poisoned and gassed. Given the government Animal Procedures report back in 1990 that replacements to animals are more accurate and more efficient we the undersigned ask for   urgent new legislation to ban all experiments and testing on dogs (and cats). We the undersigned believe experiments and testing on dogs and cats are medieval, outmoded, inhumane, unethical, and unecessary.  Not in our name!",
