            "background": "The Governmental department of the child support agency ensures that a non-resident parent contributes finacially towards the upkeep of their child(ren). There are set payment plans and amounts in place in accordance to the income of the non-resident parent.  However if a childs parent or parents have been murdered there is no financial security no child support thus resulting in more than likely that a child(ren) will be living in child poverty which is against the governments agenda.  Is the government willing to take on the role of provider to take these children out of poverty and give a fair set amount of financial assistance to the carers, adoptees of these children, in which most cases the carers adoptees are grandparents.  or do the carers of these children (who only get financial assistance if they are under the care of social services thus living with undue stress) have to continually live in poverty under the current rules and regulations.  I am asking this government to provide extra financial assistance to the carers adoptees of these children.",
