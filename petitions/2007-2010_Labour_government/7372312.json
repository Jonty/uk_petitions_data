            "background": "Voting in a General Election should be made mandatory for all eligible UK citizens, just like it is in Australian elections. This is to ensure every person in the United Kingdom makes their voice heard. The penalty for not voting would be a fixed-penalty fine, otherwise to be determined by the final legislation. There should be no excuse for not voting or registering to vote, especially since the introduction of postal voting and possible introduction  in the future of secure on-line voting. If the change is a success, it could also be extended to other local & council elections.",
