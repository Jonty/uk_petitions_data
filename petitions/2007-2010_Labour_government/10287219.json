I and my family have to pay for our prescriptions.\n\nOther people who live in Scotland and Wales do not pay for theirs or hospital parking. This is discrimination against subjects of the British Isles who live in England and it must stop with immediate affect.\n\nI write this complaint to try to address the issue internally. I have also copied it to my MP Andrew Turner. I will if necessary seek court opinion.\n\nThank You\n\nMark Smout. Dip He (Ad Nsg) (Open)",
