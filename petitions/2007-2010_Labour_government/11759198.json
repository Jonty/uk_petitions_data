        "background": "I'd like AIM (alternative investment market) stocks to be able to be included in ISAs. This would help smaller companies grow and gain access to funding more easily if people could invest in them tax efficiently. Not all of us have enough funds to invest in EIS schemes. Granted AIM stock carry a greater risk than main market stocks, but this should should be our choice. Why can we not support some of the smaller British companies that may (or may not) make it big one day? If we're going to get out of this recession we need to promote these 'green shoots', and including AIM shares in ISAs is one sure way to promote growth.",
