            "background": "A decade of debt will now follow the decade of decadence. Labour and Gordon Brown have long proclaimed to be the party of prudence and the Prime Minister, regularly taunted the Conservatives as the party of boom and bust. \nWhen Labour came to power in 1997 public debt stood at \u00a3350 billion. That figure now stands at \u00a3700 billion and Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling have announced plans in their budget to double the level of public debt to \u00a31.7 trillion. \n\nOur beloved country is in debt, the economy is a mess, unemployment is rife and rising and we're in a deep recession. The government are more concerned with arguing with the opposition and coming up with smear campaigns in the run up to a General Election in 2010. \n\nI therefore call on each and every single British citizen to petition the government to call a General Election.",
