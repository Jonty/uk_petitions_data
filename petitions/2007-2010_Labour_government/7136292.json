        "background": "This is mainly in responce to the recent and on going crisis at Atherstone On Stour, Warwickshire.\nThree Firefighters have been missing for days now... one man was found tuesday morning and as im writing this, i have heared that a second body has been found.\nIssuing Firefighters with Tracking devices/tags Will help the search and rescue teams find these people alot sooner! The rescue teams nearly always put their own lives at risk when carrying out these searches. Picking up a tracker signal will tell the search and rescue exactly where these people are, and from that they can determine if there are any risks surrounding them.\nIm not saying the tracker will help to save a firefighters life, but it would certainly help towards the finding of them in such a tradgic occurance.",
