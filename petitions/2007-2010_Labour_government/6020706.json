            "background": "The Chinese regime is one which should be eliminated, not appeased. We the undersigned petition you to cease British-Chinese diplomatic relations and declare an embargo on the Chinese, because not only their regime is murdering its own subjects but also helping the SUDANESE regime murder Darfurians. Such regime (Chinese) should be diplomatically and economically isolated. If you do not comply with this petition within the next year, I will bring a lawsuit against you to British courts, or even the World Court of Law in the Hague, where you will be tried as an appeaser of a totalitarian dictator, because the blood of Darfurians will be on your hands. This is not a joke. You have been warned.",
