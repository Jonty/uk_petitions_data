            "background": "At present, weight for weight a coach is allowed to go 10kmh faster than a lorry on a motorway. For example, on a motorway a  17ton coach with 56 school kids onboard is restricted to 100kmh (62MPH) and a 17ton lorry full of eggs can do 90kmh (56MPH).  On single lane roads, the coach can do 10MPH more, ie the lorry 40MPH and the Coach 50 MPH. This is total lunacy, if speed kills then why? \n Either admit that the HGV speed limit is outdated and move it to the same as coaches or bring the coaches down and stop the hypocrisy.",
