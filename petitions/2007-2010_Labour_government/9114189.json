Ideally any non-British player would be excluded but due to EU regulations we can not refuse entry to our European counterparts, but we can refuse entry to many of the players from outwith Europe who are flooding our national game and restricting the progress of our local talent. Whether they be South American, African or from wherever, we demand that, even if the top teams in the country and the PFA support an application it should be rejected to the benefit of English, Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish players. Players who can represent the Home Nations and who used to form the backbone of our domestic and international teams.",
