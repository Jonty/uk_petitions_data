        "background": "I am a 30yr old epileptic man who has had to give up my driving licence everytime I have a siezure because of my illness for 1yr, my driving licence is one of the only good things in my life and loosing it means my life has to stop sometimes it makes me depressed and angry which makes it worse it also prevents me from getting me a better payed and maybe more stable job and maybe spread my horizons on job oppertunites.  There are people who are banned for less time after being caught drink driving etc.. and severly and in some cases killing people,  some of these people don't get banned or if they do they get a few months if that get told they are very naughty people and don't do it again",
