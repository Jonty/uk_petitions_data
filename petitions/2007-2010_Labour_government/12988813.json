            "background": "I say that choice is good when there are around 50 extra channels, but 250+ are just those 50 playing out more and more repeats. \n\nBBC & ITV did had innovation right up until the start of Multi-channels, since then they have been no innovation; constant makeovers and far too many cookery and gardening programmes and too many Reality and celebrity's. \n\nI think the BBC & ITV have to pull its socks up quite considerably.\n\nMoving on to multi-channels UK Gold used to be good but they had to go and launch channels like UKG2, add channels like UK People, etc which left them with all these channels with a thin layer of content. I wish the time around 1994 would come back, when all the channels were quality, yes there were less but they were good and there was always something on. The film channels were great, just Sky Movies Premiere, The Movie Channel and Sky Movies Gold. Bravo was good back then, so was Cartoon Network and Trouble/TCC. \n\nThe only channels i'd say are better would be Living and TCM. I wish OfCOM would bring out some kind of quality guideline so we could see a cull of pointless channels, especially +1s.",
