            "background": "I feel it is unfair on smaller businesses and individual renewable energy installers to charge such vast amounts (often several thousand pounds) on such a regular basis (every 12 months) to be certified with the Low Carbon Building Programme (LCBP) in order that their customers may apply for government grants.  Present charges are effectively crippling the micro-renewable energy industry.",
