            "background": "Why is it you feel that it is acceptable to allow TV/Radio/Magazine advertisments for online gambling when so many peoples lives are ruined (Bingo, Slots, Poker, Roulette etc.) by this every day?\nThe adverts are drawing people in with offers of free money and great chat when the realisim is that they draw you in and then you play until you are spent out. For some people this will then continue with them obtaining more money by credit cards or loans.\nOn line gambling can cause depression and bankruptcy. I have lost count of the amount of times i have read in the chat rooms of the gambling websites that a person has been on all day and has spent \u00a3200+ and is now upset and really needs a win...\nYou can read what gambling does to people on www.gamcare.org.uk.\nStop the advertising before it encourages more people to start gambling.",
