            "background": "Wheel clamping of private vehicles is an abuse of our human rights to go about our business unhindered. It is right to fine people who park their vehicles inconsiderately on private land. However wheel clamping is a form of extortion and the costs of release are also extortinate and seemingly unregulated to the point that release fees can vary from \u00a3125 upto nearly \u00a31000. This leads to unscrepulous firms effectively holding people to ransom. Not wheel clamping works fine in Scotland bring the rest of the UK up to their high standards of human rights protection",
