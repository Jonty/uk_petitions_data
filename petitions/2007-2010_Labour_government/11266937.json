            "background": "pre-payment meters, my family pay on average \u00a380 per week on gas and electric in extreme cold weather we pay more i know the price of oil as come down, therefore the gas and electric companies should follow suit by cutting prices they hiked up when the price of oil went up. in these times please help us gas and electric to my family means either eating or heating, did we not have a fuel bill where it helped to protect the people from over charging utilities companies?? i am 100% positive we do, how many families have to suffer at the hands of gas/electric companies? why dont you jump on them and help us against them?? you help the people with the banks you have done a great job, but do a better 1 and tackle the utilities companies, at this time we need the help we need the companies forced to cut prices, i cannot afford to look after my family at 80-120 pounds per week on gas/electric, its just ridiculous, i will justly stand and fight for my right to say what is wrong i grew up in the miners strike under difficulty and understand the importance of looking after your family",
