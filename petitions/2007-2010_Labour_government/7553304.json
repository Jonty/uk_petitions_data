            "background": "The police and councils waste money on 'speed reduction' methods like speed bumps etc. They also give out parking fines without thought and restict parking to maximise revenue. Furthermore the police errect speed cameras in places where accidents DON'T happen and place mobile cameras where they know they will make money. \n\nWhile all this happens people are being assulted in town centre, burgled, having property vandelised. The police and council would rather focus on cars which are easy targets than the real problems in society who cost billions and ruin millions of lives?\n\nThis petitions suggests that parking fines only be used to avoid dangerous parking (eg:outside hospitals) and stop stupid 'anti-speeding' measures, focusing instead on stopping criminals.",
