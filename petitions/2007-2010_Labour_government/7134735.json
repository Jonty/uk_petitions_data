            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I have read in the press that Keith Vaz is calling two young men who were subject to an anti terrorist raid.  The raid was based on inaccurate intelligence and went horribly wrong.  The police apologised and made good the damage they caused. The IPCC investigated a catalogue of complaints relating to the raid against the officers involved. There is therefore documented evidence relating to the incident.  Suggesting that the committee can learn further from other matters relating to their detention is disingenuous.\n\nI am not happy that following the investigation the two young men are providing evidence to the committee regarding anti terror legislation.  It follows that prisoners and lawbreakers should also be called before the committee when criminal law is being reviewed.  \n\nI call on the PM to remove Keith Vaz from his position on the committee.  This action spells of courting a section of the community to further his own political career.  Somehow, I feel as a law abiding citizen and one who supports the police (even when they make mistakes)that my views and those of many citizens of this country do not matter.",
