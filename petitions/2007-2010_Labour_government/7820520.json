            "background": "I think that the younger people of the army should be pulled out of war as it is always in the news that people of youngest age of 21 are getting killed. As soon as you hear that you feel sorry for the widow or the man that is left on his own. It makes you feel sorry for the people out in the war as well as you start to think what is happening to them. Please take this into consideration.",
