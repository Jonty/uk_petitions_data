            "background": "Motorsport is one of the only industries left that Britain is a recognised leader in, it brings this country a great deal of money through exports, it is only right that the pinnacle of motorsport Formula 1 is supported by the people in order not to lose yet another of our successful industries, in the same way conventional motor and aerospace industries have gone, there are many countries who are now looking to displace Great Britain as the hub of world motorsport, we should be taking more measures to promote UK Motorsport in order to remain the leader, advertise our engineering prowess and safeguard the thousands of jobs.\nThe BBC should be commended for picking up the right to screen Formula 1 and NOT questioned, in fact I personally feel the government would also be making better use of my tax money if it where also to help support the renovation of Silverstone as a world class facility, a centre for motorsport, instead of spending ridiculous sums on events that would not generate as much return, such as the Olympic Games and Wembley Stadium. F1 is the greatest sport.",
