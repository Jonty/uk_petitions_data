            "background": "Baroness Margaret Hilda Thatcher IS very much deserving of a state funeral. As Prime Minister (winning three consecutive elections), Mrs Thatcher changed the face of our country forever. She encouraged self respect, pride in our nation and took on the subversive elements of the left wing so that we can be proud and free. Rewards for hard work were no longer frowned upon. We became a respected country in the world's eyes once more and did not bend over backwards for Euro-crats, aggressors or anyone who \"didn't take kindly\" to our history. As an ex-PM she is deserving of this honour (as all ex-PM's should be) and I urge you to support this petition. Let's get the message out there loud and clear, after all MILLIONS of people voted for her!",
