            "background": "Stop profit making ticket touts from selling inflated priced concert tickets on ebay. As many concert tickets go onsale during working hours on weekdays, many people have no chance to buy these tickets until later in the day, by which time the best tickets have all gone or the event is even sold out. Within hours of these tickets going on sale, they are then advertised on ebay for grossly inflated prices, clearly by people who have no intention of ever using the tickets that they have bought, to attend the event, but to simply rip off the unfortunate \"real fans\" who cannot get tickets from the official channels as they have been snapped up by greedy touts. I therefore suggest that it become illegal to sell concert tickets on online for anything other than face value or less to cut  down if not stop these online ticket touts.",
