            "background": "Hi there,\nWith the recent incident on the BBC with regards to the Russel Brand and Jonathan Ross comments i believe it is time that the UK government make the services offered by the BBC optional.I personally am actually in complete disagreement that in it's current set-up the UK tv licesne appears to be mandatory.Nothing i believe in this world should be mandatory especially in a free and open democratic society.I believe 99.9% of the British public believe this too and also that the technology now exists to make the BBC available on a pay per view basis,either nightly or paid yearly.If this petiton proves popular i can forsee no reason why the UK tv license would not be reworked by the government the we the people of the UK elect.So we,the citizens of the United Kingdom are requesting strongly that the prime minister seriously consider an overhaul of the current tv license structure and that the BBC is made optional.Thanks.",
