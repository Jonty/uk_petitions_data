        "background": "In the UK your car driving licence expires at age 70 following which you can renew the licence for 3 year periods following satisfactory completion of a series of medical questions. \n\nIf you were to come from France age 69 to become a resident in the UK, you would be able to drive a car in the UK until you were age 72 on your existing French licence without answering any health questions.  \n\nThis is blatantly unfair.\n\nIt is inequitable that any immigrant should enjoy greater rights or freedoms than those enjoyed by the  existing citizens of the country they are coming to join.\n\nAll information is contained on the DVLA website.  French car driving licences are issued for life with no expiry date.",
