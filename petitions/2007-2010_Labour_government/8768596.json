            "background": "I feel that we are clouded by many stigmas and myths surrounding self harm, that do not allow those concerned to be helped as instead they are judged. People who wear certain clothes are accused and prejudced, as of our great misunderstanding. People are looked down upon and pushed aside due to sterotyping and false information. We need to try and prevent rather than deal later with an issue which could spiral out of control. Between 1 in 12 and 1 in 15 young people self-harm which i feel is quite a high proportion and it is increasing! There is a national self-injury awareness day on the 1st of march, but it is not very well known or advertised. Sign this petition to make the issues surrounding self-harm more understood and to promote the awarness day more.",
