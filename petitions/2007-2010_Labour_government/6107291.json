        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Government IT projects are infamous for being late, hideously over budget, and many of the systems developed simply don't work at the end of it all. The current NHS project is a prime example, and other examples are legion. However, the consultancies that are largely responsible for these failures are allowed to bid again and again for yet more work. Considering that many of these systems are little more than glorified card index systems, the British public has a right to expect much, much more for its money.\n\nThis petition calls for any consultancy which takes part in any government IT project which is late or over budget to be prevented from tendering for further work for a minimum of 5 years. Furthermore, as part of any subsequent tender, they should be obliged to demonstrate how they have learnt from their previous failures.\n\nThis measure should remove many of the big names from the arena and allow smaller, more competent outfits to be awarded the work instead. It should also cut down on the practice of putting in infeasibily low estimates to win contracts.",
