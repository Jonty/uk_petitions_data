A school that cares, guides and enhances the lives of its pupils.   \n\nOur children achieve a high level of education, they do this in a place where everyone is valued.  All the staff know all the children and their families.  All the staff know all the childrens abilities, qualities and strengths.  This is a school that provides a good all-round education, establishing confidence and high self-esteem, teaching it's pupils how to respect themselves and others.  \n\nSt Luke's is a school that other schools could emmulate. \n\nThis is a thriving popular school  that serves its community and provides a strong start to our childrens school life.\n\nOur school should not be a closed school.\n\nThere is no good reason why this school should be closed. \n\nPlease sign our petition and encourage others to do so.\n\nThankyou.",
