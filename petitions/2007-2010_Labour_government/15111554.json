            "background": "To DRAMATICALLY reduce CO2   emissions from cars & vans by the use of average-speed cameras on the motorway network.\n\nVehicle fuel consumption under real driving conditions, (ie starting,cruising and braking), varies very closely as (average speed)cubed  -ie double your speed and fuel consumption increases by 8-  We could effect a HUGE cut in emissions merely by limiting top speed to the existing 70mph limit.\n\nSuppose the mean speed of cars & vans to be 75mph in practice. (65mph slow lane, 75mph mid lane, 85mph fast lane, are probably realistic values.)  \nUsing cameras throughout the network to restrict speed to 70 mph would give a fuel,hence emissions, saving of c.32%.  \n  \nThe detailed theory behind this calculation is in chapter iii A, (Cars ii) of DJC MacKay's \"Sustainable Energy\" ISBN 978-0-9544529-3-3. \n  \nOnce folk had adjusted to the idea in principle, and helped by steadily rising fuel prices, the limit could be reduced in steps of 5mph.\n\n  AT 50mph THE SAVING WOULD BE c.68%!\n\nBetween Peak Oil and Climate Change we DESPERATELY need effective measures.  Here is one!\n   \nSincerely,  Fraser Morphew.",
