It only puts money in the hands of DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.\n\nPeople that die every year in England & Wales from consuming drugs:\n\nTobacco         = 85,000,\nAlcohol         = 6,627,\nHeroin          = 842,\nParacetamol     = 466,\nAntidepressants = 401,\nMethadone       = 220,\nBenzodiazepines = 190,\nCocaine         = 176,\nAmphetamines    = 103,\nMDMA/Ecstasy    = 58,\nBarbiturates    = 14,\nCannabis        = 0 (ZERO)\n\nCannabis is one of the safest know drugs to man, Smoke inhalation is bad for you, users know that.I believe that it is a personal choice how you consume cannabis, Eating it has been proven to be non-lethal, IT TAKES AROUND 70KG CONSUMED ORALLY TO KILL AN AVERAGE PERSON, THUS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nAs for all other \"adverse effects\", Yes smoking excessive amounts of cannabis can make you feel down, But claims of schizophrenia are UNPROVEN AFTER 100 YEARS, THEY ARE LIES, BRAIN DAMAGE? LIES!\n\nCANNABIS IS LESS TOXIC THAN TOBACCO.\n\nLEGALIZE IT AND REDUCE FUNDING FOR CRIMINALS, MAKE BRITAIN SAFER AND HAPPIER!",
