            "background": "The Pheonix Centre is a community centre located on Batley Road Alverthorpe it offers a number of resources and opportunities to the local community the main one being Batley Road Playgroup which is a offstead registered nursery setting for 2-4 year olds it runs as a charity and the cost for children to attend is non profit making many of the staff are volenteers and have over a 100 years of experience in the childcare enviroment. \nAs the nursery works with very low ratios of nursery staff to children its like one big family allowing children to learn and develope through play.Recently the centre has been closed due to \"health and safety issues\" and all children have been moved to a temporary classroom until funding is found to bring the propety up to standard a whole community is affected by this as its the only childcare facility of this kind in the area, please sign this petition to get our children back to the setting they are used to and people have worked so hard for.",
