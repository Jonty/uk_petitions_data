            "background": "This country has experienced record levels of immigration in recent years.  This has put a great strain on communities up and down the country, with pressure on housing, education and health, and increasing social tensions.  There have been calls for an immigration amnesty, but the fact is that amnesties do not work.  This country needs a balanced and properly managed immigration policy that works in accordance with the needs of the country.  This is a crowded country yet we have no coherent immigration and population policy.  Illegal immigration is not a victimless crime.  While migrant workers pay tax, they also consume services and need housing, the latter a frequent cause of resentment.  There should be no reward for breaking the law, and there should be no immigration amnesty.",
