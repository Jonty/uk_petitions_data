            "background": "This Institute would have the task of evaluating proposals for organisational change in the NHS with their predicted benefits and then reporting publicly on achieved benefits after the change had been implemented. It would have some notional benchmarks of cost-benefit thresholds for such things as convenience of access , continuity of contact with identified staff member, patient autonomy, uptake of prevention services, avoidance of error, time spent on reorganisation,   as well as the more direct quality added life years used for treatment evaluations. This would lead to improvement in the design of changes and their implementation, with lessons learned from one reorganisation being passed forward to benefit future ones.",
