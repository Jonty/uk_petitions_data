        "background": "i think that having a birth or even a death certificate are needed as the baby has made it in the world the same as a full term baby, and they still look like babies just born early, i had a baby early cause he had edwards syndrom and with a certificate of birth and death it would of helped me grive better, i would like to start a petition as i think cetificates should be given to mothers who have babies earier than expected, as we still have to give birth to them.",
