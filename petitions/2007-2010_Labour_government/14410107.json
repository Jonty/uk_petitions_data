The rules of The Game state that every time someone thinks about The Game itself, they lose The Game and must announce that they have lost The Game. This petition requests that the rules of The Game be made law, so that anyone thinking about The Game would be legally required to announce that they have lost The Game. Such a law would apply to all UK citizens, including Members of Parliament and the Prime Minister.",
