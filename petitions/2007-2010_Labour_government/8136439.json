            "background": "Many people leave young children and babies in cars unattended as it is easier for them. It might be easier for the adult but it can cause unecessary distress for the child and also has many hidden dangers ie: The child over heating, someone taking the car or running in to it and many more.  We are made aware about the dangers of dogs being left in cars, surely we can afford the same level of care to our children as we do to our animals. Children are not to be left unattended in the home so it should be the same for motor vehicles.",
