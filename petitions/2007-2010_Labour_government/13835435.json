        "action": "agree that public funds be provided to build a battlefield centre at Naseby, the site of that decisive Civil War battle where in 1645 Parliamentary forces defeated the Royalist army and King Charles I, thus allowing the future development of a sovereign English Parliament, religious tolerance and a constitutional monarchy.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "While other English battlefields of earlier eras are often well equipped, little has been done for the battlefields of the major Civil War battles.\n\nThere is now a narrow window of opportunity to build a visitor centre at Naseby.\n\nA suitable site has been promised, and a planning application is being prepared.  But the funds to buy and build, about \u00a33 million, are lacking.  \n\nNow is the time for this place, these sacred few acres where so much English blood was spilt, where Oliver Cromwell led his Ironsides of the New Model Army in a decisive charge, and which is central to our journey to democracy, to be given the national support it deserves.",
