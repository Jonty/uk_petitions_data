        "background": "Dear G8 World Leaders, \nI am writing you collectively. \nI'm sure you agree that the integration of China into the community of nations as a responsible, peaceful, and cooperative actor on the world stage is one of the two most important challenges facing us all right now. \nHis Holiness the Dalai Lama is one of the most well-known, respected, and visionary spiritual leaders in the world, quite familiar to all of you and to the people of your countries. The leaders of China are the only ones who do not know him personally, and that is something you all in concert could do something about. He can be of invaluable help in moving this integration in the right direction. \nThe Dalai Lama is a friend of China, its people, and its leadership. He wants their good just as much as he wants the good of the six million Tibetans he feels most responsible for. \nBringing him and and the Chinese together at a world leaders' summit to resolve this tragic situation that has persisted for more than half a century would be an historic event. \nSincerely Yours, \nMichael John Smith",
