            "background": "I believe pensioners should be given a 50% reduction in utility bills by the companies that supply the service instead of the measly 10% allowance if 10% of earnins are paid out in bills, as many cannot afford the extortionate bills they receive. It should not be for tax payers to foot the bill in the form of winter fuel payments as some low earning tax payers are already finding times hard. The profits these companies make is substantial and it is high time they give something back to the elderly.",
