        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why is it when you travel to france, spain and other european countries you usually pay around 1 euro for a litre of fuel, which by a rough calculation is around 70p/ltr. Yet in the uk, we pay around 98p/ltr. We are all supposed to be part of the EU yet there are such varying prices. It is unjust and is another labour stelth tax. It does not detur peoiple from using their cars, it meerly punishes people who have to use their cars in order to actually earn a living. Please sign the petition and email a link to everyone you know, asking them to do the same! With enough signatures, someone will have to listen! thanks",
