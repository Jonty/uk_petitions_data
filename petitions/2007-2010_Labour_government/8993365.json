            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The increase in Road tax on Four Wheel drives when used for their intended purpose is both punitive and unreasonable. Farmers and other legitimate users require a four wheel drive to tow with or work off road. We feel very strongly that if you are a primary producer and use your 4x4 for work then there should be a reduction in tax as we are not legally allowed to tow with a smaller vehicle. We accept that 4x4 used for private and domestic use should be taxed accordingly.",
