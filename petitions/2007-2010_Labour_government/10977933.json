These two guys have egos as big as the salary they receive from the BBC and think they can do anything because it is fun. This petition is aimed at making the point that even in a liberal society we should show clearly that there are limits as to what is acceptable.",

The Government does, however, expect the BBC\u00a0to act responsibly towards its audience and\u00a0the Trust must ensure that the standards that are clearly outlined in its Charter are upheld at all times.\n\nResponsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters themselves and the organisations which regulate broadcasting, in this case the BBC Trust.  Listeners who have been offended can also contact Ofcom if they feel that acceptable standards have been breached.",
