            "background": "Vehicle clamping and towing is a misery to the lives of nearly all car owners. No one has the right to disable or take away another person's vehicle. It is a breach of basic human rights as a person has 100% authority over their own property. This authority should not be shared with cowboy vehicle clampers and/or towers. Vehicle towing should be allowed in the most extremes cases such as blocked emergency routes or residential parking.",
