The lack of protection for victims and children shocks me . A register would provide autorities involed to be aware of the situation victims find themselfs in as perpetrators have often commited these offenses before . Also the nature of this beaast is denial by the perpetrator a register would put an end to this part of the abuse . Domestic abuse is every ones responsabilit to stamp it out . Please sign my petition and help many victims and survivors like myself . Thankyou Julie Bishop",
