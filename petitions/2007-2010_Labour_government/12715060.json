        "background": "Although the current 'Expenses Row' has claimed several high profile political figures, their choice of 'standing down at the next election' is NOT ACCEPTABLE.\n\nIt seems the leadership of the party's constituency is happy for this to take place as it gives them time to re-appoint a new MP but completely disregards the will and rights of the local constituents. The MP in question has admitted they have done wrong, and have chosen the action to stand down but the constituents are forced to live with this same MP for the remainder of the term.\n\nThis is unacceptable and the party leaders appear afraid of firing the MP immediately as the local community may vote for a different party in the ensuing By-Election. It is not the choice of the party leaders to act in this way and is in contradiction to the fact that any constituents should have the right to choose an MP to represent them in Westminster. This should come at a time of their choosing, not at a time of the party leader, MP or otherwise.",
