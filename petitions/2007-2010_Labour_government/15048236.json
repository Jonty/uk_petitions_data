To the uninitiated a chugger is a charity fundraiser or street obstacle paid by an independent company to badger the good  general public to donate money to X charity and then takes a cut. It is not right for this cut to be taken, our generosity is for the cause, not to line the pockets of these greedy companies! There are many other ways of supporting charities which we all do and have done for years however these street trolls are ruining the names of the charities that do so good! We want them regulated or Rid! for good!",
