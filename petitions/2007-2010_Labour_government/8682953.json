            "background": "I recently found out about a government initiative whereby when a criminal is released from jail, they can be paid for good behaviour.  I found out, when I over-heard a local hoodie bragging to his mates about being paid for staying out of jail.  I queried the situation with my local MP who confirmed that this process is in place and it is cheaper to pay them to be good than to fund their prison sentence.  In my opinion, completely the wrong option.  Please sign this petition if you agree and lets stop rewarding criminals and start making them pay for their crimes again.",
