As i am a mother of one and there has been a problem with my benefits and at the moment i am not reciving.I was told by local office to apply for a crisis loan and since the 26/03/2008 i have been teying to get through and stuck on the phone for eight hours a day and getting nowhere. i thought that wat crisis loans are for but people in crises cant get through so i would like it if they could put the crisis loans back to our local offices so people like me who are in a crisis can get the help they need right away,and not given a number to phone and never able to get anyone at the other end",
