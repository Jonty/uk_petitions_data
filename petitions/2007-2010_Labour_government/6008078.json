            "background": "It is now more than clear the treats of terrorism had never emanated from Iraq and by means of their ambiguous claims Mr Blair and Mr Bush have put any chance of peace in Middle East at risk of complete failure. \n\nTo maintain such a heavy profile in Iraq only serves to put the civilians of Iraq at further risk. \n\nBritish troop efforts should be concentrated on border controls between Pakistan and Afghanistan. British troops should, though NATO, concentrate on the immediate and complete eradication of the Taliban, including any of their terror training camps within either Afghanistan and/or Pakistan territories; only then will we ever achieve and/or make any head way with regards to our so called overseas war on terrorism.",
