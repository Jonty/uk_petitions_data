            "background": "With a 1994 OBE and 2004 CBE for services to music, it's Clapton's time for Knighthood. \n\nHe meets the stated criteria of significant contribution in his field of activity, through sustained commitment which enhances the reputation (and finances) of Britain.\n\nFor most of his life he's led a fairly exemplary life, avoiding many of the usual controversies of iconic rock stars.\n\nHe's dealt with with drug and alcohol problems, and through his experiences as an addict established a rehab unit which he's supported with a lot of his own money, including millions of pounds raised from auctioning his guitar collection.\n\nHe's created entertaining music for more than forty years, been a positive influence on youngsters, and is the only person to be inducted three times into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nAs deserving as Jagger, McCartney, Elton John, and Cliff Richard, 'Ladies and gentlemen... Sir Eric Clapton.' it even sounds good.\n\nEric, thanks. You've made a lot of people happy. Rock on.",
