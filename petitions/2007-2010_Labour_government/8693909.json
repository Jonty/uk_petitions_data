This figure is constantly increasing as a percentage and you the tax payer are footing the bill. The politicians will not reduce their handouts as free loaders are entitled to vote just as you do and the politicians will not to lose their vote. If they had no vote the government could reduce their payments and your taxes without Repurcussions. Why should someone who does not contribute get to have the vote. If they want it - then get a job!!!",
