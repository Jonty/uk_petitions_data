        "background": "Carry-a-bag scheme to help the planet. If shoppers kept, carried and re-used for a year plastic bags they most recently acquired then landfill sites in the UK would be \u2018deprived\u2019 of more than 5,000 million bags a year in my guesstimation.\nWithin our population of 58.9 million people probably 35.4 million shop every week.  \nIf each shopper receives an average of three bags a week for, say, 50 weeks that\u2019s 5,310 million bags per year.\nThose of us who re-use bags find that shops and their staff are very agreeable to this idea in practice: it really does work.\nSupermarkets will have been informed of the idea/scheme and perhaps will consider installing, encouragingly, more \u201cbrought your own carry-a-bags\u201d check-outs than conventional ones.\nBag manufacturers would lose business initially.  Less obviously there are subtle eco-friendly ways of advertising etc. that could centre on such a re-using idea.\nAll things considered this scheme is commended to the Prime Minister Gordon Brown and to the nation.",
