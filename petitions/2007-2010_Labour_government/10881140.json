            "background": "The aim of giving each adult one million pounds, is so that they will be able to pay off all loans and mortgages. This would also allow people on low income or no income to get on the property ladder. All aduls should then have sufficient funds to put back into the economy, by purchasing houses, cars, household goods etc.This would then keep people in jobs and boost sales in the high street. This would cost the country approx \u00a340million small change compared to the \u00a3500 billion for bailing out the banks.",
