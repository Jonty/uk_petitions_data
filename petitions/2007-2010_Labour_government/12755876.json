            "background": "There is a general feeling of instability and insecurity across the country. This is directly related to the failure of Gordon Brown's inability to lead the cabinet, government and country.  I am a mother of two and work hard - I am seriously concerned about the global  view politically and economically about the UK. Insecurity in our leader is dangerous not only domestically but also globally.  The failure of Gordon Brown to look at the  damage his reluctance to step down is causing is bad for the Labour Party and democracy as a whole. It is no surprise that voters are apathetic - especially young and first time voters.",
