            "background": "Every year the switch from summer time to GMT causes misery to a lot of people as we suddenly have to endure dark evenings. But something we forget is the time wasted in changing clocks twice a year - microwaves, videos, telephones, alarm clocks, cars etc etc. More than this, with darker evenings, the lights come on an hour earlier and we use more electricity/fossil fuel. This campaign is to simply say - stick to BST all year round. No clock changes, no autumn depression. And so what if other European countries continue to change their clocks, it really won't be too difficult to remember. Please sign and make the change this spring the last one.",
