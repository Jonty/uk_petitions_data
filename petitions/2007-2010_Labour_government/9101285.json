            "background": "It becoming more and more obvious that speed cameras, especially mobile cameras, are only there to raise revenue, not for any safety issue whatsoever. This is obvious due to the positioning of said speed cameras, i.e., always on long, safe, fast stretches of road that have never seen an accident but where a motorist may have strayed over the limit by a few mph. This has never been more obvious from the introduction of the horse box cameras in North Wales and the overbridge cameras on long, straight, empty sections of motorway. It's time to end this menace for the safety of us and our licences.",
