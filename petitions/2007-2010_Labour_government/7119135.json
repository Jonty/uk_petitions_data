            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The reasoning behind this petition is that a restricted driver can only travel at 45mph for their first year of driving. On normal roads this speed is fine, but on motorways a restricted driver is an obstacle and can very easily cause an accident. \n\nImagine you are travelling at 70mph and come across a vehicle in the distance moving at 45mph, you approach this car, it is dark so your distance perception is not as accurate as it would be during the day, before you know it you would be right behind this slow moving car and having to swerve around them at the last moment. \n\nI propose that the speed limit for restricted drivers be reviewed. I would suggest a 60mph speed limit be put in place for \"R\" (Restricted) drivers on the motorway.",
