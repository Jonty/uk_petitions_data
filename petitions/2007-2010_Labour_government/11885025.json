Perhaps pay related to performance over a long period could be acceptable, but even in this case pay should not be excessive in the public eye.  And, pay associated with failure should be minimal.  There are always plenty of people who could do a much better job for much less pay.  Research is required to determine why better and less greedy candidates are not being selected.  Then appropriate changes should be made to stop people being paid inappropriately.",
