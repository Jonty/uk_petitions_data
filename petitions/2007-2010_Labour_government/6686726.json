        "background": "Carers as a rule are paid minimum wage or just over, irrespective of how experienced they are. We will never get good care for our frail and vunerable people as long as we class CARING as unskilled low paided work. Many carers are highly skilled and the only way to progress and increase their wages is to go into management or make a career change, which deprives our loved ones of the expert care they deserve and should receive.",
