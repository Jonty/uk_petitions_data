            "background": "There are proposals and plans to widen the A46 between the A606 and the A1 in Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire as this will then connect the A1 and M1 in this area by means of a dual carriageway. However, the section under discussion is mostly quiet and only busy during peak rush hours and even then congestion is rare. Furthermore, large parts of the English countryside and many rural villages and communities will be devastated by this proposal. In addition, the proposed works will take several years to complete, thereby causing widespread disruption for local people.",
