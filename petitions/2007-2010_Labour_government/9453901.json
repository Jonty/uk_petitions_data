        "background": "Those who oppose wind power are a joke. Often they will say that nuclear power is the answer, despite the fact that it's dangerous, dirty and expensive. If they are going to ignorantly promote nuclear power then they should take the consequences. They should each accept a small packet of nuclear waste to safely store for the next 400 generations of their own family as this is essentially what they are asking us all to do.",
