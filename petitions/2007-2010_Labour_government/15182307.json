            "background": "Old English is a most neglected language, yet it is more relevant to the language we use today than Latin or Greek. It would make people more aware of their cultural heritage and the origins of our society. In that sense it is an essential element in the understanding of our history. It would also be considerably easier for a native English speaker to learn Old English rather than Latin or Greek, while at the same time introducing the student to the intricate grammar of ancient languages. It would be more pertinent than say, learning one of the twenty or so Chinese languages, any one of which is likely to be slightly irrelevant to our daily lives, and yet are sometimes favoured by educationalists. The intense excitment and interest created by the recent discovery of the Staffordshire Hoard should be some indication of how Old English might be a more popular subject than one might at first imagine.",
