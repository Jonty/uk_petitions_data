        "background": "In an effort to reduce binge drinking and especially underage drinking supermarkets and corner shops should not be allowed to sell alcohol. Pubs and off licences should be the only businesses allowed to sell alcohol. This would help these businesses survive the draconian laws being passed by ill informed and misguided dogooders. It would also give pubs a fighting chance at survival!",
