            "background": "Its morally wrong for the Government to victimize people for your mistakes and bad management of the economy. If its your plan to increase taxes in a few years time. The Government in 2007 spent \u00a358 million on sea defence and \u00a3580 Billion on think tanks. Does that sound logical? Someone is getting rich and its not the British people. I do not see politicians getting into financial difficult or loosing their jobs through poor performance.Finally Oil prices have come down yet the utility companies are still charging exsessive high prices, and the government does nothing to unburden people from this rip off. Is it because the government profits from these price hikes? I am disappointed by your lack of control and concern over such basic matters.\nI thought you where a party that helped people, not tax them for every penny they earn. Wait till election day, then you will see how the people respond to your plans.",
