If he was born 8 days later he would of recieved a birth and death certificate. He was recorded as a miscarriage. He was a little baby, my baby. perfectly formed, just too weak to survive. Please please sign this petition so the law can be changed. Many other women will go though this tragedy and I would hate for them to be told, just like i was, that their baby was just a miscarriage and will not be registered as a birth.\nplease get all your friends and family to sign. Thank you so much. I love you riley xxxxx",
