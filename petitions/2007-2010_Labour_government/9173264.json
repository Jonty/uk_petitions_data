            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Leamside railway has been disused by passenger trains since 1984 and freight trains since 1992. By reopening the line to freight and passengers, pressure will be reduced on the East Coast main line between Newcastle and the area south of Durham. It will also provide great economic and social benefits to both Tyne and Wear and County Durham with the provision of new stations to link some currently remote communties, poorly served by public transport, along the length of the line.",
