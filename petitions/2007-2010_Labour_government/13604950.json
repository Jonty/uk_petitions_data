            "background": "Thousands of children aged 5 to 15 continued to attend school during WW2 despite great hardships and to date this has not been recognised. Although they did not directly take part in the conflict they gave some normality to families. Suffering evacuation and other disruptions due to bombing, many children lost family members while continuing to go to school (if it still stood). Most fathers were at the front fighting the Nazis and their children didn't know if they would see them again. With rationing, the blackout and other severe deprivations British children missed out on the enjoyment of everyday life now taken for granted. A small medal for such children now growing old would help to alleviate the pain of ageing and be much appreciated by all concerned.",
