Different wardens working for the same council and all are operating under different guidelines and levels of discretion. Appeals remain unanswered, correspondence is not received and tickets are being issued in there thousands incorrectly. People are abusing the disabled badge parking all days in bays. CCTV smart cars are taking pictures of alledged offences that wardens would otherwise see are infact parked or loading/unloading correctly. Signs are not clear or do not exist where they should. And in some instances the first a motorist is informed of an offence is when they receive a letter from a bailiff. This has got to stop",
