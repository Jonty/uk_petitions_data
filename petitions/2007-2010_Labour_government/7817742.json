            "background": "Peter Hain, by his own admission has broken laws introduced by your government. He failed to declare huge sums of money that had been donated to his Deputy Leadership campaign, even though the money had been donated after he lost. \n\nThe law is clear on this issue, and it is an offence to not declare donations within thirty days. Mr. Hain's excuse that he did not know it was illegal doesn't wash, as we all know ignorance of the law is no excuse.\n\nMr. Hain should not be allowed to resign, he should be fired. If he has any honour after that he should resign from his parliamentary seat.",
