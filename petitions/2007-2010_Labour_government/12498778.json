            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "First time home buyers should receive preferential stamp duty treatment versus those buying a second home or for buy-to-let purposes. Preferential treatment to be in the form of either abolishment of stamp duty or raising the minimum purchase price threshold that creates a stamp duty liability. In case of the latter, the threshold should also consider average property prices within a particular area (e.g. Town or City) as opposed to a national average property price.\nBenefits of this will be multiple:\n\n1. Boost the housing market (and the connected boost to the economy) by increasing affordability for first-time buyers and thus bringing more buyers to the market\n\n2. Make the system more fair for first-time buyers (an option could be to increase stamp duty on second home purchases)\n\n3. By having a local stamp duty threshold v/s a national one, make the system more fair. Currently home buyers in London are worse off as the average house price in london is far higher than the national average. The opposite applies for home buyers in the North of england for example.",
