        "background": "Bring back conscription for all young people and include all those who want   to make Great Britain their home.  Young people would be taught the discipline, respect for others etc  which the military would instill.   It would also slow down immigration and perhaps stop the number of British people emmigrating as they have lost faith in Great Britian. It would also ensure that everyone could speak English. After all if the Gurkhas who fought along side our soldiers can't stay why should we accept people who don't really want to be part of our society but just take the best bits about Britian with giving something back.",
