            "background": "It is unacceptable for any religion to be taught as a factual and truthful belief system to children in primary schools. Since current UK law states that children lack the responsibility to marry, work, have children of their own or make other important life-affecting decisions, it seems contradictory that a child is considered responsible enough to become a member of a complicated and demanding ideology such as a religion. The socialisation a child receives in primary school has a significant impact on the course of their future, and it is decidedly irresponsible to force particular religious beliefs on young minds; it would hardly be right for primary school children to be taught to align with a specific party or political group. Therefore it seems appropriate that any teaching of religion should be reserved for more advanced levels of education, and even then it should be balanced and objective.",
