            "background": "Repeal the Malvern Hils Acts, to separate land into the modern day management departments of National Forrestry Commission, Worcestershire County Council, Malvern Hills District Council. \n\nThis land is not being PROACTIVELY managed in a way to encourage safe public use and positive education. \n\nIssues of public safety have been left ignored (up to 12 months or more) until they are challenged and the Director appears to think that health & safety and risk assessments are the County Council's problem & responsibility - not his. (I refer the organisation to Ltd. Company Law and the repsonsibilities of company directors and management)\n\nLittle can be seen on the ground of attempts to encourage educational use of the hills. \n\nThe attitude of 'reducing visitors to the hills to prevent erosion' - demonstrates simply how 'nieve' the organisational objectives are, for this is a key resource that Malvern has of getting business to the area and the general public to spend their money in the local economy.\n\nAccess for disabled (wheelchair) users is very poor in many parts of the hills, suggestions of 'cable cars', 'road trains' and the like get poo poo'd in a 'not in my backyard' fashion.",
