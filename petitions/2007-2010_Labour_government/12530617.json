        "background": "To some people \u00a3100,000 or \u00a3150,000 a year seems to be a lot of money, but it isn't as much as you think. These people have worked hard for their money and deserve to keep it, just as much as anyone, no matter how much they earn. Should people be punished for their success? A large amount of these high earners are doctors, have they caused the recession? Is it right to try and make them pay for the fault of others? I believe it isn't. Who know's how much the government will truely raise from this tax on the 'rich', as I'm sure most of them are fleeing as I write this. This unecessary tax will barely dint the billions of pounds our government has borrowed, but trust me it's dinting the pockets of many who don't deserve it.",
