The former Golden Lion pub in Withington Manchester is such an example of neglect. It has such a negative impact on the neighbourhood that local residents have finally said enough is enough.  They have launched a campaign to put pressure on Seddon Homes  to take responsibility for this disgaceful eyesore.",
