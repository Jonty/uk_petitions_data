            "background": "On the evening of Wednesday the 17th September 2008, the RSS burnt down 20 churches in Bangalore, and planned to burn 200 more in Orissa. Other Hindu extremists, linked with the BJP plan to kill 200 Christian Pastors during the next 24 hours - today is the 18th.\n On August 23rd, Hindu leader Laxmananda Saraswati was assassinated - his assassins claimed to be Maoist rebels - this was backed up by India's Central Bureau of Investigation, but Hindus claim that Christians are responsible.\n  Since then, 35 Christians have already been killed, 4,000 Christian homes burnt down, along with 115 churches - leaving 20,000 people displaced. Because it is christians, as opposed to any other religious group or ethnic group being oppressed, the british media have failed to report the incidents.\n  Mr. Brown, I petition you to help your brother's and sister's persecuted in India.",
