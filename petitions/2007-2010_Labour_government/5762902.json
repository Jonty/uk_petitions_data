Pets are terrified and anxious which also causes distress for their owners. children are unable to sleep because of the noise.\nEnough is enough.  \nEvery year people are injured some seriously in the name of fun.  Isn't it time to call a halt in the interests of safety, peace and quiet and that old fashioned concept - consideration for others.",
