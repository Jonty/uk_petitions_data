I think the whole country will feel that the current system of expenses claiming is corrupt. With an independant investagation into the whole affair any unlawful claims should be paid back, after all this money was ours earned by all us hard working tax payers. Why should we carry on paying our taxes when the government wastes it with these claims, its just not right!",
