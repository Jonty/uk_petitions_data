            "background": "In the main the ordinary people in UK expect fairness when entering into contracts with companies and banks.  At present the law in UK is too abstract for the lay man.  Often this results in failure to deliver a fair outcome and only 'points in law' appear to matter and not the fairness when courts decide on a case.  Only the lawyers benefit from this at enourmous costs that the ordinary person cannot possibly afford",
