        "background": "At the moment home-educating families are purposly excluded from the Home Access free laptop scheme for families on low incomes in England. We believe this to be discriminatory against families who strive to bring a nurturing and personal education to their children and at their own cost. Ed Balls said that children without access to the Internet at home are \"...at a disadvantage to their peers...\" yet is utterly at home leaving a tiny section of society in that very place: at a disadvantage to everyone else.\n\nPlease make the laptops available to home-educated children too. The current criteria is negligent and exclusive.",
