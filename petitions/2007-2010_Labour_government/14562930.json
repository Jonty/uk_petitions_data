We believe this to be discriminatory against families who strive to bring a nurturing and personal education to their children and at their own cost. Ed Balls said that children without access to the Internet at home are \"...at a disadvantage to their peers...\" yet is utterly at home leaving a tiny section of society in that very place: at a disadvantage to everyone else.\n\nPlease make the laptops available to home-educated children too. The current criteria is negligent and exclusive.",
