        "action": "Provide a substantial financial fund to start-up entrepreneurs less than 30 years of age that have viable business plans, but no real assets and to further recognise that by supporting them today, they will become the lifeblood of the economy in the future.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is imperative that support is offered to the thousands of young entrepreneurs that have the obvious capability to start and run a business, however have mostly no cash or assets behind them. It is compelling to fully understand and recognise that these people will become the lifeblood of tomorrow\u2019s new economy.\n\nTypically it is very difficult for such people to obtain funding for their proposed ventures as banks are very restrictive in their criteria for lending.\n\nThe proposition therefore is for a national fund, along with good guidance and support can be offered to young and innovative entrepreneurs, where good and viable business plans can be accepted and approved for government funding",
