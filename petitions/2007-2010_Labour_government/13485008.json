            "background": "To improve traffic phasing in London that improves the flow of traffic. For instance n end road to Talgate road, junction A4. As you turn onto the A4 from N end road you are stopped by pedestrian lights allowing only 3 cars to turn into the road causing a back log of traffic. If people are crossing then the lights should activate. If this was looked at all over London. The flow of traffic could be improved.",
