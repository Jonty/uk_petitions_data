We the undersigned petition the govt to continue with providing football but look at better was of policing events and crowd control for the masses.",

            "background": "Aren't these people selfish ! Don't they realise that their actions will affect the police's decision to continue providing good football in the future for peacefuul, law - abiding citizens ?! Like the police, I too am \"sickened\" by the association of sport and crime. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to reassert the sports movement as one of peace - not protest and wish to be personally, disassociated with last night's actions. Events like these should not be staged without proper supervision, but admittedly, policing relies on the responsible behaviour of those who partake and clubs. Perhaps one way to encourage greater accoutnability would be to legislate so football clubs and the councils would be made to pay costs.",
