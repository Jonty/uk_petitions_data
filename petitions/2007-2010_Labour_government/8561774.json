            "background": "The former RAF Coltishall site appears to have been chosen as a site for a Category C prison, despite the site having insufficient access roads, little infrastructure to support a prison, and being in close proximity to the Douglas Bader School, and being very close to former RAF Married Quarters, currently being sold by Annington Homes Limited, to unsuspecting members of the public. In some cases, the fence surrounding this unsuitable site is less than 20 feet from the back gardens of these homes, and buildings potentially being used to house prisoners, some 30 feet from these homes, with direct line of sight into the bedrooms of these homes, a TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE state of affairs I am sure any fair-minded person will agree.",
