        "background": "Although Sir Fred Goodwin is a Scot (and so your fellow countryman), you should recognize that his greed and megalomania have done much to damage British banking and the welfare of Scotland itself (as RBS was over half the size of the Scottish economy).\n\nHis actions have directly contributed to RBS having to be nationalized and have cost us taxpayers a fortune to fund his immense salary.\n\nI'm not saying that you should take away his money or imprison him (though this may happen). However this man should not be honoured for the mistakes he has made. \nBusinessmen such as Alan Sugar, Richard Branson & John Harvey-Jones deserve their honours for what they have done & their success. Fred Goodwin does not.",
