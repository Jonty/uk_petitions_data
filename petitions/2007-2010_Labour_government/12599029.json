            "background": "The dumbing down of the BBC is an issue we feel needs addressing as licence payers. With the increase in reality television complete rigged phone polls, poor American imports, and dross masquerading as comedy, it is time the BBC was forced to clean its act up, and provide us, the viewer with proper family entertainment.\n\nTherefore we propose that the BBC should be forced to show the entire uncut version of 'Cannibal Holocaust' (currently banned in the UK). We believe a suitable time for the display of this film would be 7pm on a Saturday night, in order to gain the maximum audience share. This would be a positive step to counteract the poor standards currently in place at this organisation.",
