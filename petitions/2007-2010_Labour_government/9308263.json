        "background": "It is desirable for armed forces associations to inform serving and ex serving members(particularly combat service) of our existence and what help we can give.This would ideally be served by the allocation of government funding and indeed backing, to assist association members to visit serving troops and inform them of what we can do for them and their families.I realise that certain organisations already exist for this sort of thing(Royal British Legion,SSAFA to name but a few)however most service personnel will tell you no one is closer than the Regimental family,this is epitomised by the current associations in existence,unfortunately we have very little or no chance of visiting frontline troops.I personally believe that a visit from the associations would do far more good than political visits.A knock on effect would be a drop in the amount of ex-service personnel(particularly army) sleeping on the streets,and the eventual misuse of drink and drugs.We know our own more than anyone else!Let us get these victims off the streets and once again be proud of themselves.",
