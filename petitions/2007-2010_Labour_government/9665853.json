It seems that they think that all \"Young People\" are chavs!\n\nFor example, I saw this on an NHS Contraceptive page on the social networking site, Bebo:\n\"r u worried about pregnancy?\"\n\nI already complained to that page and the group it was in, but nothing happened.\n\nThere are many other groups that do this, all the informative posters in my secondary school picture young people to be louts and yobs, hanging around wearing fake jewelerry and hoods.\n\nThis is extremely patronising and needs to be stopped as it puts people off more than it attracts them in!",
