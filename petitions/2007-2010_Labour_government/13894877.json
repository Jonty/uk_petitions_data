            "background": "Every year tens of millions of sharks die a slow death because of finning. Finning is the inhumane practice of hacking off the shark's fins and throwing its still living body back into the sea. The sharks either starve to death, are eaten alive by other fish, or drown (if they are not in constant movement their gills cannot extract oxygen from the water). Shark fins are being \"harvested\" in ever greater numbers to feed the growing demand for shark fin soup, an Asian \"delicacy\".",
