        "background": "currently the queen recives \u00a336,7000,000 a year tax. this is not nearly enough to maintain all of her estates. A quote from an internet page says \"Calling Queen Elizabeth II as the richest royal across the globe is a pass\u00e9. The list is updated by Forbes. To your much astonishment, Queen is worth $600 million that clearly puts her on eleventh position in the list of top-15 monarchs identified.\" yet she is the monarch of the most people! i would petition to raise the tax from 61 pence per person to \u00a320 per person giving her a well overdue wage increase from \u00a336,700,000 pounds a year to \u00a31,219,500,000 (1.2bn a year)putting her back on track to true greatness. all the top ten richest monachs have more than 1bn pounds reserve so why shouldn't our great queen?\n\nyou have allowed a petition on the same topic as this I just give figures why is this not approprate? isnt it the executives job too increase or decrease her majesty's finance?",
