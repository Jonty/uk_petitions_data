            "background": "All the major religions are based on fiction, myth and lies, not one of them can provide any evidence for their claims of miraculous events or the existence of a God. And until they can prove those claims, they should be banned from preaching them as being fact. At the moment our morals are dictated by dishonest religions, which breeds dishonest people, crime and wars throughout the world. The UK needs to set an intelligent example for the rest of the world to follow, and abolish preaching lies, in favour of teaching facts. It's impossible to create an honest law abiding morally upstanding society, by brainwashing people with fiction, myth and lies. Because the method it's self is immoral, and the method belongs in the oppressive middle east, where it began over 2000 years ago. Multi racial Britain can never work as things stand, because the melting pot contains oil and water seasoned with lies and deception, which do not and will not mix. But if we abolish religion and replace it with factism, multi racial Britain would work, and racial harmony would be the beautiful result... This idea may sound radical, but an honesty based society as been overdue for 2000 years.",
