Many fought in the 2nd World War for these principles. Those who have worked hard and scrimped and saved to maintain their independence are penalised by a system that seeks to deprive them of their assets; some  who have made no attempt to manage their finances benefit from financial assistance. \nMost wish to bequeath their property to their children and it is to the benefit of the country that these assets are passed down. \nThe government should acknowledge its responsibility to provide care for those who can no longer manage an independent life.",
