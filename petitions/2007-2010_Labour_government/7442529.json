            "background": "I would like to see several things in place here to enable ordinary people help themselves become debt free.\n\n1. Stop automatic \"spam\" door drops promising automatic credit from credit card companies.\n\n2. Withdraw the advertising of debt consolidation loans, as these do not really help.\n\n3. Make it easier to approach credit companies using existing legislation.  Stop the need for a third party intermediary to have to help understand the law.  \n\n4. Make sure that ALL companies have a legal obligation to correctly means test a person before giving credit.\n\nAs a nation we have become seriously burdened with debt.  Eventually this debt is going to have a huge impact on the national economy, as people will for example stop spending in order to resolve debt.  We need some serious help in order to help us become debt free.  Above are only examples of what I would like to see, any additional points that you feel would aid this legislation would be most welcome.",
