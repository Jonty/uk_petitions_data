        "background": "May you please grant amnesty to all  asylum seekers under the age of 18.One thing you must remember is,this children came to this country because they were victims of abuse and fear for prosecution in their country of origin.And one thing that make Britain a great country is her ability to protect the right and freedom of children both in the UK and abroad. I know there are others who may disagree with my proposition but one things that we must all not forget is,no matter the reason why this children come into this country,they are still children.I would like the government to exercise such power to free this children from  bullying that they suffer in school by friends because of their status  which leaves them in a state of mental violation.Please support this petition because no matter what \"They are still children\"",
