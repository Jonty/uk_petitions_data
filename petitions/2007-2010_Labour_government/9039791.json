        "background": "The Bass brewery was founded in 1777 by William Bass and its Red Triangle symbol is widely recognised. The triangle was the very first trademark registered in 1876 in Britain and it features in paintings by Manet and Picasso - and even in a Quentin Blake illustration for the Twits. \n\nThe Bass Museum, opened in 1977 to mark the bi-centenary of Bass, has been a major tourist attraction in Burton-on-Trent and provides a valuable history of the town and the brewing industry. \n\nBass was taken over by Coors, who renamed it the Coors Visitor Centre and Museum of Brewing and have recently announced that the museum is costing too  much to keep up and will have to be closed. \n\nI believe that the Bass Museum is important enough that it should remain open, even if Coors are no longer prepared to maintain it. The museum should become part of the national museum service and available for all to enjoy.",
