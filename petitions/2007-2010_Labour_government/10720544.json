If the judge doesn\u2019t like your horse your country looses out! My campaign is to get endurance racing into the Olympics it is taken place all round the world by many different countries, and the most important thing is first horse across the line at the end and is fit to continue wins. No more politics within equestrianism! Endurance is a true test on a horse and the rider! Lets show how we can win another medal in London!",
