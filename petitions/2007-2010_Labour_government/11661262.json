            "background": "Day by day the UK economy is suffering from a lack of confidence. Be it in it's financial systems or government. While I cannot call for an referendum regarding the financial systems of the UK. I can call for an general election to elect a government with a clear mandate from the citizens of the UK. This will empower the elected government & show the world economy that the citizens of the UK have confidence in their government and with the policies they put forward to lead us through the recession we are now in.",
