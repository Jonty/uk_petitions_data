        "background": "This might go some way towards reducing the mass of allowances and expenses currently claimable by MPs, and seen by the general public as a major source of income.  Expenses should not provide personal benefit to MPs but cover justifiable costs. For example, the funding of a mortgage for a second home generates financial gain for the mortgage-holder; any profit accruing from this practice cannot be justified under an expenses or allowances heading.\n\nCurrently:-\n\n2nd HOMES ALLOWANCE - In 2008/9 the allowance limit is \u00a324,006.\n\nSALARY AND ALLOWANCES - Annual salary of \u00a363,291 and allowances received for the costs of running an office, having homes both near Westminster and in their constituency, and travelling between both. Average claimed by each MP \u00a3135,600 a year.\n\nTRAVEL EXPENSES - There is no limit on the amount of travel expenses.\n\nSALARY AND ALLOWANCES - MPs paid \u00a363,291 p.a. and receive allowances for the costs of running an office, having homes both near Westminster and in their constituency, and travelling between both. Average claimed by each MP \u00a3135,600 a year.",
