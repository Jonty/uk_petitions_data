They are closing at an alarming rate, there arent many places you can go to chill nowadays, the pub has been here for centuries, its now getting priced out of the market.  I implore the government to look into this.  We are losing our identity in this country.  We desperately need to keep this constitution going rather than remove yet another part of our identity.",
