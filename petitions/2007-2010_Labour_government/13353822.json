            "background": "At the moment, Student Finance is stressful for anyone who is starting or is at university. \nThe application process is complicated, especially if you do it online as you have to also send things through the post. Once you have sorted everything out, there is the long wait for them to process it. During this time, you receive many letters telling you they don't have things that you have already sent off. If you try to phone, you get through to a recorded message or a long wait to talk to an actual person. \nAt the moment, Student Finance is way behind with their applications and therefore not everyone will receive the money and loans they need to start or continue university. \nAlso, for those who get their insurance university, or those who change their address or have a change of income have to inform them through post which is a slow process and means that even those who applied months in advance, will now receive their payments late. \nTo conclude, Student Finance needs to be sorted out to ensure that all students who apply within a deadline receive their payments on time, whether this means more workers or a different application system.",
