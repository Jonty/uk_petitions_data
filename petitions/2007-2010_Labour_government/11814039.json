We have terrorists (etc) who claim that they can not be deported due to their \"human rights\".\n\nWe need a Human Responsibilities Act, which would trump the HRA - basically stating that if someone fails in their basic human responsibilities, then their grounds for HRA application are lost (or at least severely curtailed).\n\nExample: if someone preaches murder by telling other people of their religion to kill \"non-believers\", then that preacher loses their right to complain that they themselves would be put to death if they were deported.",
