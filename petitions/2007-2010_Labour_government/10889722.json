            "background": "Kaupthing Edge in the Isle of Man has had its banking license withdrawn, and a provisional liquidator has been appointed.\n\nFor now, all Kaupthing Edge accounts in the Isle of Man have been frozen, and customers currently have no access to their money.\n\nThere is some light at the end of the tunnel. Although the Isle of Man is not covered by the British Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), it is covered by its own Depositors\u2019 Compensation Scheme (DCS).\n\nUnder the scheme\u2019s rules, savers who had accounts with Kaupthing Edge on the Isle of Man will be entitled to \u00a350,000 worth of compensation per individual.\n\nIn the case of joint accounts, each of the named account holders will be entitled to individual protection worth \u00a350,000 -- which means that the total money potentially claimable would be \u00a3100,000.\n\nUnfortunately, savers on the Isle of Man who held more than \u00a350,000 in their Kaupthing Edge accounts cannot (under current rules) be provided with extra DCS protection.\n\nVery sadly, it seems that people in this situation stand to lose any amount they had in their accounts above the \u00a350,000 DCS limit.",
