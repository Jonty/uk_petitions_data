            "background": "The effect of human activity on the climate of earth is a scientifically recognized fact, agreed upon by the large majority of the scientific community. The extent and degree to which climate change will disrupt human life makes it of the upmost important not simply to citizens of the uk, but to every living thing on our planet.\n\nAs a result, climate change needs to be a top priority if the habitants of this planet are to survive and progress. The recent floods in britian are a warning sign of the damage that will eventually come to britain and other countries. \n\nSo far reaching is the effect of climate change that no person will be left unaffected by it. As a result it should be the top priority of our government.\nTherefore we, the undersigned, petition to make the reduction of man's effect on global warming the most important policy in our government, including trade embargoes against countries, such as the USA, who continually fail to meet Kyoto standards.",
