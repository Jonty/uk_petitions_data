Whilst being bad for you crotch, back, neck and wrists.\n\nThe solution is in recumbents. They are comfortble and more efficent than the regular bike. People won't ride recumbents because it'll make them different and people would stare.\n\nHowever, if the UCI lifted the ban on recumbents. in turn racers would have to ride recumbents because they are more efficent and faster. Resulting in recumbents being common. More people on recumbents equals less cars. Less polution.",
