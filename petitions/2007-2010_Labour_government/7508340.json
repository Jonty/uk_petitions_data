            "background": "I have observed trains being cleaned at London stations and the majority of items are recyclable - newspapers, plastic bottles, drink cans etc. They just all get thrown together in plastic bags with no visible attempt to sort the rubbish for recycling. Train companies and stations make money selling these items and should ensure they are disposed of responsibly. \n\nSimilarly I have witnessed bin lorries collecting huge bags of glass bottles which are simply thrown in the back of the truck compactor when they should be sorted and collected seperately. If householders are expected to do then so should businesses.",
