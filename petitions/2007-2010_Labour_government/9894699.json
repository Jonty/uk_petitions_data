            "background": "Currently glass recycling means tipping perfectly good bottles into large containers labelled Clear, Brown and Green where they invariably get smashed and are then then remanufactured .... why? ... why not just collect them on the doorstep like glass milk bottles. Drinks bottles usually come in 25, 33, 37.5, 75cl. and 1 litre sizes with fairly uniform shapes, some with brand names stamped on.\n\nWhy not ban brand names and adopt a uniform shape like milk bottles so that any drinks manufacturer can use any other manufacturers' bottle ... and stop this needless smashing?  \n\nIt would also assist in saving doorstep delivery of milk since they can be collected by the milkman for sterilising and distribution through dairies.",
