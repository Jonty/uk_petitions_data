            "background": "Why should the tax-payers be funding Immigrants to come and recieve free english lessons?\nIf they are serious in their desire to live in the UK, they should make the effort to learn the language, and if they cant afford that, they shouldn't be coming here seeking benefits and free schooling/NHS.\n\nIt's slighty ironic too, seeing as a fair share of our own children leave primary school unable too read or write.\n\nAnd before sympathy is felt for \"Assylum seekers\", International law states that they should seek refuge in the first country that is safe. So how do they end up here? The rest of Europe doesn't want them. Point made?",
