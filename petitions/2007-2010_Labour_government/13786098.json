            "background": "The government want single mothers to return to work, however they allow men or women with no children to claim Jobseekers allowance.  They allow these childless people who have no responsibility to anyone to live free off the state, they get given housing benefits and most of these people use their money to buy drugs and alcohol, sit around all day watching television.  \n\nOne Housing Association called Luminus in Huntingdonshire wants to introduce service charges to people living in blocks of flats, if you are on Housing Benefit you don\u2019t have to pay, what this Housing Association is doing is getting extra revenue from the County Council for free.  Where will the local council obtain this money simply put up council taxes.\n\nI think it is wrong that the government is always insulting single mothers, there are a lot of people without children living on benefits and getting free housing.\n\nIf a child has no parenting because the mother has to work what kind of adults will they grow into.  Fathers should be more responsible for their children they produce whether they wanted them or not.",
