        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It seems contradictory that the government wishes to be building zero-carbon homes by 2016 and is tightening Part L of the building reg's, yet is not making any moves to even reduce use of PVC in the building industry. The plastic is wasteful and causes enormous carbon footprints and environmental damage. For PVC windows, it takes 60 years of service to compensate for the CO2 and pollution emitted during manufacture - while it is believed that there is no way plastic windows would live longer than 50. The advantages are overtaken by the serious faults, and currently PVC windows are causing damage to conservation areas. While crafted joinery is relatively costly, if PVC was removed as an option the prices of timber products would then fall and individual craftsmen would also benefit with greater demand for work.",
