        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Men are unfairly discriminated against by the courts & benefit systems. They are less likely to be allocated children by courts because the benefit system automatically allocates child benefit to the mother.\nThere are much more young female than male millionaires.\nSingle men are far more likely to be homeless.\nBoys are falling behind because of inequalities introduced to the exams in `80s designed to address the(then) failure of girls.  \nMen are far more likely to be incarcerated than women.\nPaternal lags maternal leave massively , so families cannot choose who should look after the children/who works.\nMen are much more likely to commit suicide than women.\nLife expectancy is 81yrs(women) & 76yrs (men), yet far more NHS money is spent on Females than Males.\nThe electorate is mostly female, so MP`s are elected by women, men are a minority. Despite this there is a \nMinister for Women and Equality, & no minister for Men.\n\nWe ask that the Government end its discrimination against men by ensuring that equality legislation apply to government, benefits and law.",
