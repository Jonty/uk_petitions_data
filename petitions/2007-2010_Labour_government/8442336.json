            "background": "Television cook's Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver recently highlighted the plight of 'chickens bred for the masses'. These birds are kept in poorly maintained, cramped barns seeing no natural light and having physical burns from sitting in their own urine. (Look at most chickens on shelves that aren't free range for the redness around the leg area). \nWith Tesco now planning to sell these birds at \u00a31.99 each, I prospose to petition the Prime Minister to take action to ensure that the conditions these birds are kept in is changed. Free range chickens (Or indeed any animal reared as 'Free Range') should be actively endorsed to be bought, at the same time discouraging barbarick rearing methods and discouraging the prices of such products to be so low that the welfare of the animal is questionable. In addition people buying such products should be able to see how the animal in question has been reared generally and not be mislead by labels, pricing, or 'vague information'.",
