I earn far less than the government say is the national average.\n\nI am not classed as a key worker but earn far less than the key workers do.\n\nI feel that more people such as civil servants, local government workers should be classed in the key worker class.\nAll civil servants etc do jobs which are important to our society, such as carers, people which keep the benefits being paid, keep rubbish off the streets etc etc etc.\n\nWe do not earn enough to own a house going on todays house prices.\n\nPlease sign today to allow more people a fair access to homes of our own, not just teachers, police etc who all earn a good wage and could get a mortgage based on their earnings.",
