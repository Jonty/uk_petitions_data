        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is becoming increasingly frequent for traffic flow to be disrupted by the placement of traffic lights on roudabouts.\nThere is no apparent reason for this as roundabouts are self controlling, and we don't need to be told when to proceed or stop at roundabouts.\nAlso, there are many examples of traffic lights being placed at junctions when a roundabout would be a better option.\nNeither can I see how it is a good idea to have to stop part way through a roundabout because of traffic lights. \nOnce on the roundabout, you should be able to go freely to your exit and get off the thing.\nI have been in the situation of being stopped up to three times whilst trying to negotiate a roundabout, because of traffic lights.\nThis is dangerous, as following drivers often do not expect you to stop for no apparent reason once you start to proceed around a roundabout. I have almost been hit in the rear on several occasions due to this.\nRoudabouts are also more environmentally friendly, as they do not require the use of electricity to power them. \nNor can a roundabout suffer from malfunctions, or be hacked into and controlled by any subversives wishing to create havoc by causing gridlocks. [it could happen!]",
