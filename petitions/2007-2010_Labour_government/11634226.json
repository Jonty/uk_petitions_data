            "background": "The BBC's bias in favour of Israel is a journalistic and national disgrace. Common humanity demands that the Gaza appeal should be broadcast. The sanitised reporting of the recent war crimes in Gaza is nothing less than propaganda by default. Silence implies consent. The public deserve better, and I fail to see why my license fee should be funding this abomination. There have been plenty of reports and images available to the BBC from other broadcasters which they have failed to use. This censorship is immoral. Shame on the BBC's cover up and shame on the government's support of Israel's recent war crimes.",
