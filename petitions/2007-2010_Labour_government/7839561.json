We would like a full, independent, public, inquiry to be instigated to enable a full investigation to take place into what went wrong and why action was not taken earlier. We would like the inquiry to make recommendations as to how the process, or law, could be improved to ensure that this sort of unacceptable suffering never happens again.",
