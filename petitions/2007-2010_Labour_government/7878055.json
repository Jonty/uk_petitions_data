            "background": "Ama Sumani is suffering from a malignant myeloma that would normally be treated with a bone marrow transplant. Ama did not qualify for such treatment in the UK. Further to this, on Wednesday, 9 January 2008 she was deported to Ghana because she did not qualify under the Border and Immigration Agency's \"exceptional circumstances\" provision.\n\nHealth care in Ghana is private and unaffordable to Ama; without essential treatment she will only have weeks to live.\n\nFar from being abolished in 1965, this is a barbaric death sentence and must be reversed.",
