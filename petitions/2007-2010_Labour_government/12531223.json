            "background": "Door supervisors are currently able to work without any training in control and restraint techniques. This leaves customers and other door staff in danger. The role requires intervention in violent incidents, and many door supervisors see outbreaks of violence every night. Physical intervention training should be a mandatory requirement for SIA courses in order to protect customers from dangerously inexperienced door supervisors.",
