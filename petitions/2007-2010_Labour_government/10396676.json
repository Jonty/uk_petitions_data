        "background": "Britain is struggling to become healthy. The number of obese people is increasing each year and a sedentary lifestyle is normal for most Britons. One way to address this would be to introduce Health and Fitness Vouchers along the same lines as Childcare vouchers. Childcare vouchers come directly from your salary before tax therefore saving most people about 30% by way of a salary sacrifice. If the same option was available for Health and Fitness it may be easier to motivate the country to become healthier.",
