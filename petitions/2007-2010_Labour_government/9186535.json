        "background": "I believe that this Government has damaged this country more then any war or waring invaders in history. I am proud of England but fail to see anything from this Government that supports England or its culture or way of life. we have very few English industries to be proud of. we have no English flag we can fly without upseting visitors to this land of ours I would want to know why the English are second best,  even with this Government. I do not see this Government showing any sign that we are the best country in the world other than for imergration. I do fear that we will have a mullti cultural state but no longer an England. I have no problem with the colour of anyones skin but fail to understand why i should upset or offend anyone in my own country when I want to show I am proud of being English. so when will I/we see any differance in the way this Government acts and supports and protects the English culture and way of life and the English people.",
