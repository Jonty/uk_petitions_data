            "background": "There has been rumours for some years now that this law was to be changed, but as yet no law has been passed and mothers are having birth certificates drawn with their own decisions not to allow the father to be on the certificate, Even if the father wants to be and wants to be a part of the babies life.\n\nThis petition is to have this law put into place so many fathers get to be a part of their childs life, even if the mother decides not to for no reason. \n\nEvery child should have the right to know who there father is, especially when the mother is taking it upon herself to cut the father out of his life.  Especially if the father has done nothing wrong and just wants to be a good dad.\n\nSome children would do anything to have a dad, so why should those who want to be a dad be shut out !!!!!!",
