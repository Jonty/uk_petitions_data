        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At the moment the law surrounding contact after a separation and divorce has an implicit assumption that both parents are going to behave in a reasonable way that is in the best interests of the children. Sadly this is not always true. Occasionally the Parent with Residential Care (PRC) has the desire and time to poison the children's minds against the Non-Resident Parent (NRP) and convince them that they do not want to see the NRP. For a child over the age of 10 their wishes are paramount; so the indoctrination of a PRC can cause the relationship with an innocent NRP to disintegrate. If the law operated from the healthier premise that the best situation for the children is that contact with BOTH parents is to be promoted for the children\u2019s emotional well being then untold harm would be avoided. There would also be a fortune saved in court fees and legal aid as the PRC who is setting out to turn their children against the NRP would know that they can only succeed in the short-term.",
