Our children are bombarded by American \u2018culture\u2019 from an early age as there are no longer many British children\u2019s programmes. British films are heavily outnumbered by big budget Hollywood blockbusters which show life mainly from an American angle.\n\nEven though Microsoft can publish software in dozens of languages, they still cannot do it in English. \u2018Color\u2019 and \u2018 Favorites\u2019 are just two words that leap out at you in Windows. We have Drive Thru, all nite cafes, meters, and licenses. Solicitors have vanished to be replaced by Lawyers. The list is endless.\n\nShould we follow the French example and introduce legislation to protect our language and culture?",
