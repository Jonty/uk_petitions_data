        "background": "There is a marked lack of accountability and transparency within the goverment relating to all decision making issues. As part of being honest and open, the goverment should make available all expenditure documentation so that the general public can see where its taxes are going. The goverment should also take responsibility for all its actions and if needs be, be  willing to resign if proven to have behaved in a way that underminds the integrety of the goverment and its responsibility to govern this country in an honest and open way.",
