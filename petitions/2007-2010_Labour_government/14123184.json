            "background": "It is estimated that British Sign Language is the first or preferred language of between 50,000 and 70,000 people in the UK. Hearing impaired people who use BSL are united by a shared culture, community and history; BSL is fundamental to their self-esteem and social well being. For those who find spoken language more difficult to access than sign language, provision of information and education in BSL is especially important. \n\nOfficial teaching of BSL in schools would bring clear benefits to the hearing and hearing impaired people in terms of improved communication within today's society . Teaching would also promote better knowledge and understanding of the language as a whole and formally acknowledge the status of BSL as one of the UK's four most widely used indigenous languages.",
