They do not provide for those who wish to sing and stand.\n\nPeople get very confused today on whether to stand or sit and even the stewards and police do not really know whether to tell the fans to sit or not. \n\nTo avoid this confusion, all football clubs should be able to reserve sections of a stand or an entire stand where standing is permitted. This way, those who want to stand can buy a ticket in that area/stand and those who do not can buy a ticket any where else in the stadium.\n\nSeating would not have to be removed for such an idea to go ahead and the idea costs near to nothing to organize.\n\nIt appears to be so easy to organize and it would mean that :\n\n-Football atmospheres would improve\n-No confusion over standing/sitting\n-No safety concerns",
