One, that any woman found to have made false rape claims will be immune from prosecution and will continue to enjoy anonymity. Two, that bail will only be granted to men who make full and frank confessions of guilt immediately after arrest. Three, that the presumption of innocence, a tradition that goes back centuries, be suspended in rape and sexual assault cases\nHow can this be justice if women are going to be getting away with making bogus rape alligations, and then get away with it and on top of that the man wont be released unless he admits he did it even if he didnt",
