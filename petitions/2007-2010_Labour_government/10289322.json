            "background": "gun crime has not fallen in this country since the 'hand gun ban' so why are so many decent 'shooters' punished. i propose that the government let 'firearm certificate' holders use hand guns that are kept at there relative clubs as in section 7.3,which means they would never be a threat on the street because they would not be allowed out of the club.   but be allowed to purchase modern handguns to partake in shooting disciplins like pp1,pp2 the met 1500 etc. this would help 'gun clubs' survive and fill for many the void of not using hand guns.and allow poeple to train legally in this country for events around the world like the olympics.",
