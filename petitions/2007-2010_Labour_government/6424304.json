        "background": "Public awareness of prostate cancer remains worryingly low. Despite the efforts of many charities committed to tackling prostate cancer, too many men do not even know where their prostate is or what it does, let alone how to spot potential symptoms of cancer and where to seek help. There is a need to do much more to raise awareness of prostate cancer which is now the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in men in the UK. Every year 35,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 men die from the disease. We call on the Prime Minister to ensure that the forthcoming Cancer Reform Strategy sets out how the Government intends to raise awareness, as well as what funding it is prepared to devote to awareness raising programmes.",
