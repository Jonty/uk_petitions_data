        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "By modifying steps in this way it will make everyone in society be able to access services in the community. It would make an incredible difference to *1000\u2019s of wheelchair and pushchair users and families in the UK.  I have such a strong passion to get this done, so parents/grandparents and wheelchair users/carers can have an improved outdoor lifestyle and maybe encourage people to ditch their cars and use their feet which will make a great difference to our environment.\nThe Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires reasonable adjustment to remove barriers from disabled people's participation by employers and service providers. Within the European Parliament the politicians have fought for a new Anti-Discrimination Directive so that people are able to do their jobs and live their lives free from obstacles limiting their access to goods and services, and I believe that this new directive has the capacity to make a positive impact on millions of peoples\u2019 lives right across the EU \u2013 including wheelchair useres \u2013 and it will apply to clients and consumers, as well as employees.",
