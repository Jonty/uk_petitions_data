        "action": "Condemn the new legislation in Dublin to ban certain breeds of dog.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Dublin City Council has recently banned 11 breeds of dog (including Rottweilers, Bull Terriers and German Shepherds) from all their properties, including houses, flats and estates. Existing tenants are being given a chance to rehome their animals, but if alternative accommodation can't be found, then the dogs will be destroyed. It also seems likely that these breeds will be banned from public parks - which means dog owners living in private accommodation will also be affected.  The Prime Minister should add his voice to condemnation of this action.",
