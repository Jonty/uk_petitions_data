        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In recent years speed limits have been quit rightly reduced on many A and B roads. Now we have the anomalous situation where it is legal to travel at 60mph on narrow Country Lanes where there are no footpaths and far more hazards such as walkers, cyclists, horse riders, farm livestock not to mention wildlife. Often because of speed cameras on main roads, some drivers use Country lanes as a speedway. I would like to see the limit reduced from 60mph to 50mph and less where there are dwellings.",
