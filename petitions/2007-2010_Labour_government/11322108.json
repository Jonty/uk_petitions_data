            "background": "Please rethink the current policy of measuring ambulance service efficiency, namely Call Connect.\n\nTo achieve this standard ambulance trusts are forced into moving the bulk of their resources into large towns and cities, thereby discriminating against the rural population. Although this isn't deliberate, it is unavoidable if trusts are to secure their funding.\n\nMany trusts are also being forced into placing as many paramedics as possible on cars, so a paramedic gets there within 8 minutes. But has to wait ages to get the patient to hospital.\n\nTo base ambulance service funding simply on a time basis is unrealistic,discriminatory, unachieveable and places the crews in danger from accident and in danger from accident.\n\nAlso the rural population are also tax payers an ddeserve the right to an ambulance just as quickly as the urban population.\n\nWe urge a major rethink on this method of measurement. A system that has existed for over 30 years and has not been changed much in all that time. Please consider, a life is not worth a stastistic.",
