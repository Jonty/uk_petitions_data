            "background": "Heathrow is a vital economic lifeline to the UK, and without doubt one of the biggest bottlenecks to UK infrastructure. The Aggregate Supply shift as a nation, should Heathrow be expanded, will bring benefits to all if this airport is allowed to react to the demand that customers and businesses put on it. There are some who lose out in the form of residents near Heathrow, but surely they must have understood the implications of moving near the worlds busiest airport, and certainly benefitted from reduced house prices when buying their properties.",
