It will create an unfair league, ignoring the concept of all teams playing each other once at home and once away under the same conditions. It is bad for the fans as many will be unable to travel to support their team. It is bad for the players as we are always told they play too many games. \n\nIt is a bad idea, motivated by how much more cash can be accumulated by the bigger clubs.",
