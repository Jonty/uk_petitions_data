            "background": "As we are meant to be a Nation that is more concerned with environmental issues and public transport, why not ease up one of the worst roads in the U.K and bring back the old trainline from Aberystwyth to Carmarthen. This will enable Wales to create a connection throughout the country from north to south, without having to use a bus that take around 5 hours to go to Cardiff. A trainline will bring more business to Aberystwyth, as the road connection is appalling. Wales is the only country in Europ without a conection running from north to south. Even the poorest countries have this! Why do we need to go back in time after Lord Beeching's worst decision ever?",
