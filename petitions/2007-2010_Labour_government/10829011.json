            "background": "Stop encouraging immune strains of bacteria. Stop putting antibiotics in domestic cleaners, industrial washes, farm animal production \"promoters\", and most other things. Antibiotics are justified when an infection is identified, but not as an indiscriminate preventative which will always have a side effect of establishing immune strains of bacteria.\n\nAlso, look at licencing the available bacteriophages as a treatment for MRSA. These are natural virus like particles that \"eat\" bacteria. They kill mrsa etc. and are everywhere naturally. A different 'phage for each bacteruim strain. Phage treatment has been in successful use in the EU (Poland, Checzk Republic) for many years (they didn't have access to western drugs during Hitler's war or under Stalin). Importantly, it has no immunity build up. The UK government knows all this, and as an EU member would be able to licence it for immediate use here, but has not done so, instead it delays and repeats the research.",
