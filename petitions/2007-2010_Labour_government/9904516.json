            "background": "While expensive, raising the National Insurance threshold to match the starting rate of tax would redress the loss of the 10% tax bracket.\nIn effect instead of paying 10% Income Tax and 11% NI the former starting rate band would pay just 20% Tax and no NI.\nThis would have a noticeable cost, but funding for this could be considered by looking at introducing a 50% top rate of tax for very high incomes, or freezing the current top-rate threshold to gradually redress tax revenues.\nSchemes that National Insurance was earmarked for would be assigned a contribution from Tax Revenues to balance the figures - the main benefit over just changing tax thresholds would be that this would further simplify the tax structure and benefit the very lowest earnesr",
