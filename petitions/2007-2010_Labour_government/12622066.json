            "background": "I think its a disgrace that people should pay for glasses in order to see, do their job etc. It's not their fault if their parents and other members of their family have poor eyesight.\n\nI have a medical condition called Keratoconus and in the past 2 years, I had to have 4 prescriptions. Each time, the lenses cost \u00a3200 time. Now I'm on NHS contact lenses and they cost \u00a352.90 each and if I need to change the prescription after 3 months of issuing them, I got to pay another \u00a3105.80 for the pair. \n\nI agree frames shouldn't be covered as its a personal choice if you go for cheap or designer frames.",
