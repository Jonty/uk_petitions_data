        "background": "The British Government is responsible for abortions across the world by supporting the United Nations Population Fund, which, amongst other things, contributes to the one child policy in China.  Every year, millions of pounds of tax payers' money is thus spent destroying the lives of unborn children. It is disgraceful to force the British public to support such barbaric policies, especially when many of us morally oppose abortion and contraception.",
