We believe this is completely unnecessary, given the circumstances of his wife's death. We petition the Prime Minister to give Mr. Cabrera a work visa that will be valid for one year. If during this time he finds a permanent job, he should be allowed a permanent work visa that would replace the one that became void upon his wife's death.",
