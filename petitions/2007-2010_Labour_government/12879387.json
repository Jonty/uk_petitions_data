            "background": "That Sir John Chilcott has stated that 'all documents sent to him will remain secret' is direct evidence that he has been got at by the government. None of these documents can have any relevance to ongoing operations because they were letters of complaint from senior army officers about, then, ongoing problems which can have no bearing with what is going on in the army now or in the future.  This continued deception aimed only at  protecting the current and last prime ministers of this country from revelations of what they actually did, or did not do, as the case may be,  cannot be allowed to obtain.",
