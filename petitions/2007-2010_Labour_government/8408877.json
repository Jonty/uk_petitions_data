        "background": "I am in full time employment and would like to study for national recognised qualifications but cannot because local colleges do not offer GCSE's and A levels to Adult learners whom are wanting to do them after work, they either have to give up work or take time off to fit courses in  and in the most part they would not qualify for any help finacally. If you claim benefits or do not work you are encouraged and paid to attend courses this is not fair.",
