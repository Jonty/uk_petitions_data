        "action": "End the practice of \"Open Mic Nights\" and entitle, by law, contracted performers to be paid.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Certain operators within licenced and un-licenced venues for live music are exploiting performers by offering slots on Open Mic Nights. The venue will benefit from increased takings but the performers are not entitled to even the national minimum wage pro-rata. The costs involved for the performer are often considerable and preparations for performances can expend a lot of time and resources. Often the people are young and unemployed, seeking to start a career in the entertainment business. Revenue from a successful career will generate taxation,jobs and security but these potential earners are still being exploited by an increasing number of venues and operators. It is the only industry that has the bottom rungs of the ladder missing !\n\nI propose that if such an entitlement to earn was implemented a large number of unemployed people could return to the workplace.\n\nPlease sign the petition if you would like to help improve the future of our up and coming entertainers. Help to stop the exploitation.",
