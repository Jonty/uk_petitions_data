            "background": "Budget Airlines (among others) have been enjoying fuel tax and VAT concessions for too long. This makes them cheap to travel on, and therefore the first choice for even medium-distance journeys. On the flip side, \"Carbon Neutral\" forms of transport, such as Eurostar, pay VAT on their electricity. An end needs to be put to this by charging airlines tax on their fuel, and putting this revenue towards better, cheaper, forms of low carbon transport, such as electric high speed rail infrastructure, and electric light commuter rail serving metropolitan areas, such as trams. This revenue should also be invested into \"clean\" transport research.\nSign this petition and show the government that you're interested in cleaner, more efficient transport, and a brighter future for Britain.",
