            "background": "Make it a legal requirement for vehicle manufacturers to make available to the public all vehicle servicing and repair information as held in the manufacturers workshop manuals and technical information systems after a fixed date (suggest 2 years) from when that model was originally introduced to the UK market.  This will make it easier for independent garages to perform servicing and repairs on modern vehicles, should improve quality of repairs as repairers will have access to all relevant information and improve competition.",
