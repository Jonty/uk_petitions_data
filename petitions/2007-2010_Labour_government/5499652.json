        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At this moment in time I hear that there may be laws introduced to ban smoking in privately owned vehicles.  If this law comes into force this could mean that you will not be allowed to smoke in your own vehicle whilst driving on the public highway as this would be considered to be distracting you from driving safely and you could be subject to a fine.  In short you could face the same prosecution from smoking in your car as if you were caught using the mobile phone.  I feel that this law would be detrimental to road safety and would lead to an increase of road rage incidents and accidents, as smokers would undoubtedly be more agitated because of nicotine deprivation.  I also feel that there are more pressing agendas that need serious attention and the time has come to stop segregating the smokers from the rest of society and treating them as if they were lepers in a colony.",
