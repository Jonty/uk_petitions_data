            "background": "Too many local Surgeries operate a \"book on the morning\" policy for appointments. If you want to book an appointment you are told to ring back within an \"hour window\" on the morning you would like the appointment. As everyone is ringing at the same time, you simply can't get through. Many surgeries do this simply to achieve targets. An appointment should be booked when it is convenient to the patient. These policies should be banned now or the targets removed.",
