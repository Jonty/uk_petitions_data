        "action": "Pay service charges for those who are unemployed and have a leasehold mortgage,",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I have just been made redundant after spending eight years in Electronics. I pay two lots of Service charges on my leasehold mortgaged flat for Land and Flat management - the total amount is \u00a3580 per year. If I don't pay these costs then my lease is void and I could lose my flat. The local council Northampton are not giving me any help with these costs because I have a mortgage and don't rent. Ironically those who rent in my block of flats get their full rents paid by the Council if they are unemployed and the landlords get their services charges paid by the rent money obtained. I am annoyed by how the system penalises those of us who have worked and paid taxes. Many people I know in Council Housing have no intention of working officially as they get their rents and council taxes paid - they only do cash in hand jobs. People like myself with morgages want to work to pay off our mortgages. The system is unfair yet nothing is being done about this. Last time I was unemployed this unfairness caused me to develop manic depression due to having to go to court over unpaid service charges.",
