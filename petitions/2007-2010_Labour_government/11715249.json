            "background": "My partner has just been made redundant from a job he has worked in for nearly 8 years.\n\nFirstly the job seekers allowance that he can claim is pitiful at the best.  \u00a360 a week, is disgusting.  \n\nSecondly, when I rang the council today to ask if we were entitled to any discount on our council tax, I was told No becasue I earn over \u00a310,000 a year.  I work 36 hours per week in retail and earn \u00a311,500 a year.\n\nThirdly, I rang the benefit office to see if I could claim working tax credits.  I was told NO because it is not the end of the financial year. \n\nI am a very proud person, and do not wish to claim benefits.  However,  we will need help to pay our mortgage and bills until my partner finds(hopefully) a new job!  \n\nWhy after working full time for a combined nearly 20 years, paying tax and national insurance contibutions, should we not be entitled to help when we need it?\n\nIt seems that this government has all it's priorities wrong and supports those who DO NOT work and contribute.  Something is very wrong.",
