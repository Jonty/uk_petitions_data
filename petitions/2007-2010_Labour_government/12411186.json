            "background": "Rail travellers in standard class often have to endure very crowded and potentially unsafe conditions at peak times, and frequently do not obtain a seat despite paying full fare. These trains usually include two or three first class carriages which may be almost empty. Capacity and comfort would be greatly improved if these carriages were standard class. The relevant minister should convene discussions directed towards abolition of first class travel in the London area in peak hours, with a view to extending the principal to other areas.",
