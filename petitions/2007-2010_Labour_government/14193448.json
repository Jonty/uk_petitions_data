            "background": "Not to do this can cause immense anxiety to people who may be affected by these announcements.  For instance one of the provisions in the Budget of 9th December was to raise the age at which pensioners could get concessionary travel (i.e. Freedom Passes); these passes expire on 31st March so, as someone who holds such a Pass (which is very useful in getting around London especially since I can't drive), I suffered a lot of anxiety wondering whether I would be affected.  \n\nI did phone Age Concern, and my Local Authority Accessible Transport office, but neither could give me any definite information probably because, as stated in the petition title, the details hadn't been worked out!  This is just one issue I know about, because it affects me personally, but there must be many more which potentially affect a considerable number of people.",
