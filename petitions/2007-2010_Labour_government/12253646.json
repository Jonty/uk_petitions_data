            "background": "Models Direct based in Norwich have one of the worst reputations in the modelling world, alot of people will agree.\nWe all would very much like to see the government outlaw up-front fees; no work - no fee because of agencies like this.\nThousands of young people and small families of the UK are being conned by this agency. Its suprisingly high the amount of faces they attract each year. They send out alot of very convincing leaflets which look professional, letters saying you have been accepted by their panel but once you have paid you never hear from them again. I have known many people who have had their fingers burnt by models direct the money they ask for in return of nothing is wrong.\nPlease sign this petition in hope of the governments help.",
