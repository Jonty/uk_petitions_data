Thus cutting it, mutilating it and tampering with it in any way is considered blameworthy and unlawful. \nMoreover, in carrying out a post-mortem, the body of the deceased person will be stripped naked. This, in itself, is also not permitted.\n\nWe as Muslim Brothers and Sisters need to support each other and spread the message to one another about how wrong and shameful it is for this country to allow post-mortem examinations.",
