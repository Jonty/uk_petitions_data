        "action": "instruct all providers of public transport to make services using single-decker buses twice as frequent as those using double-deckers",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The obvious reason for this is that single-deckers are much smaller than double-deckers and can therefore accommodate far fewer passengers.  At the moment they can become intolerably crowded and this can also mean passengers further along the route being unable to get on to one bus; and therefore (obviously) having to wait for the next which may also be too full to take on any more passengers.  If the Government is serious about the environment, and about reducing the carbon footprint caused by cars, it will accede to the request in this petition.",
