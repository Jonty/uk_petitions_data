            "background": "As the current climate stands, many jobs in this country are being lost. At this time we are being very strict with how we spend money, so this is causing more jobs to be lost. This is obviously a huge problem and so far our best attempt so far has been to spend our way out of it. \nProtests have started now demanding British jobs for British workers. This is what we were promised by the prime minister himself. This will turn from peaceful to violent unless dealt with correctly.\nI believe that our government cannot effectively handle this problem with our current position in the EU.\nWhile we are struggling with our economy, we should call more temporary measures to help ourselves.\nI personally believe the EU is a great thing, but we need to be able to govern ourselves much more than we are able to due to all the countries in the EU being different.",
