        "background": "Now that devolution has taken off, Westminster has very little say over the day-to-day affairs of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Issues such as education and health are no longer the business of the MPs of these constituent countries, as Westminster is only responsible for England in these fields.  Why should MPs from other parts of the UK be able to make decisions over another part; decisions which have no effect on their constituents?  One MP per jurisdiction for the three aforementioned constituent countries would suffice in covering the Westminster issues involving their constituents.  They should be allowed no say in matters solely affecting England.",
