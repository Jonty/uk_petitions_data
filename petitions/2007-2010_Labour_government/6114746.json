            "background": "The banning of ball games in open, public spaces is completely self-defeating:\n\n(i) It further drives young people onto streets where they are more likely to be drawn into anti-social behaviour.\n\n(ii) It adds to the lack of exercise amongst the young. Most people do not have gardens in which to play informal sport.\n\n(iii) It does not encourage the development of sporting ability. Contrast with Brazil, where football is played in every available space.\n\nObviously this should not apply where there is reasonable belief that damage will ensue to private property. But otherwise, we should encourage our public spaces to be used for exercise and fun.",
