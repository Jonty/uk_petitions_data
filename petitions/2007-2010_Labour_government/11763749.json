            "background": "The NHS screening programme is currently for women aged 25-49 they have a screening test every three years, soon to be every 5 years so i hear. Everything has to be cost effective all the time, offering women tests every three years is the most cost effective. Abnormal cells take between 5 - 20 years to develop into Cancer so 3 yearly is fine for some. However some women will have normal cervical screening results, to results showing cancer within in 2 years so these are the ones for whom the programme lets down.\n\nYoung women have been found to have abnormal cells during routine smears, some are normal development changes BUT for some it isn`t normal, this would cost them their life due to the current programme.\n\nWomen who have become parents are told no when booking for a cervical screen - This is a risk! Anyone who is sexually active and had babies should be screened as this is when your at risk of cervical problems occurring.\n\nSome statistics have shown that a woman\u2019s risk of cervical cancer is cut by 84% if she has a smear test every five years, and a high 91% if she has a smear every three years. Look how many lives could be saved each year. It is common and it is a horrible cancer so please sign.",
