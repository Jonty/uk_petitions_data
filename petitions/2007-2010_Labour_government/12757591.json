            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "For a minicab office to operate in London it needed to have planning permission. This was to stop offices opening up wherever they thought was appropriate, rather than where the licensing authorities thought appropriate. \n\nIn March 2007 this law was revoked, and has resulted in minicab offices opening up all over London, many in totally inappropriate locations.\n\nAlmost every pub, club and restaurant has its own band of mincab drivers now working from it. Many 'offices' have been set up in hallways or share premesis with barbers, internet shops etc.\n\nThis is endangering the public. Health and safety rules are no longer a consideration as planning permission was not required. There is less driver accountability as it is much harder to track a driver who works out of a pub than it is one who works from an established office.\n\nIt has also resulted in long queues of minicabs waiting on the streets, and the inevitable touting that this encourages.\n\nThe legislation must be re-instated.",
