            "background": "People affected by Heathrow airport and airport expansion plans should be generously compensated, in many cases so that can move away from the area.  This potentially very large expenditure should then be factored in to the true cost of maintaining and expanding Heathrow airport.  If the true cost, including the human mistery costs, were known then perhaps there would be less pressure to make Heathrow the biggest and busiest airport in the world.  Also, when members of the public start resorting to anti-social publicity stunts such as thowing custard on ministers this is a sure sign that large numbers of people feel that their plight is being ignored.  When is the government going to learn this lesson?",
