            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "After a heavy snowfall, particularly in urban areas, many pavements are left untreated and quickly become dangerous due to packed snow becoming ice. Since many councils do not make any effort to treat the pavements, we would like the government to introduce a bill placing the burden of responsibility on home and business owners so that they should clear the pavements in front of their home or business within 24 hours of a snowfall or face a fixed penalty fine. This law is tried and tested in many countries which have regular periods of heavy snow, and would result in a far lower incidence of snow-related injuries to pedestrians.",
