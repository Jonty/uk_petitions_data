            "background": "Scrapping the 10% rate band was a real gaffe by the Government, a Labour government at that, which hits the poorest in Society. Many of those affected do not fall within the scope of tax credits or over-65 allowances, so pay considerably more tax from their already low incomes. Mr Brown should 'limit the damage' by admitting the error, and putting it right.",
