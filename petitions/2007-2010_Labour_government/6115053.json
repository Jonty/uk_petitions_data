There will be some loss of farmland etc, but the area surrounding Ormskirk is hardly short of it.\n\nThis road will allow for better transport of people and goods around the local area, and will remove many of the lorries from the roads of Ormskirk town centre.\n\nOrmskirk and the area needs this bypass to be built.\n\nPlease sign this petition to ensure that the the \"No\" petition is ignored.",
