            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We in Britain have long since abolished this form of punishment. Killing someone is illegal. Capital punishment is a cruel and barbaric punishment which not only ends the life of one man, but affects his family and friends, who should not have to suffer for his crimes.The main aims of prison are deterrent, punishment and rehabilitation.But the death penalty fulfils none of these aims -- murder cases are more common in states with the death penalty than those without it, so it is not an effective deterrent.In terms of punishment, life in prison can be worse than capital punishment, and in no way can capital punishment be 'rehabilitating'.Many people are wrongly convicted- if imprisoned, they can be released, but if executed, there is no way back. Therefore I call on the Prime Minister to use his considerable influence on the United States in conjunction with a Democratic President in order to set in motion laws to bring about the end of capital punishment.",
