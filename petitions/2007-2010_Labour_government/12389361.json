            "background": "Certain states in the USA are now making official policy to cease raiding cannabis laboratories proven to supply strictly for medicinal usage. We as a country however seem to be regressing in respect to this particular issue.\n\nThe law in relation to thc is vague at best so why not commercialize it and tax the hell out of it like you do cigarettes. However rational an idea this may be, perhaps leave it up to people to decide for themselves how they want to pollute their lungs.\n\nOn the most serious of notes if someone can get pain relief and reduce the severity of their symptoms from various ilnesses through a small medicinal dose of this narcotic then at least make a business out of it so that quality can be controlled.... who knows this may have a rather positive effect on the economy!..\n\nand for those of you who disagree, the stuff is already available to pretty much anyone anytime so the likelyhood of any noticable detrimental effect on society would be reasonably slim.",
