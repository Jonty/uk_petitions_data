            "background": "I am a 36 yr old mother of 3. When I was at school we were scared of our teachers. Not in a bad way, but in a way that meant we knew when we had pushed our luck and then knew not to do it again. The same was with the police, we all knew our local bobbies. There was usually one that we all respected and got on well with and one that we all feared so always behaved our selves. Now adays kids know that the teachers and police have no power over them at all. All this knife and gun crime is coming from the generation that have been brought up under the ridiculous human rights, do gooders way of life where the criminal's are treated like the victim and usually have more rights and the victim are usually forgotten about. How many more kids, fathers, mothers etc have to be killed before anyone is brave enough to make a stand.",
