            "background": "Currently there is no national standard for policing road racing in the UK, which, if the local police force decide not to support an event, the event cannot be run for liability reasons. This does little to encourage cycling as a healthy sporting activity, nor promote cycling as an environmental means of transport.\n\nWhilst the Government and Seb Coe is pushing for sporting excellence in the run up to the 2012 Olympics and beyond, lack of support at local level is hindering future world class talent and a bid for Olympic future medals.\n\nPolice forces may have a very good safety reason for not supporting an event but at the moment there are no frameworks or costing procedures in place by which a decision is taken.",
