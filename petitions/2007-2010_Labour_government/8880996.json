        "background": "The Scouting movement describe themselves on their website and in other materials as \"inclusive\" and \"open to all\", and have received funding on the basis of their inclusivity. However, far from being committed to equal opportunities, the Scouting movement discriminates against young people with no religious faith (65% of 12-19 year olds according to a DfES survey) via the requirement to make the Scout promise to God. Adults who wish to gain their warrant are also excluded, although volunteers are always needed and some groups are forced to close through a shortage of warranted leaders. The Guide Association has similar policies.\n\nThis petition offers the solution of an alternative promise to enable those with no religious faith to join, relying on humanist and secular principles.",
