            "background": "Social services often DO NOT listen and with full attention when with a client.Records of many people are written incorrectly.If able to prove things within their records are incorrect, clients are unable to get these records changed.\nWe cannot complain about it as complaints are dealt with by social services who stick together and seem to have no superior body to monitor them.We can disagree with records and have this put in writing, attatched to the file but this does not change the records or make them realise they have got it wrong. In questioning social services they make things worse for us by adding to their records that we are difficult and argumentative. If they are involved in court cases they then go against us because we disagreed with them. This is WRONG, especially when you get your own legal team warning you against disagreeing with social services because they will use it against you in court.\nWe need to get this changed to save more people being wrongly judged/condemned by this agency.We need to be able to get our records changed when they are proved to be incorrect, and have the incorect records deleted.This should apply to both children and adults.",
