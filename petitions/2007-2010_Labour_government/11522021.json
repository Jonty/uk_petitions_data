            "background": "We think that it is important to become one with our woodland friends. \n\nWorking together, we can achieve this by:\n\n-Making badgers, foxes, deers and squirrels common household pets. \n\nFoxes eat earthworms, rabbits, rodents, insects and carrion. Imagine your garden being free of those pests!\n\n-Bluebells, Daffodils, Corncockle and other woodland flora into wreathes and garlands, which can then be purchased at selcted retailers. This can improve companies businesses during the recent economic downturn.\n\nThe new jobs created will decrease the level of unemployement, and introduce more competative markets for household pets and flowers; keeping inflation low whilst contributing to sustainable economic growth.",
