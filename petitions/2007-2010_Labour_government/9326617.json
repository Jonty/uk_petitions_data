The plant and animal species is spectacular. And the grounds are almost a thousand years old. King Robert Bruce was the first recorded owner. \n\nAnd now the trees are being burned down, the visitors are being mugged and gangs of youths looking for the next fight stalk the dark woods at night.\n\nSomething needs done!\n\nBourtreehill Medieval Estate,\nBourtreehill, \nIrvine,\nAyrshire.",
