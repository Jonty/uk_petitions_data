North, South, West Yorkshire and East Riding should become the county of \"Yorkshire\", while East and West Sussex should just be \"Sussex.\" There should be no North East Lincolnshire, just \"Lincolnshire\", while Greater Manchester and Merseyside should be returned to the county of Lancashire. Such a move would slash bureaucracy, red tape and simplify politics.",
