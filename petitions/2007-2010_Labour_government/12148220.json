            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "One of the most frustrating issues currently facing the UK is the poor state and condition of the rail and underground networks. In the winter trains are delayed due to the snow & rain. Summer, trains are delayed due to expanding railway track. Autumn, trains are delayed due to leaves on the track. The UK is a 1st world country and should operate as such especially the railways we pay so heavily in rail fare for. Many individuals travel for up to two hours each way to get to work and back which is only further frustrated by delayed trains and being forced to use the railways due to high congestion charges imposed by local councils. With the recession, the construction industry was the first to feel the effects and subsequently, a vast majority of redundant workers are from this industry. I would like to propose the UK government create employment for all the redundant construction workers to assist the companies who are currently mending and repairing the railways/undergrounds & roads so we can get the network to a 1st world status.",
