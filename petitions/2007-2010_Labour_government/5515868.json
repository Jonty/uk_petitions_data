It's about time that the people who attack our country in order to cause maximum damage and chaos do not get a trial that costs the tax payer money or get a warm cell with decent food in a prison! Gordon Brown should reintroduce the sentence of capital punishment and condemn terrorists to death to show that Britain has firm policies against terrorism and to gain justice for the families that lose their relatives in grave circumstances.",
