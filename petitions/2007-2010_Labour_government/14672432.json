            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "During the period of snow and ice at the beginning of January (2010) I wrote to my local authority to ask why side streets had not been gritted; I recently received a reply saying that this was \"due to central government restrictions on the amount of grit available\".  Why were there such restrictions?  What can be more important than enabling people to get around safely?  \n\nIf the reason is cost surely the cost of this is greatly outweighed by the cost of treating injuries caused by slipping on the ice; plus, possibly, the cost to the economy caused by people being unable to work due to their injuries.  I would also make a point about the human cost of these injuries: pain, possible loss of mobility, etc. \n\nThe point may be made that it's more important to grit the roads since accidents caused by vehicles are more serious than those caused by people slipping on the pavement.  I might agree that this is valid but why should there be a conflict: either the roads or the pavements?",
