        "background": "My mother currently has moderate alzheimers,she was diagnosed with this terrible illness when she was 51 she is now 56,she desperatly needs this drug rember to be released now rather than later as her condition is deterioating,I think the public have a choice whether they go on the trials or risk taking the full strength of the drug rember,as most peoples hopes are getting on these trials,and they could be quickly dashed when they receive the placebo in the trials,which is very unfair,i know my mother and proberbly every person with this illness would take the drug rember in a bid to help save their lives regardless if there were side effects,is there not a way to give people the choice...by them signing something before hand,before taking the drug,it is quite unbeleivable that there is a drug out there to give 80% of alzheimers sufferers memory back,yet it is not availabe to them,what is the world coming to,please help by signing my petition and letting those responsible for keeping this drug rember from our loved ones know how everyone feels about this subject,maybe someone out there will listen to us and have a change of heart to how things should be.",
