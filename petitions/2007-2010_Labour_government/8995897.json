            "background": "The Ghurkhas have been loyal supporters of the British Army for nearly 200 years. They have fought alongside our British soldiers in many theatres of war including Bosnia and Croatia.  Many have been decorated, at least one Ghurka has an MBE - how can you now sign their deportation orders? These wonderful soldiers and their families have more than earned their right to stay here in the UK no matter how long they have been retired. Gordon Brown, you and your government should be ashamed of the way you are treating these people especially when you let in so many \"undesirable\" criminals who do nothing to add to the betterment of our society.",
