These are the rights to a proper family with married parents, i.e. one male and one female.\n\nWhy would practicing homosexuals go to a catholic agency in the first place when they are living against the teachings of the Church?\n\n\nAlso, we the undersigned expect a proper response, i.e. not the usual piffle about \"discrimination\" and \"gays should have the right to adopt\" and that this \"has no place in the 21st century\" because that just doesn't fit with the catholic view of the family and morality, which is what catholic adoption agencies should be allowed to follow. So please: a proper response.",
