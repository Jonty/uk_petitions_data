            "background": "You blame the shops for selling alcohol/fags to under age children. We get the blame all the time but yet there are these sites that allow them to buy fake id's for as little as \u20a410. These make it hard for us specially when the kids do look old enough. I know shops use the under 21 rule some even have under 25 rule, but they do need support which they are not getting. These sites shold be banned to stop kids getting hold of fake id's so easily. I believe this would help stop the under age drinking as it wold e harder for them to buy alcohol or cigs.",
