        "background": "In the current economic crisis any bail outs using the public purse should come with a number of important considerations. One, that the process involved is intensely scrutinized to ensure that the funds are used for the right reasons and not to pay outstanding 'fact cat' bonuses or salaries, and two, that in return for public funds the major financial institutional assets are appropriated by the Govt and sold back to those institutions once the markets have recovered sufficiently so the funds can be returned to the public purse",
