            "background": "It is being widely reported that companies and householders are being advised by insurance companies to not clear snow from pavements and parking areas as it opens them up to liability should anyone later slip. Anyone making an attempt to improve access by helping to clear snow should be exempt from liability arising from accidents and falls incurred by people accessing that area during or after they have completed that work even if they fail to do the job properly. This will result in safer roads and pavements for everyone and result in less accidents overall, even if a few get it wrong.",
