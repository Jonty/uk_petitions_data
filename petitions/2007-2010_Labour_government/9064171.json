            "background": "It may be obvious with the amount of parents and guardians puchasing violent or otherwise unsuitable videogame for their children that the game rating system in Britain is failing.  The undersigned believe that this is, at least in part, due to the lack of knowledge of the general public on these matters.\n\nWe request that a major advertising campaign be brought out which:\n1. Strongly suggests that video games, although often played by children, are not JUST for children.\n2. Informs the public that there are a number of games which are unsuitable for children, and more importantly that these games are rated as being unsuitable for children.\n3. Reinforces the idea that not only is selling video games to people too young illegal, but that selling video games to adults, only for children to play them, is illegal, something which has previously been seen on other campaigns.\n\nWe believe that this will stop a large number of the problems inherent with violent or explicit video games.",
