            "background": "My paper recently reported that this gap is the widest it has been for many years.  In my opinion the main reason for this is the exorbitant rises and bonuses so many heads of companies give themselves; in comparison with the inflation-only (or even below-inflation) rises they give most of their staff.  Obviously the Government cannot legislate on pay rises so I feel the best (or only) way to attempt some sort of equalisation of incomes is to tax the lowest at, say, 5%; ranging to, say, 60 or 70% for the highest-paid heads of companies and possibly even more for sports, pop, film, etc stars paid more per week than most can dream of earning in several years.  If this seems like \"the politics of envy\" so be it; there wouldn't BE any \"politics of envy\" if everyone earned a decent salary which they felt reflected their worth to their employer and to society as a whole!",
