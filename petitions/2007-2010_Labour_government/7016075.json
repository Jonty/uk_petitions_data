            "background": "We would like to bring to your attention the issue of charging for waste collections and how this will hit those who are already often financially struggling. If you need complex clinical care at home for example home feeding ( like a drip in hospital) you will have a lot of extra rubbish each week through no fault of your own. We won't be able to afford to have the extra rubbish collected and nobody will have thought about this unless they are in the situation.",
