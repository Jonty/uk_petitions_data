            "background": "Why have bank leaders not been formally investigated? As an example, RBS have released various \"creative\" statements of their financial standing over the last 6 months, for example, 3 days before the first bail out, they stated that they were among the best capitalised banks in the world. Statements such as these are tantamount to deception and fraud. Why should the many suffer from the irresponsibility and recklessness of the few?\n\nIf found to be reckless or irresponsible should they not be charged and if they have been knighted for example, have these honours removed?\n\nTrust has been severly eroded in banks and those leading them, to rebuild this trust they need to be investigated and as appropriate, action taken. Otherwise trust in banks and the government will continue to erode until there is none left.",
