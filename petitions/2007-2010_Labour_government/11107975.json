            "background": "Building the plant \n\n1) Will have fateful effects on the local birds, wildlife and Eco system. \n\n2) Vanquish much of the hard work that many are doing across the country to reduce their carbon footprint. What is the point in throwing all of this hard work away?   \n\n3) Nuclear power is unsafe and we can never be sure what the effect of this could have on future generations. \n\n4) We should be investing in a future which uses renewable sources like wind solar and tidal energy.  \n\n5) Climate change affects the whole world this is not just a local problem, but a global one.  We need to find long term clean solutions to the growing climate crisis.",
