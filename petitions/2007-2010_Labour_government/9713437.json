Let alone the 15-30 age group.\n\nScott Mills is a popular intelligent individual who is constantly in touch (properly in touch, not just \"have a meeting\" in touch) with young people, in real terms.\n\nI believe Scott Mills would add great value to the houses of parliament in giving useful input in regarding young peoples genuine opinions and contributions.",
