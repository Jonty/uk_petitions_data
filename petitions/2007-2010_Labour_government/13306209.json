            "background": "When 'care in the community' came into being in the 80's they shifted responsibility for caring for dementia patients from the NHS to social services thus creating the situation we have now where families hard earned savings are having to be spent on paying for care for the patient. For some reason dementia does not seem to be classified as an illness anymore. Dementia is a disease of the brain and lawfully people have a right to be cared for by the NHS this has to stop, it is criminal.",
