            "background": "Early Years Professionals are being recruited in order to lead change, drive excellence throughout the early years sector, and spearhead the government's drive to tackle the poor outcomes that still dominate in areas of entrenched disadvantage.\n\nHowever, despite this crucial role in leading change it has been shown (Aspect survey, published 2009) that the average pay for an EYP is only \u00a38-\u00a39. \n\nEarly Years Professional Status is considered equivalent to Qualified Teacher Status. When recruited EYPs were told the new roles would lead to positions that had parity with the roles of teachers in schools. It is essential that to continue to recruit and retain this essential workforce, and to meet the ambitious targets the CWDC are working towards to have EYPs in every setting by 2015, similar national pay arrangements to teachers (and other professional groups such as doctors, social workers and police officers) should be put in place immediately.",
