            "background": "John Angarrack is a tireless fighter for the Cornish people, (when he's not repairing washing machines.) From his Hobbit hole in Bodmin he infrequently lambasts the dreaded English, via the medium of his vanity published book.\n\n Once he gets a spell check and learns basic grammar nothing will stop these books becoming a might weapon in bringing down the English Imperial State.\n\nHe deserves far more to be crowned Prince of Cornwall than Charles the titular head of duchy.\n\nWe call on Mr Brown to set the wheels in motion for us to have Crown Prince John!!",
