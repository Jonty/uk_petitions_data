            "background": "It cannot be assumed  that people in public office are any more (or less) honorable than the general public. The last 20 years has seen a spate of unacceptable conduct from politicians that has included:- cash for questions, gerrymandering, perjury and accusations of cash for peerages.  It is certain that there are some honorable people in politics  but mere election to office is not proof enough. I  suggest that all  titles including the word \"Honorable\"  are abolished ASAP.",
