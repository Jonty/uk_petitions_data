        "background": "Team Bath FC are, nominally, a University football team playing in the BGB Southern League Premier Division. As a University they receive government money and are effectively competing against teams whose fans subsidise their existence. State funded teams have no place in the football pyramid competing with clubs who exist facing very real financial constraints. Team Bath FC should play where they belong - in the University leagues. Team Bath exists purely as a vehicle for ex-professionals to try and get back into the full time game. Real football clubs are being denied a place higher in the pyramid as a result of Team Bath FC.",
