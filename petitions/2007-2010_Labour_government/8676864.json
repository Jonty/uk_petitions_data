            "background": "The post office has notified locals it is being forced to close.\nOur local post office is necessary provision for many elderly residents, young mothers, and other residents.\nThe local main post office often has queues for 2 hours or more and is not suitable for collecting pensions , parcels etc as within the main shopping mall.\nInstead of being able to simply walk home from the post office, residents will be forced to take the bus or drive with their parcels. Hardly eco friendly!\nWe are as a community putting together a written petition also but trust the government will step in on not just a post office closure, but a true neccessity of the community and a battle against using uneccessary transport.\nIt should not be presumed that everone has, wants, needs or can afford the internet and a local service is essential.\nBring back the ROYAL MAIL get rid of the greed that is obliterating our services.",
