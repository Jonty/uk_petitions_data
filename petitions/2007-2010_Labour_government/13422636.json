        "background": "Each year the flight of very low flying noisy aircrafts over London continues to increase. I live in Lewisham and every night we are plagued by extremely noisy planes flying over our home. Needless to say the air polution it causes. \nOur government should start subsidising and reduce the  cost of rail travel across UK and work with the EU so this happens across Europe.",
