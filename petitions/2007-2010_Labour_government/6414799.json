            "background": "We the undersigned urge the Prime Minister to scrap wasteful ministerial vehicles in favour of vehicles that have a much smaller impact on the environment.\n\nThe government have recently commissioned adverts which encourage all Britons to reduce their \u2018Carbon Footprint\u2019 (and thus that of the UK), yet government ministers seem quite content to cruise around in wasteful high-powered cars which are polluting and damaging our environment, and also compounding the global warming problem.\n \nA typical government high-powered car has a higher carbon emission than a typical 4x4 vehicle. I think this demonstrates the case perfectly. \n\n4x4 drivers are often criticised because of their vehicle\u2019s impact on the environment. \n\nIt is right therefore, that if the government expect the public to minimise their carbon footprints, that the government surrender these wasteful vehicles in favour of something more modest and environmentally friendly.",
