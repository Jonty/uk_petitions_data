        "background": "It has recently been brought to my attention that England has a fast growing new trend \" Forced Adoptions\".  This is where the UK Social Services,family courts and goverment have endorsed the removal of hundreds of children from their natural parents on the basis that there is a possibility that they might \"abuse their child emotionally\". with no evidnece of this attcully happening and on some occations as they feel there is complicated family dynamics. It is time this illegal act stopped and justice was met for all families who have been victims of forced adoptions.",
