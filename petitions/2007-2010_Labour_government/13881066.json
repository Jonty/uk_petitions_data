        "background": "Bounty hunting should be legalized in the United Kingdom, because we have a police service that doesn't deal with criminals anymore. I live in Coventry so you can probably understand why we need Bounty Hunters to deal with bail skipping Yobs, Sex Offenders who failed to register the sex offenders register, bail violators that try to leave the uk. If bounty hunters are allowed work in the uk it I'm sure it would also help the police as it would reduce the amount of time they are spending attempting to find these people.",
