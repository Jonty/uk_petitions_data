Those who want to break the rules will anyway and it's a small percentage who do. But there are many kids who actually need their teachers as support - sometimes they need a hug and sometimes the only people they feel able to talk to is a particular teacher. they can't help connecting. they need responses from these teachers. they need them to listen and be there. don't let these kids suffer.",
