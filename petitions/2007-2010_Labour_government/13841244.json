        "background": "Following the sacking of Prof. Alan Nutt, it is clear that the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is too tightly integrated with the Home Office and is not independent enough to meet the goals of its mission statement, as \"an independent expert body that advises government on drug related issues in the UK\". \n\nThe reason specified for the recent sacking of Professor Nutt is completely at odds with the purpose of the ACMD, which cannot possibly function effectively without full independence from the Home Office.\n\nA proper independent advisory council should be formed in order to allow scientists to advise the government without fear of reprisal when their findings disagree with the current public policy, and to objectively inform future debate on the subject.",
