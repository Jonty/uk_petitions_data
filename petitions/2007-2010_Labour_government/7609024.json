            "background": "Please change the law so that every employee has the right to take a break at least every three hours. That way no one ever has to go more than three hours without a break, no matter whether you work full or part time, no matter what age you are, or what position you stand within a company. \nAt the moment the current law states that only if you are working a six-hour shift or longer are you then entitled to a twenty minute break. I think this is appalling as it means you could work for five hours and forty-five minutes, nearly six hours, and still not have had a break as a part timer until you finish. \nAs this current law stands, it is not far off a full day! But only full time employees get a break, sometimes having had two breaks whilst a part timer still hasn\u2019t had any. I think this is truly unfair.\nBreaks should not depend on the duration of your shift, but should be given to you without fail at least every three hours.\nEmployers abuse this law, but everybody deserves a break.",
