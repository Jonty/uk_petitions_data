            "background": "With the well publicised failures of the CBA and more or less every EDS IT project. \n\nAs IT becomes more and more important there needs to be a body to make best use of it.\n\nIt is time the government considered creating a department responsible for looking after government IT. \n\nIt would typically be involved with \nDefining IT policy \n(Secure email, FTP etc...)\n\nCreating the defining fixed specifications and implementing National scale IT projects.\n\nThe benefits to this approach are obvious.\n\nRegain credibility.\n\nYou pay less as you are employing permanent staff (with comparable private sector packages)\n\nBuilding a knowledge base inside government so as not to be ripped off when the grunt work is outsourced.\n\nProjects become much predictable and feature creep can be better controlled.\n\nDefine a coherent national strategy, encompassing data security, reliability and accessibility so that information is useful to all, not just those using Microsoft. \n\nThere are of course drawbacks, but these are outweighed by the benefits.",
