            "background": "Julie Lake was arrested after trying to stop the desecration of a war memorial by anti social youths. No action was taken by the police against the youths yet she was arrested and charged. This is despite the police admitting they don\u2019t have the man power to protect the memorial or local residence from these anti social youths. In these cases the police must be allowed and encouraged to use common sense before our communities are completely destroyed by anti social behaviour.",
