That\u2019s the bad news!\nThere is a solution! That\u2019s the good news, read on.\n\nBy reducing interest on savings deposits the government forces savers to use their \ncapital for living  expenditure, wicked; and will create paupers in the near future out \nof  people who are not greedy, also, the inflationary pressures inevitable from this \nbehaviour will escalate the loss of capital!\n\nIt is difficult to believe that any government would deliberately engineer this result so \nwe must see this as yet another unintentional consequence. \n\nRectifying solution\n\nSavings accounts up to \u00a350000 are guaranteed secure, so regulate that interest paid on these account to be 4% above the inflation/bank rate. Simple.\n\nWE WILL VOTE for the party that supports us.",
