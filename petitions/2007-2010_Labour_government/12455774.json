        "background": "All drivers are currently considered to be equally incompetent, and are penalised to the same degree when, for example, exceeding the speed limit. This completely fails to recognise that some of us are good drivers, and have managed to drive for decades without getting involved in accidents. It is reasonable to assume that this is because we drive with more care than average, and are able to judge safe speeds at all times (unlike bureaucrats who can only judge it at peak times). Some recognition should be made of safe driving, in the same way that insurance companies recognise this in premiums.",
