            "background": "Understandably this restriction is in place to reduce the amount of new riders going out and riding large powerful motorcycles without the neccesary experience after having passed their tests. However, why should the two year restriction not apply to riders over the age of 21 taking the Direct Access Scheme (DAS).\n\nAlthough the training is identical (However the test is taken on a large capacity motocycle) people over 21 are allowed to ride any motorcycle of unlimited capacity. In my opinion this is unfair on the younger riders riding 33bhp machines, even more so as many younger riders feel discriminated against and so choose to ride machines 'illegally' by not having these machines restricted.\n\nReally, what is the difference between a 17 year old and a 21 year old if they each have the same amount of road experience?\n\nOr is this simply unneccesary in a world which constantly asks for equality? Many consider this an \"Ageist\" law. and at the increasingly high price of motorcycle restriction 'kits' the younger riders are hit the worst with the fee for installation upwards of \u00a3170 (Excluding labour)",
