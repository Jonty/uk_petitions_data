The word is so 'loaded' that no sensible debate can take place without those involved being labelled, harrassed, their names being put on websites etc etc.\n\nAll debate on such issues as immigration, community relations and  religion etc has now become so 'sensitised' that by and large it doesn't take place!  The result of that is smouldering tension which will one day surface.\n\nBritain is a country where freedom of speech has been fought for and earned as a right.  Increasingly that hard-won right is simply vanishing before our eyes!",
