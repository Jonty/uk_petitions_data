            "background": "Several recent events have highlighted the systemic poor management and culture of non-delivery within many central government civil service run departments. Rigid grading heirarchies, poorly managed staff, a culture of meetings, strategy studies and externally provided consultancy all substituting for real work and delivery.\n\nWe call on the PM to reduce the staff size of all main government departments by at least 30%; to employ a range of project, team and technical staff managers from the private sector in key positions to educate each department in 21st century working practices and procedures and encourage a culture of responsibility at all grades. Thus transforming the whitehall culture from one of managed inaction to one of delivery. Enabling those staff that remain to deliver for their departments the same services with a much reduced leaner, competent, better paid and motivated team of staff.",
