            "background": "The Green Park, which is unique, and for centuries a natural parkland, is threatened by a proposal to build a huge memorial in it, bordering Piccadilly.  It would stretch for 60 metres from Hyde Park Corner, with a building half way down. It would mean the loss of natural habitat, and change for ever the precious separation between surrounding developments and that sense of escape and calm that is this park.  The proposal contravenes many Planning Policies on Open Space, design, and \u2018Too Many Memorials\u2019 etc. The memorial would be to the 55,000 members of Bomber Command who died in the defence of the Nation in WW2. They are remembered in the RAF church of St Clement Danes in the Strand, on many memorials all over the country, and it is right that there should be.  It is not right that this emotive cause should result in the destruction of this precious land. A possible and to be preferred location in Central London would be on the Embankment. Please register your objection here.  Thank you.",
