            "background": "In a recent reply to a petition, the government said that it \"has no intention of legalising cannabis\". The reasons given are:\n\n* acute and chronic health effects\n\n* prolonged use can induce dependence\n\n* smoking, in any form, is dangerous\n\n* dangers for people with mental health problems\n\n* wrong message to the majority of young people\n\n* risk of increased drug use\n\nSince these reasons are equally applicable to tobacco and alcohol, the Government should make its position on drug use consistent. Either ban tobacco and alcohol as well, or legalise cannabis.",
