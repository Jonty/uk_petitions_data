However, it was rejected because it was \"similar to and/or overlaps with an existing petition or petitions\". When I followed the link to look at the supposedly similar petition, I found it was not even remotely similar as it said nothing about asking the PM to resign.\n\nEither the people who are employed to check the e-petitions are too stupid to read, or they are deliberately rejecting the petitions they don't like.\n\nFreedom of speech is fundamental to democracy - censorship of legitimate opinions cannot be allowed.",
