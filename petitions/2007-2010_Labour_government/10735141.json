            "background": "This government each year keeps going on about helping the low paid and elderly with the rising cost of fuel bills, and each time its the same old recteric, wall and roof installation, yes the help is good, but it only needs doing once, not each year. we need lower bills, and lower bills now. We have already been squeezed with the abolishment of the 10p tax.\nYou say that new measures are at hand and been announced,which personally and not doubt many others feel these announcements are just a plaster on a facture. I am in rented accomadations, and my landlord has done some measures,as those mentioned last year and still may bills have increased not in unts but in money.!!!!",
