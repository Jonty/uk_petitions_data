        "background": "Congratualtions to the Brown administration on bridging the gender health divide - Cervarix will be given to girls aged 12 and 13 from this September in an attempt to cut the number contracting Human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes most cases of cervical cancer.\n\nCervarix guards against two strains of the HPV virus - 16 and 18 - which cause 70% of cases of cervical cancer. \nBut the petitioner is also calling on the DoH to consider funding Gardasil, which will extend coverage to protect against strains 6, 11, 16 and 18, lesions and genital warts. One alternative that may be considered would be to vaccinate comprehensively with BOTH vaccines once pre - cancerous cells are diagnosed. This is an example, of how syndromic case management - at point of delivery, would benefit screening, detection and early treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. The Welfare State was never designed to solve all - but should still adher to the principle of \"To each according to their needs\".",
