            "background": "Residents of Sellack are opposing the construction of six new houses in a tranquil location within the Wye Valley AONB. \nPermission for the development was granted in 1995 by South Herefordshire District Council to help fund the restoration of Caradoc Court, which had been gutted by fire some years earlier. Work on the Court dragged on and last year it was sold together with the grounds and the site for the development to Councillor H Bramer. Work on the houses could not begin until all the external restoration on the Court was completed. When this had been done last December the new owner submitted revised plans for the houses to increase their bedroom accommodation. After local protests these plans were withdrawn. Now it is understood  the development site has been acquired by a builder, who \nwishes to use the permission still in force from 1995 and to start work in\nthe next two weeks.",
