        "background": "If travelling a great distance then most of this time is spent on high quality grade seperated dual carriageways and motorways, with very little through urban areas. Why can't we make these urban areas safer by rigerously enforcing lower speed limits (say 20mph), while making our journeys faster and more fun by increasing the limits (to say 90mph) on good quality roads with low accident rates. Enforcable *realistic* speed limits would also be welcome during roadworks and congestion, but not 30mph on dual carriageways because there are a few cones and no men working.",
