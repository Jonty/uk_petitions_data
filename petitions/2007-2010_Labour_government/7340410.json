            "background": "The Public expenditure Statistical Analysis 2007 on the HM-Treasury Website shows that the Government spends \u00a38,200 per inhabitant in London, compared with \u00a35,995 per inhabitant in Eastern England and \u00a36,334 per inhabitant in the East Midlands. Equalising this would ease unemployment in the regions and also alleviate many problems in London caused by the increased population as the high Government spending there draws more and more people to London.",
