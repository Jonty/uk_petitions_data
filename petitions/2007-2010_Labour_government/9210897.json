            "background": "We have served under consequent UN Mandate in Iraq as part of a Coalition since 2003. \nThe contingent in Basra have done their job and need to be brought home to the UK. \nUnder legal definition of the UN mandate there is no legal authority to keep the Basra contingent to compliment a Privatisation program. Our service personnel are not recipients of dividends from the proposed privatisation and neither are they shareholders of corporate interests in Iraq. On an ethical and moral context they should thus be brought back home to the UK. \nWe have served the UN Mandate, and within this mandate Prime Minister there are no legal grounds to keep British Forces to compliment any privatisation processes in Iraq. \nIt is thus appropriate to abdicate from our responsibility from the UN mandate as the British contingent in Iraq work has been completed. \nOn an ethical view, we have served within the auspice of the consequent UN mandate however it is untenable to have a situation where we as part of a coalition have to remain in Basra for political or as part of a compliment to privatisation process.",
