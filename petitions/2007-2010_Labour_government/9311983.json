Bank industry figures published earlier this year show \"card not present\" losses for internet, phone and mail order crime were \u00a3290.5 million last year.\n\nBut a BBC News investigation found that \u00a3500 million of fraud took place when failed attempts were taken into account.\n\nPosing as computer hackers, two BBC News journalists infiltrated a website selling thousands of card details which had been stolen online from small internet retailers.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to explain how is this possible ? legal ? unprosecutable ? What can we do about it ?",
