            "background": "Jeremy Clarkson may be popular, but that does not mean he is right. He has a record of 'joking' about serious events (the recent murder comment, boasting about speeding, when speed is a factor in a large percentage of road deaths etc) and generally supporting dangerous/illegal activities by motorists. License payers' money is being used to promote danger, when it should be used to promote safety, something the makers and presenters of Top Gear should know about, especially after Richard Hammond's near fatal crash.",
