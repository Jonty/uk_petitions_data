        "action": "take urgent action,before the next general election, to re-engage the electorate by replacing our undemocratic electoral system with a mixed member proportional system in which every vote will count in a greatly reduced number of constituencies - an electoral system that is enjoyed by the citizens of so many developed democracies.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "our first past the post(fptp) electoral system is undemocratic in that it dis-enfranchises a significant number of voters in many constituencies, contributing to low voter turn-out at elections (paricularly since the 1970's) and a parliamentry membership that does not reflect the will of the people.  the solution is to reduce the number of constituencies by merger to 50% (i.e. 300 approx) and introduce a mixed member proportional (mmp) elctoral system where voters would use one vote to elect constituency mp's by fptp and a second vote to elect 200-300 members from party lists by proportional representation (pr) with only those parties achieving 5% or more of the national vote allowed to nominate mp's from their lists, which would avoid very small unrepresntative fringe parties gaining entry to parliament.",
