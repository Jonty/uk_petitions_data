The Parliament is a profligate spender - it's time that it started radically reducing expenditures on itself. That's OUR cash, not THEIRS. Other petitions that relate to this are inadequate, I believe. What we advocate is a reduction of an MP's salary to 4000 GBP per annum (including expenses allowances).",
