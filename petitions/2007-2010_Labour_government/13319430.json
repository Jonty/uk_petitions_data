            "background": "I live in Belsize Park, North-West London, where no fewer than 4 Post Offices have closed in recent years; leaving us with none in the immediate area.  The nearest are a bus or tube ride, or a long walk, away.  However the problem isn't so much the distance to those few Post Offices still remaining as the long, standing wait, for a till to be free which obviously affects people with mobility problems and those who find standing difficult; something which applies to many pensioners.  \n\nI'm certain the problem isn't confined to Belsize Park or even London; in fact judging by the very many petitions asking for a specific Post Office to be re-opened, or not to be closed, it is prevalent all over the country.  Just petitioning about your own Post Office, however, is counter-productive, since it just means another Post Office will be closed; the only effective action is to ask for them all to be saved.",
