            "background": "The keeping of Birds whilst popular in previous generations is one of the most cruel forms of captivity of any animal.\n\nA bird of any species is enabled with the gift of flight and this CANNOT be truly enjoyed or utilised by birds held in houses and flats, with birds being \"imprisoned\" usually all day in the tiniest of cages, surrounded by their own excrement. \n\nPeople believe a chirping bird in the house is great, I say that the bird is desperately trying to make contact with its own kind!\n\nThe caging of ALL BIRDS should banned excepting where it is shown that a bird is in a zoo in an adequately sized cage allowing free unhindered flight ( e.g. endangered species or likewise ) It is a disgrace that we still allow it.\n\nAll imports of Parrots, Cockatiels, Macaws, etc should be prohibited immediately. Birds should be free and allowed to fly.",
