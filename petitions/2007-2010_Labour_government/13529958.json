This is perfect timing as the Dunstable Masterplan and its initiatives have just been launched and are being discussed at present. \n\nSo this is the perfect time to sign up for what might bring people back into the town for shopping and a bite to eat in one of our lovely coffee shops or pubs. \n\nSign the petition now and we will present this to Andrew Selous MP who is already supporting us!",
