            "background": "For too long, we the British people, have watched as the intelligence standards of our once great nation nosedived into oblivion. Basic language skills seem non existant, instead, secondary school pupils like to accent each sentence with an eloquent \"brrap\" or \"yagetmi'.\" In the case of Scottish students, this would be \"nowitameanmaahn?\" Language is not the only problem. Social skills are lacking,   along with basic general knowledge and common sense. We therefore petition the government to overhaul the current, and obviously failing, education system, or make stupidity a crime against human rights. After all. WE have to listen to them.",
