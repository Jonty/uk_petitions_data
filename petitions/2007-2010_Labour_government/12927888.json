            "background": "Increase prison sentences to match the crimes of animal cruelty.\nWe believe that the present penalties given by our justice system are no effective deterrent in the fight against animal cruelty.\nThose that perpetrate these acts of violence towards animals should be be removed from society for a period that match the crime. It is our belief that these people will also create a risk to the public as they are without empathy for life that cannot retaliate or give testimony to the their suffering in a court of law.\nThe present sentences given amount to weeks not months imprisonment for horrendous cruelty resulting in tortured deaths. This should be a minimum amount of years no less than four.",
