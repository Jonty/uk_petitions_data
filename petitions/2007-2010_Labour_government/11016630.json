For example a NRP paying \u00a3570 / month for one child under the \u2018old system\u2019 rules, would under the \u2018new system\u2019 pay \u00a3217 / month less. However the NRP won\u2019t be transferred on the new system until about 2015 and then the transfer process will reduce payments over a number of years. If you consider the payments over the 7.5 years the NRP will be paying an extra \u00a320000",
