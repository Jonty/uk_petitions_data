            "background": "The Queen must go to the D-Day Commemorations in France and H.M. Government must ensure that the French Government realize this. Our Prime Minister did not want to go until he found that the American President was going. The Veterans want the Queen or a very senior member of the Royal Family to go. Gordon Brown states he is so influential with the French and American Presidents, well now is the time for him to prove it!  Failing that he should  give up his place to the Queen .  She was the only person who was alive then out of these leaders and it would be a disgrace if she was not invited. Gordon Brown get on the phone and get it sorted now!!!",
