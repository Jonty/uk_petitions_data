            "background": "Postal workers fighting modernization need to be sent a firm message. \n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of people who would gladly take their current jobs at their current wages, and perform to the same standard.\nDespite this, we've seen three months of postal strikes, government ministers being blocked from accessing sorting offices, long delays on letters sent, small businesses going bankrupt, and all the while the union sits smugly holding the country to ransom.\n\nSo, what we need is a simple message to be sent out. The post office costs too much money to run right now. So, the modernisation will be pushed through. Anyone striking can collect their P45's Monday morning, and will be replaced immediately. \n\nAnything less than immediate access will slow down the economic recovery, perhaps even prompting a second recession.",
