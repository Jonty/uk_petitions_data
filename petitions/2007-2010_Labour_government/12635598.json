            "background": "Currently there are NO requirements- unlike other trap use, to inspect kill traps used for the control of moles. This must cause possible un-necessary suffering,Defra states that it is good practice to check them frequently and failing to do so may leave the operator open to prosecution and it would be for a court to decide what measures could or should have been taken to to avoid or reduce any suffering. \nTherefore it must be accepted that to reduce any possible unnecessary suffering mole traps should be checked daily in line with other traps used to control animals and not be permitted to be left unchecked under bad practices until an example case is made in the courts of law.",
