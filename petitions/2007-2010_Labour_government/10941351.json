            "background": "With the clocks having gone back an hour at the weekend, we are calling on the Government to renew the debate on whether to adopt a system which would mean lighter evenings throughout the year. \n\nDouble Summer Time (DST), if introduced, would mean that the clocks would be set 1 hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) during the winter and 2 hours ahead in the summer \u2013 with the result of lighter evenings but darker mornings. \n\nPossible benefits of DST for the country to be consider include:\n\n\u2022 Reduction in road accidents,  particularly concerning children coming home from school. \n\u2022 Increased revenue for tourism\n\u2022 Reduced energy consumption \n\u2022 Increased participation in outdoor activities\n\u2022 Improved wellbeing: \n\n\"Changing the system of timekeeping could bring substantial benefits and we believe that the Government should allow a proper debate in Parliament in order that the issues can be looked at in full detail with a view to a change taking place at the earliest opportunity.\"",
