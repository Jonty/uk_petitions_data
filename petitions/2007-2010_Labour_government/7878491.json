        "background": "It is not sufficient to leave gifted children to educate themselves and offer 2 weeks of their summer break as an alternative to continuous  and stimulating education within an appropriate setting. Some musical children , for example are given no access to the Music colleges as junior exhibitioners due to lack of self funding. Academically gifted children are not given the opportunities which the Assisted places scheme was created for and cruelly removed on the labour govt taking over. Mr.Blair himself was educted under the Assisted places scheme.",
