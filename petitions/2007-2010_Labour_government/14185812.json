            "background": "The chancellor has announced that familes earning over 20k per year will be taxed more. The national average wage is 30k so it would be punishing the familes already struggling to pay morgages etc. We all know the tax has to rise but it would make common sense to raise the tax in relation to the national average wage. Taxing normal working familes will not help thee country out of a recesion as we will have less to spend.",
