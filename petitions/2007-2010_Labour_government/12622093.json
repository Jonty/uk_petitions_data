        "background": "I would ask that MP's who have been caught fraudulently claiming expenses be prosecuted and loose their jobs. If a member of the public had committed offences such as these we would have been prosecuted so why not MP's? MP's are supposed to be role models and representatives of our country and this is unacceptable. This is also taxpayers money being wasted in a disgusting manner whilst there is a credit crunch & people are being made unemployed.",
