        "background": "People are always moaning on how the teenagers behave where there out of the house, but know one has actually had a look at the simple things for instance giving us teenagers something to do while we are out all i have in my area is a park for toddlers and when ever we go on there we get asked to move on by the police but where else are we going to go what else are are we going to do? So i ask that the government take more consideration into teenagers as they do with toddlers and i guarantee that you will see the crime rate fall dramatically if this could happen all over Britain.",
