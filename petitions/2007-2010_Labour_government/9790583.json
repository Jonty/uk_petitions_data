            "background": "NASA have produced figures showing that Global Warming ended in 1998. Average temperature have been at a level for the past 10 years and are  now heading downwards. This last winter has been one of the coldest on record for many parts of the world. In the  UK, summer 2007 was cooler and wetter than of recent years and 2008 seems to be heading in the same direction. Winter lasted well into April. On the basis of clear evidence the government should be looking at so called green taxes particularly on energy for mobility, heating and business in the context of lower annual temperatures and harder winters and recognise the serious consequences that its current  policies will have for the population and economy. This is a clear indication that man made CO2 emissions are not responsible for changes in the planets weather; this is a natural phenomenon beyond the control of governments.",
