            "background": "'They should be strung up' you say when they thinking of those accused of torturing and murdering Baby P.\nOur current judicial system doesn\u2019t allow this and we call for a return of the death penalty and justice for Baby P.\nOn the 3-8-07 Baby P was found dead. The post-mortem examination revealed Baby P had suffered: \n\u2022 Eight broken ribs and a broken back\n\u2022 Numerous bruises, cuts and abrasions, including a deep tear to his left ear lobe, which had been pulled away from his head. \n\u2022 Severe lacerations to the top of his head. \n\u2022 Blackened finger- and toenails, with several nails missing; the middle finger of his right hand was without a nail and its tip was also missing. \n\u2022 One of his front teeth had also been knocked out and was found in his colon. He had swallowed it. \nThis is not intended to shock, but to re-enforce the need that we need to bring back the death penalty so that the vile, evil perpetrators of such hideous acts are given a sentence in-keeping with their crimes.\nIn memory of Baby P",
