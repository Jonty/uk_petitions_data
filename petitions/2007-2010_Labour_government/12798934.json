America, Afghanistan and  Mexico, would make users in UK think more about using these drugs, which are financing crime and the terrorism.\nAll schools should be required to make such information part of their programme, if they do not do so already.\nAlso a publicity campaign should be set up to promote this knowledge among the public. This problem does not get enough attention in the media.",
