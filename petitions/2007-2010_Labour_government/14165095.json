Family tax credits, housing benefits, chidcare assistance etc.\n\nI am not against this.\n\nHowever, this forces many single working people into renting accomodation, often throughout their working lives.\n\nThe assistance could be in the form of a one off grant or through tax breaks.\n\nIt would create a healthier first time buying market as well.",
