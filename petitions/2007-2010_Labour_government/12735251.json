            "background": "The World Bank on Wednesday praised the Indian UPA government's National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme saying people can fall back on  \nthe scheme \"in these hard times\". \n\n\"India is fortunate to have in place a (NREGA) program that people can fall back on to find work in these hard times\", World Bank's Country Director Roberto Zagha \n\nI propose that a similar scheme should also be started in the UK and that every person who is a UK Resident excluding EU Nationals should be given this Guarantee. They can be used to create a core infrastructure which is lacking in the UK. In many ways the core infrastructure is worse than a 3rd world country",
