            "background": "I propose to reintroduce capital punishment in severe cases of crime, i.e. Rape, Murder, Terrorism, police killing....\n\nWith improved forensic evidence this should be workable and the punishment only exercised where there is 100% evidence and assured that the person is guilty, and to ensure that all found guilty are put on \"death row\" for at least a year (to allow for appeals, etc).\n\nI for one am fed up with the Huntley\u2019s, Bombers, etc being a burden to our society, so why not do to them what they have done to others and use that money spent attempting to rehabilitate them on better and more worth while causes.\n\nAt least the victims would feel that justice is being served then and the public would feel safer and now these monsters won\u2019t ever be let out again after 7 years of a 13 year \"life\" sentence.\n\nAlso it would send out a clear deterrent that this country isn\u2019t soft on crime.",
