OTTION 1) create a new earth as they think they was how earth was created, you do the math, There is not much room on Earth to fit another Earth. OPTION 2) Create a black hole. im sure i dont have to tell you that black holes are bad crack. The whole of the earth will be pulled to its centre and destroyed. OPTION 3) Nothing happens..\n\nso, theres a 1 in 3 chance we will be ok. I dont like these odds. I think that its our Human rights that if there is a chance of destroying the Earth we should be at least asked about it.\n\nHere are a couple of links.\n\nA black hole does this \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXzugu39pKM\n\nThe CERN website\n\nhttp://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html\n\nA CERN SCIENTIST SAYING THE WORLD COULD END \n\nhttp://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html",
