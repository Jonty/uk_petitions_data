        "background": "Concern about the volume and nature of swearing on television made headlines when in November 2008 Michael Grade, the Executive Chairman of ITV, observed that swearing had become \u201cunrestrained\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate\u201d.  He also stated that people do not want to hear those words.\n\nIn May 2008 the Radio Times conducted an opinion poll, which found that 69% of people believed there is too much swearing on TV.  In November 2008 the Sunday Express launched a Clean Up TV Crusade focusing on the excessive use of swearing and the Sunday Telegraph conducted a poll which found that 56% of people thought the f*** word should never be used on TV.\n\nThe Office of Communications (Ofcom) in its Communications Market reports for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 found that the majority of people believe there is too much swearing on TV.    \n\nmediawatch-uk believes that swearing on TV has reached such proportions that it is threatening the English language, that it is undermining the Government\u2019s policies on Education to improve communication skills and hindering initiatives to restore respect and civility to our society.",
