A far better solution would be to allow a parent to stay in the house as long as a sufficient repayment structure is in place. when the youngest child reaches 16 or eighteen if the debt has not been repaid then the home maybe soild for equity(...probably alot more equity will be available then anyway!) albeit a long winded solution it keep kids within a family",
