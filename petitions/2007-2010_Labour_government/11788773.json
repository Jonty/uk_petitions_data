            "background": "This petition is not about Geert Wilders as such, his poletics, morals or points of view. This petition is in defence of freedom of speech and against those who try to suppress this by strong arm tactics such as threatening protests and so forth.\nNote that if Mr Wilders - or anybody else breaks the law of the land, he should be held responsible but NOT before that, in the same way we do not lock up criminals because they may reoffend. Please note that to date Mr Wilders has not been tried or found guilty of any offence.\nLet him make is point and allow an open and honest discussion amongst all concerned. Crushing public speech is a short term solution to a long term issue that will eventually blow up in our faces if not tackled now.",
