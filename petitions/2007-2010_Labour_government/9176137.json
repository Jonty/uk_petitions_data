        "background": "I feel that the HSE should be given the resource to inspect more workplaces. All too often workers are injured because their boss(es) believe that prevention costs too much. Some companies go for a least a decade before a HSE inspector calls. Some inspections only take place after an injury or fatality has occured. It should become common knowledge that accidents do not 'just happen'. There is always a cause.",
