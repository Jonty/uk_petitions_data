        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We believe that a payment to pregnant mothers to be of \u00a3200 cash to \"encourage the consumption of healthy food\" is a waste of tax payer money, an inducement to increase pregnancy amongst those least able to afford it, and is far too unlikely to be spent as intended by the government. Furthermore we believe the aim of \"reducing in the socio-economic infant mortality gap\" could be more fully and more cost effectively achieved by utilising this money in other ways. As such we think this proposal should be scrapped before it is introduced.",
