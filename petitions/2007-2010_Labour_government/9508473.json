At some point we need to stop growing and it would be best if that was done in a planned and controlled way.  I believe that we have already passed the point where economic growth is reducing our quality of life (NOT our \"standard of living\" which is a purely economic measure) and that government is failing us by not seeing that. The cost of this can be seen in our schools, hospitals and night-time streets.",
