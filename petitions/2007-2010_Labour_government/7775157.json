            "background": "July 2007 saw the blocking of Pandora outside of the US. We did however hold out some hope that a solution might exist for the UK. We left it unblocked as we worked diligently with the rights organizations to negotiate an economically viable license fee. After over a year, this has proved impossible. Both the PPL (representing record labels) and the MCPS/PRS Alliance (representing music publishers) have demanded per track performance rates which are far too high to allow Pandora to operate in the UK. \nIt continues to astound me and the rest of the team here that the industry is not working more constructively to support the growth of services that introduce listeners to new music and that are totally supportive of paying fair royalties to the creators of music.\nWe know what an epicenter of musical creativity & fan support the UK has always been, there is a lot of support from listeners & artists in the UK for us .\nWe're going to keep fighting for a fair, workable rate structure that will allow us to bring Pandora back to you.  In the meantime, we have no choice but to turn off service to the UK. Pandora will stop streaming to the UK as of January 15th, 2008. \n-Tim Westergren (Pandora founder)",
