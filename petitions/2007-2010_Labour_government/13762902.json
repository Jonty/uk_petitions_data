A stupied knee jerk reaction AGAIN from this government.\n \nBring TA training back TODAY.\n\nWith all the money wasted on outside bodies carrying out services that could be done in house, this would more then cover the money the government are trying to save. EG medicals at \u00a3150 per time carried out by OHSAS, (Do we not have medical staff in the TA). Road side Vehicle [green fleet] repair and recovery now carried out by AA why can\u2019t REME do the job when they are out with us on FTX. Catering, the slop that is served to us on FTX by landmark surly o TA cooks could do a better job and save the MOD some money.",
