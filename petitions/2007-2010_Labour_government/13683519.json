        "background": "How many times have you watched/listened to politicians when they have been asked questions and instead of answering in clear direct terms opt for talking a load of rubbish, speaking for sometimes minutes but not actually saying very much at all, never actually replying to what's been asked of them?  I'd imagine most if not all of the time.  MP's are there to serve us.  We put them in power.  They are supposedly our representatives yet they sit there, often refusing to make eye contact and never answering questions directly.  It's an outrage.  I petition the Prime Minister to stop allowing this to happen.  They must listen to what's being put in front of them and then reply as clearly and directly as possible so the questioner is satisfied that every single point asked has been responded to.  No blather, no verbal diarrhoea, no evasion.  Just honesty.",
