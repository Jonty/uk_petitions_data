            "background": "Removing the image of Britannia is yet another attack upon British Heritage, this national emblem makes our country distinct and the move to remove it may seem small but is deeply symbolic of the current state of affairs. The British are constantly berated for not being as 'vibrant' as other cultures, but its hard to be when the government keeps removing and destroying our old traditions and belittling our history bit by bit. So i urge people to sign to save this small bit of our collective past.",
