Everybody knows where Michael Martin's interests and fears lie. That is why he wants to silence whistle blowers from the fees office who act in the interests of tax payers.\n\nThe Prime Minister should do the honourable thing and seek to oust this Speaker who brings the House and the Labour Party into disrepute.",
