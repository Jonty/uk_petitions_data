        "background": "We have had enough talk about how low our country has sunk re: morals, discipline, crime, education, N.H.S.,  immigration, political correctness and human rights.  Let us stand up now, PROTEST RESPONSIBLY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT before it gets any worse, because it will.  I have never known apathy like it is at present.  No one in any sort of power seems to have the back bone to say enough is enough in case they upset anyone.  If the M.P.s,judges etc lived in our world and not their ivory towers, then they would know how we feel:  intimidated and fearful on our streets. They are all so weak\nLET US STAND UP NOW FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN!  WE WANT OUR STREETS AND COUNTRY BACK.",
