            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There has been a recent development of private profit making parking enforcement companies exploiting tired drivers who respond to the Governments advice to stop when feeling tired. \n\nIf they should happen to sleep more than the arbitrary time [often 2 hrs] they get an automatic fine of \u00a350 via CCTV cameras.\n\nGiven that the cost to the public purse of an accident can run into many millions, surely the DoT or whichever department that controls or leases the service areas should impose a new requirement on the operators:\n\n\"That public spirited drivers who respond to the sensible advice to have a break when tired, should NOT be fined if they are asleep in their vehicles by the unfair use of CCTV but, they should be approached personally and reminded that they are about to exceed the free parking time and asked if they wish to pay for longer or leave.\"\n\nThe current situation will result in tired drivers trying to keep going for fear of a fine, with possibly fatal or certainly very expensive consequences.",
