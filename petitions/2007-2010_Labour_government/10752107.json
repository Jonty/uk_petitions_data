Everyone understands the need for speed restrictions in certain places, but the councils have gone beserk in the amount of money that is spent on these measures. A lot of the time they just create more frustration for the already stressed out motorists. This money and effort would be better spent on filling in the thousands of potholes that are affectig our crumbling roads",
