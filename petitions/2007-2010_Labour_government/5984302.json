Many people choose to retire to member states after paying their National Insurance contributions all their working life. Where it can be seen that the person had paid their contributions for 44 years + then they should be entitled to 100%. Some have paid for at least 49 years\nThe extra help that pensioners get in the UK is not available to pensioners living in other member countries",
