            "background": "I hate unfair hypocritical tuition fees like any student but unfortunately they seem to be here to stay. But I will say they should be capped at \u00a33000 a year and NOT under any circumstances raised to ridiculous limits like \u00a310,000 like some university leaders want. This would price most people out of higher education and leave university as an option only to the rich.",
