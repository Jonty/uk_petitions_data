            "background": "Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide and accounts for 250,000 deaths annually. \nThe new HPV vaccine protects against the most common cervical cancer-causing subtypes, 16 and 18, which are responsible for 75% of all cervical cancer cases. \n\nAt present, the vaccine is only available on the NHS for women under 18 years of age. Women over this age have only one option to receive the vaccine- by paying for it privately. This costs a total of \u00c2\u00a3450. This is a cost that many cannot afford and is leaving them at risk from contracting the cancer-causing strains of HPV. \n\nBy signing this petition you are agreeing that the NHS should be subsidising this important vaccination programme for women over 18 years of age and that the Government should take note and make a change.",
