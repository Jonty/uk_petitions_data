        "action": "Allow pension funds to be used to offset mortgages - it will also provide liquidity to UK Banks",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Due to the problems with poor liquidity in the banking industry resulting from loss of confidence in lending, can we relax the rules around SIPP pensions to allow private pensions funds to be used to offset mortgages.  This will reduce private debt, increase savings into banks who can therefore improve the ability to finance their own mortgage loans.  I would request that the government ensure that the pension fund is secured.  I would also ask that the government ensure the banks do not exploit the generous assistance of pension savers by increasing interest rates to recover the original loan interest before the offset was deposited.",
