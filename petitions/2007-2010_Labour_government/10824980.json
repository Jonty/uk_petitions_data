            "background": "School governors are busy-bodies who often only want to further their own influence in the community. They make important decisions on recruitment and school policy without any qualification or experience in such matters. \n\nThe situation at the Roman Catholic school in Manchester, where the governors banned the HPV vaccine, proves that school governors care more about their own feelings than what is best for the children in their care.\n\nSchool governors should be removed and replaced with a system combining qualified education professionals  alongside a more democratic and less elitist system of taking parents views into account.",
