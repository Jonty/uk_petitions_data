            "background": "Current Cannabis Sativa (hemp) legislation is a crime against humanity and the planet. It has caused more death, destruction and environmental damage than any other political/state/legislative decision in history. Making cannabis sativa/indica/hemp the worlds number one crop (as it once was) for industrial/medicinal/recreational use, is the most viable way for humanity to REVERSE global warming. Britain will do all in its power to return Hemp to the position of most important resourse on the planet, the only legislation on cultivation will apply to specially bred / genetically modified strains for recreational use that contain excessive amounts of thc with little cbd. Restrictions on cultivation will not apply to any natural forms of Cannabis Sativa or Indica. in Open found 0 hits.",
