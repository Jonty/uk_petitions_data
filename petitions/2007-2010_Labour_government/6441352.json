        "background": "We are all aware that, as well as ongoing deaths due to engaging with the enemy, in both Iraq and Afghanistan, many of our armed forces are also being very seriously injured.  Some of these injuries are so serious, that they lead to the casualties being permanently incapacitated.  It has recently become apparent that many such casualties are being treated in NHS hospitals, placed amongst civilian patients.  This is totally unacceptable.  they should be in specialist military hospitals, amongst service doctors familiar with their kind of injuries.  Additionally, there should be ongoing military convalescent homes for those who require long term care.  As it stands ,the government is reneging on such requirements, and such callous treatment of these brave personnel is not acceptable, and the situation should be amended immediately.",
