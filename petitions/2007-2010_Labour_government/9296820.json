            "background": "In the Interest of National Security and Evidential Integrity,  Police Officers should wear a continual Video camera at all times, Images being sent to a National Database (not run by the Police), Custody Suite Images should be on a 24hr recording and images sent to a national Database to secure evidence. This will make policing more efficient and trustworthy, it will make police officers MORE secure as they perform their duties.Presently the system can be abused due to Police access to video evidence.The Police should not have access to any video recordings contained in custody suites, its illogical.",
