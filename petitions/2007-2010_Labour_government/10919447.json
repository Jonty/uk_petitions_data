            "background": "This organ, originally purchased and installed at \"The Picture House\" Walsall in 1925, was the first Wurlitzer theatre organ to be imported into the UK.\nIt is therefore a vital part of our musical heritage, and now deserves to be restored to its former glory as a performance instrument as well as being regularly maintained and serviced in order to keep it in pristine condition.\nThe instrument is currently being featured in a series of fundraising concerts by professional theatre organ players. Eventually, when it is fully restored it will continue to entertain the public in this way for generations to come.\nMore information can be obtained from any search engine with the words Beer Wurlitzer.",
