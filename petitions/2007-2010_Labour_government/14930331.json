            "background": "Since the loss of John Peel and certain other respected music lovers, new and innovative music has suffered.  Whilst, due to the launch of internet radio, there are many varied music stations, there are none with the eclectic mix and quality of 6 Music.  The station is there to provide varied music, both new and old, from various cultures.  It fits the core remit of the BBC, \u201cto educate, inform and entertain\u201d.  BBC 6 Music is one of the few stations to focus on the music rather than commercialism or speech.  It is a valuable contribution to the culture of our society and would be a great loss if it were to be removed from the airwaves.",
