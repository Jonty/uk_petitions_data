            "background": "At present the CSA works out non-resident parent's earnings from self-employment from their self-assessment return that they send to HM Revenue & Customs and/or the tax calculation notice that HM Revenue & Customs sends them. Unfortunately, there are self-employed NRP\u2019s that do not declare all their taxable income (cash in hand jobs). If the PWC has suspicions that the NRP does not declare all their taxable income (maybe because the maintenance payments worked out by CSA do not match the NRP\u2019s lifestyle) then it should be the responsibility of the CSA and NOT the parent with care to investigate this dispute. The CSA should employ assessors who survey the NRP\u2019s lifestyle situation and the NRP should be penalised, the maintenance re-assessed, backdated and repaid to the PWC.",
