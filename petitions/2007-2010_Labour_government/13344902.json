If this was changed it would increase tourism to both the U.K. and the other countries of the E.U. which can only benefit the economies of all E.U. countries.  \n\nEither we are in a union with them or we're not; this would be one way of proving that we are.  It might also help to reconcile anti-Europeans to the existence of the E.U. which I believe has helped to avoid wars in Europe.",
