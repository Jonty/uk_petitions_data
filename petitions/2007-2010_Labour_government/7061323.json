We expend energy and water on treating it when we could be using it to generate methane (with the right equipment) and in turn generate electricity!\n\nFor an initial outlay from the government to convert our sewage farms into power generation plants, we could save money, waste less water and cut down on other more controversial methods of electricity generation. Hence saving money in the long term!",
