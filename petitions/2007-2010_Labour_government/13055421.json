        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In January 2009, Birmingham City Council opted to permanently ban the apostrophe from the city's road signs. We believe the apostrophe to be a key component of the English language that is crucial to understanding: in the case of \"St Paul's Square\", it denotes possession. We do not believe it is within a city council's power to make such broad changes to our national language and we consider it tremendously insulting that Birmingham be littered with examples of incorrect English.\n\nWe accept that it would not be cost-effective to restore apostrophes to signs that lack them. Nonetheless, we ask the government to introduce a policy enforcing apostrophe use in new or replacement road signs, applying not only to Birmingham City Council but to all councils nationwide. Not only will this prevent them from wasting valuable time debating the issue, it will ensure that the apostrophe is used correctly by councils across the UK.",
