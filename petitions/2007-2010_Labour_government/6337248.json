Though for some unknown mad reason the government have not apologised for this I think you will find the country as a whole does.  What I want to know from Africa is why have they not demanding an apology from the Islamic world which continued to kidnap and enslave for years after we stopped?  Why has our government rolled over and taken what seems to be 100% of the blame?  Why exactly are we the only shame filled country while others quietly turn a cheek and African countries happily lay all the blame on the western world?  It is time the government reminded middle eastern countries that though we regret our involvement they are most certainly just as guilty.",
