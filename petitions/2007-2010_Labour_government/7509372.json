He was in danger of over-acting the very wooden Kevin Costner off the screen so much that he was told by the director to \"tone it down\".\n\nHe has also brought pleasure to film audiences with his performances in \"Die Hard\" and the Harry Potter films (although he does freely admit that most of the credit for his portrayal of Severus Snape in the latter should have gone to the wig he wore for the part).\n\nThe man is a genius and should get a knighthood (or at least the wig should).",
