        "action": "obtain an independent report to determine the cost effectiveness of wind turbines and true levels of electrical output that can reasonably be expected.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Significant amounts of public money are being invested in electrical power from renewable sources, particularly wind turbines. There are grave doubts amongst independent thinkers (not influenced by government grants)  whether this is justified, advisable or cost effective. The amount of power that can be generated and sustained over a 12 month period is at the current stage of technology too low and unreliable.  \nPower is only generated when the wind blows at sufficient speed. The country is therefore vulnerable to a significant drop in output in calm and light breeze conditions. Hydro electric and wave power on the other hand is more consistent as indeed is solar power.  \nI speak as someone who had tried a small wind generator to recharge narrowboat batteries, only to be disappointed with the actual level of output in comparision with the anticipated average output stated by the manufacturers. A constant wind of around 15 miles per hour or more is needed to provide a useful output.",
