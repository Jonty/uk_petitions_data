            "background": "Too many multi occupancy housing is built without enviromentally friendly means of drying washing. They are often fitted with washer/dryers for each flat but no outside drying lines. This is totally against saving resources and is simply done so as no to spoil the look of the building or to make more flats . No thought is given to the waste of energy. As more multi occupancy housing is built more and more energy wasting machines are being used. This has too long been ignored.",
