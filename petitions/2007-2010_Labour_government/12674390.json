And we feel that they should no only be stripped of power, but have all positions they have gained through deceit stripped away from them. \nAnd a full investigation by an independent company started. \nBy abusing the position given to them by the public of the United Kingdom, they have broken the law, and should face the full weight of the justice system.",
