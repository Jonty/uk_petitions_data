British TV was once a cause for pride, now it is a source of shame.\n\nBBC management, committed to multicultural mediocrity and the cult of  celebrity, have betrayed our trust.  We demand regime change! \n\nIn the future, the Board of the Trust must be chosen by licence payers, instead of the metropolitan  establishment.\n\nWe call for the Government to introduce legislation to institute such change forthwith.",
