        "background": "The European Commission has backed a plan to give 1bn euros (\u00a3800m) of unspent EU farm subsidies in aid to African farmers.\n\nThe cash could help farmers boost output, thereby tackling food shortages and soaring prices.\n\nThe money has been allocated to the EU agriculture budget, but not spent.\n\nSome countries have queried the move's legality. But if EU ministers and the European Parliament agree, it could take effect in early 2009.\n\n\nWith the credit crunch well and truly here, we need all our taxes working hard for us, and not to be given away in such a manner as this!!",
