            "background": "Farts are made of methane, which is a lot worse for the environment than CO2, and cows fart A LOT! Also, vegetarians fart a lot, so by eating cows you are helping the environment by stopping the cows farting and stopping you farting. And if you think this is cruel to the cows, they cannot milk themselves because they have evolved to be milked by people, and is very painful for them to hold milk for too long, which is why they are milked at 5 in the morning. An alternative to killing them would be to collect the methane from their farts and to burn this as it is renewable energy, and it wouldn't mean we would have to kill them",
