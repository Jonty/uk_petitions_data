            "background": "The NFU have estimated that electronic tagging will cost farmers 40% of their income to implement a system, which is neither effective nor rigorous enough to stand up to field conditions. In addition, this will add red tape - as if there is not enough already.\n\nSurely, penalising farmers with extra costs for an ineffective system, shows neither clarity of thought nor practical understanding of farming or the way, in which, business operates. In this time of recession, this is the last thing farmers need and it will encourage more farmers to leave the industry. \n\nWhen will the government understand that the actual task of farming, costs significant amounts of money and the profits are not high. It is becoming less worth the effort of doing so.",
