            "background": "Conservative Party leader David Cameron has pledged to allow MPs a free vote on whether to repeal the Hunting Act if he becomes Prime Minister at the next election.\n\nA survey carried out by Ipsos MORI in September 2009 showed that an overwhelming 75% of the British public do not want fox hunting to be made legal again. Even in rural communities 72% want to see fox hunting remain illegal. Still more people oppose hare coursing, hare hunting and deer hunting.\n\nIf David Cameron does succeed in doing this we would like the vote to be put to the public and not solely for MPs.\n\nANIMAL CRUELTY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED",
