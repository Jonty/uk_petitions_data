            "background": "We declare that the existing verb \"to petition\" is insufficient and nonsensically long. Owing to the UK's ever-increasing ethnic diversity, and uncontrolled immigration floodgate, we feel the new replacement verb will be more easily understood and uptaken by youth and non-English speaking immigrants. The verb shall conjugate as follows:\n\nI petish, You petish, He/She/It petishes, We petish, You (pl) petish, They petish.\n\nIn the unlikely event that the petition gathers an insufficient number of signatures, we kindly request that the undersigned initiate immediate use of the verb \"to petish\" and concisely scrawl it in dictionaries whenever possible. Therefore, the Prime Minister should write to the Oxford English Dictionary in order to introduce this fantastic verb.",
