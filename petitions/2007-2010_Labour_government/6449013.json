        "background": "This includes debilitating female related conditions such as Endometriosis, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Hormone Disorders & Menopause related conditions.\n\nWe require the NHS to take seriously ALL female related medical issues and to provide adequate levels of support, research and understanding to ensure that our daughters and grand-daughters are not expected to suffer intolerable pain and adverse impact on their everyday lives.\n\nUnbelievably we are still told by GPs to 'grin & bear it', as research is minimal. In the UK 33% of women suffer from Endometriosis,15% with PCOS & at least 7% of women are struggling through menopause.  We require effective treatment & research to ensure that women in the UK in 2007 and beyond can lead full and pain free lives - WE DESERVE IT!",
