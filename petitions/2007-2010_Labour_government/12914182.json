I for one take these speed bumps at the correct and legal speed yet you have incured me over \u00a3130 YET AGAIN!\n\nRemove them and find something better, and that does not include a camera as they are proven to by inaccurate on countless occasions and people have no defence against their inaccuracies!\n\nDo you also realise that Police forces are now training civilians to use speed cameras? yes that's is correct, (elderly people with time on their hands is how one advert was worded) can now speed trap you, they are not legal law-enforcing specialists, they are merely people who have no expert analysis in the field, people who fancy themselves as the LAW!\n\nIt is an ever growing concern - we respect that people speed but you must find something better than this as you are costing us a fortune unfairly in my own case and thousands of others",
