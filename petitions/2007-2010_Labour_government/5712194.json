Hizb-ut-Tahrir says \u201cJews should be killed wherever they are found\u201d and that it is totally opposed democracy. It\u2019s time to ban these groups that are poising our country. Egypt, Germany and China are some of the 40 countries that have banned Hizb-ut-Tahrir \u2013 it\u2019s time for us to do the same.",
