            "background": "Skillforce is an unfair waste of government funds that exacerbates inequalities in the school by literally rewarding bad behavior. \nVery often, Skill Force is not an option for all pupils, and is only available to the pupils that teachers pick out. \nIt is unfair that this program is not available to all, and even more unfair that there is no equivalent program available to those who are well behaved. \nScrap Skillforce so the wasted money can be spent on those that deserve it.",
