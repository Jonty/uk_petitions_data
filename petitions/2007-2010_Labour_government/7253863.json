        "background": "The Prime Minister has announced a serious of extreme measures at train stations, cinemas and shopping centres \nand 'vulnerable' buildings.\n\nThis will all be at vast tax payer expense. Recent history in Israel, Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland has shown that without dialogue and reconciliation no amount of measures can protect against terrorism so it is total waste of money. The only people gaining will be the private contractors brought in to pour the concrete. If the Home Office is is incompetent enough to be hiring illegal immigrants to provide security then no amount of bollards and concrete wil protect us.\n\nIf the intention is to save lives then spend it on areas where the money there would be clearly pay off like reducing road deaths, child obesity, pollution, banning cheap alcohol, and providing support for the vunerable in our society.\n\nThe 'defence of freedom' must be achieved by removing our freedoms and putting us in a concrete fortress.",
