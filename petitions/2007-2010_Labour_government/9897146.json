            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As fuel costs continue to rise for homes, the added VAT charge of 5% on Domestic Fuels by government is unacceptable.  Even winter fuel payments to the elderly are subject to this charge.  Todays winter fuel payment would not even cover the trading standards minimum delivered quantity of 500 litres.  This winter more and more people will find themselves in Fuel Poverty.  Something needs to be done now.  This is at least one step that can be implimented quickly.  Many UK regions and in particular Northern Ireland rely on Oil not Gas to heat homes.  Gas prices although rising are fixed for a period.  Oil prices change daily and follow market trends.  Each rise is immediatley passed to the consumer and with each rise the VAT paid increases.  Remove this unfair tax now.",
