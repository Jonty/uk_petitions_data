            "background": "There is now nationwide screening of newborns for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) but there is no publicly-funded screening of adults to determine if they are CF carriers. There is a 1/25 chance that a random adult is a CF carrier. If both parents are CF carriers there is a 1/4 chance their child will have CF. Carriers usually have no symptoms so will be unaware of their status. Carrier testing is done by a mouthwash swab with an instant result and is available privately but not on the NHS. People should not have to play Russian roulette with such devastating consequences.",
