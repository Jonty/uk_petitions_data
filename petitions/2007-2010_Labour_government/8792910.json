            "background": "This petition is to end the tolls (or at least reduce them) on both Severn Crossings. Over 26 million people a year use these bridges which generates profits in excess of \u00a370m p/a.  Currently the bridges are owned by a Private Company and won't fall into britsh public ownership until \u00a31bn of Tolls has been collected. The Second severn crossing cost \u00a3300m to build and as of 2006 - \u00a3684m had been collected in tolls, effectivly paying for the bridge twice. Do we really have to pay for it a third time ?",
