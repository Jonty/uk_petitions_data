        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Due to the number of Racing Pigeons being attacked and killed whilst racing or while taking exercise around their lofts this is having a great impact on our sport where by fanciers are being forced to leave the sport which they love after seeing their birds ripped apart and die in front of them and being powerless to do anything about it due to the RSBP and the present laws protecting these birds of prey . The Pigeon Fancier is not only concerned about his own birds. But the number of wild birds also being killed in great numbers every day and will soon become exstinct if urgent action is not taken . We therefore urge you to alter the laws which protect these raptors and at the same time a reduction in their breeding be made whether it be the breeding by human means or natural means .And to give all pigeon fanciers the rights to protect their birds and not letting the RSPB have it all their own way and carry on giving false imformation regarding their numbers .While talking to 90% of all Pigeon Fanciers they all agree that it is natrual after all for these birds to kill to live its nature but there as to be a balance as nature intended.",
