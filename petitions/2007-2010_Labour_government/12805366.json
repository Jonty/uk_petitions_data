        "background": "The \"supermarkets\" and other buyers have forced the price of milk to uneconomic levels.  It is madness to watch our farmers go out of business because it costs them more to produce our milk than they are paid.  At the same time we, as a country, are now importing liquid milk from abroad. We will lose our farming community if no action is taken. This government must take action to protect our farmers.",
