            "background": "This is a petition to support Morville Primary School in it`s fight against Shropshire County Councils intended scheme to close many of our rural schools. Morville School is a fantastic place for children to be educated, you only have to see their faces at the end of a school day to realise just how happy they are to be learning in such a wonderful environment. To close this school and others alike would be a terrible injustice to all of the children affected. The other larger primary schools in the area are already bursting at the seams and would have to find many more places to accomodate the children from Morville if the closure plan went ahead. Please sign our petition and help keep Morville School open for another 150 years!",
