The results of this incompetence are clear, with a reported \u00a31bn potential loss to the British economy next summer. Please allow the reported 'root and branch' approach see some of the chairman and board member sacked from their post and help the right people resume management of the fa and restore some pride and economic strength to the people of England.",
