            "background": "How many children have to die to cancer before the Government will fund this marvellous building that will take 2.4million a year to run. \nBluebell Wood Children's Hospice provides a community palliative care service available for children and their families resident in South Yorkshire, North East Derbyshire, North Nottinghamshire and parts of North Lincolnshire. The Hospice will provide care for over 200 children and families suffering from life limiting and life threatening conditions, who are not receiving the support and care that they need. Research carried out by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health estimates that there are 10.6 million children in England under the age of 17, of which approximatley 1060 are likely to be so ill they will die within one year. 10,600 will be suffering from a life-limiting condition; half will need active palliative care at any one time. Within Bluebell Wood's region there are 200 such children and their families. Bluebell Wood is entirely funded by donations.  It is about time the Government recognised the need for Bluebell Wood and took responsibility for its existance as it is a priceless service which is needed!",
