            "background": "A large number of Classic & sports cars manufactured in the USA are designed to have no front number plate, fitting  front plates often spoil the asthetics of the vehicles.\n\nDue to the small number of USA cars in the UK & the low mileage covered by the careful owners, I do not see how this would affect the policing of our roads.\n\nAlso as there are such a small ammount of these vehicles on the roads, they should be easily identified if they were to be caught breaking any traffic violation.\n\nBearing in mind motorcycles do not currently display front plates I do not see any downside to this petition.",
