            "background": "I propose that the government starts treating hard working citizens of this country with more respect and giving them better benefits. It is not right that in this day and age you are better off on benefits than out working. I work full time only to be taxed and for my taxes to go and pay people who choose not to work. \nI am not against people getting benefits who cant work for whatever reason but there are too many families on benefits whose lives are made to easy for them by this government by providing them with grants, free products etc where people who are working are basically thrown to the wayside as we just seem to be a means of extra income for our government",
