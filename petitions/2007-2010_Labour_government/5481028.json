            "background": "If Gordon Brown is \u2018for Britain\u2019, then he is for making the Eurovision a national holiday (with compulsory fancy dress). Here are five reasons why (one for each decade the \u2018Vision has been running): \n\n-\tYou can use it as a tool for improving citizenship education (how Europe works, who votes for whom and why. Watch out though, \u2018cos some entrant countries aren\u2019t actually in Europe)\n\n-\tYou will reduce social inequalities by making everyone look equally ridiculous\n\n-\tYou could aid progress towards 5-a-day targets by gifting all citizens a fruity vodka jelly (red, white and blue colours are non-compulsory but recommended)\n\n-\tYou could enhance Anglo-Irish relations by bringing the joy of Terry Wogan to one and all (starting with a private audience chez moi \u2013 well as suggester of this policy I think I have earnt it!)\n\n-\tIf you are behind it, we might have the chance of getting a half-decent entry (I personally favour Chas and Dave, see Facebook for further details)\n\nDon\u2019t let me down, Gord!",
