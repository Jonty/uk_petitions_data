Diana\u2019s title on her death was ridiculous. Since her divorce, she has no direct connection with the House of Wales; and as the mother of a future king, she merits the HRH label regardless of her marital position. \u201cHRH Diana, The Princess Mother\u201d recognises her correct status in history, allowing the princes\u2019 stepmother to become Queen upon the accession of Prince Charles, but giving Diana the ultimate recognition a generation later.",
