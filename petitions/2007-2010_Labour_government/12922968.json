        "background": "A company called UK PARKING MANAGEMENT have been tricking people into parking illegally in Harlow's Bush Fair car park then charging \u00a3185 to remove the clamp. The warning signs (if you can call them that) are not very well displayed and are not clear. The shops in the vicinity are losing trade as more of their customers are being clamped.\n\nThe employees of UK PARKING MANAGEMENT sit in their unmarked van waiting for you to park (unaware you are illegally parked without a permit) then they rush over the minute you leave your car and clamp you. The company are sneaky and unwelcome in Harlow.\n\nPlease sign the petition as the more signatures we get the less people will get caught off guard.\n\nTHIS PETITION IS NOT ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL PARKING AND THOSE THAT KNOW CLAMPING IS IN OPERATION ARE AT FAULT IF THEY LEAVE THEIR CARS IN A CLAMPING ZONE.",
