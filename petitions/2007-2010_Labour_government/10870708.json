When the free parking limit is only 2 hours, drivers have been ticketed if they are there for more than 2 hours,\n\nThe govt needs to scrap service stations charging drivers for more than a couple of hours. Obviously, if there are people using the service station to 'camp' on, then fine these people. Not the people who are just tired and need 2-3 hours kip.",
