            "background": "Currently, on a farm in Somerset are 58 completely healthy pedigree dairy animals, some of which are pregnant, quite literally on a DEFRA \u2018death row\u2019 where DEFRA are able to be prosecutor, judge, jury & executioner despite being based on particular bloodtests which the government is now investigating the validity of, and have been abandoned as unreliable by other governments around the world.\n\nDEFRA refuse to retest the animals despite ministry veterinary officials acknowledging that they are perfectly healthy and very valuable animals.\n\nThere is no appeals process available to the farmers being destroyed by the process.\n\nCompensation, again judged solely by DEFRA, is only a fraction of the real market value of these animals.  Many will not know that DEFRA in turn sell-on the innocently slaughtered dairy cattle into the meat chain for profit. \n\nThey are due for forced removal and unnecessary slaughter on the 6 April 2009.  WE HAVE ONE WEEK TO SAVE THEM.\n\nA front page article on this situation can be found at:\nwww.thisisbristol.co.uk/wdp/news/TB-TESTS-SCANDAL-ANGERS-FARMERS/article-854056-detail/article.html",
