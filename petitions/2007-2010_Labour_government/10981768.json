        "background": "After coming through a 2 year divorce process I realised just how difficult and complicated it becomes as soon as solicitors and courts become involved. What had been a fairly reasonable split turned into near war the moment the process became a 'legal' matter. Whilst noone should take divorce lightly the process is so complicated and it creates monsters of perfectly normal human beings. Solicitors are slow, the process is not clear, guidelines for settlements and child payments are woolly at best unless you go to the CSA (which creates bad feeling) - what happened to two people agreeing to split amicably and keeping things civil? I have never in my life experienced such stress that could be completely avoided with a far slicker and more tightly controlled process.I beg number 10 to review the whole divorce process and I would be only too glad to help out!",
