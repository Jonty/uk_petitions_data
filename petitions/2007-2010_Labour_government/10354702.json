            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We believe that the proposal to close the Dale and Peacefield Primary Schools and to expand Rose Hill Primary School into a 'super school' is not the answer to surplus primary places in Marple. We believe that this proposal can only have a detrimental impact on the education of our children, the local residents to the three schools and on parental choice of where and what type of school to send their children to. An action group has been formed to propose alternative plans. All three schools provide excellent education and are not failing. We believe the alternatives should be given proper consideration and that the Stockport MBC proposal is not in the best interests of the children parents or residents of Marple.",
