            "background": "The government recently announced it would give families with children a winter fuel payment.  They did not however do anything for carers of chronically sick and disabled people.  Many carers are living in poverty and have no financial help towards rising fuel costs and utility bills.  We therefore petition that carers get a fairer deal and that these \"heroes\" get some financial help with fuel bills especially during the winter.",
