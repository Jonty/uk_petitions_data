            "background": "At present, adults on benefits, trying to improve their education by learning new skills to improve their chances of LONG TERM employment, are forced by the current benefit system into short term work. This can only cause problems for the country as a whole. Currently benefits which help adult learners, such as the ALG (adult learning grant) only support people who work part time earning up to \u00a319,513 (or \u00a330,810 if with partner) a year, while people on benefits, who really need the extra support to learn, get no such help.",
