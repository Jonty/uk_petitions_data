            "background": "Great British tradesmen and women are unfairly villified in the press and in the general public as being greedy or lazy, the vast majority are very hard working and the among the most highly skilled in the world, proven as they are sought after the world over. These same tradesmen are under huge threat at the moment with the current economic climate, not only do they have to deal with finding work, but also the work available is likely to be taken by under qualified, cheap, foreign labour. Believe me as somebody in the building trade myself, this is a huge problem and is getting worse. For example the olympic village site only 54 percent of the workforce are British the percentage of which are tradesmen are anybodys guess, probably far far less. Any man and woman on a building site who works hard enough should be able to earn a living but because of major undercutting and wages being slashed this is becoming a MAJOR issue far greater than is portrayed in the media. From the bricklayers to the plumbers etc , it takes years in Britain to learn and perfect these trades in many cases handed down from generation to generation, this is why the British tradesmen are regarded as the best in the world.",
