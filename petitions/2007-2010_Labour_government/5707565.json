            "background": "Healty food having a heavier emphasis in schools is a an effective tool against the war against obesity, However it has not only been introduced, but forced upon students.\n\nAny foods with sugar or fat seem to have been deemed unsuitable for consumption, and are bieng removed from schools nationwide. Rather than giving the option to choose a healthier food, students have no option but to pay for food that leaves them devoid of energy, and certainly not as cheerful.\n\nSnacks are important during breaks, but a pack of seeds doesnt quite have the same effect as a mars bar.\n\nObesity is a growing issue, but rather than food, i beleive education and excerize are more to blame. Forcing health foods on a person only drives them to leave school premises, seeking other foods. \n\nPenalizing the rest of society from the luxuries that make life that little bit more enjoyable, just because some people lack the willpower to exercize, or eat carefully, is unfair, and should be stopped.",
