            "background": "Take out a credit card and the banks offer you a payment protection insurance. Take out a mortgage and you are entirely at their mercy if you get ill or lose your job through no fault of your own.\nIt costs the nation a fortune in benefits to look after those dispossessed -to say nothing of their heartache and trauma.\nWhy not a form of National Mortgage Protection Insurance? A Trust could be formed which would pay the mortgage payments in most cases (except wilful neglect)and would take a proportion of the equity in exchange -recovering their outlay when the house is eventually sold.The cost could be shared between the mortgage lenders and all mortgage payers.\nI can NOT believe it is beyond the wit of man to create this necessary helping hand.",
