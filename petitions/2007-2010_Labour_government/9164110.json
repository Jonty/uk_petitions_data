Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society . Learn the language! \nThis is a Christian country because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, made this nation what it is today. Sharia law is not part of our culture.  If God or our laws offend you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home. \nWe will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.\nThis is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this.  \nIf you aren't happy here then follow a great British freedom - the right to LEAVE. We didn' t force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.",
