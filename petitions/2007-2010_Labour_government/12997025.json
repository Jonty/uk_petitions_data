            "background": "You are suggesting that parents can be taken to court if they do not sign the proposed Home School Agreement - since when is it possible to take someone to court when a non-mutually agreed contract has not been signed??\n\nThe majority of parents make sure their children attend school, complete their homework on time, know that their children behave as they are expected to, but you will always get the odd child who may, at some point disrupt a lesson.  \n\nStronger discipline needs to be brought back into the schools that need it, not a piece of paper that says parents can tell tales on others.\n\nAlso, what business is it for another parent to know what time our children go to bed??\n\nThis is another worthless, money wasting idea like the previously propsed ID cards.\n\nSign this petition now to get this idea scrapped!!!!!",
