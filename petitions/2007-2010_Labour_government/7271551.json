        "background": "As of recently there has being several rises in the amount of tax that is paid on fuel until the point where we are paying over 68ppl to the current 100ppl price. Some people have to use there car and cannot use the public transport system as it is impractical and a poor service. We want the tax on fuel reduced or capped at 100ppl. The prices in Britain are one of the highest in the world for fuel. Cut the fuel tax or at least stop futher rises.",
