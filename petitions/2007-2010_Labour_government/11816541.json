            "background": "In my opinion, children learn Maths at school.  They learn all this but are then not told what they need to learn to live in the real world or why they needed to know about percentages etc.  An insight into this would be beneficial to them for example VAT, APR, Credit cards and Loans etc would possibly have meant we would not have been as bad in the current recession situation.  I feel too many lenders gave out money to people who did not understand what they were getting themselves into.  Learning our children the outcome of getting a loan or credit card and giving them the tools to understand how much they would have to pay back i feel is something we should be doing, lets face it money will be something they will have to deal with every single day of their lives !!",
