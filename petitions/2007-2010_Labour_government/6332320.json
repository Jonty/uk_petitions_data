        "background": "We the undersigned request that Government departments stop referring to acts of terrorism committed in the name of \u2018animal rights\u2019 as being \u2018activism\u2019.\n\nActivism is a form of legitimate protest that respects both the rule of law and the livelihood, rights and property of other people.\n\nTerrorism has no respect for the rule of law or the rights of its victims.  'Animal rights activists' often operate in covert cells whose existence is seemingly tolerated during periods of inactivity.\n\nRecently, these terrorists have committed a wide range of violent crimes against people lawfully undertaking their daily business in the name of \u2018animal rights\u2019 \n\nPlease make a distinction between these criminal acts being undertaken in the name of \u2018animal rights\u2019 ideology and the lawful work of legitimate protesters who are vilified by the actions of these people, as I have done in the title of this petition.",
