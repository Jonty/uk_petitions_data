'Animal rights activists' often operate in covert cells whose existence is seemingly tolerated during periods of inactivity.\n\nRecently, these terrorists have committed a wide range of violent crimes against people lawfully undertaking their daily business in the name of \u2018animal rights\u2019 \n\nPlease make a distinction between these criminal acts being undertaken in the name of \u2018animal rights\u2019 ideology and the lawful work of legitimate protesters who are vilified by the actions of these people, as I have done in the title of this petition.",
