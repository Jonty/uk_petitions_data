            "background": "It is illogical that private individuals are able to opt out of sales/marketing calls by registering with the Telephone Preference Service, but are unable to do the same with regard to market research calls.  Market research calls are arguably even more annoying than sales calls, because they tend to last longer.  Also, people who don't want to receive sales calls, are unlikely to be willing to answer market research calls.",
