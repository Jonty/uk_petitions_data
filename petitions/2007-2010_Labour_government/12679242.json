        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The above Act details in section 65 that sexual relationships between certain family members is an offence. Among these relationships is that of uncle/aunt and nephew/niece: given that the age difference between the uncle/aunt and nephew/niece can be much less than that between the nephew/niece and their own parent, the uncle/aunt's sibling, and given that the genetic relationship is no closer than that between cousins (who can have a relationship entirely legally) I believe that this violates the human rights of the individuals concerned. Likewise, the genetic relationship between half-siblings is no closer than that of cousins where the parents are identical twins, yet one is legal and the other is illegal, so we, the undersigned, call for the removal of these from the above Act.",
