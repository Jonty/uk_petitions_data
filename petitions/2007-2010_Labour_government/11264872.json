            "background": "This Petition calls upon the Prime Minister to begin a programme to nationalise and operate on a NON-PROFIT basis the following:-\n\na) All banks, building societies and financial institutions\n\nb) All trains, buses and local tram networks\n\nc) All electricity, gas and water companies\n\nd) The Royal Mail\n\ne) British Telecom\n\nThese are vital institutions and in many areas the services they offer must be improved. In addition, the public can ill afford the sort of price rises that most of them are forcing upon us.\n\nIt is morally wrong that companies should profit from the provision of these essential services.\n\nWe, the undersigned, therefore petition the Prime Minister to take control of these organisations, keeping in mind that the objective of such is to offer the public higher standards of service without any further price increases, and possibly in some cases even make price cuts as we enter this difficult period of economic uncertainty.",
