            "background": "Hundreds of BUPA and other private hospitals are not burdened with the cost of providing emergency cover because they state that everybody is entitled to NHS emergency treatment - even when it is a medical operation they provide which goes drastically wrong.  This makes the operation of a private hospital much, much cheaper than it would otherwise be.  When operations go wrong those private hospitals should be liable for the cost and organisation of emergency treatment and NOT the taxpayer through the NHS.",
