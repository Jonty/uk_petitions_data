        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Whilst acknowledging that MPs who live outside London need accommodation in London, the current 'second homes allowance' is being abused and is certainly not giving value for money to the taxpayer.\n\nI therefore propose that all MPs be allocated two rooms each in the Olympic Village after the 2012 games have closed, one for use as a study and the other as a bedroom. \n\nThe Olympic Village will have good transport links, catering facilities, gymnasiums and leisure facilities and established security procedures. \n\nAbove all, this will end the mess that is the present system and provide value to the taxpayers who are funding the Olympic facilities through taxation and the plundering of the National Lottery fund.",
