        "background": "The removal of the 10p tax rate has, as we are all aware, brought much distress to those who are most in need of tax fairness. There has been an attempt by HM Government to redress the balance, but surely a change to the income limits for meeting the criteria of the Tax Credit Scheme would be a far more appropriate way of compensating those people who at the moment fall outside these required limits. Please sign up to this petition to bring a change to the Tax Credit Scheme",
