            "background": "Since the early seventies \u2018the Undercroft\u2019 (the sheltered area beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London\u2019s Southbank) has served as the home of the skateboarding community in the UK.\n \nIt\u2019s an open public-space that has brought together thousands of young people, from various backgrounds, over the last 35 years to form a harmonious and positive community. This type of positive and \u2018unorganised\u2019 activity for young people is very rarely seen elsewhere in the UK today\u2026\n \nHowever the area is now being rapidly redeveloped and the future of \u2018the Undercroft\u2019 is uncertain. Already a large part has been partitioned off behind large wooden hoardings. Please join us in petitioning the government to guarantee that the site is: (A) returned to its previous state (allowing the general public and skateboarders open access to the full area), and (B) officially protected and preserved for future generations of the skateboard community to use.",
