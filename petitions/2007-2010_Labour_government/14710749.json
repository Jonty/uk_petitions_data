        "background": "There is an urgency for the UK government to abolish income tax with regard to the heroes of the British Armed Forces who are on active duty.\n\nThese brave souls are putting their lives on the line in Afghanistan and they SHOULD NOT have to pay income tax on their earnings.\n\nThe US Armed Forces DO NOT pay Income Tax, our services shouldn't have to either!\n\nIt's a mockery and a total lack of respect for all those risking life and limb in war zones around the world.\n\nWe urge the government to act with immediate effect. You owe them, not the other way round!",
