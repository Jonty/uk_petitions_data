            "background": "Given today's political climate and public opinion, working with children and vulnerable people can be quite dangerous. Any false allegation can damage the accused's reputation before they have a chance to defend themselves in court. Professional and personal relationships can remain damaged even though the accused is aqquited.\n\nI propose the following: Due to the nature of the job, employees should be paid generous \"danger money\" for the potential risks. A sensible sum should be \u00a35,000/year+ on top of normal salaries depending on assessed risk to the employee.\nThe money will come from the institutions / organisations who expose their employees to such risk.\n\nNOTE: This petition has nothing to do with the CRB check system.",
