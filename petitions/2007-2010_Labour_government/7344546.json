            "background": "In the wake of recent publicity given to a tragic missing child situation, we strongly urge the government to create a robustly enforcable law,CLEARLY placing responsibility on parents and carers to arrange for infants under five to be cared for, at all times, by a responsible adult.\nClear, unambiguous guidelines should be given regarding the care of older children, especially those who have special needs of any kind.\nParents of under 5s should have to attend twice yearly, multidisciplinary talks at a local school or clinic, to ensure that they are aware of the minimum standards of child protection.\nParents who renege on this requirement should face clearly defined sanctions.\nIn the event of an avoidable tragedy, due to their failure to carry out their responsibilities,parents should be placed on a register and prevented from being allowed to work professionally with children or young people, in any responsible capacity.",
