            "background": "From September the DSA are going to change the  driving test \nFor ten minutes  you will have to follow road signs or a diagram or a list of directions \nI think this will make the test harder for people  that suffer with disabilities like autism , dyslexia or for people who do not speak English  , it will also make it harder for people that get very nervous under test conditions  or do not live in towns with test centres  \nThe DSA estimate that it will take on average about five more hours to  pass your driving test  so costing about \u00a3100 more to learn to drive\nIf you think these changes are wrong sign this petition",
