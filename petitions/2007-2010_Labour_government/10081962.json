        "background": "The H&S law states workplaces should provide 'adequate supply of wholesome drinking water with an upward drinking jet or suitable cups should be provided' and 'Bottled water or water dispensing systems may still be provided as a secondary source of drinking water'. I have been at work before and none of the water fountains have worked or there are no cups. This is breaking the law. Also my employer did not provide bottled water at their own expense - we did. This is the 3rd day this has happened. I have seen many colleagues collapsing in the heat. This should not happen",
