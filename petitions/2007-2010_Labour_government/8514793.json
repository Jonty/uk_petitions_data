            "background": "I wish to put forward this petition because i am sure i am one of many who is tired of working to fund people who choose to take drugs (it was their choice before they got addicted) and into the bargan while us working class are paying tax etc from our HARD EARNED WAGES drug users are having rent/mortgages, food, health perscriptions and dental treatments and debts paid for them. Not that it isnt bad enough that they steal from our homes, cars, pockets etc I feel the government are basically giving them easy access to our pockets. I want the govenrment to stop funding drug users maybe then the NHS would cope rather than scraping the barrel with the rubbish budget they get. Drug users may even realise that by taking drugs doesn't give you the easy life.",
