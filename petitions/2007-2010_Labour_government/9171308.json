        "background": "The Human Tissue and Embryology Bill allows scientists to create a variety of embryos made up of of different species. Public consultations to date have overwhelmingly rejected this research. It presents the dilemma of what it will actually mean to be 'human'. We should not be dismantling natural evolutionary barriers between species for the sake of research that can be underatken using other methods e.g. using adult cells.   \n\nQuestions remain: a)What are the benefits? b)Will there be more animal experimentation? c)Why not rely on alternative stem cell research (adult cells) d) Why leave ethical decisions to an unelected quango (HFEA)? e) Why has the government not been pro-active in its public messaging? \n\nWe need a properly informed public debate now on the benefits,risks and ethics before legislation is passed.",
