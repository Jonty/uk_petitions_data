        "background": "The Pegasus bus was refused funding from the government back in 2005 when the bus service was offered to parents. Surrey County Council have funded it since then but are now trying to stop this. We ask that the government intervene especially as they are encouraging us to be more Eco-friendly. There is not a better way to reduce pollution on the roads. For most of us this service is vital for getting our children to school in a safe environment with people we trust.",
