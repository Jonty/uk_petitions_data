            "background": "I think we should take a leaf out of JOE ARPAIO's book when it comes to our penal system.\nSheriff Joe Arpaio created the 'tent city jail' to save on another expensive prison complex.\nHe banned smoking in the jails, took away weightlifting equipment.They're in jail to pay a debt to society not to build muscles. He started chain gangs to use the inmates to do free work on county and city projects and save taxpayer's money.He makes his prisoners wear pink.Criminals should be punished for their crimes, not live in luxury until it's time for parole, only to go out and commit more crimes.\nWhen are we going to follow suit?Criminals should be punished and they should be working for free in chain gangs and saving us from going into a recession. There was apparently 81,135 prisoners in England and Wales in September 2007.Please let this country punish the criminals in this country before it becomes even more lawless than it already is!",
