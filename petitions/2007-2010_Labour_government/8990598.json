            "background": "20% of my income goes on council tax,i am self employed , this is not a fair and just tax system that discriminates against the low paid,it should be worked out by means testing,the council does not take into account that people have mortgages to pay,so this is disregarded if you try and claim for council tax rebate,i can not claim for council tax rebate so i have to give the council 20% of my meagre earnings,if reform is not carried out soon you will see something similar to the poll tax riots",
