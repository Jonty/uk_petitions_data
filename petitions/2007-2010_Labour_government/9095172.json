            "background": "With my council, as well as general rubbish, they collect garden waste and cardboard in a wheelie bin. Also they collect glass, food/drink cans in one box and newspapers in the other box. However, with the same households week in, week out, just the general rubbish wheelie bin is taken out. This means, there are some lazy people around. They do have gardens and high chance that their food/drink comes from packaging made from glass, tin or cardboard. Street collections is the most easiest forms of recycling, yet some people don't bother to use the facilities given to them by their councils.",
