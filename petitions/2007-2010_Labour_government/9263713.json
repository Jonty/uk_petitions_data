            "background": "A company that has to take Child Maintenance from an employee because of a \"Deduction of Earnings\" order has up to the 19th of the following month to send it to the CSA. \n1) A DOE is a last resort when an absent parent refuses their responsibility.\n2) The DOE is made for the absolute \"minimum\" an absent parent should pay.\nCompanies are earning interest on the money they keep for up to 5 weeks without sending to the children involved. Why should these companies earn money while children are forced to wait for their maintenance?\nThis can mean children are provided for financially; over 2 months in arrears, even though the non-resident parent has paid 1 month in arrears. (Which in itself is wrong, why are they allowed to support their children in arrears?).\nImmoral companies are earning money from children by making them wait for their (legally given) maintenance, to earn themselves interest.\nChange the law to benefit the children.. Maintenance money should be sent to the children immediately!",
