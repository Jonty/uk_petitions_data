            "background": "With all the global warming issues and road congestion problems we face today why is it so essential that everyone still drives a car?\n\nI am finding it increasingly tough to find a job simply because i refuse to take my driving test and buy a car, I have made a moral choice to not drive, I dont need to drive and in 30 years of life its never been essential to me. So why is it that i get asked at every job interview \"do you have your own car\" even if the job is only a 5 minute walk frm my house and is not a driving based job?\n\nwhy is it that not driving is seen as a negative by employers?\n\nIf I am willing to walk to work and use public transport shouldnt this be seen as a positive thing clearly im not a lazy person this should be seen as a positive not a negative point.\n\nbesides why would i even go for a job that i couldnt even get to it makes no sense at all to ask a potential employee if he or she drives or not.\n\ni believe that asking this question should be banned outright and seen as descrimination infact with todays carbon emissions i think the government should enforce that employers should employ a certain percentage of their work force who do not drive cars its good for peoples health and its good for the environment.",
