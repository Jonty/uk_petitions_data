            "background": "Councils apply council tax exemptions for houses that are empty and are in need of structural repair. At the moment, this only applies for the first 12 months. We are at the first anniversary of the major floods in 2007. It is estimated that around 5,000 households who had their homes flooded last summer are still unable to move back home as their houses are still unsafe to live in. I find it disheartening when these people are expected to pay when they cannot live in their house. The govt should scrap a time limit for giving exemption to pay council tax if the house is damaged by fire, floods, explosion, strong winds, earthquakes etc.",
