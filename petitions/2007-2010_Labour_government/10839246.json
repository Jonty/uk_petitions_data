        "background": "With merchant shipping under attack and with innocent seafarers being kidnapped, it is clear we are not effectively policing modern maritime piracy. We therefore petition the Prime Minister to ensure action is taken to tackle this devastating crime epidemic, particularly around the Horn of Africa.\nStrong and effective policing of these seas are vital, and naval vessels should be freed to enter Somali territorial waters in order to tackle pirates with deadly force. In addition, changes to the legal process are needed to allow effective punishment of pirates, and those who benefit from the proceeds of piracy.\nThere is also a need for action to be taken ashore, as currently the pirate gangs are left relatively unmolested, and military intervention is needed to ensure they are unable to function in the future.\nWithout a mandate and a genuine political will to end piracy, more seafarers will be kidnapped, more ships will be taken, and there are genuine risks posed to life, property, the environment, and to the movement of trade and energy supplies along the vital sea routes between Asia, the Middle East and Europe.",
