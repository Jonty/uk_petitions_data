            "background": "HGV's are restricted to 56 mph - all modern HGV\u2019s vehicles are powerful and even when fully loaded can sustain this speed on all sections of Britain\u2019s motorways - it is therefore impossible for one to overtake another unless they speed or crawl past each other for mile after mile - therefore in the interests of safety and to improve traffic flow they should be banned from overtaking each other",
