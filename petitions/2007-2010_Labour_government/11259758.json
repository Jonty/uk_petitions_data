            "background": "We wish to ensure that the sport of Water Polo is properly represented in 2012. The sport missed out in the first funding announcement because of the shortfall in the promised amount in spite of meeting all its' performance targets to date. GB has won the most medals in the sport since 1900 and the game was invented here. Only one nation has failed to send a team to its' home games since 1900. We don't want to be the second. Please support us as many of our athletes have spent 5 years training for this.",
