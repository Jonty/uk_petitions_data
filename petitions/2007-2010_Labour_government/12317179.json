            "background": "The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has long been undermining family values around the world and recently a Director of UNFPA, Arie Hoekman, has gone on record saying that the breakdown of traditional families is a triumph for human rights. Hoekman denounced the idea that high rates of divorce represent a social crisis, claiming that they represent a triumph. Other members of UNFPA publicly supported this sentiment at the time.\n\nFamilies have a place in our country. Where possible, children should be brought up in loving homes with two parents. The UNFPA ignores international law and the UN declaration on the basic human rights of children and the natural family as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is not an organisation that the United Kingdom should support or condone.",
