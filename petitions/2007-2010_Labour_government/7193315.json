            "background": "This is in response to a petition asking that aid to India be stopped on the grounds that the Indian government has (allegedly) got billions in foreign currency.  Even if this is true the Indian PEOPLE aren't benefiting from this; unless and until EVERYONE in a specific country has FULL POWER to order their government to spend its revenue on the poorest of its people it is totally unfair to penalise the people for any money the GOVERNMENT (or, even more, any dictator) has in its/his (or her) coffers.\n\nWhile looking through current petitions to prepare for this one I saw A LOT of petitions against overseas aid; in fact I don't think there was EVEN ONE in favour.  No doubt the creators of all these petitions take a \"charity begins at home\" stance; but surely it is only fair for charity to begin WHERE IT IS NEEDED which, in most cases, is NOT \"at home\" but in Third World countries such as India.  No one has any control over where they are born; it is very unfair for any individual to be penalised for this.",
