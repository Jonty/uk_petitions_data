Fuel cell combined heat and power generators can give home owners the opportunity to do their bit by investing in equipment, provided the excess power they produce can be sold profitably back to the power companies. \nFuel cell technology is not variable according to the weather and does not require vast investment in infrastructure or waste handling.The effiency is greater than solar in the uk  and the uk is in the forefront of this technology both in manufacturing and application, for example in the Shetland Islands.",
