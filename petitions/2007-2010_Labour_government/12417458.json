        "background": "By signing this petition, you are acknowledging that families and marriages are sacred and should be allowed to continue to grow and remain healthy despite incarceration.  A healthy marriage requires emotional, as well as physical, intimacy.  In addition, children need to have and develop a bond with an incarcerated parent.  As a nation, we must stand and protect our families despite court involvement.  By supporting this petition, you are recognising and establishing the vital importance of the family bond and unit.  We must realise that innocent family members should not be punished along with the incarcerated family member; families should be supported for the benefit of all involved.  The therapeutic value of conjugal visits will far outweigh any future criticism which evolves.   I strongly urge you to take into account healthy families and marriages when choosing to endorse this petition.",
