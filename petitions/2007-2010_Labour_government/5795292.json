This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, and the staff at the zoo should know better than to do this. \n\nThis is not the first time I have seen this horrendous sight, a couple of months back, we saw the exact same thing at Whipsnade Zoo. I strongly recommend that you introduce new legislation about animal rights.",
