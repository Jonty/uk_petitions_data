            "background": "Having been forced to listen to how the 'poor' banks are having a tough time paying back the billions of pounds that they have borrowed and can no longer afford to pay back, I am disgusted that the taxpayer is now being robbed to bail them out. These organisations have borrowed beyond their means, they should now have to pay the price. The average Joe who can no longer pay his debts risks losing his home, is this government going to bail him out in the same way??? If not why not?? \nDoes the government not think that Banks should be held responsible for their mistakes??\nIf you agree, please sign this petition and make the government see that we do not have endless funds to throw away, bailing out irresponsible banking practice.",
