            "background": "Joanna Lumley has over many years championed many worthy causes. We feel that due recognition should be given to her for these efforts. Note should also be made for fearless way she fought for the rights of Gurkas to reside in this country; at the same time, she reflected and championed the country's sense of fair play against the government's unwillingness to consider the reasonableness of the Gurka's case for residence. At all times, Miss Lumley has behaved with a sense of purpose whilst displaying the due respect to ministers dealing with the matter. She has been an example to us all in that she has shown that democracy does work and that one person can make a difference.",
