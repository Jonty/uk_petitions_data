            "background": "Default Notices remain on Credit Files for 6 years following the issue of such notice.\n\nIt is apparent that some Default Notices are not as severe as others i.e. amount, time taken to pay, etc. A CCJ paid within one month of issue will be removed from Credit Files, however Default Notices remain for 6 years decreasing the chances of obtaining credit for the individuals concerned, yet these are not considered on a case by case basis.\n\nThere is no legislation stating that a Default Notice should remain on a Credit File for 6 years (only referred to by the \"Crowther Report\") yet it is assumed this is 'fair'.\n\nWe propose either a 'scale' for Default Notices i.e.\n\u00a31 to \u00a3500 - 1 Year\n\u00a3501 to \u00a31500 - 2/3 years\n\u00a31501 to \u00a33000 - 3/4 years\n\u00a33000+ - 4 years+\n\nOR a standard amount of time set to 3/4 years which we deem to be a fair amount of time for the Default Notice to remain on a Credit File.\n\nWe hope you consider our proposal and aid many people repair such damaging information in a timely fashion who, in some cases have had the Default Notice issued in unfair cases.\n\nWe thank you for your time.",
