            "background": "Britain is seizing up with the cold and many pavements and roads are iced up.  We cannot expect local authorities to clear all this for us especially when grit is short.  On the continent of Europe citizens clear pavements and roads of snow outside their houses and this makes walking and driving safer.  It also prevents snow and ice build-up.  We need reminding of this responsibility by government so we can get the country moving again and make it safer for pedestrians and road users.",
