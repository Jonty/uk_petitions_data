            "background": "Christian Aid today reports that the WB privatisation model is failing to deliver energy to the world's poorest people and the gap between promoting clean, affordable energy. \n\nGiven Hilary Benn's webchats, the petitioner is urging the P.M. to examine tariffs as a strategy to support the excellent work of Al Gore on climate change. 1.6 billion people wordwide have no access to electricity -800 million people lack fuel for basic cooking. Imported oil still is relied upon in most developing countries to generate electricity, so any strategy on Iraq may well win credence amongst the world's poor. Just as the G8 countries have offered support to Iran to develop it's nuclear capacity, so long as it is not militaristic, development of an international grid would be a great mark for our generation to reach the poorest of the poor and impact globally on the seeds of discontent, mainly I believe, poverty, bad governance, corruption, poor education and unstable infrastructures, which is the real enemy in the so - called war on poverty and war on terrorism. What does the rest of the nation think ?",
