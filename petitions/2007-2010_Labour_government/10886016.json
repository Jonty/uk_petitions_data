            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many people coming off Northern Rock fixed terms are now finding themselves trapped with the SVR due to loss of equity in their homes which does not allow them to move mortgage. The SVR is currently punishing these people further with no where to go. The least that can be done is to ensure NR cut this rate in accordance with the BOE rate cut considering it is out tax money that was used to prop it up and it is now a state owned bank. In fact NR should have been the first bank to announce a cut.",
