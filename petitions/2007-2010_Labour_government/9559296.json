            "background": "The current system of 'understanding' criminals and ensuring that their Human Rights are retained at all cost needs to be reconsidered. Latest figures show in excess of 70% recidivism. prisons should be made very basic with no 'frills'. Criminals must be made to understand that the Human Right to a peaceful life without risk of violence takes precedence over the comfort of the criminal. Prisons need to return to slopping out and chain gangs. I acknowledge that this would be seen as demeening for the prisoner, but surely this is what should be the case? At the moment a murderer is given a comfortable lifestyle with access to their loved ones, why should this be? They have deprived the victim's family of that human right. Prison must once again become a place to be feared or this society is doomed.",
