            "background": "We believe that Meredydd Hughes should resign from the police force in order to become a champion of the motorist\u2019s human rights.  \nInstead of arbitrary fines and revenue collection, we want to see the firm treatment of road users who cause accidents or fail to avoid them.\n\n\n\nSuch a simple approach would likely be the correct road to removing road traffic accidents altogether.\n\n\n\nFixed penalty speeding offences are uneconomical to defend despite flagrant mis-use of speed camera equipment especially with motorcycles.\n\n\n\nThe government have been seen to conspire in the artificial increase of congestion to support congestion & parking charges in an agenda of revenue over fairness. This must change.",
