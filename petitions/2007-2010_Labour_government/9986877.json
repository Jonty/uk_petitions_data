        "background": "This petition call for a review of the way that taxi's and private hire vehicles in the UK are governed.\n\nAt present the situation is covered by the police and town clauses act. This act was brought in over 100 years ago when Hackney Carriages were drawn by horse with a spare hay bale. Over the ensuing years ammendments have been made but never a full review.\n\nIt is my opinion that a full review should be made as there are now Private hire vehicles/drivers aswell as Hackney carriages. Local authorities and local police authorities are over-stretched in trying to regulate this area. With drink fuelled crime in cities quite high, surely a safer system of getting people home would be greatly appreciated.",
