            "background": "I read Rupert Christiansen in the press saying that this film should be 'precisely the sort of thing that should be the bread and butter of the BBC's arts remit' but isn't.  He went on to say that the film-maker Phil Grabsky's two films IN SEARCH OF MOZART & IN SEARCH OF BEETHOVEN should be in every school music department. They are 'films that give those who already know Beethoven & Mozart enormous pleasure, and at the same time would provide any receptive 12-year-old with the ideal introduction to the men and their music'.  Music should be part all of our cultural tapestries and this would be an excellent - and cheap - first step.  I commend this petition to all that read it and especially the Prime Minister.",
