            "background": "I was bitten on the face by a dog in Jan 2007 and was very lucky to have been treated at my local NHS hospital (University Hospital Coventry) by very efficient medical and nusing staff whom did a marvelous job of suturing me for which i shall be eternally grateful for. I would like to form a petition that all hospitals in the UK that treat patients for dog bites are automatically referred to the police for further investigation and recorded on a national database. This is due to the fact that sometimes it may be a friend or family dog or an incident may have happened in the family recently preventing a victim from going to the police to report the dog bite. This petition would take the matters out of the hands of the victim and the police would investigate further.",
