During this time, he has also been a paid consultant for the preferential bidder to run the ID card scheme. When we can't even trust our elected representatives not to fiddle their expenses, how can we trust that their judgment won't be clouded by external, paid, influences? Public office should be an honour and not a privilege, and it should be the sole focus of the incumbent's attention. Since politicians are feeling contrite, now is the time to get something done. I urge you to sign this petition.",
