Announcing a \u00a36m grant to help cover the maintenance costs of the Humber Bridge, the Minister said \"the government is committed to doing everything it can to protect communities and businesses from economic downturn and to help the country recover. This is why I recently decided not to accept the Humber Bridge board's proposed toll increases\". The users of the Severn Bridge pay the highest tolls in the country and, by adding VAT to the charges, the government has extended the date the bridge is due to revert back to the state by 2 years to approx. 2016.",
