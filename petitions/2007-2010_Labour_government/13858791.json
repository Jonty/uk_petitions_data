This is why I recently decided not to accept the Humber Bridge board's proposed toll increases\". The users of the Severn Bridge pay the highest tolls in the country and, by adding VAT to the charges, the government has extended the date the bridge is due to revert back to the state by 2 years to approx. 2016.",
