            "background": "There is no Central government in Somalia. While parts of the north are relatively peaceful, including much of the self-declared \"Republic of Somaliland,\" interclan and interfactional fighting can flare up with little warning, and kidnapping, murder and other threats to foreigners can occur unpredictably in Mogadishu (mainly). \n\nSince 1991, 350,000-1,000,000 Somalis have died because of the conflict.\n\nLatest reports say: about 3 millions peoples are dislocated, lost their properties and require desperately food and medical attention.\nThe political chaos and humanitarian disaster in Somalia made this country the worst place in Africa (possibly in the world!).\n\nSince the deployment of the Ethiopian troops in Somalis, they have been killing and raping young girls as old as 10 and killing everyone on there way, as British I would like to see the Prime minister to get the Ethiopian troops out of Somalis so that a young generation we can re build our home country.",
