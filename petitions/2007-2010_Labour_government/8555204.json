            "background": "The current enforcement methods used to tackle antisocial behaviour are not dealing with the problem. ASBOs are not acting as a deterrent and it can take months of complaining to authorities  to get anything done. \n\nAs has been noted by many commentators we are losing control of our streets\n\nThis petition calls for a zero tolerance approach to dealing with antisocial behaviour with much stronger powers, such as a greater use of on the spot fines, community service orders and custodial sentences used at a very early stage to stop this behaviour.\n\nNeighbours from hell and antisocial youths should know that their actions face immediate punishment.",
