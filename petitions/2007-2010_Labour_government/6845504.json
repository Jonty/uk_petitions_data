            "background": "according to our extensive research, it has become clear that Chuck Norris is in fact superhuman and therefore in our opinion deserves the rank of sainthood. We would like to recommend Wales as the country he may become Patron Saint of. Here are a few reasons why:Chuck Norris does not hunt because the word hunting implies the probability of failure - Chuck Norris goes killing. In fine print on the last page of the Guinness Book of World Records it notes that all world records are held by Chuck Norris, and those listed in the book are simply the closest anyone else has ever gotten. There is no theory of evolution, just a list of creatures Chuck Norris allows to live.Chuck Norris has two speeds: Walk and Kill. \nWhen Chuck Norris falls in water, Chuck Norris doesn't get wet. Water gets Chuck Norris. And our main reason is that Chuck Norris doesn't do push ups, he infact pushed the earth down.",
