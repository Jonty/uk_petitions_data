            "background": "A radical muslim group has launched an effort to bring full Sharia Law to the United Kingdon of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We are a nation of equality and diversitys but this is taking it too far. We are also a Christian country and always have been. The head of state i.e. Queen Elizabeth II is a christan. The introduction of sharia law will make a mockery of this countries excellent legal system that has developed over centuries. Vote now to say NO to the introduction of sharia law to our glorious nation",
