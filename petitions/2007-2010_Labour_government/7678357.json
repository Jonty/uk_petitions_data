            "background": "In 2005 Parliament took a brave decision to abolish aspects of an activity that the vast majority of the public in the country wanted banned. Fox Hunting, Stag Hunting, Hare Hunting & Hare Coursing was all banned by the will of a free democratic society. We now urge the Prime-minister and Government to continue its full support of the Hunting Act 2004 and ensure that its use is upheld. We also seek that the laws contained are clear for all to follow so there can be no doubts to the legal standing of the law.",
