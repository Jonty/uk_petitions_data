            "background": "Ronnie Biggs surrendered to police in 2001. He is now aproaching 80 years of age and is in poor health. We should show we have compation and release him because if he were to die in prison it would be a life sentence instead of 30 years. If he hadn't escaped and caused embarrasment to the authorities even serving his full sentence without remission he would have been freed in 1993. He has now served 8 years and deserves to be freed on compationate grounds as he is no longer a threat to society, just an embarrasement to the government.",
