            "background": "I recently (5-6pm on 14/9/07 Reading to Leamington Spa) returned home on a packed Virgin train and as a wheelchair user (not my reason for starting this petition),  I felt trapped and many people standing had to get off to let me out. \n\nThere was so many people standing in aisle ways etc, a fire or crash would have been disastrous. The manager announced that this was not Virgin's fault, but the government for restricting the number of carriages used, and \"if we were sheep, cattle, cats or dogs it would be illegal\". \n\nPlatforms may be too short for longer trains, but trains could stop, let people in say 5 carriages on/off, then move down and do the same for the remaining carriages. It surely can not be that difficult?\n\nWhen I heard the this government limit the number of carriages put on trains, I laughed at first, but felt very angry. If this government are serious about reducing road traffic and carbon emissions, they will take this idea seriously.",
