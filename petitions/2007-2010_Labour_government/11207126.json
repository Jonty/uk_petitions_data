I ask the Prime Minister to come clean and admit to the public of Great Britain that the GOVERNMENT strategy with regards to speeding was nothing more than a money making exercise at the expensive of the hard working individuals who have been unnecessarily discriminated against, convicted as well as stressed out thanks to a strategy that has had absolutely NO IMPACT on the saving of lives. I would also ask the Prime Minister to explain to the public WHY they are being held 100% liable for their actions on/in vehicles capable of excessive speeds.",
