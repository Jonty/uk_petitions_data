            "background": "As described from Identity and Passport Service.\n\nBritish passports are issued primarily to British citizens, British Overseas Territories citizens, and British Overseas citizens as defined by the British Nationality Act 1981m which came into force on the 1 January 1983.\n\nSection 1 of this Act says that a person born in the United Kingdom on or after 1 January 1983 will be a British citizen if, when they were born, either parent was a British Citizen or was settled in the United Kingdom.\n\nFor those before 1 July 2006, whose parents are unmarried citizenship can be claimed only through the mother.\n\nIt is the last part which we find unfair as my partner has lived here all his life, acts, talks, works, pay taxes as an Englishman. but because his parents were not married when he was born he cannot get an English Passport. Please change this.",
