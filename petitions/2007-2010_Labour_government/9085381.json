        "background": "With technology making everything smaller it is within the realms of possibility to inject/fit every child, shortly after birth, with a tracking chip.  This would allow police to find any missing/abducted children in good time as well as a host of other benefits such as mix ups of children  in hospital.  A simple reader could give the childs surname, DOB, and a bar code ID.  I would like to petition the Government to investigate a safe and proper device and method of installation, then to get full approval to start fitting a Children's Tracking Device (CTD).  This may need to dissolve after 21 years and so negate removal for personal freedom issues.",
