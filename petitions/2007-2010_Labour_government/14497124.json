            "background": "In Uganda, there is a bill which will essentially condemn gay people and their supporters (including people who are aware of a gay relationship) to hefty prison sentences or death. This is an archaic and horrendous bill, especially in the light of strong evidence to suggest that homosexuality first occurs in the womb, with the possibility of a \"gay gene\". The bill is clearly discriminatory and needs to be stopped, because thousands of innocent lives are at stake.",
