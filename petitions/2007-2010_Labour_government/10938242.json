            "background": "I am epileptic and had a bad illness last year, my partner took time off work to look after me, we were with preferred mortgages and because we missed 2 payments they took us to court to take our home from us. The judge said it was nonsense and put a suspended possesion order on the property so there is always the threat of them taking our home because the order does not get removed until arrears are cleared, but they add on 60.00 each month beacuse we are in arrears, its unfair that people work hard to better themselves instead of using benefits and social housing and you get repayed this way.  In this day and age you are better off being out of work, sick and on benefits then you have no worries at all, but some people want more than that in life !!",
