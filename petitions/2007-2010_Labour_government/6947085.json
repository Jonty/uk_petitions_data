        "background": "We live in an age of multiple technologies, where music and film can be viewed on anything from a standard TV to a mobile phone yet the industry that produces this content consistently tries to develop technologies to hinder a consumer transferring from one media to another for personal use, I cannot legally copy a film purchased on DVD to my phone without using dubious software (being illegal in the current climate) because of the restrictions placed upon DVD's by the industry. So I ask the government to add to the consumer legislation that already exists a consumers right to transfer information across differing media and outlaw any such technologies (e.g. DRM, CSS) that hinder this process.",
