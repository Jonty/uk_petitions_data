            "background": "Currently numerous teachers are being driven out of the profession by systematic bullying in the workplace. Many of these these situations go unreported or are concealed by sick leave, gardening leave or staff leaving the profession to seek employment elsewhere. The profession can ill afford to lose high skilled teachers it has invested heavily in. Every workplace has a duty of care to its staff but this seems to be the last thing that many heads think about as they ensure that the school runs effectively. It is in the best interests of all stakeholders that staff feel supported and work in an environment that is supportive not oppressive. A happy employee is an effective one; it is a sad state of affairs that this fact has been lost in many schools. It is never to late too do something, but unless this is tackled soon it will be for a whole generation of teachers.",
