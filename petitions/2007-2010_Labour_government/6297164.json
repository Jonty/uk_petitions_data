        "background": "By banning the sale of electrical items with a stand-by function, we are taking forward existing logical government thinking. As existing items are replaced over time the ethic of switching-off would become mandatory and standard. This reduces energy use, and has the added bonus of improved electrical/fire safety. The petition also allows for an out for items which require a stand-by function on the grounds of safety.",
