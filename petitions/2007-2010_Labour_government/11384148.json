In the recent conflict there has been use of phosphorus weapons against its own people, which amounts to the use of chemical weapons. The UK government was quick to condemn Saddam Hussein for similar actions. We feel that the UK government must show consistency and clearly condemn Israel  for its atrocious behaviour in the current conflict.",
