            "background": "According to current legislation, since shops are private premises, shop owners or authorized staff have the right to refuse entry or ask people to leave without giving any reason whatsoever. This sometimes results in customers being treated in an offensive manner. The incident that led to this petition, for example, involved a mother and her baby being asked to leave a shop because the staff unjustly accused the baby of passing wind, and were not able to provide any proof. Such situations are totally unacceptable and should not be allowed to happen. Shops and businesses may constitute private premises, but the public are permitted access to them and while in the premises they should reserve the right to remain unless they behave anti-socially or commit a crime.",
