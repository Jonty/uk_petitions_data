            "background": "Increasingly, home and mobile phone tariffs include free calls to geographic numbers but all non-geographic numbers remain chargeable. People contacting government departments are therefore forced to pay for the call even if they could call a geographic number for free. This can seriously impact those most likely to call a government number - for example, benefits claimants - and who are least likely to be able to afford the call.",
