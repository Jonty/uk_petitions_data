            "background": "I would like to know that why in a country such as the United Kingdom where animal cruelty, safety and well being plays a big part of our lives,  the government chooses to ignore the recommendation from the FAWC on the slaughter of animals for purpose of halah meat(Recommendation 201. Council considers that slaughter without pre-stunning is unacceptable and that the Government should repeal the current exemption.)This is allowed to continue whilst our own farmers and slaughter houses are strictly monitored and fined should they not follow recommendations set out for them. \n\nThis whole situation once again shows the double standards we face in this country, where the civilised people of this country have to sit back and obey strict rules and laws whilst others can carry on their sick barbaric ways in the name of their religion.\n\nWe insist that you follow these recommendations set by the FAWC and stop this sicken slaughter.",
