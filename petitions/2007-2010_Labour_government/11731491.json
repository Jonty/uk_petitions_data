        "background": "The government is proposing to exclude transgendered people who are not transsexual from the Equality Bill. They argue that this is because being trans is a \"choice\" and that there is no evidence that there is systemic discrimination against transgendered people.\n\nThis is incorrect on both counts. Transgendered people do not choose to be trans, and the government has been sent compelling evidence that there is systemic discrimination.\n\nGiven that both the reasons given by the government for this exclusion are wrong, the government should reconsider and protect ALL trans people from the discrimination they suffer from on a regular basis.",
