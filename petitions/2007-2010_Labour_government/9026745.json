            "background": "Look at the leaps and bounds that technology has taken since these limits were last reviewed, and increase the speed limits. A blanket increase of 10 miles per hour on all existing limits would be a good start.\n\nMost people, it seems, drive faster than the speed limit anyway. \n\nThis could free up police time and allow them to fight the real criminals. \n\nAll drivers pay a lot of money to use the roads and we should be listened to. This is not a request for an email response about why we cannot do this, but a call for action.",
