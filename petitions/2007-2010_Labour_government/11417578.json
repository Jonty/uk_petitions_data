            "background": "Get the Banks to stop the arrogance and start releasing tax payers money to the tax payer and their employers. The company I work for has been brought to its knees by the simple fact that the Banks are unwilling to lend money so that firms, like the one I work for can progress. Since October, when this started, they have laid off 20% of the work force. Previous to this the Company was booming. You can point the finger at one institution - the Banks of this country. HELP NOW before its too late. Gordon Brown, the man partly responsible for the biggest ressession in living memory.",
