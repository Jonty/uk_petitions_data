            "background": "We need to encourage UK manufacturers and the best way to do this is to give them a competitive advantage through making all UK produced goods exempt from VAT while increasing the VAT on all imported goods. This would have the benefits of encouraging UK manufacturing and reducing the price to the high street consumer, while keeping the VAT revenue stream for the government. It should be done as part of a \"Buy British\" drive.",
