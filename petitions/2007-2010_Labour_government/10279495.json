Many schools and hospitals were destroyed during the civil war and many are without good education and medical care. They need support from Britain and other countries to help develop a peaceful solution to the country's problems. May there be no more fighting and they will be able to live in peaceful co-existence together. Support is needed for the Salisbury-Sudan link to help them continue their support of our brothers and sisters in Sudan.",
