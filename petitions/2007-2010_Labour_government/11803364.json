        "background": "Crime is illegal (Sounds obvious but it doesn't seem that way). Don't allow police / the courts and yourselves to turn a blind eye to all criminal activities. Your citizens are victims of your complacent attitude towards fighting crime. I have seen many police allow crimes to occur in front of them with no consequences. Prisons cost money - yes! But, I would rather you spent money on prisons than banks! If crime goes on unpunished, how can you expect your people to listen to anything else you say! Lead the country by creating respect and values. Surely, there is an objective to your legacy. And I don't think allowing rape / murder / stabbings / theft to go unpunished is what you want to leave for this country!",
