        "action": "NOT increase PE lessons in school to 5 hours a week",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Firstly, until every child performs at expected levels of numeracy and literacy, academics are more important.\nSecondly, many people who are now young adults, such as myself, hated and dreaded PE lessons at school. For less naturally athletic children, these are painfully tedious, make them feel like failures, and are an opportunity for other kids - and even sadistic teachers - to pick on them. This damages their self-esteem.\nSport is a LEISURE activity and should mainly be done out of school, just as dance, drama and music are.\nAnd tackling the obesity problem? Ha. I either got out of PE lessons on some excuse or other, or spent most of them sitting around waiting for my turn.\nFar from setting up healthy habits, I was turned OFF exercise.",
