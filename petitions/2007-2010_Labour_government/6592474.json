        "background": "My Local Authority, the London Borough of Camden, became a Lib-Dem/Conservative coalition this year, after decades of Labour control, by promising to freeze Council Tax.  This was obviously a popular measure but - equally obviously - it necessitated cuts in services and these cuts seem to be targeted mainly, if not exclusively, on services which benefit the poorer sections of society most of whom are eligible for Council Tax Benefit.  This means people in this situation are losing out twice: by reductions in services on which they depend and also by not benefiting from the freeze.",
