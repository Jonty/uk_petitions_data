            "background": "There is current discussions around increasing the cost of alcohol which would impact on every citizen within the UK who chooses to consume alcohol. Most people who use alcohol do so with responsibility and why should they pay further tax and cost due to minority actions, considering we already pay for policing and criminal justice through income tax? This approach, once again, persecutes the responsible majority in order to 'target' an irresponsible minority. The likely result of such an action would be that the responsible majority would pay more for alcohol and the 'troublesome' minority would likely turn to street drugs as they are invariably cheaper than alcohol. Has anyone done any research into poly drug use and the impact on crime or does everyone assume it's solely alcohol which fuels anti-social behaviours?\nCan we have an adult debate based on real facts rather than a backdoor tax based on public fears?",
