Although sufferers look normal to the untrained eye, these incurable conditions cause extreme pain & discomfort to anyone who suffers from them.  Associated problems are depression, bruising, dislocation of joints, palpitations, CFS, ME, severe pain.  Sufferers are being denied DLA because there are no external signs of this problem.  Many visiting doctors from the DWP are not aware of the condition & sufferers are being excluded from the system. Awareness of these serious medical problems needs to be adressed urgently.",
