            "background": "I believe that the Prime Minister does not address concerns raised in petitions in an appropriate manner. Too many times responses have not been clear, concise and in plain English.  They are often full of legal terminology and are too long winded. \n\nThe recent petition about AM-FM-Radio is an excellent example.  The response could have been summed up like this:\n\n\u201cWe will only switch off AM-FM Radio when over 50% of the people listening are doing so on digital. Currently it\u2019s 20%.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no clear response to the main points of the petition.\n\nAnother point is that a petition has to be kept to 1000 characters, the government\u2019s response is unlimited. E.g. The response to the AM-FM Radio petition is 1722 characters long.\n\nIn a nutshell my petition is that the government\u2019s responses to petitions should be limited to 1000 characters as well in plain English and concise. However if the response is in plain English and concise there should be no need for the limit of 1000 characters.",
