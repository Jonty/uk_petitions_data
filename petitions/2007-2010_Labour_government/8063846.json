            "background": "Shropshire County Council are trying to close SELATTYN village school as part of their reorganisation of local schools, with the main purpose of saving the Council money.  \n\nSelattyn school is a successful primary school in a small village near Oswestry in Shropshire.  It will cause disruption and inconvenience to pupils and their parents if the school is closed, as most pupils are local, many of whom live in the village itself. \n \n\nPlease add your signature to this petition to show your support.",
