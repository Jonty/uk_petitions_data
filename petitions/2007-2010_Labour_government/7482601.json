They dont offer any industry standard qualifications and dont give you any recognisable experience to use towards employment. \n\nI call upon the public and the prime minister to address this issue by making industry standard qualifications (nvq level 2, city and guild, modern apprenticeships, all I.T qualifications) available to those on new deal.\n\nThis can should be implemented by making the courses free, and letting the persons on these courses retain there benifit during the duration of the course.",
