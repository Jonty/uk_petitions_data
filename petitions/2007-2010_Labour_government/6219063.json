            "background": "I herewith propose banning cyclists from public roads for the following reasons; lack of protection often worn by cyclists means serious injuries occur at the tax payers expense, lack of insurance in the event of an impact with a TAX paying vehicle makes claims difficult or impossible, lack of consideration to other vehicles regardless of size, parking cycles on pedestrian footpaths risking injury to pedestrians, general smugness of paying 0.0 mpg and any other reason I\u2019ve not been bored enough to think up.\n\nLet's not approach this as rational human beings, each of which are given the born right to enjoy life provided there is no seriously detrimental effect to our fellow man. Let's always look at the financial implications on a large scale, as money is after all significantly more important than a man or woman\u2019s right to enjoy the life given to them for free.",
