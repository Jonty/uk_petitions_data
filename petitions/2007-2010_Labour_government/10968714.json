        "action": "establish a \"brand mark\" to identify high quality British goods in the domestic and international market place",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "British goods sometimes face an uphill battle in the domestic and international market place because they are often more expensive than goods manufactured in other countries.  \n \nWhat do British goods have in their favour?  Well, the fact that they are British.  They have not been produced in sweatshops, they have not been produced in flagrantly environmentally unfriendly ways and they are safe to have around.  They may cost more but they are often better.  We should drive that undoubted advantage home.\n  \nThis could be done on a British or European level but a \u201cbrand mark\u201d should be established and promoted.  It could be awarded to any company in any country whose operations met certain standards.  The brand mark could be displayed on that company\u2019s goods to demonstrate why those goods were more expensive than others and to give an additional sense of confidence to the consumer who chose to buy those goods.",
