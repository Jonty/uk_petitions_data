            "background": "The A-Level system is currently divided into two qualifications: AS and A2. \n\nThe 'AS' qualification is entirely pointless. Its only purpose is to encourage students to stay on an extra year, and so it should be an optional exam which can be taken by those who do not plan to take 'A2' levels in Year 13. \n\nIf there were no AS Levels, students would have a year without public exams in between GCSEs and A2s. Why should they undergo so much stress for a qualification that ultimately means nothing, as A2 Levels serve any purpose that the AS Levels might, but which if not obtained prevents them from having an A-Level?",
