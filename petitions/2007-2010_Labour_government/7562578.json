There is no game at Old Trafford. There is no game on the local park. Without a Referee, football is nothing.\n\nThe FA say 20% of all matches are played without a qualified Referee. This is down to increased levels of abuse, both verbal and physically, aimed at Referees.\n\nThis will affect the quality of Referees in the Premiership in coming years.\n\nPlease follow the USA's lead ** and bring in laws and tough penalties specifically for people who abuse Match Officials in sports.\n\nPROTECT THE GUARDIANS OF OUR NATIONAL GAME AT ALL LEVELS!\n\n**= Certain States Only!",
