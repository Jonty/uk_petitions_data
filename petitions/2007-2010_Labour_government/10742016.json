            "background": "With the first weekend of World Cup qualifying games behind us(weekend of Sept. 6th/7th 2008), I was appalled that not one of the free to air television companies showed highlights of the Andorra vs. England game. I can not be sure, as I do not have access to Scottish or Welsh programme scheduled, but this may also have been the same for them.\nThere are many millions of people in the United Kingdom that were deprived of watching any of their National teams football matches and I believe this may continue, given the extent of the contract between the FA and Setanta.\n\nI am not asking for all live games to be aired on terrestrial television, although this would be preferable, but at a minimum, extended highlights of each and every game, must be made available to all in the UK.",
