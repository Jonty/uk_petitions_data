        "action": "Ban Insurance Companies from using 'With-Profits' investor funds for shareholders uses/benefits",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Insurance Companies are currently paying investors 0% returns annually on their with profits investments. They are also attempting to unfairly gain acess to a larger proportion of the 'Inherited Estate'surplus for shareholder benefit. At the same time they are trying to pay a pittance so that any future distributions from these estates will only benefit shareholders. Shareholders also receive one ninth of any asset share surplus of the with profits funds annually whilst policyholders receive 0% on their annual bonus. The companies use surplus funds to bankroll strategic investments, shareholders dividend tax liabilities and new business costs. They want to add endowment misselling compensation claims to this list. The policyholders in with-profits funds are treated badly on returns (0% annually for the last 6 years) whilst shareholders receive an unfair advantage.",
