            "background": "When the channel tunnel opened, a number of shorter Eurostar trains was built in order to run North of London, for example providing a link from Birmingham to Paris, without the need to change trains. These trains were never used, partly due to perceived lack of demand and competition from cheap flights, and are now being used in France. Considering the new rail link will open in November 2007, and the environmental damage that flying causes, the government should introduce such a service. Central Birmingham to central Paris in approximately 3 hours is possible.",
