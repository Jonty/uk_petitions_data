            "background": "250 years ago, Adam Smith said that the cost of collecting a tax should only take a small part of the yield. Yet Transport for London says that the cost of collecting the London Congestion Charge in 2006/7 was over half the revenue collected. We are currently being told that a national road pricing system will be \"revenue neutral\", meaning that the Government will not take more than it will lose by scrapping related revenue streams. But this does not mean that the amount collected will be the same as at present, only the amount reaching the Exchequer. We will pay a substantial collection cost. In comparison, fuel duty is cheap to collect and each person pays an amount based on their mileage and the fuel economy (and hence carbon emissions) of their vehicle,\n\nSo we call on the Government not to introduce taxes and charges that are expensive to collect, and to consider scrapping any already in existance where the cost of collection is over 10% of the cost of revenue generated.",
