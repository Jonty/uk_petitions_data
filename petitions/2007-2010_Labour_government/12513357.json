        "action": "commit the use of an adequate number of naval vessels to patrol the areas of seas and oceans where piracy is a threat to British registered vessels, and take appropriate action, using gunfire if necessary, to capture, sink, or disable the pirate vessels, with no regard for the wellbeing of the pirate crews, and to capture the crews alive if possible, provided that the safety of Navy vessels or personnel is not compromised.",

        "background": "Although Britain is participating in struggles in the middle east, we are no longer seen as a dominant world power. America has assumed this role, based purely on its size and wealth rather than its ability.\nA conflict with pirates operating outside anybody's territorial waters would not upset anyone; and would not add appreciably to the defence budget as it equates to training.\nThe prestige from the Navy being seen to be doing something for us - the ordinary people of Britain - would raise the 'Nelson spirit'.\nIt is time we showed the world that we can still lead.",
