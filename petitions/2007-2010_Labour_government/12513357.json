            "background": "Although Britain is participating in struggles in the middle east, we are no longer seen as a dominant world power. America has assumed this role, based purely on its size and wealth rather than its ability.\nA conflict with pirates operating outside anybody's territorial waters would not upset anyone; and would not add appreciably to the defence budget as it equates to training.\nThe prestige from the Navy being seen to be doing something for us - the ordinary people of Britain - would raise the 'Nelson spirit'.\nIt is time we showed the world that we can still lead.",
