            "background": "Anyone who has lived with a rabbit knows how delicate these beautiful creatures are. For them to be torn away from their mothers, often too soon, and put in a shop environment, they are likely to  become stressed out, bullied and often ill. Little guidance is given to nutritional requirements and health, and a complete lack of regard for their inherent natures is often evident in how they are \"displayed\" for public view. These rabbits are continually bought as impulse buys that often lead them to either being neglected or abandoned. If someone is serious about adopting a rabbit they should go to a rabbit sanctuary where they are not handed out like sweets. This is disgraceful and needs to be stopped, please sign my petition and put an end to shop bought rabbits.",
