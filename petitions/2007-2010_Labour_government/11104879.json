        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The major contributing factor to a lack of organ donors is the fact that people have to go out of their way to opt in to the current organ donor scheme.\n\nPresumed consent (opt out) will automatically deem you willing to give up your organs when you die, so that someone else might live.\n\nIf you feel strongly against donating your organs then you or your family will be able to opt out, nothing lost.\n\nAt the moment there are more than 8,000 people waiting for donor organs in the UK, with this figure rising annually.\n\nNot only will this scheme stop people dying needlessly whilst waiting for donor organs, but the NHS will save an estimated \u00a3500million over 10 years.\n\nThe NHS will ultimately save money to the difference between the cost of the operation in comparison to the long term costs of sustaining health in a patient waiting for an organ.\n\nMore than 1,000 people die every year waiting for a transplant.  This can help.",
