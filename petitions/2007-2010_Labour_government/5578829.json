            "background": "We have been involved in fighting wars in Afganistan, Iraq, Palestine/Israel without success.  Instead of dwelling on the negative aspect of fighting can't we become positive by now building up the country by cooperative measures as were done in the UK after WW2, eg issuing ration books, stamps, rewards etc to gradually build up a democracy.  That way the locals will have something to work for instead of blowing themselves up because there is nothing to live for in their lives   anyway. As long as we fight them they will fight us.",
