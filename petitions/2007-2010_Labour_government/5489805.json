The Phil Collins statue petition is testament to that.\n\nThe responses to these petitions are what? \"We know best - shut up\", \"please go and moan at someone else\" it is daft, also pointless. It is simply keeping some other overpaid monkey in a job.\n\nSupposedly, 200 signatures will prompt said monkey to actually look at the petition - get it signed.",
