            "background": "The amending treaty is in all but name the new constitutional treaty of the EU.  European leaders tell us it is.  Its contents are virtually identical to the rejected Constitution. It transfers huge amounts more of the people\u2019s sovereignty to the EU, property that never belonged to any politician, and without specific permission from the people of the UK.  That permission has never been given and any voter under 50 has never been asked.  The 1975 referendum was about a free trade \u2018Common Market\u2019 and Heath promised no transfer of sovereignty.  In addition the new treaty appoints a president above our Monarch, an illegal breach of our own Constitution.  Gordon Brown says he wants to restore trust in polticians and re-connect with the electorate. This is his chance to prove it or to prove that he is dishonest and untrustworthy.",
