The UK Passport Agency has a single page website containing very little information apart from instructions to telephone them. Upon dialling the caller is, again, given no information and is invited to dial a 0906 number and informed that calls will be charged at \u00a31.15 per minute. This disgraceful practice should be ceased forthwith and the UK Passport Agency should be compelled to act in the service of the citizen taxpayer and give free advice free of charge, if necessary on a properly designed and constructed website.",
