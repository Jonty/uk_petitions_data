As you may be aware, the French Embassy has provided vaccinations to all French citizens in Morocco. The advice from HM Government in the UK is clear:  we cannot provide vaccinations for British citizens overseas.  Information on swine flu can be found on the British Embassy website and also on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website.\"\n\nWe find this attitude dispectful of the British expat community. We hereby petition the Prime Minister to reverse this decision and make the vaccine available for British citizens, irrespective of their country of residence.",
