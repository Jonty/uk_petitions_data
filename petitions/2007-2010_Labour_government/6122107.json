            "background": "Why do all the buses and taxis in the UK still run off diesel?\n\n Other countries such as Australia made it compulsory that all buses and taxis must run on LPG, \nwhat a difference when walking around their cities. There are no black smoke clouds and toxic fumes being thrown out into your face.\n\nEdinburgh is a prime example of this you can see the black cloud rising up and also taste the fumes from the main streets. What effect is this having\non our bodies I do not want to know. The government are trying to encourage using public transport and more environmentally friendly modes of transport \nyet one of the modes they recommend is still running on toxic diesel.  It is not encouraging when walking or cycling to have a black cloud from the back of a bus or taxi approach you. \n\nCurrent Buses and taxis should all be converted to run on LPG or Electricity.\n\nSo Prime Minister make it law that all buses and taxis run on LPG or Electricity and help us save this planet.",
