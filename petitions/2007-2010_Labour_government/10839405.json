        "background": "Over a number of years Spiritualists have unsuccessfully made representations to the government to be allowed to be represented among the religions which wish to pay respect to the fallen by laying a wreath at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in Whitehall.\nSpiritualism serves the religious needs of the community in the same way as other established religious bodies and we ask that we be allowed to share in the same facilities and have accorded to us the same consideration and treatment as those of other, major religious denominations in relation to the annual national service of remembrance. The Spiritualists' National Union accordingly respectfully requests the Government to allow a representative to take part in the Remembrance Day parade and place a wreath at the Cenotaph in commemoration of those who gave their lives for their country.",
