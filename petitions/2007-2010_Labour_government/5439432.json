        "background": "Government and some motoring bodies suggest that there is wide support for speed cameras,  yet many unofficial polls suggest that the public strongly object to their use. \n\nThere is no unequivocal evidence of the effectiveness of such cameras and harmful side effects have not been researched.  \n\nIn the absence of good research into their costs and benefits I call for a referendum on their use.",
