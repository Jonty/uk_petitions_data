            "background": "Gordon Brown PM's first year as Prime Minister started well. Optimistic pledges, and inspiring promises had been made. However, in recent months there has been mounting scandal and controversy; lost records, illegal donations and stealing policy initiatives from his opposition, among other revelations.\n\nLet us not forget that the Labour Party was re-elected under the promise of Tony Blair serving the full term, and until Gordon Brown is elected on his own merits, we believe that he cannot act as an effective Prime Minister.\n\nWe argue that this is a new petition with its own merits due to recent revelations about the government's administration. We are not trying to undermine the Prime Minister; rather we are trying to ensure that whoever the Prime Minister is, he or she shall serve with a true mandate.\n\nSo we the undersigned request a vote of no-confidence; either in the form of a General Election where if elected Gordon Brown would have a stronger mandate as PM, or a vote of no confidence in himself and his cabinet put to the Houses of Parliament.",
