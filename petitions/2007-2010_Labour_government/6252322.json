            "background": "Allow fast food vendors to operate in motorway service area car parks. The price of food and drink in motorway service areas has now reached ridiculous levels ie \u00a31.90 for a cup of tea. This can only be down to a lack of competition as one never sees fast food vans in motorway service area car parks. If \"burger vans\" and other fast food operators we allowed to ply their trade on these sites it would not only provide a greater choice for customers but would also force the motorway service area operators to moderate their prices. The fast food operators could also pay for a license for this and the money could be put towards the cost of improving the toilet facilities.",
