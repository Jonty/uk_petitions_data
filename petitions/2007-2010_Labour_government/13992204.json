Closure would involve significant redundancies and unacceptable consequences for students midway through their degrees. \n\nWe are calling on the University Council, at its meeting on 26 November 2009, to:\n\n1) Reject the closure proposals of the College of Social Sciences Executive Board as being based on a flawed review process and evidence base.\n\n2) Institute a new, transparent review of Sociology that includes all stakeholders, lifts the threat of redundancies and addresses the institution\u2019s wider strategy for the social sciences.",
