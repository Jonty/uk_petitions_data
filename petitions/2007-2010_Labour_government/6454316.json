            "background": "Having had mental health problems for over 10 years, the treatment I have received has been poor. 6 months ago I suffered a depressive episode and was eventually seen by a clinical psychologist. They strongly recommended that I receive cognitive behavioural therapy. Unfortunately I was told the waiting time for this is over 12 months with my local GP and CPN telling me at least 24 months! With reports of up to 3 years within the NHS in Derbyshire. How can this simply be acceptable with the extra investment into the NHS. Has mental health been forgotten about?",
