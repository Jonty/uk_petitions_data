Mr Brown was in government when the HRA was introduced and forced through by Tony Blair so he is the right person to tell us why people who are stalked have absolutely no rights while stalkers are nurtured by the legislation and actively supported by our police services and judiciary into continuing their threatening behaviour towards their victim.",
