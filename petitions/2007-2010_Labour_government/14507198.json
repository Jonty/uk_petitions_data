        "background": "It has long been said that the HRA was a criminals charter and there are MANY cases every day, in all the newspapers in this counry, which demonstrate that the HRA only works effectively FOR criminals and actually PREVENTS the innocent from using any part of the act against criminals.  Mr Brown was in government when the HRA was introduced and forced through by Tony Blair so he is the right person to tell us why people who are stalked have absolutely no rights while stalkers are nurtured by the legislation and actively supported by our police services and judiciary into continuing their threatening behaviour towards their victim.",
