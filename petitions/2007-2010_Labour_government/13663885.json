I am glad you think it is humorous as this country deteriorates further under this government!\n\n\nTime after time, we hear the Prime Minister say that he or the Government is doing \"everything in our power\" but we never seem to hear what it is he is doing.\n\nIt is about time the Prime Minister gave us some facts with honest results, and to drop this wooly line in favour of hard facts or planned actions.\n\nOtherwise, will he please vacate number 10 so someone else can have a go!\n\nHere is a recent pearl in his interview with Adam Boulton:\n\n\"Well I can say we will do whatever is necessary and that doesn\u2019t rule out what is necessary for our troops\"",
