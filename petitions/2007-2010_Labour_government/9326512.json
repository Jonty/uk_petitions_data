The culprit is the varroa mite which is killing millions of bees.\n\nIn 2008 there are 274,000 bee colonies; in 1958 there were over 400,000. We have lost nearly 50% of our colonies and this will impact on honey, but also on all other pollination carried out by the bees.\n\nThe UK Government needs to spend some cash to protect our bees, but DEFRA will not agree to fund the activities necessary to protect our bees.  \n\nPlease sign this to create a groundswell of public opinion which may lead to a change of heart by the Government.",
