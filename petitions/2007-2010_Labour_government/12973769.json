            "background": "Please review the access rights for fathers to children.Lets face it, it would stop guys dressed in batman suits hanging banners and themselves from  public buildings and being criminalised for what is a basic human right. Review the assumption that they should automatically reside with the mother. Introduce a law to ensure that fathers must see their children when agreement is in force instead of the father having to pay lawyers to invoke the right. Change the age when a child can opt out visiting(currently 12-after all everything else is aged 16 IE: can't leave home till 16). Where is the equality in any of the current legislation and why moan about absentee fathers when half of us can't see our kids despite contributing towards them and loving them just as much as the mother.  It's disgusting and should be taken up to the European Court of Human Rights.  Make it an offence for a mother/parent to deliberately obstruct visitation rights.  Your support would be most appreciated.",
