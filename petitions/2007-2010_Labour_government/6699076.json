            "background": "The Hazard Perception Component of the Theory Test is:\n\nUn-realistic: You are not given the same view point as if you were driving in a car.\n\nUnfair: You are penalised for clicking too early if you identify a hazard earlier than what the test sets as relevant response time; and you completely fail the test if you fail one component.\n\nPoor Quality: The image of the hazard perception test video's are of poor quality and make it very difficult for you to identify potential hazards at a distance, e.g. signalling vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists.\n\nCostly: Having to pay a sum of \u00a328.50 to sit the theory test each time has no justification other than being a source of revenue for the government.\n\nI propose the Hazard Perception Component be abolished in favour of returning to the standard theory test, it is unfair, un-representative of the true conditions whilst driving and is costly.",
