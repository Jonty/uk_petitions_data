        "background": "I would like an apology from the Government for the current economic conditions we face.  We have been promised that the government would be a careful steward to the economy, ensuring that we had economic growth and stability, the end of boom and bust.  Well this appears not to have happened. Instead, we have seen ever increasing taxes, services stay the same, and now we face massive debt for me and our future generation.  Where was the government? \n\nSo can we please have an apology for the mis-management of the economy, poor regulation of the financial sector (why did they let the banks behave this way), and most importantly a focus away from taxing everyone to the level that's just acceptable and look at how and where we spend our money. We need our public services free at the point of use, but we need an end to expensive government advisors, consultants and public private partnerships.",
