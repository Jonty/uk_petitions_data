            "background": "We the people,the men, women and children of the United Kingdom, demand from our Government, the money and resources to restore sector policing across the whole country. Which means reopening and staffing our local police stations twenty four hours a day seven days a week and reinstating police officers walking the beat. The governments policy of centralising police resources, the closing of local police stations to be replaced by part-time satellite police offices and neighbourhood policing by PCSOs, has been of no benefit whatsoever to the law abiding people of the United Kingdom in reducing crime. The only one\u2019s to have benefited from this decade old policy have been the criminals and the Treasury",
