It's a venue for gigs and comedy nights, providing holday activities to children and teenagers. The local council, in a bid to cut costs, is reducing the arts budget. The West End centre will close unless something is done. This petition is asking for the government to step in and stop the Music and Arts Venue, The West End Centre, Aldershot, from closing down.",
