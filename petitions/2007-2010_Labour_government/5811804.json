            "background": "London Authorities have many powers under Sections 63 to 77 of the RTA 1991, and as a result they have the power to enforce parking with draconian tactics using contractors. This petition is the first step in forcing a change in the Act that sees proper regulation of the authorities to act in accordance with common law and allow the \"accused\" to appeal before paying fines, release fees etc. Further this ammendment would reinforce the powers of the Police as the ultimate authority over parking.",
