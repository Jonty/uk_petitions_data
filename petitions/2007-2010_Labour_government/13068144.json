            "background": "The UK-US Bilateral Extradition Treaty was designed to make extradition of terrorist suspects between the UK and the USA easier.  However, this treaty is severely one-sided and has repeatedly been used to extradite British citizens in cases which do not involve terrorism.  This is entirely unjust.  Civil Rights Campaigners know it, most opposition MP's know it, the average citizen knows it.  Only the government seems oblivious to the obvious injustice of this treaty.\nIt is the first duty of the Prime Minister and the Government to protect the citizens.  By allowing this treaty to exist and to be so abused, Gordon Brown, Alan Johnson,  and every MP who does not stand against this treaty is failing in that duty.",
