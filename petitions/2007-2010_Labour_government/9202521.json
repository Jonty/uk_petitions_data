Unfortunately offenders often replace the seized equipment and are on benefits so the \u00a31 a week taken for the fine has little impact.\n\nWe request the prime minister consider introducing additional punishments for repeat offenders particularly those playing loud music and allow environmental health officers to also seize an offenders CDs, records and tapes.\n\nShould that fail we request the final punishment to be a seizure of all noise making equipment, CDs, records and tapes as well as an ASBO banning the perpetrator from visiting electrical stores and music stores",
