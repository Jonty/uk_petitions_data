There is no scientific basis that proves the existence of a \"Man Made Climate Change\". The current theory that \"Man Made\" CO2 warms our climate is wrong, CO2 does NOT lead temperatures, it has already been scientifically proven that CO2 follows the Earth warming. The current warming from the past 50-60 years is from an active Sun and NOT Man.",
