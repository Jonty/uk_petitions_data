He speaks with great intelligence and is a natural orator.  He should represent the people of the United Kingdom who do not believe in an imaginary friend.  There are Atheists in both Houses who are afraid of declaring a non belief as it would lose them votes, but he would stand up for common sense.\n\nAny religious leader who believes in an imaginary god, or a God that is not relevant in today\u2019s society, should not be a given a seat in the House of Lords as a right.",
