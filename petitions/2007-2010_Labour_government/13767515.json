        "background": "The Prime Minster has in essence bankrupted this Nation by his fiscal profligacy for 12 years, including that period when he was Chancellor. Yet he  continues to instruct the Bank of England, which he was supposed to have made to be independent, to recklessly print money in form like Zimbabwe, which he has no intention nor ability to compensate for in the required Keynesian process if and when the economy recovers, so making the fiscal position much worse in the long term, and which will generate hyperinflation. \n\nThe only honest, decent and professional thing to do therefore is to hand-over the Premiership to one of his colleagues, able to lead in a competent manner, and to rescue this country from the destruction which he has wrought.",
