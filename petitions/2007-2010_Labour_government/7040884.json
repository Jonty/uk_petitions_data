            "background": "We as citizens of the United Kingdom have seen the summers pass by so quickly. As each year passed, we have all noticed a decline in the number of people enjoying a delicious creamy 99 flake ice cream. WHY? Becuase the so called '99 Flake' ice cream has had its price risen from 99p to \u00a31.50 or more which is despicable, considering the fact that the name was built so it could be sold at 99p HENCE the '99 Flake'. Get your act together ice cream van drivers i want a summer where EVERYONE can enjoy a 99 flake not just the rich and famous.",
