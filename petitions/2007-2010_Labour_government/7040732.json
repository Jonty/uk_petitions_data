            "background": "why should NHS staff have to pay to go to work. Many hospital staff travel long distances to get to work and public transport is not always available especially in semi rural areas and because of shift work and less buses and trains running at certain times of the day. Many hospital workers are already under paid as it is and often feel undervalued. Might as well work for one of the big super markets instead",
