            "background": "The Party Walls Walls Act is a useful piece of legislation intended to protect the interests of both Building Owner and Adjoining Owner in the event of excavations within a prescribed distance of a building and works affecting party walls and party fence walls. Unfortunately, however, it lacks teeth in that the only redress against a Building Owner who refuses to serve notice and comply with the Act is to apply for an injunction to stop works. In the event that the work is carried out without the adjoining owner's knowledge or consent, there is no redress under the Act other than to take out a civil action and sue for compensation to cover the costs of any damage caused. This can be a costly process. The Act should be amended to make it a criminal offence to ignore its provisions and to provide specific sanctions.",
