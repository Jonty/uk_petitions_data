            "background": "Following a failure to agree the Police Negotiating Board referred the issue of Police pay to the Police Arbitration Tribunal who recommended a 2.5% pay rise backdated to the 1st September 2007. The Home Secretary agreed to the pay rise of 2.5% but refused to backdate it which effectively reduces the pay settlement to 1.9%. Additionally the Home Secretary made this decision in a furtive, secretive and underhanded manner by confidential letter to the Treasury. Police Officers only became aware of this betrayal when the letter was leaked to the Daily Telegraph.",
