            "background": "Although I am Spanish born and bred, I married an Englishman in 1964. I married him because he is British, he speaks English, he behaves in a British sort of way... and I liked it! If I would have fallen in love with a Chinese, Japanese, French, or Spanish person for that matter, I would have MARRIED them! As it was, I did not. Moreover, when I was accepted as a British citizen I did SWEAR to love and serve your Queen and Country, not any Prime Minister or any other Leader the cirizens of this Nation chose to elect. What do you want me to do, to divorce my husband because he is \"too British\"?!... To stop loving and serving your Queen for the very same reason?! Be real for Pete's sake! There has been great opposition in this World about Spanish bull-fights but they are still bulfighting because that is SPAIN -God bless them.- I do not want Spain to change from being SPANISH but I am VERY PLEASED (so far) with England been English and <The Red Arrows> are a British institution to be proud of. If you yourselves cannot fight for YOUR Country at all levels please let me know NOW so I can go back to being totally Spanish.\nThank you.",
