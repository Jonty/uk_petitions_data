            "background": "The prohibitive rules against domestic tipping, particularly DIY waste in conjunction with the move to fortnightly bin collection has predictably led to a noticeable increase in fly tipping in the area. Not collecting peoples waste and then refusing to allow them to tip at the proper sites is ludicrous, particularly given the amount of council tax that we pay - Just another example of Britain having the one of the highest cost and lowest standards of living in the EU - The government is encouraging fly tipping and turning the precious few rural areas that are left into unsightly dumping grounds.",
