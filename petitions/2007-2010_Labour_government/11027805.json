            "background": "The sudden fall in house prices will benefit Landlords with numerous properties (some with over 1000) as this will allow them to purchase more properties. This is a cash rich business, and Landlords can afford multiple deposits.\n\nThe problem is that Landlords can offset interest on mortgages as an expense, which means that if they carry on buying houses (and so pay mortgages) they pay no tax, as they never declare a profit.\n\nFurther to this, there is no incentive to sell due to Capital Gains Tax on properties other than your main residence. This makes it more profitable to rent the property out rather than to sell. This will result in 1st time buyers will get squeezed further during the next cycle as fewer properties will be available \n\nWe need to ensure that these tax advantages do not exist in this industry, and that the Landlord pays tax on all rentals received rather than on the declared profit. Houses should be for living, not for profit.",
