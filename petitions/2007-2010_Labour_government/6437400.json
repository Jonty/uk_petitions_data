        "background": "Krek and Mers, otherwise known as Thomas Dolan and Thomas Whittaker were sentenced 15 and 12 months respectively. Their crime was to spray paint trains and railway bridges. Although we are fully aware that this constitutes criminal damage the punishment does not fit the crime. In the Greater Manchester area a total of 32 sex attacks, 33 robberies and 3,071 assaults were punished with a caution, reprimand or final warning instead of an appearance in the dock. Why has a first non-violent offence been punished with a custodial sentence while violent and sex offenders get away with a caution. This is a great injustice.",
