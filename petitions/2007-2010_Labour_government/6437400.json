Although we are fully aware that this constitutes criminal damage the punishment does not fit the crime. In the Greater Manchester area a total of 32 sex attacks, 33 robberies and 3,071 assaults were punished with a caution, reprimand or final warning instead of an appearance in the dock. Why has a first non-violent offence been punished with a custodial sentence while violent and sex offenders get away with a caution. This is a great injustice.",
