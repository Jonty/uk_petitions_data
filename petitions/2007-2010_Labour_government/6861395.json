            "background": "I am a professional driver and work as a driving assessor.  Unfortunately I am one of those who is forced to pay the heaviest road tax charge because of the size of my private use car which I use relatively little.  I need a 7 seat car for 5 children and I also tow a caravan.  I believe that cars which are taxed in a lower bracket because of exhaust emissions but are travelling at high speeds are not in fact running efficiently.  Manufacturers of cars create exhaust emissions on a car running at efficient speeds of just below 60 mph therefore vehicles travelling at high speed are not running efficiently. It frustrates me to see so many vehicles travelling well in excess of speed limits on both urban roads and motorways being driven by people of all ages and gender.  Drivers of speeding vehicles do not seem to realise the danger they are creating for others as well as themselves.  Perhaps an increase on road tax for those caught speeding may make a difference ie 3 points = 3 years at highest level and so on.  A speeding car must have a similar environmental impact to a large car travelling within the limits.",
