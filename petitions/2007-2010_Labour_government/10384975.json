Unbelievably the old system results in a situation where me and my partner would be better off if we split up. Is the government trying to encourage separation?  Even more bizzarly we would also be better off if i had another child with a different person. This situation is intolerable - as i wish to do neither but the government department appears to be trying to push us down this route.",
