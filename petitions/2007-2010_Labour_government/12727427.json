The same principal applies to the rest of the Government starting with Mr. Brown who afterall if he was the CEO of a Public Company would be ultimately responsible and would have too pay the ultimate price.  An enquiry should also look into their 'pay offs' after all they were the people who firstly sanctioned Fred Goodwin's then tried too back track.",
