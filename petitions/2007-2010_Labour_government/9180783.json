        "background": "At the end of September 2008 the DSA are closing the motorcycle test centres in Barrow-in-Furness and Kendal. The alternatives will be the proposed Multi-Purpose Test Centres at Blackburn and Carlisle. The result of this decision is that motorcyclists currently using the Barrow centre will now need to make a round trip of 156 miles to Blackburn (158 miles to Carlisle). The round trip is likely to take approximately 5 hours and require them to negotiate the busy cities of Lancaster and Preston en route. On top of this they will be asked to take their tests on completely unfamiliar roads. We believe the above situation is totally unacceptable. For inexperienced riders to travel these sorts of distances in the summer will be bad enough; in the winter it will be positively dangerous and expose the most vulnerable group of motorcyclists to unacceptable risk.",
