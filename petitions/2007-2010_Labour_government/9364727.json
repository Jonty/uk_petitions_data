            "background": "only permit the sale of council house property to tenants at a reduced value, with a guaranteed option for the council to be offered first refusal for the repurchase of the property at the equivalent discounted rate.  For example, a council property (value \u00a3100,000) sold to a tenant at a reduced rate of 60% where it is purchased for \u00a360,000, if valued in future years for \u00a3150,000 and is offered for sale then it must be offered to the council for \u00a390,000.  This guarantees the purchaser the appropriate return on their investments, and also enables the councils to maintain council owned property for alternative tenants in need of a council owned home.",
