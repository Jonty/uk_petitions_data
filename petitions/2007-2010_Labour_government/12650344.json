            "background": "Mr Field was quickly ousted from the front line, seemingly because he wanted to make radical changes to benefits.  There have been no scandals or negative media associated with him. He speaks a lot of common sense and shows  a general respect for parliament and more importantly the British electorate.  Unlike many of his colleagues he has never displayed blatant loathing of other political parties and therefore seems a most appropriate candidate.  His quiet manner indicates an ability to think before opening his mouth.  He hasn't been promoting himself and perhaps he doesn't want the job.  If he does, I think he would make an excellent speaker.",
