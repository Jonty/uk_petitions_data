            "background": "The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 introduced a minimum tariff of two years for prisoners serving indeterminate public protection sentences.  The government made an error with the interpretation of the law regarding IPPs and approx. 970 prisoners were given tariffs of less than 2 years.   To demonstrate justice these people should be released if they have served their tariff which generally was the same length of time they would have served with a determinate sentence.  The judges passing the IPP sentences did not consider the offenders to be so dangerous that they should be kept in prison for lengthy periods or they would have  given tariffs of more than 2 years.   This results in more than 970 prisoners being kept in prison after the end of their tariff with little hope of release.",
