        "background": "Legislation needing to be changed - Human Fertilisation and Embryology or HFE Bill Section 15 (3)\n\n*a little wish* is campaigning to highlight the problems and discrimination within the above legislation\nCurrently the law for women with a working uterus and who need help from fertility treatment states that: embryos/gametes can be stored until the intended mother is 55. For those women who do not have a working uterus and whose embryos/gametes are intended for surrogacy the current law states their embryos/gametes can only be stored for 5 years. It is proposed that this is extended so that embryos/gametes that are intended for surrogacy can be stored for 10 years, (though the law is not to be used retrospectively).\n\nOur aim is to persuade UK MP\u2019s to change the law so that all embryos / gametes are able to be stored until the intended mother is 55, that the law should be the same for all that have to undergo fertility treatment.",
