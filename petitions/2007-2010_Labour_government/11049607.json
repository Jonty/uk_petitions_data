            "background": "I am writing this after 10 years of fighting to keep my son with multi complex learning disabilities and a 6 year delay in special needs school.Since he was 5 my son has already lost 2 years out of education because SLC's cant cope and there are no special needs school for primary aged children. \nthe government shut down most of our special needs schools and gave our children Specialist Learning Centres instead .\nThis was to comply with the intergration rulings bought out by this government, but they did not stop and think it all through at all. Now our children and families are suffering because they government took a system that worked away from our children and dumped them into a hell hole to suffer.\n\nIn SLC's the children are being issolated, excluded for their own saftey, bullied and their lifes made hell at SLC's and the teachers do not have the time resources and knoledge of a special needs school.\n\nThe special needs school systems was there to help our children try and have a future but the government have basically taken it away and said \" whats the point\"",
