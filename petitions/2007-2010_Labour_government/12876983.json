        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "10 years ago residents paid approx \u00a318pw for the additional services provided in Sheltered Housing. 2 resident wardens resided on site 24/7.  Services have diminished and now only a part-time mobile warden with no weekend cover visits once a day - the cost still \u00a318 pw. Yes they have intercom connection for emergency calls\u2013 on average 2 mins to respond \u2013 They pay extra for that service. The warden property is rented and generating additional income as is the community room - no reduction of fees and no income to support community functions. \n\nEven though they are being robbed blind their main concern is that they are no longer \u2018sheltered\u2019 from the harms that come with old age. For those with no family it could mean going from 11am on Friday to 11am on Monday without speaking to anyone. Is this really acceptable in 2009?\n\nPlease lobby for council\u2019s to re-instate the full-time wardens that these people have been paying for so that they can thrive in their communities.\n\nYOUR GRANDPARENT???",
