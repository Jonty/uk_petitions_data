            "background": "To allow people the right to choose in establishments that have facilities for both smokers and non smokers. The current situation is fouling streets and peripheral areas of these establishments and is heading toward mass unemployment and bankruptcies. People who know no other busines, will be thrown on the jobs scrap heap, through no fault of their own. Ex servicemen, who fought in the wars to maintain democracy, are now not allowed to enjoy the life for which they fought, a quiet pint and a smoke, as they reminisce with their friends, they are now forced outside and offered no shelter, due to the ridiculous restrictions in the building of such protective shelters.  ABSOLUTE MADNESS. Dave Wilcox, Halfway House, Blackpool. A final note. I am 62 yrs old, worked hard all my life and paid my dues. My reward for this?? I will be applying for state benefits in the very near future. So much for all my years of public service and conscientious hard work. Thank you England and it's looking like Hello Spain for my retirement years. Struggling I might add, due to my involuntary, early retirement",
