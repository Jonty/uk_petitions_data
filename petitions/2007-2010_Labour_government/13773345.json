            "background": "20 mph speed limits create a better balance between road users. Not only do they create a more attractive and safer environment, studies also show that they make a pronounced contribution to casualty reduction.\n\n  \n20 mph zones in Hull have reduced the number of people killed and seriously injured by 90%.\n\nA survey of European best practice by the Commission for Integrated Transport found that where cities have extensive 20 mph or 30 kmh limits \u2014 covering between 65 to 85% of the urban road network \u2014 they are transformed \u201cfrom being noisy, polluted places into vibrant, people-centred environments, with significant levels of walking, cycling and public transport.\u201d \n\nWhen 30 kmh zones were introduced in Germany, car drivers on average had to change gear 12% less often, use their brakes 14% less often and require 12% less fuel. \n\n20 mph limits are also highly popular: in the 2005 British Social Attitudes survey, three-quarters of people said they favoured 20 mph limits in residential areas, including 72% of drivers.",
