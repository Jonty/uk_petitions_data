            "background": "After reading the petition to assist student pilots gain the same access to funding as Doctors and Lawyers through thier training, your response was to seek a Career Develpment Loan as it is classed as Vocational training. A medical student wants to become a Doctor as a Vocation. We want to become Pilots as a Vocation. It costs about the same to train approx \u00a360 to \u00a380k. There is a worldwide shortage of pilots and just about every other country has a program to assist students reach their target. A CDL of \u00a38k doesnt help much. As you tax fuel and travellers so much, we urge you to give some of it back!",
