Solar power is a synonym of solar energy or refers specifically to the conversion of sunlight into electricity by photovoltaic\u2019s. \nIt will help the whole of the UK in the long run especially if they are connected to a PV power plant. \nSolar thermal technologies can be used for water heating, space heating, space cooling and process heat generation. The 1973 oil crisis stimulated a rapid rise in the production of PV during the 1970s and early 1980s. Production along with improvements in system design & performance brought the price of PV down from $100/watt in 1971 to $7/watt in 1985.\nManufacturing progress during the 1990s include improvements in feedstock quality, thinner & larger wafers, kerf loss reductions & cell efficiency improvements.",
