            "background": "The current situation where employees of private companies \"invest\" in the stock market in the hope of building a fund to purchase an annuity in retirement is not fit for purpose.  The markets have no interest in the secure retirement provision of a substantial proportion of the population and gambling on the state of global finances is too risky a proposition.\n\nThe mechanism for private company employees to fund their retirement is also in direct and inequitable contrast with public sector guaranteed pension schemes which are amassing increasing and uncosted liabilities, the burden of which will fall on future generations.\n\nThis situation is simply unsustainable.  Action must be taken immediately.  A single pension scheme is the equitable (sic) answer.",
