            "background": "We have had to 'lose' a full time teacher at my children's junior school (rated outstanding by Ofsted last year!) due to 'low numbers' and therefore reduced funding. This means the 'small' year, (76 children) are taught in 2 classes with 38 children in each class. I was horrified that this could even be possible, but apparently there is no top limit of children per class! This means technically they could be taught in a class of 76, or even 100!\n\nI am aware that this has happened in other schools too, and believe it is unacceptable for both the children and the teachers.\n\nPlease cap the class numbers to improve children's chances of a decent education - we cannot afford to send our kids to private schools to get smaller class sizes, nor should we have to!\n\nIf the government really believes in 'education education education' surely this is a small but sure step towards achieving higher standards.",
