            "background": "Rail fares are set to rise above the rate of inflation for the next 10 years. An annual season ticket between Brighton and London not including tube currently stands at \u00a33240. Another 5% increase the year will bump that up to \u00a33400, over \u00a34000 with tube. These increases cannot be carried by commuters for much longer as salaries are not keeping pace. Ultimately no action will lead to people being forced off the railways and on to the roads. Some may be forced out of jobs simply beacuse they can't afford to get there.\n\nIf the government is really serious about reducing carbon emmissions and encouraging people to use the rail network some sort of tax relief needs to be given to rail season ticket holders, whether they be weekly, monthly or annual. They can no longer be seen as cash cows by the companies or the government.",
