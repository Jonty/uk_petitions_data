            "background": "In the light of the murders of six convenience store workers in the past 15 months, we urge the government and the UK's police forces to give a higher priority to protecting local neighbourhood grocery stores, and the people that work within them, from violent crime.\nOffences such as shoplifting and robbery can easily escalate into assault and murder in vulnerable premises, and we urge greater protection for local stores, especially independent outlets serving vital community needs; quicker police response for every reported offence; and stiffer penalties for those found guilty of attacks on store workers.\n\nSix store workers have been murdered in their shops since January 2009:\n\nCraig Hodson-Walker, Fairfield, Worcs; \n\nJashbhai Patel, Luton;\n\nAhmet Paytak, London;\n\nNasar Hussain, Eccles, Manchester;\n\nGurmail Singh, Hudderfield, W Yorks;\n\nDiana Garbutt, Melsonby, N Yorks.\n\nPlease sign in memory of them.",
