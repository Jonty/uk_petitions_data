Many other countries have tests immigrants must take before they enter the country most of these tests incluse a basics in the native language. This petition is to stopthe economic drain legal immigrants can be when they can't spaek our language therefore can't get a job, therefore are living off benefits. this act would also stop the rare cases in which immigrants will come to our country purposly to live of our generosity. This will not affect asylum seekers or those who will not stay in our country more than 6 months.",
