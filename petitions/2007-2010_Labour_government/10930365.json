            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This daily buying limit (established by experts) will bring alcoholic persons to a better control of their problem and for their families will be easier to say: \"no more for today darling, not allowed\". The shinny precious bottle (this is the way commercials present it) brings so much anguish in many people's life... Alcohol it's a false friend which can easily get un-aware persons to this self-destroying terrible habit. \nGovernment can help a lot with a little touch like this: the weekly or daily buying limit.\nSome exceptions could be allowed in a way that buying more than daily limit for once, to consider for that week the weekly limit, so for a party you can buy more alcohol for once. \nThe limit could be on a simple card similar to Oyster or schools cafeterias cards; it's not a complicate technology involved, although may be some costs for government. But these costs will prove much lower than money spent for alcohol detox clinics,  financially supporting broken families of alcoholic persons, social protection for children with addicted parents and so on..\nThank you.",
