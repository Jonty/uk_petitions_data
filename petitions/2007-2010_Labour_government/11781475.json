            "background": "Michael Palin is a British institution. His contribution to British television is on a scale matched by few others. He has entertained and educated people both in Britain and abroad through his extensive work for both television and film. His travel documentaries alone stand as timeless pieces of sagacity which have enlightened and inspired millions. He has also used his celebrity status to promote various good causes. Yet, for whatever reason, he has yet to be bestowed the honour conferred upon so many of his peers. I think it is time the Prime Minister rectified this and request that Her Majesty The Queen knight Michael Palin.",
