            "background": "A controversial ban on commercial and private flights to and from a Hampshire airport comes into force later. \n\nLee Flying Association has vowed to fight the ban and said the police authority had failed adequately to explain the safety grounds which have led to the decision.\n\nThe former HMS Daedalus airfield in Lee-on-the-Solent opened in 1917 but will close to private and commercial aviation at midnight.\n\nAbout 60 planes are kept there, along with a flying school and aircraft maintenance company, which will shut. \n\nSmall aviation businesses and private pilots have been using the airfield for years, but a month ago they were told that they have to stop.\n\nPlease stop the ban, Lee-On-Solent airfield has the potential to bring much business to the area and is the only viable GA airfield for this region of the south coast. It must not close.",
