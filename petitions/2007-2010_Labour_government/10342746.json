            "background": "There is much media speculation about a possible state funeral for Margarest Thatcher and some indication that the present PM is minded to agree.  \n\nThis should not be allowed to take place:\nMrs T was the most divisive PM of the 20th Century;\nShe and her Goverment oversaw the destruction of organised labour and the UK's manufacturing sector;\nIn promoting a 'greed is good' culture she laid the foundations for the riven society we have today;\nShe failed her own sex - despite being the UK's first woman PN she set back the cause of equal rights.\n\nFor these reason and many more we believe she should not be accorded the honour of a state funeral.",
