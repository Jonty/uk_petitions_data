            "background": "The goverment recently announced that there is to be a cut in the funding for Futher Education. Colleges will be losing a large amount of the money they recive to try and better peoples skills and educaion. People over 19 years of age will no longer recive the funding needed, this means they need to pay full price for the course they enroll on. The price will not be easy to pay and many people simpley will not be able to afford it. This also means colleges could close, course are already being closed, and alot of staff will lose their jobs. We want the goverment to stop the cut and allow people to better them selves.",
