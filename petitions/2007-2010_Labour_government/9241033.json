            "background": "Tom Parry was expelled from Ribston hall high school sixth form just a few weeks for his exams for 'poor attendance' He did NOT have the lowest attendance. He also his a very intelligent young man who was set to do very well in his exams despite his absence. We feel that he deserves the chance to show how well he can do. We also believe the situation was dealt with poorly by some members of staff. The final point to be made is that his attendance is only going to get worse now he has been expelled.... We want Tom Parry to be allowed to study at Ribston Hall once again. Justice for Parry - F4D",
