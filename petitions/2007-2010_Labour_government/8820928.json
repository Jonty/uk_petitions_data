This law just doesn't make sense and seems too far right to be a labour party. \n\nI am a british born UK resident, I am law abiding, contribute to society, do voluntary work, work full-time, am a university student, do not claim any benefits whatsoever and pay national insurance and tax. So why would the Government want to ruin my life by making me wait another three years to allow my wife to come to this country (p.s. I will be paying for all my wifes expenses anyway, so I don't see how this effects our economy in any way)",
