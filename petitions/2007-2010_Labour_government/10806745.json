            "background": "In the 1998 budget the rolling car tax exemption was scrapped in favour of a fixed date.  Only cars built before 01 January 1973 now benefit from an exemption of vehicle excise duty.\n\nThe reasoning provided by the government that environmental factors have been considered in this decision does not hold much weight as owners of classic cars generally do not drive them on a daily basis and therefore cover very low mileage.  \n\nMany classic car owners restore and maintain British built cars and helping to preserve the great British car manufacturing heritage.",
