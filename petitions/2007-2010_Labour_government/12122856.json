Taylor said details of the genocide could be found in Harry-Scott-Gibbons' book entitled \"Genocide File\". Stating the English archives also proved the genocide, Taylor said British newspapers of that period gave wide coverage to the Greek-Cypriot cruelties with photographs. Taylor demanded those responsibles for this savagery who are still living on the island, be brought before the law.\n\nWe now petition the same thing, we want Action to be taken to recognize the Genocide and all responsible peoples be bought to justice at once.",
