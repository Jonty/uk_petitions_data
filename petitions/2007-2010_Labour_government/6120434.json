        "background": "We do not want this type of \"farming\" in our countryside.  It undermines the work of true farmers who care about animal welfare.   If people want cheaply produced meat without caring about how the source product (the animals) are treated then put these \"farms\" in traditional factory settings, with the infrastructure to dispose of waste, chemical and air polution. Don't hide them in the countryside and pretend they are farms.  They do not contribute to the local economy (only employ relatively few people).  They do however have the potential to cause serious environmental damage.",
