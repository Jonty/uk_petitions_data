            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Baby P three have been convicted of \u201ccausing or allowing the death of a child\u201d carrying a maximum jail sentence of 14 years. \n\nHow can they be found innocent of manslaughter or murder when Victoria Climbie's carers were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment?  Both Baby P and Victoria are dead as a result of deliberate systematic physical abuse, so how can there be such a huge discrepancy in convictions?\n\nThose who deliberately inflicted Baby P's injuries, had done it before and in all likelihood knew that they would do it again and again, especially given that the boyfriend has been described as 'fascinated with pain'.  Isn't that premeditation?  Those who deliberately covered up his injuries, and in doing so deliberately deprived him of the medical care he so urgently needed knew what they were doing. Their cover-ups were also premeditated.  No one can possibly claim that they don't know that continual and extreme violence against a child might kill them.\n\nPlease ensure that Baby P gets justice by signing this petition to demand a retrial.  Thank you.",
