        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition strongly supports the abolition of the private, independent school system. It is quite simply outrageously unfair that a person's education and, to a significant extent, future be decided upon the basis of one's family income. Patently, there are grave problems when it comes to wealth distribution, but to allow parents to pay for better education conduces to the perpetuation of a significant inequality of opportunity, never mind equality of outcome. The Russell Group consisting of the top universities in the country is absolutely dominated by ex-public school pupils. I highly doubt that this is on account of wealth breeding intelligence. To maintain a separate system of education in this country maintains a radically split Britain, where a person's life is largely decided from birth. This is so evidently unfair. At the very least, the private sector should not be classed as charitable organisations and so benefit from tax-breaks. Even if a meritocratic Britain has considerable egalitarian draw-backs, a plutocratic Britain has far more.",
