            "background": "We, the holder of vehicle tax discs have already paid to use the British roads. Parking on the British roads anywhere in the country is part of using the road by our vehicle. Why should we pay again to park on the very same roads the use of which has already been granted to the vehicle tax disc holder. The Government may place restriction on where not to park or where to park for restricted duration but can not logically ask for paying again to use the road. Parking a vehicle is part of using the vehicle on the road for which we have already paid vehicle tax. \n\nWe the undersigned therefore humbly request the Prime Minister to consider the scrapping the parking fee on British roads.",
