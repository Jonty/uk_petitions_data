Inevitably, British pig industry leaders are desperate to shake off any guilt and seem wholly concerned with urging the public to keep buying their products for fear of damaging their profits.\"- Animal Aid report on swine flu.\n\nWe the undersigned, are concerned that not enough is being done to stop further outbreaks of Swine- flu, or any other simular 'super-bug' now & in the future.\nWe collectively ask the Prime Minister & the government to fully investigate Intensive Pig farming in the UK further & not with-hold any information on the results of the proposed investigation from the public. \nWe collectively Call for a Ban on industralised pig & 'livestock' farming. We all agree that this method of farming is potentially dangerous & out-dated.",
