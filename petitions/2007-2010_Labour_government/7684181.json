        "background": "I believe that it is obscene for MPs to request a pay rise that is greater than a standard inflation measure (such as RPI), particularly as all other public sector workers are being forced to accept small increments to their salaries.  Any MP that votes for a pay rise of greater than the annual inflation rate should expect to be voted out at the next election.",
