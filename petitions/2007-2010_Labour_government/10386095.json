            "background": "Why does the government think they know what kids want or create legislation to stop their enjoyment?\n\nBecause a minority of kids are anti-social doesn't mean we all have to suffer. For example, the govenment thinks we must be kept busy with homework ext. to stop us being anti-scial. This simply ruins our fun. Any anti-social person would not worry about homework would simply ignore the work set.\n\nStop this legislation and give the vast majority of childern their happyness and freedom back, and introduce other laws to tackle anti-social behaviour.",
