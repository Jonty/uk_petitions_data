            "background": "A founder member of Pink Floyd; the driving force and lyricist behind all time classics \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", \"Wish You Were Here\", \"Animals\", \"The Wall\" and \"Amused To Death\". Innovative live performer, responsible for the incredible event at the Berlin Wall site in 1990, attended by over 250,000 fans. Recently released an opera based on the French Revolution, \"Ca Ira\". One of the outstanding British musical talents of his, or any other, generation. Politically outspoken with a powerful intellect to support his statements, much of his work will not have found favour with the powers that be; nevertheless, in an age of instant gratification and reward, here is an individual with over 40 years of musical achievement and excellence behind him, which is surely worthy of high honour.",
