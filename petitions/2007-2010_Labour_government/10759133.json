        "background": "as the BBC has a monopoly on TV licencing they have a duty to provide a service that people want. i was disgusted to see they refused to pay a paltry \u00a31 million pounds for the highlights of the very important Croatia v England match recently. the team recorded their best result for years yet millions of people were left with absolutely no coverage whatsoever due to the BBC's crass decision that  buying highlights would represent poor value for the licence payer. how much do they spend on project's that are not even aired is a question that springs to mind. \nplease join me in putting pressure on the BBC to see that millions of England football fans and licence payers have been done a disservice by their decision making and that all future England games should always be shown on BBC1 OR BBC2.",
