        "background": "In the Scarman Report of 1972 was published the IRA plan for FIVE terrorist weapons systems.  Bomb, bullet, poison, agricultural and industrial sabotage (by infiltration of the trades unions)\n\nThe Good Friday Agreements folly (against which Gen De Chasterlain has recorded concern) is that its Decommissioning Terms only apply to two of the terrorist weaponry, Bomb and Bullet.  We cannot compel IRA to declate sabotage in place or capability or to whom sabotage techniques were taught.\n\nAll of the 42 day detention debate is based on the same GFA Fallacy that terror can be combatted by identifying the bad guy before he goes out with his bomb and bullet.  A saboteur can carry out his work in the 1980s and the result activate up to fifty years later.  \n\nTony Blair sent the NI Secretary a report in 2005 of sabotage, consistent with Stage 3 of the IRA Garland Plan, against emergency backup generators.\n\nThe sort of thing which failed at a little old place called Chernobyl if you want to assess potential consequences.\n\nDounreay ?  Bradwell B ?  Hunterston B ?\n\nDebate on terror, which does not address our woeful civil contingency infrastructure, is bogus.",
