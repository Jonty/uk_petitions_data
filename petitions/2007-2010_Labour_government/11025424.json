        "background": "Time are now harder than ever, yet the rules are sill bending when it comes to the Banks, even Goverment banks.  The interest rates should, and needs to be passed on in  full by every bank. Even the Goverment bank will not lead the way so what hope is there for the people who need this cut. What makes its worse is that most of these customers can no longer go to other banks due to the way the NR bank dished out it's loans in the first place.  Now the Goverment needs to step in at least with the publics own bank and insist the interest rates on all mortgages are cut in line with the Bank of Englands interest rate cuts.  The country is in trouble, and when the banks needed help, the people came to the resuce, now it is the Banks turn to return the favour.",
