            "background": "I believe there has been too much selling of our history and industries to foreign interests. The Government states the postal service cannot 'pay its way', but has recently approved a \u00a34m contract to the Dutch to deliver a large proportion of it's own mail. Such a decision undermines our postal service and demoralises it's employees. I would ask all like minded British Citizens to support this petition and to make a stand against any further selling off of our 'Crown Jewels'",
