            "background": "At the moment, children who behave badly or commit crime, are treated to luxury items and free holidays. We request that these rewards are immediately stopped for these people, and to give the rewards to children who behave well instead. The vast majority of children are well-behaved and commit no offences, but seeing that those who commit crimes get treats while the well-behaved get nothing, only encourages more children to become involved in crime and bad behaviour. The government should give far more attention to children of good character and behaviour, instead of constantly ignoring them. Rewarding good behaviour instead of bad could stop childhood crime in it's tracks.",
