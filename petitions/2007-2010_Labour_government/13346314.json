            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "On 9th August 1971 the British Government introduced internment without trial in the North of Ireland. Between the 9th and the 11th August the British Army's Parachute Regiment killed eleven civilians in the mainly nationalist Ballymurphy housing estate. The deat included a Catholic priest and a mother of eight. In all 53 children were left without a parent as a result of these killings. The killings were not investigated independently or appropriately and the Northern Ireland Office immediately disseminated disinformation alleging that all of those killed were involved in paramilitary activity. The cover up and lies added intensely to the deep hurt caused by these deaths. The ensuing suffering of the families has been indeed egregious. 38 years later it is now time for the British Government to act to put in place a human rights compliant, fully independent investigation so that the truth of what occured is firmly established and to make possible official actions of reparation and apology to the families. This will contribute positively to the processes of transition and healing in the North of Ireland and to the current debate on dealing with our collective past.",
