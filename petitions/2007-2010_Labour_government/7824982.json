            "background": "As dog owners are fined if their dog leaves any excrement in a public area, why are not horse owners. There is nothing worse than cleaning your car then having to drive through a large pile of horse excrement because the inconsiderate riders cannot apparently carry poop-scoopers. This disgusting oversight cannot and must not be allowed to be continued and I ask that if horse owners wish to travel along public pavements/ highways then they should be made to be responsible for their animals actions.",
