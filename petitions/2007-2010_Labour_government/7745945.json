            "background": "The outdated programme Woman's Hour is on BBC Radio 4 every weekday 10-11am. It started 60 years ago and had a role broadcasting to housewives and mothers. Now, however, it is well past its sell-by date. It is a low-quality programme, presented and produced entirely by women (sexism) - and well-off middle-class feministic women at that. There is no equivalent programme for men - even in a female-dominated media industry, where most TV and radio programme pander to women to get higher ratings. The programme contantly promotes the idea that all men are useless and all women and wonderful and just poor victims of patriarchy. It is obsessed with this, as well as women's gynaecological and personal problems - which, of course, are all men's fault - like everything else in the universe according to this fourth-rate, sexist show. Scrap this programme now! Let's have real equal opportunity and replace it with a magazine show produced and presented by women and men - dealing with human issues, not feministic obsessions from the 1970s. Please sign. Thanks.",
