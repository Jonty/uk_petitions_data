These chemtrails are distinctively different to aircraft contrails which gases can be seen for several hours compared to an average 15 seconds for a contrail. With so much conflicting information on the internet, some with sinister undertones, the population of Great Britain need to made aware of what is going on with the spraying which is happening above them.",
