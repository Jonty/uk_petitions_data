            "background": "Premium bonds offer a guaranteed return of capital to the investor and the chance of tax free cash prizes. The money invested also benefits the UK Government - an obvious boon in the current climate. Suggestion is to allow transfer of Pension Pot funds to Premium bonds up to the normal limit of \u00a320,000. Individual's pension fund would be the bond holder and any prizes to be paid directly in the fund and kept therein until retirement.",
