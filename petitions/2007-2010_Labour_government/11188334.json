            "background": "What I particularly have in mind is the frequent - far too frequent - situation in which someone, often a celebrity, is spared a driving ban on the grounds that the driver needs his/her car to fulfil various obligations or to do his/her job; this in spite of being found guilty of speeding or some other offence which could have killed or injured an innocent road user or pedestrian.  My feeling is: \"tough! if it's so important to have the use of your car don't commit the offence!\".  \n\nI also completely fail to understand why an individual in this situation can't be told to employ a driver or take taxis!  Why should they effectively get away with breaking the law just because they need to be able to use their car?",
