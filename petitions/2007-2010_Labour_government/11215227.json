            "background": "Most students have to pay to get to their educational establishments and have to find phenomenal amounts of money to cover the costs of this. The elderly and disabled get free travel on buses nationwide - therefore all full time students in the UK should be given free area/countywide bus passes like those given to disabled & elderly residents. Further & Higher education is already costly enough without having to pay for ESSENTIAL transport so that students can gain an education. There is no reason why we should be made to pay for travel - after all it has been proven that those with qualifications can gain better paid jobs, therefore bringing in yet more taxes to the government.",
