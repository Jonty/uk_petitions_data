            "background": "The 3.5 million dispensing patients in England will no longer be able to pick up a prescription from their local surgery. Patients will have to go to their nearest Chemist which (because of the \u2018distance\u2019 rules on dispensing \u2013 a GP can only dispense to a patient who lives more than 1.6 miles from the nearest Chemist) will certainly be more than 1.6 miles from their home.   \n\nThe second problem is more subtle. Between a quarter and a half of total income of a dispensing practice comes from dispensing medicines. This income enables a practice to have more GPs than they could otherwise afford, and in many cases, subsidises the cost of running branch surgeries, particularly in rural areas. \n\nIn total there are over 5,500 dispensing Doctors in England, working from 1,135 dispensing practices.",
