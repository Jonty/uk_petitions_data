This additional burden towards the end of a person\u2019s life can be avoided. Many people who have made this choice often travel alone, to avoid causing distress or implicating family members who will pay harsh consequences if they do. \n\nAs a person in their thirties with an incurable neurological illness which will degenerate further, I would like to be assured that the research in understanding the effects of assisted death and dying are being documented and thoroughly undertaken in the UK. By supporting further research into the impact of those faced with the decision of assisting a loved one, it will enable those who are currently involved in these issues, are well informed and are able to make these decisions with transparency and facts.",
