            "background": "Computer hardware, such as hard disks, SD cards and memory is invariably marketed with its capacity measured in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB). While these terms are standards they are misleading, as their prefixes (M, G, T) (mega, giga, tera), in this case, are used to denote powers of 1000, while computers, as they work on a binary system, measure these figures in terms of powers of 1024.\n\nThis means that a 4GB pen drive actually only has 3.73GB of storage space as measured by a computer.\n\nWe propose that hardware should be marketed in terms of binary prefixes, denoting powers of 1024: Mi (mebi): 1024^2; Gi (gibi): 1024^3; Ti(tebi): 1024^4.\n\nBinary prefixes are an already widely used standard, and should be the standard in the marketing of computing products.\n\nFor reference:\n1 MB = 1000,000 bytes = 0.95 MiB;\n1 GB = 1000,000,000 bytes = 0.93 GiB;\n1 TB = 1000,000,000,000 bytes = 0.91 GiB",
