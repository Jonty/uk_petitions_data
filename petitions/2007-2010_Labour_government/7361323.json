            "background": "Lets face it Mr Prime Minister, Jose Mourinho is the special one. Therefore he should be made the England manager. I suggest to you Mr Prime Minister that you go over to The FA HQ and tell Brain Barwick and Sir Trevor Brooking CBE that they have to employ Mr Mourinho as manager. I understand that you are scottish and you probably dont care about who gets appointed as the next England manager but if you do this i guarantee Labour and your good self will be victorious in the next election. Dont worry you wont need to thank me for this truely brilliant piece of PR as having jose as England number 1 will be enough. \n\nI'd just like to take this opportunity to thank you in advance.\n\nYours faithfully,\nEvery single England Fan in the world.",
