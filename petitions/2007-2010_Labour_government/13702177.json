        "background": "hay ,\nHO is doing good job and made changes according to uk economy.but HO should keep in mind that those people who already got psw visas should not suffer by their recent changes and make some transitional changes for them.\nBefore 31.03.2009 on the basis of bachelor or pgd,they can switch from psw to tier 1 general.because of this option students started to change their status to psw from july 2008 and get 2 years post study work visa.this is HO policy to keep uk graduates in uk and HO claimed psw is a bridge to tier 1 general.this is actually work visa. from 1st of april,2009 new rules were introduced and minimum master degree is required.if HO has to change their rules,they should do transitional arrangements for those who had already got psw.in uk,there are equal opportunities for everybody.what u think is HO giving equal opportunities to psw holders of before 31.03.2009 ?\nrather unfair to let students get PSW with a Bachelor degree and then stop them getting General. \n\nthanks \n\nshaz",
