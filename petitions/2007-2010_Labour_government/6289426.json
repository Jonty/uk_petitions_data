            "background": "An increasing number of school leavers are emerging with poor standards of English grammar and communications to the point where it is now a serious national issue. The root of the problem is the KS4 English curriculum because schools have to spend vast amounts of time teaching heavyweight literature such as Shakespeare and poetry as part of the compulsory English literature GCSE. Many students and teachers see this as a complete waste of time that could be put to better use teaching things that really matter in the real world such as grammar, comprehension, and clear factual writing.  \n\nVery few employers want an English literature GCSE. They want people with good English language skills. Therefore I propose that English literature is made an optional rather than compulsory subject at KS4.",
