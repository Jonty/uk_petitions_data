            "background": "We've all heard the stories of filesharers being sued for infringing copyright. The usual story portrayed by the media companies and representatives is that the artists are not making enough money to support themselves due to the illegal downloading of their music. It is this that music companies use to justify their war on P2P.\n\nIn America, the RIAA puts all of the money gained from these lawsuits back into fighting piracy. That means that artists do no see a penny of the money for their work being illegally shared.\n\nThis petition is aiming to ensure that the same thing does not happen here in the UK. If a copyright infringement case is won then the artists should be entitled to some of the money and a system should be put in place to decide a fair amount and ensure that the artists receive it.",
