        "background": "The government needs to listen to the CML and give government financial support to new mortgages given out by UK banks. This must be put in place immediately before the housing market worsens and has a deeper and longer negative impact on the UK economy. Reacting in the Autumn will be too late because the damage will be done. It's unfortunate our government won't react to the credit crunch as quickly and effectively as the US politicians react to their crisis.",
