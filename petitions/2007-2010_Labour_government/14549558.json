            "background": "Either permanent or for a limited period, which allows taxpayers of their own accord, address the tax collecting agency and disclose inaccurate or incomplete information from past tax years, or disclose material they did not report during previous dealings with the agency, without financial penalty or prosecution.\nGrant Thornton published in September 2009 a Tax Manifesto, a proposal for reforming the tax system. In the core findings, the tax system needs to become more transparent but also measures are needed to bring people back into the tax fold and keep them there. The recommendation is that the UK implements a vigorous General Tax Amnesty to bring those in the hidden economy back into the tax system without fear of imprisonment or penalty.\nOn the Treasury\u2019s figures, the budget deficit will reach \u00a3178 billion in the current financial year.\nThe benefits that accrue to the Exchequer from a comprehensive General Tax Amnesty are many and apart from the fiscal, the contribution to society in terms of compliance to the law is important and should be encouraged.",
