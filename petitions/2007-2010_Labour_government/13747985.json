More so that it is looking like they will not be penalised for the flipping of those 2nd homes . It is now time for the government to build purpose built homes to which the keys can be handed over whilst serving in their respective posts but those keys can also be handed back . For those that have already purchased properties , any monies made from the sale of those properties , should be paid back to the taxpayer . NO M.P should be able to financially gain from a property payed for by the taxpayer.",
