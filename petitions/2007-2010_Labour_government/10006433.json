            "background": "British Soldiers have to pay for their own health insurance.\nAs innocent people fight for their lives to protect the safety of our country they are getting into debt from insurers. These magnificent men and women are saving our well being and need to feel safe when they are on the lines. \nSoldiers get between \u00a312,500 and \u00a315,500. Even Traffic Wardens get paid \u00a317,000. Should our heros really be treated this way? Our country has been touched by these great people and we really need to give them credit for there outstanding efforts and actions.\nPrisoners get more money spent on their food than the Navy. What are our National Services coming to.",
