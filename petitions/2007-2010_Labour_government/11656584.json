            "background": "We need to do all we can to help this recession. Removing stamp duty for 18 months will I am sure help with the sales of property. The more homes sold will create work for many professions and the spin off of  monies being spent on services and items bought for a new home. HIps as it is at the moment abolished, the energy part being managed by the local authority whereby we can have an energy MOT and providing certain targets are met rate payers would be offered a discount off there annual rates bill. Doing this will surely help with jobs and reducing benefit payments.",
