        "background": "To provide ample parking for students and lecturers at HCT. Lately all the adjacent roads close to the College have had parking restrictions put on them making it nearly impossible for anyone at HCT to park. Students travel as far a field as Brecon and Worcester everyday so being able to park is essential. In the car park cars are dangerously parked everywhere. It is dangerous for all persons there. It's capacity is nowhere near enough.",
