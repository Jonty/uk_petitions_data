            "background": "Obviously no politicians live in small rural villages because if they did they would NOT keep closing anything small, such as schools that have been there for over 100 years or Post Offices that are all that's left and form the heart of these communities.  That \"community\" spirit is dying because the villages are dying.  Close the Post Office at Rodmersham and the shop will struggle to surive - it is used by all the surrounding villages because their Post Offices have all been closed over the years - you are forcing us to drive further and further and yet we are encouraged to be green.  The small branches of banks all went, but that was OK because we could use the Post Office - now you are taking that away too.  How can you encourage us to look after our elderly community when you force them to make long journeys to get their pension - do you actually have a conscience?  What is being gained by these closures?",
