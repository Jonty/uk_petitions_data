            "background": "This petition proposes that all Crown appointments at a senior level, for example Prime Minister, all Cabinet Ministerial positions, and all other senior roles should be ratified by Parliament. Parliament should consider the wider aspects of Crown appointments, and insist that certain standards are met. One such standard would be that all senior Crown Ministers be drug free and that they have always been drug free.\n\nThe USA has political systems under which even the President must answer to Congress and many senior roles must be approved by the Senate. The UK needs parallel systems.\n\nThis petition has been censored by Number 10 Downing Street so that named politicians cannot be mentioned who may have used drugs.",
