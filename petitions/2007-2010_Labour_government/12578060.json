        "background": "Mp's have claimed that it is normal for people living away from home to get expenses covered. At this point we should point out that members of Her Majesty's forces routinely are posted away from families and friends and to areas where property prices are out of the price range of even long serving service personel let alone the young ones. The government provide subsidised accomodation for these service personel. I say if it is good enough for these people then it is good enough for MP's. Instead of selling off old Barracks in London they should convert them to flats for MP's",
