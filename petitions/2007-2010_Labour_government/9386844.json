            "background": "IVF treatments in Britain is one of the greatest achievements in my opinion of he NHS and medical science, with 28,000 people undergoing treatments every year. People, who previously could only dream of having a family, now have greter success than ever before. But some service users are frustrated and seeking opportunities elsewhere. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to :\n\n1. Examine the cost (currently \u00a3115 per appointment)\n2. Variable success rates (the national average is 23.3 % for women in reproductive agge groups)\n3. Further research side effects and complications, often related to multiple births\n4. Psycho- sexual support and counselling services, including genetic screening advice services\n5. Regional and clinic success rate disparities",
