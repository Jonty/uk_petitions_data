            "background": "The Government is proposing to fund public works in order to support families and businesses in the current economic climate.  The Stonehenge tunnel has been through all the planning processes and is a scheme that could be started immediately. It is therefore an ideal candidate for this funding. Douglas Adams was Britain's foremost comic Science Fiction writer and is deserving of a public memorial. His work has an association with by-passes and naming the new road after Douglas Adams would be entirely appropriate.",
