A YOUNG WOMAN LIVING AT HOME WITH PARENTS IN AN AVERAGE INNER CITY ENVIRONMENT IS AT THE MOMENT ENCOURAGED BY THE BENEFITS SYSTEM TO HAVE CHILDREN. BY HAVING A CHILD AS A COUPLE OR SINGLE PARENT, IT ENSURES THAT FINANCES ARE RECIEVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE TAXPAYERS AND THAT THE PARENT/ PARENTS BECOME A PRIORITY FOR A COUNCIL HOUSE, WITH SUBSIDISED COUNCIL TAX AND BILLS. THOSE PARENTS WHO ARE FINANCIALLY NOT IN A POSITIION TO HAVE CHILDREN ARE THEREFORE ENCOURAGED TO DO SO BY RECIEVING FREE INCENTIVES. THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE SITUATION.",
