            "background": "China's emissions of carbon dioxide and pollutants have soared on the back of its ongoing economic boom.\n\nImpossible targets?\n\nChina has set a target of cutting the emission of pollutants by 10% between 2005 to 2010.\n\nHowever, with China now building about two new fossil fuel power stations every week, Western environmental commentators say it will be all but impossible for it to achieve that reduction.\n\nEarlier this month, a Chinese environment official admitted to British politicians that China was not able \"for the time being\" to commit to binding agreements to cut carbon emissions.\n\nSO what are the government going to do about it? As you are responsible for climate change from a government prospective, then what answers can you give for us supporting a country that care so little for life over economic gain.\nWe would be interested to know what form of trade embargo or constraints we as a country are placing on China for its total lack of ethical understand of what climate change is being effected due to pollution.\n\nthank you",
