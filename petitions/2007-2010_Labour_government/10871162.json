The professionalapproach is to just smile, humour them and nod because as thesaying goes...\"the customer is always right\". But deep down inside, we all know this isn't true and want tosmack them up the side of the head and tell them what youreally think. I believe that there should be a National Customer Service Day- Tell It How It Is\" where you are able to turn around to thecustomer and give them what for, as being at the brunt of rude,aggressive and plain stupid people is enough to send anyonecrazy. I've always been under the understanding that youshould treat people how you expect to be treated - I say, let'sgive it to them!",
