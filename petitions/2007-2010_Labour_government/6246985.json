        "action": "Reform the council tax, allowing for opt-out facilities whereby users may pay per use for all appropriate council services, such as refuse collection",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is much in the news about problems with refuse collection, and recycling.\n\nThis petition aims to publicise the problems, and suggest an alternative, whereby the user pays for the actual services used, proportional to usage, rather than the current flat fee based on property value.\n\nIt is also proposed to extend this idea to other appropriate council services.\n\nCredits may be gained by the user for providing reductions to the council costs, such as recycling, car-pooling, volunteer work, neighbourhood watch, etc.\n\nThis is based on the philosophy that society needs to learn responsibility for their actions, and to raise awareness of this from within.",
