Our military units is too small for the numbers of battlefield casualties, and the overflow has had to be treated on ordinary mixed NHS wards which is not suitable for our armed forces .Armed forces  have a language &  of their own and a totally different  perspective on life;  it is bad enough that  relatives have to travel from all over the country , to visit wounded personnel and there should be a village where by our soldiers and there familys  can be near each other Please give our armed forces the consideration and respect you expect people to give you. Help to build their morale through knowing that we, the British public, do care about their wellbeing",
