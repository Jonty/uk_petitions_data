            "action": "introduce a law to separate out commuter traffic from commercial goods traffic during peak commuting hours on weekdays by banning commercial goods carrying vehicles with a Gross Laden Weight greater than 3.5 Tonnes from using any UK road during peak commuting hours on weekdays",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, peak commuter traffic and commercial goods vehicles use the UK road network at the same time. This has lead to an increase in 'side swipe' incidents as a result of inappropriate overtaking manoeuvres by heavy vehicles and congestion as a result of low heavy vehicle speeds, low overtaking speed differential between heavy vehicles and slow acceleration of heavy vehicles. Surely separating commuter traffic from commercial goods traffic by timing is a sensible and sustainable method of lowering UK road traffic incidents and easing UK road network congestion?",
