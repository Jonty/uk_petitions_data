            "background": "there is an increasing crimewave affecting the uk, it is known as boiler room scams. initially you may be cold called and introduced to a company that is allegedly about to float on one of the words main stock markets, you are invited to buy a small number of shares at a discounted price in advance of the floatation,with the guarantee that the shares will tripple in value because the entry price has already been set, however, shortly before floatation day, yuo will receive a call informing you of a takeover bid by a large international company, who are only interested in buying shares in blocks of 20 - 25,000, therefore if you want to sell your shares and take your profit you have to increase your holding, although at the same discounted price per share. By now you will be the proud owner of 20 -25,000 shares in a company that is about to float on the market on Monday,and you will sell your shares by the end of the week and take your profit. Not So, the takeover will never happen and neither will the floatation, you are left with worthless shares that you cant sell and have to admit that you have all but lost your money.",
