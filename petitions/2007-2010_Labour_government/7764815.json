            "background": "As the government and local councils are all so concerned with road safety (I say this with the utmost reserve) could they please support this petition. Metal access covers on our roads are highly dangerous as all bikers know. If it is wet they are like ice and any inexperienced biker will find them highly unnerving, this could lead to loss of control and therefore accidents. Please sign this petition to have them removed permanently from our roads so that the government can finally do something which really addresses road safety.",
