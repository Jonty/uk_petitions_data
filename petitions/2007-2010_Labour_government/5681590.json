            "background": "The Church of England is our national Church - its bishops even have a right to sit in the House of Lords, influencing legislation. Therefore, it is disgraceful that women are banned from these senior church positions simply because they are women. It is yet another example of the government accepting religion as an excuse for appalling sexism, and flies in the face of otherwise laudable efforts to eliminate sexual discrimination. Add to this the benefits women would bring to church management, and the whole position is nonsensical.",
