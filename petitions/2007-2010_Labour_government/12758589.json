We all live by the decisions of our elected local government bodies and national government. Therefore it should be incumbent upon all citizens who have the right to vote to exercise their basic right to vote for the people that run the governance in our society. To duck this responsibility is an insult to the basic principles that so many people have sacrificed so much to introduce.",
