            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At present, concessionary fare is dependant on the local Passenger Transport Executive, and concessions, particularly students, are losing out because their student status only applies in their own area of residence. Particularly with rail travel, this can result in yearly expenses of over \u00a31000, even when travelling only to and from college or university. In my experience, a matter of 3 rail stops means the difference between \u00a3185 and >\u00a31000.\n\nA student in one area is no less of a student in another; neither does crossing a boundary give them access to an income which they would not have in their own area.\n\nThe solution is to make concessionary fares and student zero-fare passes available to anyone with a Student Card, regardless of residence.",
