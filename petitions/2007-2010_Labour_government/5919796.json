            "background": "Under current taxation rules, it is possible to claim some tax relief on replacement tools purchased for work.  However, new tools cannot be claimed for by employees or apprentices.\n\nIf I was self-employed, and maybe earning \u00a320-\u00a330 per hour, I believe I would be able to claim tax back on all my tools purchased, even new ones.  However, as an apprentice building up a collection of my own tools (my employers pay no contribution) I am purchasing more tools on my \u00a34.45 p/h minimum wage than an established self-employed person would normally be expected to, but I am not allowed to claim any tax relief on these tools beyond the \u00a370 p/a that everyone gets.  This represents a gross imbalance in the tax system, and I appeal to the PM and his Chancellor to address this imbalance promptly.",
