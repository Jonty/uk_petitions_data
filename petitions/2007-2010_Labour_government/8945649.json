            "background": "This petition is to encourage all remaining overseas territories or dependencies of the United Kingdom to leave the federacy, and either attain full independance or union with another state. As the majority of those remaining former colonies are either uninhabited or sparsely habited islands, they contribute little, if anything, to the country. This petition also includes the military bases on Cyprus and Diego Garcia, which are highly unpopular with local populations. It is time for Great Britain to just be made up of the British Isles once more (unless Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland choose to secede, which would be encouraged).",
