            "background": "The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 allows for the creation of dog exclusion zones under the provisions laid out for dog control orders. We, the undersigned, believe that such exclusion zones are descriminatory to law-abiding responsible dog owners that take great care of how their animals impact their environment and local communities. We are being punished for the actions of a small minority of irresponsible dog owners. We request that the Government and Prime Minister review this situation to ensure that we are able to exercise our animals.",
