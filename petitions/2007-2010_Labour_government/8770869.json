This is not true\nPrice of alternative machines is close to price of none change machines\nPrice of change machines compared too non change machines only a fraction of illicit gain by council for no change given\nPlace to receive refund often several miles away , by appointment or for limited hours\nFair transaction should be available at place of transaction\nCredit not available for unused time .\nPenalty charges far in excess of normal time based parking fee car parks\nExtortion , ransom, wheel clamping.\nCredit/debit  of a few pence is a few pence. Penalty charges should reflect this and be in reasonable proportion\n And should reflect this without  clamping which is disproportionate and is excessive abuse of power and one sided \nCouncil excuses, the scam is widespread and if others get away with it then so can they.\n(remember the BBC and phone in scam)\n\nThis petition is too ban illegal or unfair scam practices by councils",
