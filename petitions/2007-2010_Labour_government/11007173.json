            "background": "In view of the UK banking industry's culpability in our current economic woes, we see no justification for paying bonusses to those responsible. Instead they should be made to suffer like the rest of us, but in proportion to their degree of responsibilty, i.e. LOTS.\nTherefore I would propose that any bonusses paid should be confiscated in full and passed to the treasury to help offest the cost to the nation of bailing out the banks.",
