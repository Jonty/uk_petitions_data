If the offender had been a motorist, there would have also been either a driving ban, prison sentence or both.\n\nWhether, a minor moving traffic offence, or one that results in injury or death, all road users should face the same penalties. Where cyclists are permitted to use the pavement, the same laws should apply to them as when they use the road.",
