            "background": "Take the following measures:\n1. Improve infrastructure.\n2. Remove some artificial congestion-creating constructions such as road humps, chicanes, concrete barriers covering complete lanes.\n3. Build more bypasses.\n4. Increase the speed limit on less congested motorways to 80mph.\n5. Encourage long distance freight to be carried by rail - or, even, canals.\n6. Switch off traffic lights outside rush hour times at quiet juntions.\n7. Build more filter lanes at junctions.\n8. Reduce reliance on technology and put more police on the roads.\n\nThe benefits will be less:\n1 congestion.\n2 fuel wastage.\n3 pollution (and health problems).\n4 time wastage - and therefore reduced costs to businesses and to us for goods in shops.\n5 wear and tear on roads - and therefore less roadworks and associated problems in those places.\n6 use of electricity.\n7 noise pollution - vehicles not bouncing over humps or swerving round chicanes.\n8 holdups due to accidents when the idiot drivers are caught lane hopping, tail gating, etc.",
