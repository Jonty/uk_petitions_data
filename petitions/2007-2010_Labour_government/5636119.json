            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A dedicated area with proper air extraction and ventilation will have no impact on non smokers espeacially if this area is serviced by smokers themselves. It is claimed that smoking costs the NHS \u00a32 billion yet the government receives \u00a38 billion in tax. If everybody stopped smoking overnight there would be severe adverse tax implications for the rest of the population. It is unfair to be punished for smoking in what is meant to be a free country if it harms no one else.",
