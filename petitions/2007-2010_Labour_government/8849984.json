            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This would provide a real incentive for home owners to make improvements that reduce the energy consumption of their home. Stamp duty payable would be graded according to energy rating of the home  as assessed in the HIP as follows, for example:\nA=0%\nB=20%\nC=40%\nD=60%\nE=80%\nF and G=100%\nSo spending money on energy saving measures would mean that buyers would pay less stamp duty on houses costing over \u00a3125,000. The seller could raise his asking price by the amount saved on stamp duty for a purchaser and the purchaser would still pay the same total amount. He could therefore afford to spend this extra amount on energy saving measures and recoup all of it when he sold,- and In the meantime benefit from lower running costs.\nIn addition a potential purchaser is more likely to want to buy your house because it has lower running costs - thus making easier to sell or enabling the seller to get a better price.",
