            "background": "A recent petition created to limit cars to 70MPH is incorrect. Cars are made to do speeds exceeding out legal speed limit of 70MPH to allow owners should they choose to take their cars and drive them off road at a speed of their choosing.\n\nAlthough other (usually heavy goods vehicles) are limited, this is ebcause they are not designed to be used on private land for pleasure.\n\nThere is no reasoning to say that car insurance would decrease as insurance companies will always want to impose the maximum charge that they are reasonably able to.\n\nIt is an erosion of civil liberties to impose on motorists that their cars will never be able to exceed 70MPH, as well as the times when said vehicles will be used off road, it is in some situations necessary to exceed albeit slightly 70MPH, limiting cars would for example in motorway driving be likely to cause accidents when switching lanes.\n\nEnd line, do not limit cars to 70MPH, the law is clear on the matter and reasonable people would choose to obey it.",
