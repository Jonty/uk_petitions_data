            "background": "It is well noted that the MMR should not be given to boys, since the Rubella component is suitable only for females. Males given the Rubella jab suffer from Arthritis and internal organ damage and failure. The MMR jab is given to both sexes for convenience and economy, but the results are very dear to those who suffer and die as a result of errorneous and frankly abhorrent administraion. I ask the PM, now as before, to fully address the ingredients and application of this and other vacchines, and to make people in the UK fully aware of what constitutes them. It is no longer acceptable for Goverment backed medical centres to endorse the uptake of MMR without letting them know what makes it. The MMR is not always a panacea, but a frighening, dangerous substance that afflicts children who were hitherto perfectly healthy and normal. When you run your Television advertisments and magaizine articles about the affectiveness of this jab, please also list the ingredients and the myraid documentated cases of adverse reaction. \n\nThis is what we are asking for today. We know this Labour Goverment feels as we do in making people aware of MMR saftey. \n\nThank you.",
