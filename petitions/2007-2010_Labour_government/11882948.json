            "background": "There should be free well-maintained toilets at all railway stations and pubs subsidised by the government if necessary.  This is a key hallmark of a civilised society.  The inconvenience of having to find a convenience and of having to pay to use it is very annoying.  Nearest toilets should also be sign-posted much better.  The current trend towards separate charges for everything has got to stop.",
