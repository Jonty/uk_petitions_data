(Over 1,000 complaints)\n\nThe PCC sent out auto responses claiming that it would not investigate the complaint unless the complainant is personally involved in the case. \n\nThe remarks in the above mentioned articles caused offence on so many levels to so many people and I believe the PCC should have greater powers to investigate and punish organisations for such items if breaches of their own code are found.",
