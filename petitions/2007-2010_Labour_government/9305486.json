            "background": "whilst immigration has been considered by some to have been a positive contribution to Britain, others consider that this has been to the detriment of the British worker. More money should be invested in better training schemes to be made available for the long term unemployed,and more realistically paid apprenticeships. If we invest in the British unemployed, give them back their self esteem, give them the tools to be great craftsmen and professionals again. this would reduce the skills shortage and redress the balance. British workers need to regain their pride and not be passed over by their own government again.",
