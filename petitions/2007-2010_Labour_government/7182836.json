Whilst unworkable and unbelievable in its Big Brother magnitude, can we really allow our liberties again to be passed over again? After the EU referendum, NHS database spending, Consultants appliaction database can this system be secure and can it work? History proves that ID cards only work in times of war and with 100% support.",
