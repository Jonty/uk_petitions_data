The local papers are full with adverts for dogs; Websites are now being used to advertise dogs of ALL sorts, legal and banned/illegal. To stop backyard breeders \u2018licence\u2019 all dog Breeding and imports. Form another \u2018Quango\u2019 (the Government has formed enough already another one will not harm) Fund the Quango from the licence fees and a grant from Central Government (they waste enough as it is there must be a little more to spare). \nAnyone breeding who does not have a licence: Remove and destroy all the dogs, \u2018Fine\u2019 the people breeding, (and actually collect/get the money) Any do-gooders who complain about cruelty to the dogs can have the sterilised dog at a fee that covers the cost of the sterilisation and a portion for the licence set-up, on the condition they have a home (no more than two dogs) not a kennel for the dog. All these people want rights; well rights come with responsibility - Make breeders and owners responsible for their actions.",
