        "action": "Subsidise British soldiers' telephone bills",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As a parent of a young British soldier, I believe that more should be done to allow our soldiers' to keep in touch with family and friends at home.  These young men and women are away from home fighting for their country, yet no subsidy is offered by the government towards the cost of their telephone bills.\nAlthough my son has not yet been posted to Afghanistan, he is often away from home for long periods, and does need to speak regularly to his friends and family.  Whilst in Germany, he recieved very large monthly bills which he had to pay upon his return home.\nIf our soldiers' are away from home for long periods, then why aren't their phone bills subsidised? I for one, believe that this is the least the government can do, to ensure that they are not cut off completely from their families.",
