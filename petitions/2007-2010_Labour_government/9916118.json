            "background": "Today, Private Parking Companies (PPC's) who regularly patrol shopping centre and Superstore car parks are freely accessing thousands of peoples records retained by the DVLA and using this information to send harassing and threatening letters to the registered keepers of vehicles, where as in actual fact any private car parking offence is committed by the driver of the vehicle at that time and not the registered keeper, the keeper is also not required by law to divulge who was driving at that time either, therefore any attempt at obtaining monies from vehicle keepers when any offences are committed by the vehicles driver is tantamount to obtaining money on false pretences, which the government is aiding by providing these PPC's with our information from their records, for this reason i petition the Prime Minister to ban or severely limit private parking companies access to DVLA records, (this petition does not include local government/council controlled car parks which operate different rules and regulations)",
