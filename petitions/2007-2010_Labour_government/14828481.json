A carer is somewhat like a prison officer or a member of the night shift at a hospital or care home,just because the person they care for is locked away or asleep,does not mean the officer or carer can go home,No they must remain there in case of an emergency.\n\nSo if a prison officer or night staff carer get payed for just being there,why do we get treated without that respect ?\n\nCarers are both officer and sometimes prisoner at the same time,Please respect there position within the social care system .",
