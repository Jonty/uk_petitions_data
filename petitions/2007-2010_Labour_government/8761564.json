            "background": "Whilst the Civilian War Dead of the Second World War who died as the result of hostile action those from the First World War have been ignored. As we approach the 90th Anniversary of the Armistice is it not time for those who died in that conflict to be remembered offically by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. This will require an ammendment to the CWGC's Royal Charter by all the particpating nations(UK, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand & South Africa). Why should these unfortunate souls remains forgotten? They died in air raids, in internment camps, as passengers on torpedoed ships, by bombardment of their towns by enemy ships & in one well known case (Edith Cavell) was executed by the Germans. Please sign if you agree with this petition",
