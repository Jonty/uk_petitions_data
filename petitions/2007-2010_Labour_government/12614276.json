        "background": "In excess of \u00a320 million has been spent to train 'Cohort 10' of Trainee Probation Officers. Most trainees have been informed that they will not be offered jobs at the end of their training. This is a huge waste of talent and resources. At this time of econmic difficulty, with predictions of a resultant rise in crime, why is investment in the Probation Service not forthcoming? Job cuts loom, posts go unfilled and the few that are left have greater caseloads yet less time to work with people. This surely increases the very risk of harm that Probation Officers assess, monitor and contain. Funding needs to be urgently directed towards this area.",
