            "background": "The Government intends to raise the earliest age at which an occupational pension may be taken (other than on ill health grounds) from age 50 to age 55 in April 2010.\nThis will be carried out retrospectively and people between 50 and 55 on April 5th 2010 and therefore eligible to take their own occupational pensions, will from April 6th 2010, be unable to access their occupational pensions.  Should they lose their job and be unable to find work they will find themselves with no income unless they claim state benefits.",
