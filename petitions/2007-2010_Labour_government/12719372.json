            "background": "The Government plans to reduce or 'cap' the amount of money we have raised via Council Tax this year by \u00a31.6 million. \n\nAs a result, we will have to produce new, slightly lower council tax bills and distribute them to every household in the county.\n\nTo return this \u00a31.6 million (a reduction of 6p per week for a Band D council tax bill) via these new bills will cost us \u00a31.2 million in administrative & distribution costs. The resulting reduction in our budget will force us to cut 50 front line officer and staff posts. \n\n\u2022Cancel its plan to 'cap' the Surrey Police Authority budget for 2009/10\n\n\u2022Introduce a fair funding formula that reflects the true cost of policing Surrey.",
