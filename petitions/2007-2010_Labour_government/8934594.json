The two cornerstones of your government are said to be 'Stability' and 'Fairness' yet all too often, we who live in this supposed democracy often feel ignored and under valued. Perhaps with a 'recall election' system available to the wider population governments, national and local, might be more inclined to listen to and take note of the wishes of the people.",
