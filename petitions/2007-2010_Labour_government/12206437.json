            "background": "In past years deaf people have had to miss out on going to the cinema because of a lack of showings with subtitles. We would like to see every cinema to be required to offer at least 1 evening screening with subtitles per film.  \n\nTheatre is also lacking in accessibility.  There is a charity called Stagetext who put on Captioned theatre productions, but they do not have the funding to put on as many as they would like.  Many theatres are unhelpful when it comes to assistance, to the extent that the Producers of Avenue Q recently referred us to an AUDIO-description site!  In the 3 years that Avenue Q was running they did not put on a captioned production, and by their own admission have no plans to do so when they reopen in July. \n\nWhat we are asking is for more funding to be put into making the Arts accessible to those with disabilities. Also, legislation is required to make theatres and cinemas offer more options for the deaf and it is crucial that the Government look at this.",
