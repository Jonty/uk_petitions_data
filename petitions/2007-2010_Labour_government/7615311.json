            "background": "In an age when we are being both encouraged and pressured to leave our cars at home and use public transport, why is it that rail fares are significantly more expensive than the cost of driving ourselves.\n\nFor example, a return ticket from Southampton to London is currently around \u00a360 for commuters and the rail companies are talking about raising the off-peak prices, apparently to \"reduce overcrowding\".  The companies fail to understand that the off-peak trains are becoming more crowded because the peak trains are not affordable.\n\nReturning to the above example, the cost of the fuel to drive into London from Southampton is less than a third of that cost.\n\nIn addition, the cost of transport in London is weighted towards London salaries, but as such makes transport beyond the reach of people visiting London ... both UK residents and tourists.\n\nSomething needs to be done!",
