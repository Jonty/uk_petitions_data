Licence payers in their 10's of thousands have clearly shown that they were outraged by this behaviour that was broadcast, it was immoral, and offensive. The Director General, has dithered on this occasion, and clearly should have made a statement about the whole affair immediately. He didn't, and has shown the public he is not capable of performing his duty, in the office that he is employed by.",
