Why should a footballer recieve every penny owed by the club, but the coach company, utility companies, tradesmen, HMRC, get nothing?\nThis strikes me as blatant discrimination. If it is a Football League rule, then the govt. must insist that it is changed, or allow ALL companies to bring in similar protectionist rules.",
