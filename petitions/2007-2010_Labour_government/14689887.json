        "background": "With more and more football clubs getting into financial difficulties, isn't it about time we stopped football debts taking precedence over non-football debts? Why should a footballer recieve every penny owed by the club, but the coach company, utility companies, tradesmen, HMRC, get nothing?\nThis strikes me as blatant discrimination. If it is a Football League rule, then the govt. must insist that it is changed, or allow ALL companies to bring in similar protectionist rules.",
