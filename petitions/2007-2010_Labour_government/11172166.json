            "background": "The Wiltshire Young People's Opportunity Fund does a LOT of good in Wiltshire. Loads of projects run and for young people in Wiltshire are able to happen, due to this type of funding from the Government. \nHowever there are still SO many worthy projects, which do not receive money due to limited funding!\nIf extra money was provided, young people in Wiltshire would be even more stimulated to channel their energy in positive and constructive ways, by giving something back to the community and helping demolish the media stereotypes of young people.\nWYPOF money has already changed so many people's lives! Young people who are often hard to reach, through things such as disabilities or the rural areas in which they live! \nMusic projects! Art projects! Sports projects!Improving youth centres! Points reward schemes! \nGovernment funding has been pumped into SO many things and done SO much good! Despite this, there are still plenty of young people who would hugely benefit from it!\nWouldn't it be nice, if this effective scheme could do EVEN more, to improve the image and perception of young people, help them feel better about themselves and help make their lives have more meaning?",
