        "action": "take steps to safeguard the historic use of Degrees Fahrenheit as the traditional method of measuring temperature in the United Kingdom and to encourage broadcasters and the media to give priority to Fahrenheit over Celsius/Centigrade.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Degrees Fahrenheit is the traditional scale for measuring temperature in the United Kingdom. It is also by far the easiest and most accurate way of referring to hot temperatures - ie. heat can be referred to as being in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s etc. That is much easier than awkwardly saying the teens, 20s, 30s which is vague and covers a far wider variation. Fahrenheit lends itself to accuracy because there are almost 2 degrees F to a single degree C. Fahrenheit remains the temperature scale used in the United States, and there is no logical reason why the British should have to switch to Celsius simply because that is what they use in Europe. Degrees F is as much a part of our heritage as traditional weights and measures.",
