        "background": "An economist mentality has eroded our nation\u2019s assets, community identity and our civil liberties as governments in the last twenty years have put profits, statistics and targets before people and common sense.  Politicians who once spoke with humanitarian passion, are now dulled by hollow words uttered more by vanity than compassion. The banal Americanisation of Britain has allowed the ruling elites to shape our daily lives.  Egalitarianism and community identity have crumbled under the politics of selfishness leaving our make-over towns marked by tension, fear and corporate soullessness.  Aggressive social divisions have formed where competitive egos now replace the cooperative spirit. The collective powers of the people have been diminished, divided and diffused by a system that no longer recognises the profound injustice and folly of permitting the majority to be controlled by a privileged few. \n\nRestore and guarantee our civil liberties and freedoms, our shared and common-sense values. Re-value social justice and state benevolence over executive profiteering; Reinstate a system of government in which the people of this country can once again believe.",
