        "action": "increase driving age for a full licence to 18yrs whilst keeping provisional at 17yrs.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Raising the driving age is a sore area, and at any point they will be a new driver and \"maturity\" varies at 18 just as much as it does at 17.\n\nThe problem is mainly how fast someone can get a licence after they are 17.\n\nI feel a mandated minimum amount of time on a provisional licence should be enforced.\n\nThis allows a young 17yr old driver to be able to drive and learn, and get the experience over at least a year before they can do their test for a full licence at 18yrs.\n\nThis is a better solution to the \"minimum\" amount of hours a new driver should take, since they won't be forced to drive with an instructor and pay the costs, thus poorer families can teach their own children over the course of a year.",
