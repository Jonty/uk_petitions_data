The petitioner is calling for the govt to conduct a health impact assessment of IT equipment use and it's disposal. \n\nCash Convertors, send back envelopes for ink cartridges and second hand shops already go some way to this, but this informal market is poorly regulated and no facilities exist specifically for electrical goods disposal other than the local tip. There must be a better way than this.",
