WHAT A RIP OFF are they just going to keep raising everything every year?? If the cost was just \u00a31 for a motorbike, \u00a32 for a car and \u00a33 for a van then M6 congestion through junctions 10A - 8 will ease considerably, does that not make sense? no only money talks apperently. what a rip off, and my van a 2007 maxus pollutes far less than most modern petrol cars and equlivent so why should i have to pay \u00a318 to use a toll road lol NOT A CHANCE",
