So basically, half of your hard earned money is thrown into the government to make 'a better life for Britain's' -- Well (1) The way tax money is spent in this country is ridiculous in some cases and (2) We would all have a better standard of life anyway if we had more money.\nFor example a person earning a total of \u00a340,000 anually would lose SIXTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS in taxing and would live only on \u00a324,000 of the hard earned money. This is abslolutely ridiculous!",
