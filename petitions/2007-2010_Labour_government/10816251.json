            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The long term shortage of council and social housing has driven the massive inflation in house prices over the the past 2 decades and, in part, contributed to the current negative economic climate.  We need to steady or even reduce the cost of housing by bleeding off demand at the lower end of the market through the construction of low cost council and social housing.\n\nTherefore local authorities that have a waiting list should be required to year on year double their housing stock for the next 5 years or until they have more housing than people seeking housing.",
