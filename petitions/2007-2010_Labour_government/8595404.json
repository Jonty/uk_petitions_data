            "background": "With dog bites recently in the news it is clear that current dangerous dogs laws require tightening up.  However we petition the government to recognise that it is not the breed of a dog that causes it to attack but rather its upbringing and training.  We therefore request that all proposals for any legislation further restricting ownership of any specific breed be rejected and laws focussed instead on the responsible ownership of dogs regardless of breed.",
