        "background": "We as gay men and lesbians are discriminated everyday. It ranges from the smallest things to things like not being able to donate blood. We are told that we have rights, these rights are limited and nowhere near the sort of rights that hetero's get. It's time to take action, it's time for change! I propose that we fight to not pay taxes. In the eye's of the government we arn't good enough. So why should they take our money? The pink pound rakes in billion's each year. Why should it be used for things we can't participate in? Why should we, as the gay population of this country pay for services that only straight people can use?",
