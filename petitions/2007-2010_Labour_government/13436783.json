            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Why do we continually allow people that pay us no tax or add to this country to freely arrive to the UK to claim UK housing benefits, Job seekers allowance, use our healthcare system, and generally drain this country of funds.  The UK needs to protect itself before it is over-run with freeloaders.\n\nWe are however recruiting for valuable members of society.\nDoesn't it seem like common sense that  if you haven't contributed to the financial pot for a period of 3 years, then don't expect to take funds or services from the pot (unless you've got a very good reason). \n\nThe time to end the UKs status as a registered charity is here.\n\nAre we not learning that people want to come to the UK in increasing numbers because we are the softest and most generous nation in terms of handouts we offer.  It's no real wonder why they're calling their families and telling them this is the promised land, they're in heaven!\n\nLets keep our benefits and services for those that need them, first and foremost UK born citizens, and valuable members of society that add to our culture.",
