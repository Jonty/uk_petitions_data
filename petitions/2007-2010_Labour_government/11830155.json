Poor Jade whom only has weeks to live has enough to deal with. \n\nThe documentry  viewed by many on Living TV last night, gave us an insight to what Jade's feeling and going through. \n\nShes trying her best to stay strong for her family, but with all this presure of the unforunate illness and now on top of this the worry of being alone on her wedding night. It's not fair.",
