            "background": "As Many of us already know our throw away fashion habits in the UK have created a situation where poorer countries are slaves to our luxuries. Little information and sometimes no labels at all on clothing sold in the UK means us the consumer can not make a conscious, informed choice when buying clothes. It should be compulsory that like our food we can be told where its from, if its organic and if the people involved have received a fair wage.\nWe therefore would like the government to create this legislation, working towards a more informed choice for consumers in the UK, which could then lead to a better working environment for those who currently are a slave to our fashion.",
