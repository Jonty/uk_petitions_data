            "background": "The adequate need for housing of people is accepted.\nHowever the proposed Eco town sites on which these are to be built many 1000's of acres of food producing agricultural land will be lost.\nWith the world food shortage and in order to prevent us becoming a net importer of food which will be damaging for the economy we need to grow more in order that we can export in order to provide food for those around the world.\nIt is that old saying you can eat food but you can not eat money or houses.\nI move that all plans for Eco Towns be suspended until such time the World food Crisis Issue is over.",
