            "background": "National house builders have seen a massive increase in what they charge for a new home, this is in no way reflecting the increased buiding costs, but has fermented the destruction of aspirations for people to own thier own homes. Housing densities are too high compared to prices charged, the profits are ruining social cohesion in the UK.\n\nBring back realistic housing for people, not just first time Housing Association schemes, but encorage builders who make a modest profit for a reasonable size of house.",
