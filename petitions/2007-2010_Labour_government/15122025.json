It is time to do something about it.\n\nFuel duty is at 50.35p a litre, then VAT is added at 17.5%.\n\nThis means that an average tank of petrol, of 50 litres is costing \u00a357.50, which breaks down as follows.\n\nVAT - \u00a310.06\nFuel Duty - \u00a325.18\nActual cost of fuel - \u00a322.26\n\nThat works out at \u00a335.24 in tax!\n\nWith petrol prices being raised again this week (w/c 15/3/10), it is time made a stand.",
