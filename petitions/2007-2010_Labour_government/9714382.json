The road is just not suitable for the ammount and type of traffic it sees. Trucks coming from the ferries have the negotiate thin winding country roads and in Girvan a one way road through the heart of the town. The difficult to negotiate roads mixed with speeding and large vehicles makes this a very dangerous road. If it where by passed there would be no need to speed as it would be a straight road and there would be more room for cars and trucks to negotiate the road safely.",
