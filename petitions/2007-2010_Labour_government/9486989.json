While they all claim EXPENSES for their SECOND homes and PETROL for their cars, also REDUCED prices for commons MEALS, paid for with our TAXES, the rest of the country are held to ransom by increased GAS,ELECTRICTY, PETROL,FOOD, PRESCRIPTION CHARGES & COUNCIL TAX. Perhaps if you were to give up some of your perks, it might go some way to help the rest of us and pay for things we really need. Also could you not stop all the form filling Doctors/Nurse/Police & Teachers have to do, then perhaps they could all get on with the jobs they are meant to do.",
