            "background": "Multiplex plan to develop a 5000 house development between Wilburton and Stretham in Cambridgeshire. The proposal will create an additional 12,000 vehicals on the A10 (single carriageway) road to Cambridge and overload existing local resources in an already overdeveloped,overpopulated part of the fens.\n\nDespite being turned down by all relevant authorities, the developer is still trying to push this development though in an already overpopulated area of Cambridgeshire.\n\nEly and it's surrounding villages have already expanded beyond sustainable limits, and Mereham is not needed. The already congested A10 will not support the additional estimated 12k vehicles, and the local facilities such as doctors and shops are over-stretched on current population.",
