            "background": "Now released into the public domain and ably documented in the BBC Documentary broadcast on 8th October it is apparent that the bravery and quick thinking of a few individuals working at Windscale averted a national disaster.  Their actions have never been applauded but their reputation was sacrificed to political expediency by the McMillan government which had forced the pace of nuclear development at the expense of public safety.  It is time that the nation honoured these men and it is fitting that the current Prime Minister should take the lead.",
