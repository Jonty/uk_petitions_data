            "background": "The creation of the STFC from two previous funding bodies, PPARC and CCLRC, was intended to streamline the disbursement of government funds to areas of research in advanced physics. Assurances were given that budgets would be maintained. Whether by error or intent, the result in December 2007 is a dramatic shortfall in funds of about \u00a380million, seriously undermining scientific research in the UK. You promised this would not happen, and we look to you to correct the situation.",
