The fuel pumps will incentivise or penalise. \nThere would be less tax dodging and much lower administration costs.\nJust think of the tax saving in that alone. \nThe complexity, inefficiency and unfairness of this current cobbled together road tax will cause confusion and anger for years to come.",
