        "action": "I propose PCSO's have a useful set of powers which are standard nationwide, have a set standard uniform, all be issued stab vests and have the power to arrest for public order offences.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I feel certain aspects of the job have not been covered very well and need addressing. I feel it is important not just to the public but for a PCSO also, with a set power structure a member of public could travel across England and understand the role regardless of what force there in. Additionly the powers a PCSO has needs to be backed up by further powers to ensure they can do the job affectivley. For example the power to arrest for public order offences would hold the threat factor, which would sway the opposing party to comply. In addition with a set uniform the PCSO would have a stance within the POLICE more so as they would have the same duties, and jobs to do, creating a true new addition to the POLICE family.",
