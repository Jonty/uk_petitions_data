            "background": "The \"basket\" of goods and services that make up the CPI figure each month does not accurately reflect the costs experienced in real life. According to the Government's own published figures, the added up total weighting for: rent, all food and non-alcoholic drink, gas,  electricity and water bills, the purchase of a vehicle, fuel, road tax, rail, bus and plane fares (most of which are rising dramatically) makes up only 37% of the average household budget. This is nonsense. \n\nThis results in an artificially low inflation figure, distoring the signals used by the Bank of England to set Interest Rates.",
