It has provided me with a positive vehicle for expressing a wide range of emotions and feelings. Learning the craft of songwriting and mastering the discipline to learn an instrument has given me a huge sense of achievement and in turn boosted my self esteem.So, why has the internet encouraged us all to allow our songs, some taking years to write and inspired from a lifetime of experience, to be heard for free? It is time for songwriters and their songs to be fairly rewarded.",
