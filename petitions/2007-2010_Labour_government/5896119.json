I take a flask, have a ciggy before and a ciggy before driving home.\nHave not yet been challenged, but a Glasgow Kiss might be my reaction!!!\nWe aren't harming anyone else with our smoke!  Nanny state.\nThey've also started restricting drinking(or trying to) with the \"drink wisely\" programme.\nI don't know about you, but-after four pints, I'm anything but wise, though it does increase my accuracy with the darts!",
