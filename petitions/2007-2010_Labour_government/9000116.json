Half of the people of Barnsley are NOT Muppets and would like Barnsley to be the new Capital City. Most of us seldom get to leave Yorkshire because we can't afford to or we simply can't read a map.\nIf Barnsley were the Capital then we could all go and see summut by Lloyd Webber after a few pints in the Nags Head.",
