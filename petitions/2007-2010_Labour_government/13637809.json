If parts of the body are trapped this can have disastrous consequences.\n\nRecently there was a tragic accident in which a child lost most of her fingers.\n\nWorse things can happen.  There have been cases where a person has been cooked alive, their friends unable to release them from the ghastly grip of the rapidly setting material.\n\nIt would be simple to print a warning on every packet.\n\"Beware. This material liberates heat. Ensure that no body parts are trapped while making casts\".\nThis would rapidly become part of Art teachers folklore, potentially saving life and limb.\n\nIt is not always obvious to members of the public what is the most effective way to implement change.\nThat is the expertise of the politician.\nPerhaps all that is needed is advice to distributors from the HSE\n\nPlease help us find the simplest and most effective way to bring about this change, so that this kind of horrific accident never happens again.",
