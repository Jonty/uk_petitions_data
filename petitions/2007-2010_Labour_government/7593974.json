            "background": "Al Bangura,, faces deportation to Sierra Leone after losing his case to stay in the UK at an Asylum and Immigration Tribunal hearing on 11 December 2007. \n\nThe teenager, who became a father earlier this month arrived in Britain four years ago, escaping civil war in his homeland, and was given limited discretionary leave to stay but now the Home Office will initiate moves to remove him from the country. \n\nWatford manager Aidy Boothroyd said: \"It is an incredible decision, absolutely ludicrous.   I hope common sense does prevail. We will be appealing because we think it is a ridiculous decision.   We thought we could put our faith in British justice but obviously not. We have to keep trying everything we can to make sure he stays.  To escape civil war twice and avoid what he has avoided in his life, we cannot imagine what this boy has gone through in his short life and then somebody somewhere thinks it is a good idea to send him back to all of that.\" \n\nSign the petition to avoid this potential tragedy becoming a reality.",
