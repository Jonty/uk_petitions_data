        "action": "Introduce a regional tax on all packaging that is not recyclable in the area it is being distributed and have the money raised given to the council in that area to create a market for the recyclable waste and provides recycling facility for it.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A tax is needed to provide the money to enable all packaging waste to be recycled, manufacturers are always keen to put the recycle symbol on all their packaging but the problem is there is no market available for a lot of this packaging so it goes straight into landfill, at present people live in a sort of postcode lottery with what they can and can not recycle varying enormously from area to area, companies should be tax according to the availability of recycling in the area the product is going too, this should be graded with zero rate meaning door to door collection is available so all can be recycled. Money raised from the said tax should so directly to the local council, once councils have the money available they should then be able to help set up recycling markets/facilities for these products and possibly in the long run even provide free recycling collections for businesses.",
