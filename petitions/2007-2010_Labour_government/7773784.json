            "background": "Piercing guns are an extremely unsafe way to pierce which unfortunately many people do not know.\n\nThey are unsterile and the studs used are too short to accomodate for any swelling and made of plated inadequate metal as well as being unsterile. \nThe inability to sterilise guns between customer use increases the risk of spreading disease.\n\nThe choice between a teenager who has learnt to pierce with these guns from a half hour video before being set loose on the public (including children and even newborns) and a professional who uses one-use sterile needles and in a clean environment (not a dusty shop window) shouldn't be difficult.\n\nBody piercing is becoming very commonplace, we should at least do some research into it and provide safe procedure and aftercare (something places like Claire's Accessories are not very good at) to ensure a reduction in embedded gun studs and infection.",
