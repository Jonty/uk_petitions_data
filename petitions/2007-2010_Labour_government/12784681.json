            "background": "As soon as the new career as an Energy Assessor was created \"vultures\" arrived. \n\nEven in the current climate where many Energy Assessors are struggling to find work there are some training providers that are being allowed to continue to promise pots of gold and 10 EPCs a day to unwitting victims. \n\nMeanwhile Panels are offering low fees to Energy Assessors, who in some cases due to the current housing market, are being forced to accept a measly \u00a335 per EPC before lodgement fees etc. \n\nThe Energy Perfomance Certificate deserves some positive proactive publicity! \n\nThe EPC can help save money on fuel bills, which would be a god send to many people this winter, especially the elderly and those who are already struggling to repay last years fuel bills. \n\n1000s' of Energy Assessors have struggled to pay course fees and now are struggling to pay bills due to the lack of work and insulting fees offered by panels for this professional service. \n\nThis Government needs to start looking into this industry immediately and make the necessary changes.",
