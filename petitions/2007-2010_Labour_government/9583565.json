This is just one instance that we know about of fat cat Labour MP's using expenses innappropriately.  She was on the TV a couple of days ago saying she had not broken any rules, she obviously has no moral compass either as she went ahead with these purchases.\nOn the other hand it is Labour which has resticted Police pay to a 1.9% increase, whilst helping to cause inflation to run at 4-5% in real terms. What hypocrisy from the so called working mans party!  Time to vote Tory I think.",
