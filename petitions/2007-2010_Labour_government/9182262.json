            "background": "Dear Prime Minister\nMy wife and I joined our family here in Canada in 2004.  Our Old age pensions are frozen from the date of our departure from the United Kingdon.\nI made madatory payments to the State Pension Scheme with the understanding that the state pension would be paid and indexed thrughout my life in retirement.  With Moving to Canada to join my family the pension is frozen.  I believe fundamently that this is wrong and should be addressed as a mattter of immediate concern and importance to me and other pensioners her in Canada.\nI know the matter has been before you in the past and nothing seems to have been done to re-address the matter.\nI firmly believe that I am being fraudulently derived of the increases that I would otherwise be entitled to and I have grown up to expect better from my own country. Would you please therfore consider a correction to this injustice that now prevails.\nYours respectfully\nWilliam and Josaphine Steward",
