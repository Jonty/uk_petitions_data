            "background": "The reason why corporal punishment is not used in offences is because it is barbaric and it is going against basic human rights. Then why is it still LEGAL to punish a child at home corporally? This form of punishment, towards children, simply instigates hatred and suggests to the child that HITTING SOMEONE is okay! Countries like Germany have understood the stupidity of corporal punishment, and they have banned it. There are much more humane ways of punishing children which are also much more effective.  Are we BRITISH or BARBARIC?",
