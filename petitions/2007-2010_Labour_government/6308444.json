            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "So many phones are sold to consumers LOCKED.\n\nLOCKED means that they cannot be used on any other mobile phone network, simply because of restrictions, imposed by the providers themselves.\n\nThis is NOT fair practice, towards the owners of phones, and other competing networks.\n\nPhone Network Providers CAN unlock nearly any phone, usually over the phone in seconds. They tend to charge over \u00a335 for this though! By putting this cost on the consumer, it often makes them simply live with the less competitive network. The network makes money because the consumer has no choice but to pay up, or not use their OWN purchased mobile phone.\n\nI encourage the Government to make mobile phone network providers unlock ANY phone at their own cost so that consumers can CHOOSE the network they want with as little hassle as possible!!\n\nNOTE TO 10 DOWNING STREET: THIS IS NOT ABOUT SELLING PHONES UNLOCKED, IT IS ABOUT THEM DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW!!! IE. UNLOCKING ANY WISHFUL CUSTOMERS PHONES FREE OF CHARGE!\n\nAll those who agree, sign this petition...",
