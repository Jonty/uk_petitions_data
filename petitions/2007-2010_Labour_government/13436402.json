        "background": "Hospital beds are not available, scanning machines are not available, the food is atrocious for sick people who need good food to recover, TV services do not work with trouble receiving credits back, telephones by beds are expensive to ring with a 1 minute message before talking to the patient. Car park costs are expensive and some machines do not give change with disparities between machines at different hospitals within the same city. Some mentally ill patients allowed to wander into all female rooms. How we managed to afford our relative being in hospital and how we managed to concentrate on helping my parent get better with everything else to sort out is amazing.  Beds, food, costs needs sorting out to help our health care and the current wastage in this service needs looking into urgently.",
