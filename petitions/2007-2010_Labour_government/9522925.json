        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Petrol is currently taxed at 65.24% per litre, costing each person 65.24p in every \u00a31.00. As petrol prices ever increase globally the British tax payer is hit twice: firstly, by the global price rise and, secondly, by the 65% tax paid to the government on this global rise.  The UK tax payer also pays VAT on petrol AND on the fuel duty so the British taxpayer is actually hit three times, twice by tax and once by the global rises.  \n\nThe government are requested to cap the tax to only the first 100p paid per litre so that the current global price rises can have a smaller impact.  This would mean the UK tax payer never pays more then 65p per litre in tax, even when a litre of petrol costs more than 100p, which of course it now does.\n\nThis would mean that as the price at the pump increases above the 100p per litre price, the tax does not also increase.  Currently the government is benefiting from the global  oil price rise as for every 1p extra we pay, they charge tax of 0.65p.  We must stop this - the UK government is capitalising on a global oil crisis at the UK tax payers expense.",
