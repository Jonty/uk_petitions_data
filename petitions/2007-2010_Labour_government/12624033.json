            "background": "What real improvements has the \u201cprivatisation\u201d of many of Britains public services and assets had?\nIf the public still owned the various concerns that have been privatised, what would they be contributing or removing from the public balance sheet?\nThe performance of public services pre and post privatisation should be thoroughly reviewed, and an appraisal constructed as to what elements of \"improvement of service\" derive directly from \"privatisation\" and what improvement has come from decreasing service levels and worldwide innovations in the technologies used to deliver those services.\nIt has become accepted practise in neo-liberal marketplaces that \"privatisation\" and \"liberalisation\" of markets such as energy, telecommunications and transport is the right thing to do. Recently, the doctrine of neo-liberal economics has been widely challenged by the economic crisis, and as such, it would seem timely to review processes, procedures and practises that stem from that particular ideology.",
