            "background": "As Zimbabwe is one of the former british colonies iam am starting to get frustrated and annoyed that we are just letting Mugabe swan about hurting his people and sometimes even killing them all for just because they voted against him. Not only this average age in the country has dropped from 70 or just above to about 33, most of the country is starving and inflation is about 100 000%. People in Zimbabwe need are countrys help and at the current time we are just sitting back and admiring the way he is managing to put his country level on par with other 3rd world countrys. Once completing the job, leave the country independent but leave some soldiers in around the country so it does not become like this again.",
