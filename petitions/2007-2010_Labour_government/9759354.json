            "background": "Brian Clough (1935 - 2004) deserves to be knigted for his services to football.\n\nHis numerous achievements, particularly as a Manager included 2 consecutive European Cups with Nottingham Forest. He will probably be best remembered for his achievements as a manager with Forest and Derby County. Very few managers will ever enjoy such succeses.\n\nIt's about time Cloughie's achievements were properly recognised and I see no reason why he shouldn't be awarded a Knighthood.",
