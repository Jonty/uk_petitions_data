Domestic pets should not be kept in unsuitable circumstances, which can border on cruelty.\nHaving a cat in Downing Street is just asking for trouble.\nQuite apart from the dangers for it in navigating central London traffic, some terrorist is going to try and infect it, implant something, or whatever. Or someone is going to kidnap it for ransom. Nothing good can come of it - plus think of the risk of causing allergic reactions in foreign heads of government.\nFor the sake of Sybil, Humphrey, and the rest, spare them the perils of Downing Street.",
