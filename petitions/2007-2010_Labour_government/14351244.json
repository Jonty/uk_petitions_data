            "background": "Winter fuel payments are at present guaranteed to those over the age of sixty.\nHowever there are many people out there who have long term chronic illnesses which means they often need their heating on for longer than normal but are afraid too because of the cost.  If a payment was guaranteed for \u00a3400 it would really lift the burden that we currently face.  At present I have to use several blankets to try and keep warm as I am worried about the heating bill and will only have the heating on a couple of times a day.  I implore the government to look into this and see that something gets done for us. If you get a means tested benefit it means you lose out and those on Job Seekers Allowance and the like can get all and everything.  The system needs to be fairer to the disabled people of this country.",
