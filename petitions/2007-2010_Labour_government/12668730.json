            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Under legislation bought in under the tax regime introduced in April 2006 if a member of a pension scheme is suffering from serious ill-health then, provided certain conditions are met, the scheme administrator may commute any pension entitlement that member holds under the scheme and pay the member their entire benefit entitlement under an arrangement as a lump sum. This is referred to in the legislation as a serious ill-health lump sum. \nAFPS75 does not have any provision within the scheme rules to pay out a Serious Illness Lump Sum, and as it is a scheme approved under royal warrant it does not need to adhere to, or adopt HMRC tax rules.\nI believe that this is discriminatory to to service personnel and that the scheme should adopt the rules.",
