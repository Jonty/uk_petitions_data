            "background": "Employer national insurance contributions have long since lost any meaning and are simply a tax raising measure that places additional costs on businesses.  Instead, as high levels of employment are generally \"a good thing\", the government should introduce a permanent mechanism that rewards employers for taking on and retaining staff, such as a business tax credit.  If the government still needs to collect the same amount of tax from businesses, it can make further changes to corporation tax which targets those businesses that have the ability to pay.",
