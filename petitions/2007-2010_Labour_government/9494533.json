            "background": "Sounds obvious, doesn't it? This is what doesn't happen when an adult is bitten. Next time it may be a child; and the act of going to court may make an irresponsible owner realise the seriousness of the situation in a way that a slap on the wrist caution may not. Many Councils/police forces are still abiding by the abolished rule that first offences do not count and a dog must have had 'previous' before they will consider any further action (including a Formal Caution). However District Councils and Police Force computers do not talk to one another, so where a dog owner has been cautioned under one system it doesn't show on the other organisation's computer, meaning that it willnot be taken into account!",
