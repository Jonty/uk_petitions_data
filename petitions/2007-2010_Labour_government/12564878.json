            "background": "It is petitioned that the Prime Minister should establish a Ministerial Housing Association to provide managed accommodation for ministers, thereby abolishing the need for a second home allowances. As a Housing Officer having worked in Associations and Local Authorities alike, I believe this is a possible and necessary reform in order to stop MP's and Ministers spending massive amounts of tax payers money on this appalling addiction. In 1911 people became MP's and Ministers in order to change our society for the better, now they do it for the money. The average Cabinate Minister earns \u00a3141,866 and MP average salary is \u00a364,766. These people are our elected representatives, whose pay is supposed to reflect the mean average of our society. This is not the case.",
