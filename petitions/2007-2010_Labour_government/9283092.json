It is both disgusting and distressing. There may be a warning at the start of the program, but does a child take note of such things? Most children like doing things they aren't allowed to, so this will probably encourage them to watch it. Also, what if they decide to try it out at home? To see if cutting open the dog will provide the same shelter as a camel in the sahara? This program should either be scheduled later, or not at all!",
