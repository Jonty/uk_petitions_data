        "background": "Only the employed can take advantage of Childcare vouchers. I believe this is completely unfair to the self employed, when many could not work without placing children in childcare. The self employed pay tax and National Insurance and many even charge VAT for their services.\nThere is no logical reason why the self employed should not benefit from Childcare vouchers.\nWhilst the self employed can claim child tax credits if they earn under the threshold, it is a difficult system to use and is completely unsuitable to those whose earnings fluctuate throughout the year and from year to year.\nTo the contrary, if the self employed were able to utilise childcare voucher scheme the tax and national insurance savings can be simply worked out at the time of filing the year\u2019s tax return. Often it would be worked out by the person/accountant filing a self assessment so there is little or no added administration for the government.\nEnd this unfairness. Give the self employed parity with employees.",
