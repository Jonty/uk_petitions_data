            "background": "Me petition is regarding cervical cancer. I really think that the age needs to be lowered from the age of 25 to 18. I have done research and alot of the causes for cervical cancer is due to things alot of younger and younger girls are doing today, so why have you made the age to be called in for a smear test so much older? I had a smeard test at the end of last year because i was having so much problems and it came back that i have got abnormal cells and that i need further treatment, i was 22 when i had that test and if it wasnt for the problems i was having.... i wouldn't have had that test until i was 25! how much more worse might it have got? I also saw a story of a girl that died of cervical cancer and she was just 21, there was still 4 years to go until she would have had that test but if she was given a smear at 18 she may have lived. I just really cant understand why the age is 25, there is the injection that is being offered to school girls to prevent it but alot of parents are not letting their children have it as they seem to think it will encourage them to have sex younger. Please please lower the age as it is taking to much of a risk for so many women.",
