            "background": "Self service express tills are appearing in a variety of stores from supermarkets to DIY stores.  This is riduculous as it is reducing the number of jobs available to the British work force and prevents inter human interaction. In addition it reduces the overheads of the money grabbing corporations and increases their profits.  A ban should be put on these checkouts or the price of products should be reduced to re-imburse the consumer for serving themselves.",
