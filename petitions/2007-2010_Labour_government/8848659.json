            "background": "The problem with the current parking enforcement companies is that they \"review\" tickets issued by their company and decide whether to enforce it or not.\n\nI believe that this is somewhat onesided as it cannot be truely independant and think that this could be reviewed by a nationally independant review board.  This board would only cover private parking firms and give the individual a fair and independant hearing",
