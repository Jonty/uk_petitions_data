        "background": "This is another example of government trying to micro-manage peoples lives. The current \"Health and Safety\" culture is repressive and intrusive. Far more benefit would be had from investing in periodic re-testing and improving the standard of driving. There are many roads where the national speed limit is inappropriate but when the \"End of speed limit\" signs were first introduced they meant just that, it was only later that there was a speed limit assigned to them. The motorist was then left to drive at the speed appropriate to the road. Give the average motorist the credit for some common sense and let them judge what is appropriate and stop trying to control every aspect of behaviour. Rules only control the people who wern't the problem in the first place, those who are the problem will probably ignore them anyway.",
