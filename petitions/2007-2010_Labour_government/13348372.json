            "background": "AS you may be aware it seems that there is a constant lobbying of opposition to money managers and in particular hedge funds and private equity firms. Thus triggering a extensive regulatory overhaul from the EU.\n\nIn my belief this is simply a matter of London in particular being targeted. Lets be frank here, hedge funds have been a target to increase transparency. Many in the industry will tell you that investor demand alone is ensuring this. Another key topic is leverage again another key aspect of risk management which investors ensure is always carefully managed.\n\nThis industry did not receive any government bailout, a few ponzi schemes besides and we have a thriving sector in which London benefits heavily. \n\nNot to mention the tax and employment the industry creates.\n\nI would like the prime minister to simply keep regulation as it stands or adopt key individuals in this area to propose new regulation. The managers themselves not Paris or Brussels.",
