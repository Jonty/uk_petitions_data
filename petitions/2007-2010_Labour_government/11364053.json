            "background": "Why spend money issuing cards -why not just link it to a national insurance number (or a national ID number)?\n\nThe benefits of the ID card are in improved security so reduced identity theft. ANY PHYSICAL CARD TECHNOLOGY CAN BE CLONED - eventually it will be hacked and copied. With an ID number, all the technology (biometrics etc) would be on the government side.\n\nSo how would it work? Say a police officer wants to confirm your identity. They can ask you for your name, address, NI number - tap that into their PDA, receive back from a central server your picture, iris scan?, finger print? etc etc? Then if further confirmation is needed (if you don't look quite like your picture), your fingerprint/iris could be scanned there and compared with whats on file.\n\nThere would be no politically sensitive introduction phase where the whole country is upset at paying \u00a380 each - you could set this up TODAY with initial security checking by confirming address or mothers maiden name.",
