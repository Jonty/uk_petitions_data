            "background": "Street gangs, anit-social behaviors are serious issues in the current Britain and they are threatening the overall stability and future productivity growth of the country. It is a work that involves everybody such as the governement, police forces, and particularly every parents. Parents have the duty to discipline their children and to discourage them joining gangs or doing harm to the society.\n\nI am proposing the government should create a new tax credit that for every tax year, \u00a32000 tax credit should be given to those parents whose children (under 18) have not had any criminal/civil charges, or arrests by the police. This ia a tax incentive to encourage more parents to discipline their children.",
