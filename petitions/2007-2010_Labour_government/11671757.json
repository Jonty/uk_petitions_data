            "background": "The present violence is the direct consequence of the Israeli blockade of Gaza.  This stops food and medical supplies, and all external trade.  Israel has NO rights over Gaza\u2019s sea frontier; attacks on Gazan shipping are piracy. \n\nUK government should, as humanitarian aid, build a secure port for Gaza.  It would be under UNRWA control, with an international customs force, to prevent arms smuggling.  This would reassure Israelis, and allow Gazans to earn a living by trade.  Other Arabs and Muslims could support Gazans by creating export processing industries around the port.  \n\nThe cost might be around \u00a3300m, plus ongoing dredging of the approach channel.  The payoff would be large.\n\nThis action would demonstrate that the UK regards Gazans as human beings, not just as terrorists.  It would transform the situation in Gaza, by giving people a window to the world outside.  It would also radically change Muslim and Arab perceptions of the UK, and cut the risk of terrorist attacks here.",
