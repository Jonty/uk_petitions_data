            "background": "The policy of stripping the rain forests of Borneo by both the Malaysian and Indonesian governments is leading to the destruction not only of the habitat of the Penan people who live there, but also that of the Orang Utan, which will soon join the extinct species list unless we are very careful. This logging is sanctioned by both governments and contracted to companies whose methods of dealing with objectors are pure thuggery! This must be stopped. The increase in planting Palm Oil in no way makes up for the environmental catastrophe that is the loss of the rain forest which government greed has sanctioned.",
