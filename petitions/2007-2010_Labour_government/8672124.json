        "background": "The first reading for Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill is tabled for today (22nd Feb 08) in the house of commons. It is expected to get a second reading thanks to cross-party backbench support. However more governmental support will be required if the bill is to progress any further past this second reading.  The bill aims to reform temporary contracts and create a fair employment environment for all employees, thus stopping the abuse of temporary contracts by employers seeking to avoid their responsibility and duty of care for the well-being of their employees. We the undersigned petition our government to support this bill in its entirety, showing solidarity with the individual worker and a determination to give all workers equal, and unavoidable, rights.",
