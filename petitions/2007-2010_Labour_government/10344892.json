            "background": "Much press coverage has been given to the granting of a State funeral for Margaret Thatcher.  Whilst the death of any person is tragic it is shocking that the State should consider spending \u00a33 million on the funeral of a woman who divided British society and whose divisions continue to plague those worst affected by her policies.  She once stated that 'there is no such thing as society'.  Why should we as a society, a concept she declared no belief in, fund her funeral?  Not with my taxes please Mr Brown - we have enough financial hardship as it is without wasting money on an event which will divide the British people.",
