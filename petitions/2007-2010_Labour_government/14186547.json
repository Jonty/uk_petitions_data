            "background": "Councils have a duty to enforce regulations relating to the underage sale of tobacco, alcohol and fireworks. \n\nThe only practical way to detect illegal sales is by underage test purchases or by observation of shops, both of which methods have been used for decades. \n\nNow, following the implementation of the Human Rights Act these methods require RIPA authorisation. \n\nIf Councils are removed from the the RIPA regime they will no longer be able to use these tools and will no longer be able to comply with their duty of enforcement.\n\nTo impose a duty and then hinder performance of it would be grossly unfair.",
