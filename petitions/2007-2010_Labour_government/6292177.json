        "background": "The Nordic countries, and especially Denmark have achieved great levels of prosperity and development whilst maintaining social order and respect. They also have world-class public services, even if these do come at an admittedly high price in taxes. In short, I am proposing greater government intervention and a u-turn from unchecked capitalist/western/free-market approaches. In particular PPP's which dilute the Governments influence in the critical regions of health & education (ceding control to unelected bodies), and needless privatisation which is not always in the consumers best interest as is so often suggested. We should all just cough-up the cash and pay for public services in a responsible manner, to prove we are a civilised and caring nation.",
