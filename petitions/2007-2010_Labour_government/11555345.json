            "background": "Stop criminalising street artists by allowing these talented and artistic individuals to legally paint/decorate telecommunication boxes on the public highway.\nCertain Local Authorities run adoption schemes, in conjunction with communication companies, where residence can \u2018adopt a box\u2019 and keep it free from \u2018vandalism\u2019 by painting it green.\nWhy not allow street artists to \u2018adopt a box\u2019? Giving artists a legal, positive and creative outlet for their talents whilst transforming bland, utilitarian objects in our ever increasingly homogenised and commercial urban areas into beautiful works of art.\nWith crime increasing amongst young people this would offer disenfranchised youth a constructive opportunity to contribute to their environment whilst giving them a real sense of belonging.",
