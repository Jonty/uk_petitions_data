            "background": "I have recently heard about many foreigners who are currenly working/living in the UK who are claiming benefits and tax credits to support not only themselves here in the UK but also for their families living in other countries. I believe that benefits should only be availiable to support people currently resident in the UK. Foreign families living in a different country should apply for benefits from their own government.\n\nOf course British citizens who are currently working abroad for a UK organisation (e.g. the Army) should still be entitled to benefits etc. the same as they would be if they were still resident in the UK.",
