        "background": "I have been speaking with a group on Facebook who have encouraged me to create a petition for the Prime Minsister to understand how angry the British people are with all the illegal immigration, the way our towns and cities are being taken over, and how we as a Christian Nation have to hide our faith, take away Religious icons to avoid upsetting the muslims, yet we have huge Mosques built that dominate towns or cities. Thats ok tho!\n\nWe were born here, we pay our outrageous taxes and bills to live here, so why do we not have the right to keep what is ours. Why does the PM or other leaders not see this. Other countries are laughing at us. France sends them here, they keep their country theirs.... whats happened to us?  My Family have died fighting for this country- is it not a kick in the teeth?",
