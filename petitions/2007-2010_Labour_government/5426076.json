            "background": "North Weald Airfield has, for many years, been the subject of speculation with regard to its future. Various plans have been put forward including a waste incineration plant, lorry park and a holding centre for asylum seekers. However the main threat has always been that of the housing developer's bulldozer. The airfield is in the ownership of Epping Forest District Council and, although officially a Metropolitan Greenbelt Site (it is not currently a brownfield site!) it would fetch a high price if sold for housing development. In fact, plans are afoot to change it's status to \"brownfield\" to smooth the path to re-development.",
