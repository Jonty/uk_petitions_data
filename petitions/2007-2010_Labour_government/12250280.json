Because Birmingham only has a 'Right Worshipful' Lord Mayors, Brum is kept down in the first division. \n\nLord Mayors are ceremonial and symbolic. However, Birmingham is the second city of the UK and furthermore, through its regeneration, the people of Birmingham aspire for their city to be equal to any in the United Kingdom or beyond. \n\nSo Prime Minister, give the Lord Mayor of Brum 'Right Honourable' status.",
