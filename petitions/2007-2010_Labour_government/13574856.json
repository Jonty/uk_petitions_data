We were established in 1973 and have grown over the years not only in size but also in the range and amount of care services available for local people.\n\nOur consultant led multi-disciplinary clinical team provide specialist palliative care* for people facing cancer and other life-limiting illnesses; and help and support for their families and carers.\n\nWe do not charge for the care and help we provide, we rely on voluntary donations and some statutory funding to meet our running and development costs.\n\nHowever, due to the credit crunch,the charity is running short of cash and Stoke on Trent City Council is looking to spend cash on getting new found gold into the local Museum. We need SOTCC to donate money to the DMH",
