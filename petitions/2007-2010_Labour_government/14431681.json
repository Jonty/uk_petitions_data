        "background": "We feel that cyclists the law is not as clear as it could be on the matter of cyclists either commuting or training on roads. We therefore feel that in order to clear this matter up that cyclists should be given priority over motorised vehicles so that it is clear to other road users that should they not give cyclists the room and care they deserve, something that is quite often given to horses or children walking, they can be prosecuted for any injury caused.",
