            "background": "The 40p a mile rate for the first 10,000 miles travelled on work related travel has been in place for a number of years now.  When it was originally introduced it was intended to cover the cost of running the car: not just the fuel costs but also the maintenance, tax and insurance of a private vehicle used for work. Over the last few years and, more significantly over the last few months, fuel costs have escalated and this means that we are fast approaching the point where the 40p rate won't even cover the cost of diesel for a journey never mind the cost of servicing, tax and insurance.This rate urgently needs reviewing and increasing to keep it in line with it's original purpose.",
