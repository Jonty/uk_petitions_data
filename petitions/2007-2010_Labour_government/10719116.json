            "background": "We recently remortgaged our house and as part of the legal fees we were told that we would have to pay \u00a3145.00 for a Voluntary Transfer Indemnity Policy which protects the new mortgage lender. \n\nThe policy is meant to protect the new mortgage lender in the event that, if my wife and I go bankrupt and any other parties have a stake in our house, the other parties' share is paid out by the insurance policy and the new mortgage lender gets our house.\n\nThis policy is misleading as it turns out it is not \"Voluntary\" at all. We are not allowed to cancel the \u00a3145.00 payment as our new mortgage would not be accepted. Furthermore it is also unnecesary as my wife and I are the sole owners of our house and no one else has any share/stake in it.\n\nIn any other industry, this would be classed as false advertising or at least misleading the public. This policy should be taken out by the mortgage lender and paid for by the mortgage lender.",
