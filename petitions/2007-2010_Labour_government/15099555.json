        "background": "The Children's Commissioner for England Dr Maggie Atkinson has asked for the age of responsibility to be raised from 10 to 12 and is quoted as saying \"My constant song is listen to the children and young people\". Dr Atkinson has demonstrated that she does not understand the fact that children do understand responsibility at a young age and should answer for their crimes in an appropriate manner, including incarseration in cases like the James Bulger case. Dr Atkinson has stated that too much weight is given to victims and that victims need less consideration than at present, this we believe to be irresponsible and wrong.",
