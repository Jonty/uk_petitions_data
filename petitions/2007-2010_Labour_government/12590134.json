By retaining these items on a system, which is usually used for \"controlled drugs\", means that the manufacturers of these products do not have to  \njustify their exorbitant prices. \n\nGluten Free flour products are not a controlled drug and should not be treated as such.  \n\nPeople should be able to buy Gluten Free products at a proper \"market value\" price.",
