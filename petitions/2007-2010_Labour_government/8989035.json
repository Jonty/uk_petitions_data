            "background": "Can the government please make budgeting skills mandatory for mortgage and large loan applicants?  Not everyone knows how to properly budget, it may be common sense but for some it seams disinteresting or an alien concept to others who may be at risk of defaulting. For some the struggle to survive financially does not allow them to see anything else but the struggle. If consumers are entering into a mortgage agreement or borrowing large sums of money, they should prove that they have budgeted effectively. Cheap credit has seen us adopt bad budgeting habits, which could worsen the economy if not dealt with in this current environment of the 'credit crunch'. We propose the Government provides more support for mortgage customers in terms of budgeting/managing finances in addition to the current strategies. This could save more homes from repossession and allow additional consumer confidence in the housing market.",
