            "background": "Rather than offer tax relief for winter fuel payments - the companies offering fuel should be investigated as to why none of them are dropping prices despite the lack of storage facility and the fact we were told gas and electric were linked to fuel prices when they were increased.\n\nRecent Fuel Prices : \nUS light sweet crude fell to $50.20 a barrel. The price of oil is around two-thirds cheaper than in July, when it hit a record above $147 a barrel. \n\nNone will drop prices because they know a price war will impact their profits.\n\nThis requires government intervention.",
