            "background": "My idea is simple scrap tv licensing, let the bbc go commercial. They just seem to be annoying people with how much their presenters are paid. And for a non commercial channel there seems to be adverts in between the shows showing what they are showing lasting a good 1-3 minutes, also they are not only advertising on the channels but they are advertising on the street on the side of buses, then passing the expense onto us as the licensing keeps on increasing. And the shows seem to be getting worse.\n\nAlso more advantages of this would be there would be less time wasted in the courts over people not paying their licence causing more grief. I\u2019m not to sure if you go to jail for not paying your tv licence but if you did that would free up some space in the over populated prisons. Plus with the \"credit crunch\" that extra money would help.\nyours sincerly\nMatthew age 17",
