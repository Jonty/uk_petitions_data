        "background": "The childrens A&E department and maternity units have been closed at Southport Hospital and moved to Ormskirk hospital. The traffic from Southport to Ormskirk is horrendous at normal times and gridlocked at peak times including bank holidays. Children have been born on road sides through being stuck in traffic and it wont be long before a child dies. Southport has all the facilities needed, it has more residents than Ormskirk and plenty more roads in to the hospital.\nThe services were taken away to cut costs and we want them back.",
