            "background": "In order to increase the safety of cyclists by making other vehicle drivers more aware of their needs and vulnerabilities, I would like the car driving test to include an element of cycle-training.  \n\nMany car and other vehicle drivers have no experience of cycling on the road, and have not therefore developed the habit of taking extra care in looking out for, and allowing adequate road-space to cyclists.  I suggest therefore that on-road cycling training, such as the government's Bikeability scheme, should be made a compulsory part of passing the car driving test.",
