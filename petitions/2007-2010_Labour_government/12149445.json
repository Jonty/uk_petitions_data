            "background": "Noah\u2019s Ark Zoo Farm (NAZF) is a zoo just outside Bristol that markets itself to schools and is heavily focused on child education.\n\nHowever, instead of teaching well-established science, it promotes creationism.\n\nThe literature displayed at the zoo is hostile to Darwin and his theories and attempts to debunk techniques such as radio carbon dating and interpretation of the fossil record.\n\nMuch of this literature - which is presented as fact - contradicts science on the national curriculum, thereby actively damaging a child\u2019s education.  This can be evidenced on their website; however, this is much diluted compared the ardent creationist material on display at the zoo.\n\nNAZF also uses the VisitBritian logo to market the zoo.\n\nThe stated aim of VisitBritain (Britain's national tourism agency) is to market Britain worldwide and to develop England's visitor economy.\n\nBy promoting the NAZF, with its creationist agenda and harmful educational materials, VisitBritian is damaging the reputation of the United Kingdom.",
