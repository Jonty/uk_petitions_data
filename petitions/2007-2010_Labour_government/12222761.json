            "background": "The current punishment(s) for Paedophiles in this day and age is completely inadequate.  A paedophile can be released within months of a jail sentence being issued. The current system needs to be reviews urgently.  The children are our future and I think it is time that we protected them.  Paedophiles do not change. They may develop an ability to control their behaviour or, more likely, conceal it, but are always a risk to children. It is as unfair to them to place them in a position of temptation once released as it is to dangerous.",
