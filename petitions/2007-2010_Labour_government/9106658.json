        "background": "Wales has free prescriptions; Scotland (at the time of writing) has reduced prescription charges and plans to abolish them by 2011 with 90% already given for free; England is faced with higher and higher charges year upon year. Why should ill patients who live a mile from the Welsh or Scottish border be forced to pay while their neighbours enjoy free or soon-to-be-free prescriptions? Why should England be forced to subsidise costs? Free for all, or free for none.",
