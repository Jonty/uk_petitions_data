            "background": "I and my friends are passionate skaters. We have a local shop for our equipment and our only skatepark closed a long time ago. due to this we can only skate on the street. we understand people do not like this but there is nowhere to go. i feel by building a park for sports such as skateboarding, rollerblading and bmx riding could aid to reduce the number of youths in the street.\nDoes anyone feel we have the right to skate in a zone where we are comphortable, we have what we need to do our tricks and we are not in the way of people trying to go about their business.\nregardless of whether you skate or not do you not agree it is needed?\nif so please sign my petition",
