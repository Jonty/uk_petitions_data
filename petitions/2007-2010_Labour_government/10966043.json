            "background": "We the undersigned are seriously concerned about the future of HM Revenue & Customs offices in Motherwell, Hamilton and Coatbridge in Lanarkshire.  The proposals to close these offices will mean that the people served by them will be left without access to the services they currently provide.  We are also concerned about the likelihood of staff in these offices being able to find alternative suitable work within the local area, and the effects this will have on them and their families.  We support PCS in their campaign to keep H M Revenue and Customs offices open.",
