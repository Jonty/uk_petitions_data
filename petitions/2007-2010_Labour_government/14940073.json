        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The ill thought out 2007 ELQ legislation removed government funding for courses of an equal or lower level than one you already have.  In practice, that makes the cost of retraining for a job in a new field the same as that for overseas students and unobtainable for all but the richest. As, on average, people change careers 3-4 times throughout their working life, this could impact almost everyone at some point.\n\nThe legislation has only been in place one full year and already courses are showing reduced uptake and already motivated and hard-working people are loosing valuable opportunities and being trapped in jobs that do not make use of their full potential and that they do not enjoy.\n\nMost insidious is the way this punishes people, such as new parents, who have been out of work for some time and may need top-up training.  It also disproportionately hurts those who have already achieved a high level of qualification, wasting a pool of tremendous talent and making such qualifications less desirable.\n\nThis silly rule holds back our country's brightest stars: exactly the people we should be encouraging to go further than ever before.",
