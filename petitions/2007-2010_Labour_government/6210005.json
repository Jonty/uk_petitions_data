            "background": "The Kilburn State is under threat from developers!\n\nWhen it opened in 1937, The Kilburn State -- a Grade II* listed building -- was the biggest auditorium in Europe, with seating for 4,004 people. Since then, The State has played host to a galaxy of stars -- The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Marilyn Monroe, David Bowie, Louis Armstrong, Sarah Vaughan, George Formby, Deep Purple, and many many more. And for the past 20 years, The State has been run by Mecca Bingo. \n\nBut now Mecca is selling up. The State is closing, and its future is in the balance.\n\nAn application to turn The State into a live music venue has hit a snag... and property developers have pounced. There's a danger that these developers will deliberately allow the The State decay, and then, when it is beyond repair, tear it down to build flats.\n\nWe the undersigned call on our elected representatives to make sure that the Kilburn State is returned to its former glory as a vibrant cultural centre in the heart of London.",
