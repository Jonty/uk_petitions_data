            "background": "We the undersigned object to the development project known as the \"Wimpey Ouseburn Gateway Scheme\" at the proposed address -- Land At The Confluence Of The Rivers Tyne And Ouseburn To The East Of Mariners Wharf, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne And Wear -- as this will have a detrimental effect on the surrounding area, and in particular, a damaging effect on the view from the Free Trade Inn pub which is a popular local landmark and vantage point for the Tall Ships event. The government has stressed the urgent need for environmentally friendly and affordable housing, this development would not fulfil either quota and would also act as a visual barrier between communities rather than bringing them together. We the undersigned also feel that if planning permission were granted for this development, it would set a precedent for further unnecessary devlopment in the future.",
