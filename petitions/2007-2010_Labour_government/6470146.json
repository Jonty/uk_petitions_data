            "background": "The government needs to realise that when court orders are granted, forcing children into situations they cannot psychologically cope with (or that cause friction between the biological parents that encompass the child) that these damaged children influence and damage other children from stable backgrounds-mainly at school. My children are unrecognisable after a day at school. More children are being home educated because they are failed by schools addressing issues that often arise from court orders or CSA pressures. Morality also needs to be re-introduced in schools. All children have a right to a happy childhood and education. This need is, I believe, greater than needing to have two unhappy parents in their lives.",
