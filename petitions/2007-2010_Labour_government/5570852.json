            "background": "Southern England is geologicaly impoverished without 1000m plus mountainous uplands. The petition is for a joint public works/PFI programme to elevate parts of Dartmoor by increasing the height of some tors from material adjacent to at heighest point at least 1 metre more than Snowdon, and a project (longer term) to reach 1 mile and outrank Ben Nevis. Benefits - adjacent excavations provide large fresh water reservoirs & sports potential. Skiiing. Moutaineering. Canary Island collapse tsunami refuge. Bodmin and Exmoor would also benefit from more modest uplift in the future. Technological knowledge enhanced from developing magma drilling techniques (controlled volcanic eruption to provide additional material), large scale earth moving with potential gains in knowledge for rebuilding Norfolk, which will come in handy. Geothermal power stations.",
