            "action": "both preserve our vulnerable coastline and to create a large and effective renewable energy source by building outer sea walls, creating lagoons. Each outer sea wall would contain a number of electricity generating turbines. The outer sea walls would effectively be tidal barrages, but without blocking access to rivers. Tidal power is guaranteed to be reliable whereas wind is not. Nuclear power is not safe and there is the problem of disposing of the waste which can remain dangerous for thousands of years. Coal, gas and oil will not last forever. The outer sea walls could be built in areas were coastal erosion is a serious problem as they would give protection.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "These outer sea walls could be built hundreds of yards or even miles out to sea at their furthest point from land. They could be virtually any size or shape, straight across the mouth of a bay, or a semi-circle along a straightish section of coast.\nThe outer sea walls could be constructed the same way as the Mulberry Harbours were in Normandy in 1944, by floating large prefabricated reinforced concrete boxes into place and then sinking them. When in place they could be filled with rubble and large rocks could be sunk on the seaward and inner sides to give extra protection.",
