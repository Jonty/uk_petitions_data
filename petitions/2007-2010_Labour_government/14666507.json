            "background": "Today I become the voice of my 9 yr old son diagnosed with Aspergers. \nSince he was diagnosed over 1 year ago his primary school has refused any extra support, services or even a SEN assessment. Reason they say his to clever. Suffering with a social communication disorder with added sensory issues I feel help is needed. He has been excluded for not following instructions and once back he is excluded from lunch breaks as staff can't handle him. I will have to collect and take him home everyday for 1 hr. Help!\nHe has special educational needs and a statement is his only way forward in mainstream school.\nHe is who he is and he should not be punished for this.",
