        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Please make it a nationwide law that any motorists caught using their mobile phones whilst driving have the option to, face court & receive points & a possible ban or to go on a drive tech course called 'Call Divert'. At this time of recession, the last thing self employed drivers need is to be banned or points adding to their licences.  I agree there are some drivers who are just careless & take liberties but there are some who's income & families depend on every call, on the move or sitting still in traffic. Call Divert is only available in some police boroughs, this is unfair.  It should be made available to all drivers, nationwide. If drivers can be shown the error of their ways properly via a class & video surely that would be more acceptable than banning or building up points on thousands of licences.  Times are already hard enough  & expensive enough. I ask that you take this as a serious subject for discussion & consideration.",
