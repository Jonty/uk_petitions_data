            "background": "The Rottweiler faces being dumped on the banned dogs list. This is being brought about by irrisponsible ownership, media hatemongering and an ignorant, narrowminded and fearful public. The Rottweiler was bred not to kill outright but to protect butchers moving livestock from their hometowns to markets. It was bred to be powerful to be able to protect the butchers and their livestock, but was bred to be gentle and loyal when trained in the proper manner. This is another breed that should not be placed on the banned dog list purely becuase of public ignorance and irrisponsible thugs. Thugs I might hasten to add who will simply find another breed as soon as the Rottweiler is outlawed. Please, save the Rottweiler in the UK and sign this petition.",
