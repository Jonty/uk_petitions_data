            "background": "Present Government \u201cclimate change\u201d policy, based on CO2 driven warming is likely to make massive changes to our way of life. Energy prices will rise, and there is likely to be a shortfall in supply. The knock on effect will negatively impact personal lives, industry, and environment\n\nTens of thousands of scientists dispute the CO2 driven climate change model. There is no consensus, and scientific history proves the majority is not always right!\n\nThe momentum of the \u201cclimate change\u201d juggernaut is almost unstoppable. It will take a courageous Prime Minister to  ignore the zealots, and re-assess the evidence, but it\u2019s the right thing to do!\n\nA lot of ordinary (non demonstrating) people are seriously concerned about the consequences of current climate related policy. In a financially impoverished country it cannot be right to encumber the country with massive further debt following dubious evidence! There is no imminent \u201ctipping point\u201d that the alarmists will have you believe. If current \u201cwarming\u201d theory follows the 70\u2019s \u201ccooling\u201d into the trashcan, history (and the electorate) will judge this Government harshly indeed!",
