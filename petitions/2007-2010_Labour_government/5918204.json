BS 8601 and associated International (ISO-8601), European and US standards, now mandate use of YYYY-MM-DD as a globally accepted standard for the numerical representation of dates.\n\nThe Govt, as a representative of \u201cThe Working Party on Facilitation of International Trade Procedures\u201c signed a recommendation in 1988, \u201cthat Governments and international organizations accept and use, and promote the general acceptance of (ISO-8601) for expressing dates, whenever these data are to be used in international trade.\u201d This petition, seeks to extend such recommendation to all UK Government business, including use in eGovt and its interface to the public.\n\nWith the proliferation of the Internet, increased exposure to the conflicting 'legacy' date formats will continue to cause confusion unless governments act to standardise. Our govt is in a position to take a lead.",
