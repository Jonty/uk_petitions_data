            "background": "We the undersigned request that the Prime Minister intervene to see that funding is restored to the Metropolitan Police's Human Trafficking Team.  We believe that preventing human beings being sold into slavery, often of a sexual nature should be an absolute priority, and condemn the decision to slash the units funding and wind it up, and we believe that whilst a large amount of money, the several million pounds needed to run the unit is an insignificant sum when compared to the full state budget.   In the UK, in the 21st century no-one should be sold into slavery, least of all into sexual slavery, we therefore call upon the government to re-prioritise this issue and properly fund the team for as long as it remains necessary.",
