        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Disabled people have been forced to watch able-bodied people park in disabled parking bays for many years now with impunity; even the police turn a blind eye to this abuse and even carry out this abuse them self\u2019s.\n We want the law to protect disabled peoples rights to go shopping in the knowledge that they can park in spaces provided for them. And that the penalties for those parking in disabled bays should be inline with other parking laws and offences of this country\n, We are also asking that the police carry out there duty to enforce the laws of fraud against motorists who use a blue badge illegally, by using the new equipment supplied to them, and not allowing them to pass this duty over to traffic wardens or police wardens as some forces are now doing, as those bodies do not have the power of arrest.\nParking is a big problem for every one and we appreciate that, but for the disabled it means they can carry on a normal life, just like any able bodied person can\n. We demand the Prime Minister ensures the police enforce the laws on fraud against those who use the blue badges illegally, and bring in new laws protecting disabled parking bays, both on private and public land.",
