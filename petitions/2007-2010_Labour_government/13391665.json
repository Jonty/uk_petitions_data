        "background": "An English couple have been arrested for expressing their views on Christianity and  Islam, yet Muslim fanatics are seen to wave hate placards on the streets of Britain and no such action is taken. Expressing beliefs and expressing hatred are two different things. Any form of extremism, perpetrated by any person, should be treated equally. This is a Christian country first and foremost and indigenous people must not suffer for expressing personal beliefs that were not based on hatred or racism, whilst Muslim cleric hate-mongers are allowed free rein to peddle hatred on our streets.",
