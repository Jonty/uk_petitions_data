Expressing beliefs and expressing hatred are two different things. Any form of extremism, perpetrated by any person, should be treated equally. This is a Christian country first and foremost and indigenous people must not suffer for expressing personal beliefs that were not based on hatred or racism, whilst Muslim cleric hate-mongers are allowed free rein to peddle hatred on our streets.",
