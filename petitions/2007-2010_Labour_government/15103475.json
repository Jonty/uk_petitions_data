            "background": "The law is neccesary to protect the citizens of a given society from those who wish to undermine it.\n\nSo why, in the context of the plain human instinct to defend your home, family and life - does it repetedly favor those who were breaking the law in the first place and presenting themselves as an agressor in someones private property where they should feel safe?\n\nThe decent citizens of this country need to know the law is on their side, not the criminals who see this ridiculous predisposition in the law as the go ahead to break into peoples home's and businesses.\n\nMr Primeminister, we propose that by changing the law to reflect the ever increasing need for people to feel safe in their own home will go toward restoring some faith in a govenment that many feel has sold them out.",
