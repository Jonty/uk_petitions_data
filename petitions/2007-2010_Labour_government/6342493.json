Some might argue that the country needs such people in our midst as they help create wealth for others. However, the only effect most of us have noticed is the inordinate height to which house prices have risen as a direct result of the super-rich invading the market. In London and the South-East, in particular, house prices have risen to the extent that young professionals such as teachers and university lecturers cannot afford to buy a house. If professional people cannot afford to buy houses, it\u2019s no wonder that prison officers, fire-fighters, nurses and other key workers cannot afford to make ends meet and buy a house. It\u2019s time this discrimination in favour of the rich, i.e. \u2018non-domicile\u2019 status, was abolished.",
