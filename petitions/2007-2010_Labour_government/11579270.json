            "background": "Meetings held at Bridgemary School in Gosport from 15 - 17th January were of little or no use. A lot of people are being badly affected by the work so far. A lot of people are having their privacy and security invaded. \n\nThere is also the environmental issue. We know of many animals that are being disturbed, frightened and confused. These include foxes, badgers, deers, shrews, voles, slow worms and sand lizards.\n\nAt the weekend, the meeting staff said planning permission had NOT been granted yet TODAY Gosport Borough Council have said that it has \"all been agreed by Hampshire County Council\". Whether that means ALL or just the work carried out so far was a grey area.\n\nDo you want to be kept in the dark? Do you want to lose our wildlife and our security? Are the actual workmen giving you cause for complaint?\n\nLet your voice be heard, please.",
