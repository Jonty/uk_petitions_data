            "background": "President Mbeki recently voiced the concern that \u2018NAFCOC [the National African Federal Chamber of Commerce and Industry] has to be actively involved in solving [the problems of small businesses], but are they? One gets the sense that they do not [even] exist.\u20195 There is little evidence of any impact on improving the business climate made by organizations such as NAFCOC or even the Soweto Small Business Executive Council.6 While the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry may be committed to representing the interests of Soweto businesses, they do not have a strong organizational presence in the township. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to ensure that existing business organizations no longer fail to provide Soweto entrepreneurs with an effective voice, and follow up their commitments with action - by offering greater support to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).",
