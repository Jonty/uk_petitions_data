        "background": "If a parking ticket costs 40p per hour then the fine for any over stay should not exceed the cost. It should be proportional to the original cost. It is criminal that local authority's are allowed to issue fines of \u00a360.00 for a 5min overstay on a 40p parking bay.\nMost local authority's are now deliberately using these fines as a way of raising revenue and this should be stopped.",
