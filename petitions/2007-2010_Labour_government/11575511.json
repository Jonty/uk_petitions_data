Why should we (the public) bail out companies that are on the brink of colapse because they cant keep themselves in order. A lot of the public can no longer access credit as the banks have tightened thier lending criteria. If a member of the public is subject to a credit check which fails, why should they have to bail out a bank that is billions of pounds in debt and unlikely to see a return from lending?",
