I believe that there is no other way to curb this spate of violence. If people want to use a weapon, then stick them on the front line. When they finish the minimum sentance, then it's straight into learning a trade. No race, gender or religion should be exempt from this. If they choose to be violent then they choose to deal with the strict consequences of their actions.",
