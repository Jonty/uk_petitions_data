We are looking forward to having the greatest sportsmen and women compete on British soil.\nHowever, we feel that the 2012 logo does not reflect the vision nor image of our country we wish to project to the world.\nWe feel that the logo was accepted without due consultation and we insist that a new logo is commissioned.",
