            "background": "The OFT states that for sale boards can only be provided to property owners via estate agents. \n\nThis has led to owners creating their own boards which are often not as robust/attractive as might be provided to them by an Internet Property Advertiser - so why have the regulation there - a professionally produced board that is professionally put up, then removed and recycled when appropriate should be permitted.\n\nGuidelines about what can be displayed on a board and technical specifications would go much further and help the private seller to sell their property professionally.",
