            "background": "The licence for this drug was withdrawn because it was felt that it was used to overdose with, either deliberately or accidentally.  If someone is going to overdose, it can be done with any number of drugs.\nFor those suffering unremitting pain, whose only relief came from Co-Proxamol, this decision has been a disaster.  It is difficult to put into words the effect of constant pain, with the knowledge there is a drug that can significantly reduce it, but that it has been taken away from you with no alternative of equal value.\nIn fact, it would be easy to overdose with other drugs to try and get the relief from pain that is now denied.\nWe call on the government to show some compassion for the sufferers of arthritis and other conditions for whom the drug Co-Proxamol is the only relief.",
