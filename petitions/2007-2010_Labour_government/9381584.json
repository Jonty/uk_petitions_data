        "background": "The number of NHS places at Dentists in Cornwall is decreasing each year.  This has been an ongoing campaign by many of the Cornish MPs to get the Government to change the NHS Dental Contracts.  It has got to the stage now where it is proving more and more difficult for children, disabled, old age pensioners and those on benefit to see a NHS dentist, sometimes resulting in journeys in excess of 100 miles.  We, the undersigned, respectfully request the Prime Minister to re-assess the policy and increase the number of NHS dentists in Cornwall.",
