            "background": "Alan Turing was a pioneering figure in the history of computer science, a key contributor to breaking the Enigma code, and a leading figure in the fight against Nazism. Turing is a national hero, and it is only fitting that Turing has a monument in our nation\u2019s capital. As we come towards the 70th anniversary of the cracking of the Nazi Codes it would be a suitable memorial to the unity and the purpose of all free peoples in those dark days if Turing received a monument alongside other great heroes of the nation.",
