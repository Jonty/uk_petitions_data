        "background": "Lots of people in this world have allergies. LIFE threatening allergies. Me, I have a nut allergy, but there are many people in this world with other allergies as well. You may have seen on food wrappers things like MAY CONTAIN TRACES OF NUTS. That means that the food has no nuts in, but there is a risk of it having a trace in. It doesn't matter whether the risk of it having a trace in is 1%, or 99%, I still can't eat it. And that is what my petition is about. Preventing cross contamination in all the foods we can. It can be stopped, it's just a matter of someone who can be bothered to do it. Some of my previous experience is how I found out about my allergy. I ate ONE raison from a fruit cake, and I had an extreme allergic reaction. I should have gone to hospital (I was extremely lucky), but none of us knew what was happening to me at the time. Now I have to carry adrenaline injections with me everywhere I go. If I eat a nut, I start to swell up, including my throat, which could result in my breathing stopping. So that is what my petition is about. I want to make some change for allergy sufferers!",
