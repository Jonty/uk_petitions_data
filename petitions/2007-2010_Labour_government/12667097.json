            "background": "After the shameful pension pay outs to banking executives, while the \"shop floor\" workers receive little or no pay increases, we would like to see banker\u2019s top pay limited. The limit should be a multiple of the pay of an average worker\u2019s salary in any bank partially own by the government, so if the bank does well, everyone who works in the bank benefits. This would act as a limit to the greed that has infected executives at the top of the banking system and force those at the top to think twice before giving themselves a pay rise.",
