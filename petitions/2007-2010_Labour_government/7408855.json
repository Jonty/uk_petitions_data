            "background": "Our fuel prices are among some of the highest in the world.  Approximately 70% of the price of a litre of petrol is tax and this is unacceptable.  Motoring in the UK is already over taxed - motorists pay insurance premium tax when they insure their cars, road tax to drive them on the roads, tax when they buy cars, tax when they fuel them and tax on maintaining them.  We would like the government to make a reduction in fuel tax.",
