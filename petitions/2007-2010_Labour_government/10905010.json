            "background": "England and Wales have 8 bank/public holidays per year. Scotland and the Republic of Ireland have 9 each, and Northern Ireland has 10 per year!\n\nOf England's holidays, 5 are in the 1st half of the year, and only 3 in the second half - the latter being at the end of August, then Christmas and Boxing day.\n\nWe feel that an extra public holiday would be gratefully recieved by the general public, and the perfect time is Halloween - the 31st of October. This would sit neatly 2 months after August's holiday and 2 months before Christmas.\n\nWe understand that you may be wary of the connotations, but October 31st is also known as the Celtic New Year, and it's a celebration of the end of the harvest season.\nWe believe that it would benefit our country's cultural diversity to have a public holiday on this date, as many of the current bank holidays are associated with Christianity (such as Easter) with no ill effect.",
