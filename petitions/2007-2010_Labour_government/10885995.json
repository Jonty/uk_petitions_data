        "background": "In today's news, we learned some local councils have money (our money) invested in overseas banks, namely Icelandic banks, and could loose much of it. \n\nApart from the present economic crisis, this is absolutely ludicrous. Our money should be deposited / invested in our own banks here in the UK. At one time, it was illegal to take Sterling out of the country, and now, we have this ridiculous situation. \n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to make it a legal requirement that all UK local councils deposit / invest our money in British banks.",
