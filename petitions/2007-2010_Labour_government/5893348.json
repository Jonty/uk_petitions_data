            "background": "With so much crime and anti-social behaviour caused by the consumption of alcohol amoungst youths in this country, we ought to tackle it head-on by eliminating the ability for under-21's to buy alcohol. \n\nWith all of our shops adopting a \"Think 21\" approach, (I recently went to a restaurant which has a \"Think 25\" (!) scheme), it's about time the law followed suit.\n\nIt would also go some way in combating many other related felonies which are being committed daily by the youths of this country.  One of the many benefits would be a reduction in the amount of road accidents for the notoriously-unsafe 18-21 age-group.\n\nLet's take action to reverse the trend of binge-drinking, and give our nation's reputation for alcohol consumption a much-needed boost.\n\nReferences:\n\n(URLs taken out by request)",
