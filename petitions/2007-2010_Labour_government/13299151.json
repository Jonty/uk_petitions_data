            "background": "Some months ago, the popular American wrestling company WWE started to feature \"guest presenters\" on it's Monday Night Raw program, broadcast on Sky Sports in the UK and the USA Network in the United States.\n\nWe believe that after the perceived damage to the UKs reputation within the USA over the Al-Maghri affair, it would be something of a good idea for Prime Minister Gordon Brown to apply to appear as a guest host on Monday Night Raw in the future.\n\nWith precedent already set by Tony Blair's appearance on the Simpsons and British talk shows, we believe that Mr Brown appearing on the popular show would promoted Britain abroad, serve to improve relations with the United States and also possibly get more young people, the shows target audience, interested in politics and international relations.",
