        "action": "allow continuing students to be entitled to the maintence grant presently only available to the 2008 cohort.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is grossly unfair that students who signed up for courses prior to September 2007 were only entitled to a maintence grant if the household income was \u00a339,000 but students signing up for courses for September 2008 qualify for maintenance grants if the household income does not excede \u00a360,006.  The Government wants to 'entice' more students to uni but is not intersted in helping support a large number of students already at uni and their parents many of whom are under a lot of financial pressure to assist their children because the allocated student loans are not sufficient to cover both living costs and rent while living away from home.",
