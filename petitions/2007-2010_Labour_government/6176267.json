            "background": "As an Off-Licence employee i am getting more and more frustrated with the number of adults buying alcohol for minors. This can be their sibling / offspring friends etc. \nBasically i have now had a few problems with legal drinkers entering the shop to buy alcohol for minors who are with them at the time.\nThey even will ask them out loud what they want. Often these minros are not even close to 18.\n\nMany people just do not understand that they cannot buy alcohol for a minor. They thinks it legal to buy them alcopops etc.\n\nThey also dont understand they are putting mey and many others livelyhoods at risk by doing this.\n\nMaybe its about time we got awareness campaigns for this just like drink driving/drugs/safe sex etc especially as we are now topping the charts as the highest underage drinkers in europe.",
