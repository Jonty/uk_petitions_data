The only difference is that where as a human doctor learns about one species (Man), Veterinarians have to learn many, many other species (Dogs, Cats, Cows, horses, etc). \n\nThey work just as hard and do not get the full recognition that they deserve in the UK.\n\nThis is not how we should treat the people who look after alot of the UK's produce and of course many of mans best friends.",
