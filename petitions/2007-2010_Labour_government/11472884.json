You won't find lengthy interviews with Taleban supporters claiming there's a British massacre of Afghanis and explaining how they're going to send the British Army to early graves. And you won't find endless questioning of the real motives of the UK, or attribution of cynical bad faith to the reasons for particular military actions happening at particular times.\nStop the BBC reporting disproportionally against Israel.  The BBC should report ALL the facts and tell ALL sides of the stories they choose to report.  The BBC should be neutral and should step out of playing politics.",
