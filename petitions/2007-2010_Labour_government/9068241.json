Where would 0.5 miln persons alone in UKGB get their birth certificates from then? \n\nBe believed or not, please, this could be so dangerous that, & it could happen, & so, again, please, just don\u2019t do it. The PM & HMG must surely put the interests of if not the lives of such UKGB nationals overseas, regardless of colour or of (native) languages, before straight-forward aliens overseas, that we must say. Whatever it is, it is not worth it, so please don't do it and drop it.",
