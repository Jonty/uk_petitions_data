            "background": "We, the undersigned are concerned about the rapid disappearance of  funfairs and theme parks from our coastal resorts.  We are asking the government to make financial concessions and funds available via the National Lottery and the Department of culture Media and Sport to encourage and assist local authorities in the preservation of these attractions for the general public to enjoy, as they are part of out heritage.  \n\nIn recent years, on the North West Coast alone has lost traditional theme parks such as Southport Pleasureland and Ocean Beach, Rhyl, which have closed resulting in the demolition of classic rides many of which were the last of their kind in the UK.\n\nWe are particularly concerned about Southport, where the future of the Pleasureland site is uncertain.   The current owner planned to develop the site as a theme park but the local council has awarded the lease to a development company and a funfair will not be included in their plans.  This will do nothing for tourism and will cause local businesses and shops to close resulting in the decline of the resort.\nWe hope the government will consider these views to secure the future of our seaside resorts for everybody to enjoy.",
