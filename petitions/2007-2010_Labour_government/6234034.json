        "background": "Numerous travel packagers, car rental companies and others offer a pricing scheme which they refer to as \"dynamic pricing\". They charge buyers different prices depending on such unfair factors as where they live, sex, and other discriminatory practices. \n\nThe true meaning of \"dynamic pricing\" is in fact quite the opposite. Prices are \"dynamic\" when they are allowed to float continuously in any direction in an open free marketplace. Any buyer and any seller can agree to trade, without regard to anything but the price. The stock market is the most common example of \"dynamic pricing\".   \n\nAirline style \"dynamic pricing\" is in fact \"fixed pricing\" NOT \"dynamic pricing\" Prices are set according to buyer circumstances and NOT allowed to be moved by free market forces.(the word \"fixed\" is a direct opposite to the word \"dynamic\")\n\nAt the very least these traders should be forced to use the term \"differential pricing\" to describe such discriminatory pricing schemes.",
