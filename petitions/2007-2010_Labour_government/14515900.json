            "background": "The current grant system unfairly discriminates against students from middle income families.  I believe that all students should be treated equally, not dependant on their parents wages as the final salary of the student is dependant on their own job not their parents. 2 studenets earning the same salary when graduated could be in completely different situations, one with a \u00a325,000 loan and another with no loan to repay based purely on what their parents earn. All students should leave university on an even playing field.",
