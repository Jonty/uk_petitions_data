        "background": "The roulette machines in betting shops are widely known as the 'crack cocaine' of gambling for a reason.\n\nThe fact you can bet ludicrous sums of money, on what is effectively a computer programme, is a joke.\n\nIt is far, far too easy to end up with a gambling problem. The Government needs to show some sort of responsibility and put a stop to this kind of thing happening. There is a betting shop within yards of wherever you are. Kids as young as 15 or 16 are able to play them, as most shops are very relaxed at asking for identification. They are just happy at making money. I know countless people whose lives have been ruined by these machines.\n\nAt least with casinos, they are a lot rarer and harder to find than a betting shop. Furthermore requests for ID are a formality before you even enter the premises.\n\nPUT A STOP TO IT NOW.",
