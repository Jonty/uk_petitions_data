            "background": "Since the smoking ban took effect in the UK, the burden has moved from inside to all outside public areas. Smoker\u2019s now congregate outside business\u2019 and work places. It is now impossible to go anywhere without experiencing second hand smoke. \n\nFor example, I am forced to hold my \nbreath every morning when I enter my work building (because of the plethora of people that loiter outside smoking). The same is true when you travel down any high street. \n\nThis is not only unpleasant because of the smell, the rubbish and the unsightliness of it, but also because of the adverse medical consequences. \n\nSmoking is a private pastime, it causes unnecessary inconvenience and harm to the majority of the population and  accordingly should be restricted to people\u2019s homes, (or at least areas in which non-smokers can avoid without unnecessary hassle).",
