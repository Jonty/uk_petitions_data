It forces you  to scrap all your existing radios - and buy DAB sets instead. \nCar radios, kitchen radios, bedside radios, stereo tuners, all become scrap. And the liberated bandwidth is used for extra services no-one wants - witness the DAB station failures - polluted with advertising, and never again the chance to hear a foreign station by accident.\nThis is not a future I want.",
