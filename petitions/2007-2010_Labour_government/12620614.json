Rather than have the MPs, Party Leaders, so called political experts and members of the press tell us what we should be thinking it is now time for the voting people of this country to have our say. Let us decide whether we can trust our local MP to represent us in the House of Parliament in the only way possible, by means of a General Election. Do the decent thing and call a General Election now.",
