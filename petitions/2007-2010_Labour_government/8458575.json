        "background": "Reports from the BBC suggest that the English Premier League intends to introduce an extra league game per club per season, to be played outside of the UK. (see http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7232390.stm )\n\nWe believe that this new proposal could damage English football. We have the following objections:\n\n* The proposals for extra games beyond the current 'home-away' system would go against over 100 years of tradition and would add a random, unfair element into each season\n\n* The extra game would damage the England national football team by adding to an already full fixture schedule\n\n* Holding matches abroad would further distance players and clubs from their fans\n\n* The increased revenue from the games would only suit to enlarge the gap between the richest and poorest clubs in England",
