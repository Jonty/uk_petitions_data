            "background": "In the last few years we have witnessed the growth of big business dominating media ownership. As Hilaire Belloc, identified - in his famous essay on media manipulation; we are at the mercy of business owners whose interests are furthered through their control of the print and broadcast press.  News and opinion are inter-mingled with conjecture, pointless experts and rumours. The situation has become so acute that we are at risk of journalists fabricating and creating news. Note the Daily Mail journalist who fingered a suspect in the McCann case. The harrassment of people in the streets at their homes must stop. Countless individuals have been subjected to the uncontrolled media glare. Many have subsequently been targetted with physical violence, or had their homes vandalised. Note - Sir Fred Goodwin. Let us not confuse the right of the press to report events and probe, with an individuals right to privacy, respect and dignity; whatever they have done. That is why we have courts and a system of justice. The media should not and cannot become judge, jury and executioner.",
