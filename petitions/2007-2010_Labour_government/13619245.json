This could obviously cause accidents, possibly fatal, and equally obviously affects children more than adults (though I have to declare a personal interest: my own height is exactly 5ft). \n\nI first became aware of this situation some years ago: there was a report in my paper about a driver who had killed a pedestrian but was not punished for causing her death because the defence said he had been unable to see the 5ft 4in woman.  I wrote to my M.P. who contacted the Secretary of State for Transport but apparently (then) nothing could be done until there had been some sort of ratification by the European Union.  I don't know if this ratification has now taken place but even if it has I still wonder how many avoidable deaths have occurred since I first contacted my M.P.",
