It would appear that more and more MP's are being caught with their fingers in the cookie jar, are there any honest MP's I highly doubt it.  If they were working in any other sector they would have been at the very least suspended or sacked and would have more than likely have had criminal proceedings taken against them.  It is totally unexceptable that they seemingly get away with so much surely their salaries are high enough, many of us could only dream of earning such sums.",
