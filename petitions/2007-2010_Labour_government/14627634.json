            "background": "I have notice a large increase in the amount of post that is lost by Royal Mail. Valuable items seeming the most like to be lost. There seems no where to properly log lost post independantly of Royal Mail I believe the current system makes it easy for Royal Mail to hide how much post is lost and this is being abused I have found the extent of post lost is beyond to my mind accidental and is actually criminal and is being hidden by the company. An independant investigation should be mounted where the public can tell the investigation directly about what they have lost so practises can be changed.  An independant investigation should be undertaken by the government in to the volume of post Royal Mail is lossing including the ones Royal Mail like to dismiss the ones without proof of postage or value",
