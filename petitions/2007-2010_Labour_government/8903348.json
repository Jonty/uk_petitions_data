            "background": "People who live in rural areas sometimes need to own a 4x4. Without a 4x4 many people can be cut off in times of bad weather and depend on 4x4s for their day to day lives. People in towns do not need 4x4s or big engined cars so tax can be charged higher, but out in the country we would be lost without one. It is not fair that country people should loose out because of people driving their 'Chelsea Tractors' in towns when rural people do use their 4x4s off road. This is why I think road tax should be based on location of residence because this is a much fairer solution for everyone.",
