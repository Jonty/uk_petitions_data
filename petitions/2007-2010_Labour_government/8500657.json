            "background": "I have, like many other people, been to both primary and secondary schools. we are always being told of the poor behaviour and education of young people in and out of schools. so why not appoint someone like me or other decent young people, into their previous school, to assist teachers and gain a rappour with the current students to help in school life, i was a student at my old school last year, and therefore would understand what pupils want. interior setups like student councils do not work, you need to identify problems on a one to one basis, and i feel young people like myself would understand the current situations being faced in out schools and would be an important asset to the school. this should be done throughout the country with suitable past students. We need young teachers and assistants!",
