        "background": "To assist in identifying all those who do not pay car tax or insurance would it not be useful for the DVLA to reward any legal road user for identifying those who cheat the system. The reward could be in the form of a (say) \u00a310 cash payment or credit note (for each vehicle) for the next years tax once the offender has paid up or had their car seized. The legal road user would need to identify the model and registration of the vehicle together with its location.",
