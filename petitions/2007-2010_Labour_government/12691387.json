        "background": "When IR35 was introduced it was expected to earn \u00a3220 million pounds a year from 'tax-dodging' self employed contractors. Instead it nearly destroyed an entire industry and introduced multiple extra complications. Figures released under a freedom of information request show it has brought in a palty \u00a31.5m a year - far less than the cost of the encumbrance it imposes on HRMC and contractors, and clearly as a tax it is a failure.",
