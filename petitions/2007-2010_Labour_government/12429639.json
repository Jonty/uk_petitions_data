        "background": "Falling house prices mean that two million households have either negative equity, or too little equity to finance a house move, lenders have said. \n\nThis figure equates to around one in every four homeowners, who will see the value of their home fall to a level whereby they actually owe more on the property than the property is worth. Those that are most likely to be affected are homeowners that purchased their property over the past few years, when house prices were still rising before peaking in the latter part of 2007. \n\nMillions of homeowners had been failed by the Labour government and the banks even though they were simply trying to make a brighter future for themselves and their families by buying their own home. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has to take personal responsibility for the crisis.\n\nHard working young families deserve more than the fear of negative equity that theya re living with. \n\nThe Government needs to bring an agenda to parliament to work with the banks, who have orchestrated this crisis, to provide solutions to allow people to finance further house moves.",
