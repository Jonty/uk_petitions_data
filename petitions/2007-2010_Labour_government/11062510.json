He endured much abuse but played at the highest level for clubs like at Tottenham Hotspur.  \n\nMore importantly, he was the first black officer in the British Army.  He worked his way up the ranks despite the institutional rules designed to prevent this.  He lead his men into battle and on various raids, being nominated for the military cross for bringing his men back unharmed during a mission.  He was  killed in battle.  \n\nA truly British Hero whose rise against the odds and valour deserves to be recognised.",
