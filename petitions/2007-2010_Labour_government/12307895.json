        "background": "Loudspeakers are similar to guns in that the recipient has no choice whether they are hit with it's contents or not.  Experience has proven people cannot be trusted to use them responsibly.  Loudspeakers can turn a quiet leafy suburb into an inner city ghetto and an inner city ghetto seem far worse than it is.  Why should anyone have the right to hurt people far away in the neighbourhood at the touch of a button?  They should not be allowed to have that power while quiet reclusive people have to be forced into finding them and legal matters against their will.  In the end things like loudspeakers will be banned it is just logical so let's speed up the process it takes effort.   Every human deserves the right to silence and freedom",
