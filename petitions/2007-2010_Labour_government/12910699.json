They face iminent deportation back to Egypt tomorrow 4/06/09. The family fled Egypt because of religious persecution which threatened their lives. The injustice is that they have not received proper legal representation and the opportunity to put forward their case in a fair hearing.\nWe believe there are strong grounds for them to stay. They desperately need your support. Please sign this petition.",
