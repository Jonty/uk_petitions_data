            "background": "Our bus services are appalling, there are holes in the floors, seats that are not bolted down sufficiently and bus drivers that rely on students to direct them as to where they are going and where they need to stop.  These are the busses that take children to school.  Would you want to be on a bus like this? Would you want to risk your life due to a lack of regulations?  However, it is not just school busses, public busses and hirable mini-busses are in an equally bad state.  Some drivers have no licence, can not speak English and have no understanding of British currency.  We need regulations on enforcing regular maintainance on all busses.  We need to ensure our drivers have valid licences (which are regularly checked), can speak English, have an understanding of British currency, and are properly trained.",
