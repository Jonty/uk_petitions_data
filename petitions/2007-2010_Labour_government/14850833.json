        "background": "Smoking when driving a motor vehicle is as dangerous as eating or using a mobile phone, yet it has become accepted by society as the norm for those that smoke. If a person drops a cigarette the automatic responce is to suddenly look down to pick up the ciggarette to avoid burning ones self taking both eyes off the road being temporarily distracted which causes a danger to passangers, drivers and the public. With a ciggarette also comes smoke, the chance of getting smoke in your eyes and even a coughing fit. In order to smoke at the wheel the ciggarette also needs to be lit and held maening that at theese times only one hand is controlling the steering wheel. I am not anti smoking i just think if it is illegal to do other things while driving why isnt smoking at the top of the list.",
