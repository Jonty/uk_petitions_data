Its about time that the dole was looked at as a last resort and not a lifestyle choice. I have to work to afford my lifestyle, why should these career spongers get away with milking the system. I urge the government to stop being so eager to please the long term benefit claimers and spare a thought for the people who actually do something positive for this country.",
