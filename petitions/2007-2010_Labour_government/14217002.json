            "background": "Please rethink stopping using cheques.  Small businesses rely on cheques from clients as not everyone has the required amount of cash on them at any one time, and i certainly cannot afford to buy a credit card machine to take with me on every job.  Fair enough that big business and supermarkets dont want to use them, this does not mean you can penalise the smaller trading firms.  more and more people will stop being self employed = more people out of work.",
