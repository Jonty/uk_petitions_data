            "background": "In the past, Knighthoods have been revoked on numerous grounds including war and treason.  How can a perpetrator of crimes against humanity be allowed to endorse himself with such an accolade?  We should, as a nation, disassociate ourselves from this dictator.  Whilst the knighthood may have been bestowed in good faith in 1994, intervening events have proved that the recipient is more than unworthy of the title.  Please pledge your support to this campaign and show that Britain thoroughly opposes the oppression of the Zimbabwean people.",
