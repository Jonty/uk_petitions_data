            "background": "HM Revenue have raised tax on  memberships at many leisure facilities, due to being classed as Luxury and not health. This has resulted in people having to pay over \u00a36 extra a month per member directly to the tax office or opt out of the extra facility... in the case of Highbury pool being the newly built steam and sauna. It seems a shame that a facility recently improved is now sitting around largely unused due to tax office greed.",
