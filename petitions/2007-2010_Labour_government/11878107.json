If they are then found to have brought disrepute in any way to themselves or to their respective institutions. Then that Title must be REMOVED from them. Otherwise it slurs everyone else who has that Title! Whether they be bankers or sports stars it does not matter at all. Also future granting should ONLY be for BRITISH BORN and BRITISH RESIDENT individuals. We do NOT want US conmen in Antigua to get one, no matter who they are and what they did!!",
