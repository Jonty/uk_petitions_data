            "background": "Eastnor Parochial Primary school is the heart of our village providing an excellent level of education for our children.  Although we are a small school with only 83 children we are continually oversubscribed each intake year and have grown year upon year to become an excellent school with outstanding academic results.  We feel it is an injustice to our children to close a school which has proven itself time and time again.  We are very much involved with our church giving our children not only a excellent education but a secure grounding for their lives, teaching them to respect those around them as well as themselves. Please support our petition to keep this wonderful school as it is and continue to provide the education that our children deserve.",
