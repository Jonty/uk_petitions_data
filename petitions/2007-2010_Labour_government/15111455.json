            "background": "How is it that insurance companies are able to charge men for car insurance sometimes four or five times more than they do for women?\nThey justify it by saying that men have more accidents than women percentage-wise, however surely there is a difference between the percentage of black people and the percentage of white people having accidents; this would be wrong to apply and so is what they are doing now.\nThis petition is to stop insurance companies discriminating against gender when quoting car insurance or any other type of insurance.\nIt is not right that a man should have to pay more than a woman; it is simply unfair and discriminative.",
