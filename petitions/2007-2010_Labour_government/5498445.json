            "background": "There is currently no incentive for Local Authorities and their Parking Attendants to ensure that parking tickets are issued appropriately i.e. only when an offence has occurred.\n\nThe inappropriate issuing of parking tickets seems to be on the increase, and for the motorist to appeal the notice can mean significant inconvenience and costs. \n   \nI propose that when a parking ticket is successfully appealed the issuing authority should be obliged to pay the motorist the same amount as the original penalty.",
