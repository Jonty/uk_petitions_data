The parent who is not the full time care giver has to put up with official bodies ignoring any concerns about welfare for the child, just because they do not care for the child full time.\n\nOrganisations such as CAFCASS and Social Services are supposed to be there to take the welfare of any children involved, but often, are too biased against the non-\"full time\" parent to give concerns a fair hearing.",
