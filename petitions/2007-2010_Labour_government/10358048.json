            "background": "The council of Hammersmith and Fulham have proposed that the sculpture \"The Man Who Blows the Clouds\" in the childrens playground on Shepherd's Bush Green is to be removed. \nThe sculpture was installed 20 years ago and has become part of the area's history. The sculpture fully involved the local community: four local schools and Marisa Rueda, the artist in residence at the time, were involved in it. The \u2018man\u2019 was based on a real local character who frequented the green, who used to walk about 'with his head in the clouds'. It is also listed as a historical sculpture on the borough's website.\nThe project was supported by the Arts Council and Art Angel. The funding came from the borough of Hammersmith & Fulham and the Department of the Environment.\nMany local residents are appalled at the proposal to remove the sculpture and would like it to be restored to its original state. The exterior maintenance has been neglected, but the sculpture is fundamentally sound.\nPlease sign the petition.",
