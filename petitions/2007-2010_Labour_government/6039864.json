This is incredibly humiliating and angering to the person involved.  Companies such as Google have said that it is not their job to check their own site for these brutal videos.  They claim that that is the responsibility of the Police.  It needs to be made a criminal offence to record fights using recording equipment and very serious penalties need to be imposed on those involved, even underage persons.",
