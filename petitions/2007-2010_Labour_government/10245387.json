        "background": "Research in \"Brain\" medical magazine, reports on the hidden cost of war - of the 1.64 million soldiers deployed, 320,0000 suffer brain injury at a cost of $ 26 - 409,000. The report recommends that \"We can and must learn to do a better job of healing the mind and the brain - helping and honouring those who cannot be healed\". Having suffered long - term consequences of anti = psychotic drugs, the petitioner is recommending that if head injuries are to be treated in this kind of capacity, better advice should be given to junior doctors on the type of medication and dosage. Recurrent history taking by junior doctors, and different staff on different visits, due to poor continuity of care is a practice that should be avoided to prevent flashbacks.",
