            "background": "the major problem of conjestion on motorways is the difference in speed between hgv's and cars. increasing hgv speeds would lower the difference in speeds and therefore decrease conjestion. If anyone has been to the USA, over there hgv's dont seem to be limited to a low speed. I been there several times and on a 3 or 4 lane highway, all the traffic is moving at upto 80 mph on each lane, and guess what, No Conjestion.",
