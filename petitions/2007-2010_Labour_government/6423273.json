            "background": "Vaccination would be detrimental for the agricultural industry due to the damage it would cause to the export trade which is likely to take 6 months after vaccination to resume rather than 3 months under contiguous culling.  The vaccinated animals could not be saved - they would all have to be slaughtered in order for the country to regain the essential export markets again.  There would also be difficulty in ascertaining the difference between a vaccinated and an infected animal, which could cause further spread of the disease.",
