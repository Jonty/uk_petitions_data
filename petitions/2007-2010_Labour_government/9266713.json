            "background": "A survey for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulation ahead of new consumer protection regulations to be introduced next month found 96% of people want a crackdown on rogue traders, AOL reports today.\n\nThe poll found 90% have had pushy salesmen at the door or on the phone, while 82% had received repeated calls from the same firm despite telling them they were not interested.\n\nBecause of the time difference, using overseas telephone centres is wrecking havoc and invading my privacy.\n\nAnother 43% of consumers said they had been duped into buying something after receiving misleading information, and 94% had \"won\" a competition they never entered - including e mail lottery syndictes - the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to address whatever happened to Britsh justice in consumer law.",
