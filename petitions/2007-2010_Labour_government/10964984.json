            "background": "All privately rented properties to be inspected by the local council.The inspection fee to be paid by the landlord.An annual inspection to be carried out.Again the cost to be borne by the landlord.Any repairs to be carried out promptly.Long term assured tenancies to become the norm.Rents to be set by the local council or by an independent body.Those that have a short-term tenancy seem to have less rights over their home.After the initial 6-month term they can be evicted with only a couple of months notice.This causes a great deal of stress as well as unnecessary expense.There is the stress of trying to find suitable accommodation where there is already a marked shortage. There are the costs of moving etc.This again affects the less well off as well as creating further stresses.If there are children involved this may also require a change of school.These regulations would ensure that more people are protected within their homes.Tenants who cause a nuisance may be evicted without having to be re-housed. This will place the responsibility on the tenant to control their behaviour and that of their children.",
