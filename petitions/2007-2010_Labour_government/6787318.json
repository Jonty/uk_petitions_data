This could entail varied, coordinated and sophisticated or massive destabilising actions in order to disrupt the economic and financial stability of a state, a group of states or a society (such as market oriented western societies) for ideological or religious motives. These actions, if undertaken, may be violent or not. They could have either immediate effects or carry psychological effects which in turn have economic consequences.\"\n\nUnfortunately, desperate times require desperate measures.",
