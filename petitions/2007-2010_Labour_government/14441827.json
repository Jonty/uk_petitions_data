Yet the board room of rbs think they deserve lottery winning bonuses for adding to the current financial meltdown. Bonuses are acceptable when performing but not for failing. This is like giving sweets to a child for misbehaving.Any profits should go to the treasury as it is now mainly a tax payer owned company. Nationally owned industry should keep taxes down, it shouldn't put them up to pay bonuses and bail outs",
