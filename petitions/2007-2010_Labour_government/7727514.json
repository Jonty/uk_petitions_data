            "background": "The undersigned people of the UK have finally had enough of mass immigration which has swamped our own identity, taxation at ever increasing levels, incompetent government departments who cannot be trusted with our personal details, an NHS in chaos with filthy hospitals, the spread of superbugs and a four tier system depending upon where you live.\n\nWe have had enough of government spin doctoring and sleaze, pandering to the rest of Europe, the lack of consumer protection which allows UK residents to be ripped off, the charging of University fees, house price inflation, exorbitant petrol prices, uncontrolled levels of violent crime, political correctness lunacy, the erosion of our long held history, beliefs and rights and the obsession with celebrity.    \n\nWe therefore call upon the Prime Minister to provide emigration relocation assistance services for the undersigned UK residents who would wish to leave the UK for a better life elsewhere.",
