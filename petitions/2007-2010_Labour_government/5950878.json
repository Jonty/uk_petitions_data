            "background": "Stop the inequality in funding for public transport systems in the north. We want the government to fund a high speed rail link to Manchester allowing the Eurostar to run directly to the continent. Why does the government neglect the needs of the public living north of Birmingham. First the metrolink extension was rejected funding by the government forcing new congestion charging measures but the government does not realise that the only way to force people off the roads is to improve public transport. introducing such charges is deemed to fail and overburden an already crippling public transport infastructure.",
