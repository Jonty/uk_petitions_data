            "background": "The draconian anti-smoking legislation is unfair.  It removes the right for smokers to congregate in a social situation with other people who smoke.  We believe that it is a Human Right to congregate lawfully with others who feel the same way rather than having to leave a gathering to use either the pavement outside or a shelter which, by law, is made uncomfortable to use.  Few people disagreed with the alternative whereby a special room (or indeed a whole premises) was set aside for use by smokers.  It has never been categorically proved that 'secondary smoking' can cause lung cancer.  In any case, there is sufficient affordable technology to remove almost all air-borne particles (99.99%) from the air which will alleviate any possible complaint on these grounds.  Though we doubt that the Government will respond to this question;  On what grounds do ordinary people who do not smoke differ from Members of Parliament who do not smoke when using Members Parliamentary facilities?",
