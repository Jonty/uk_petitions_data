            "background": "The abolition of the 10 percent tax band will hit people on low incomes the most. This is especially so, when these tax increase come on top of above inflation increases in Council Tax, Water Rates, fuel bills etc.\n\nGordon Brown has claimed that the decrease in income will be offset by increases in Tax Credits. However, not everyone is eligible for Tax Credits. For example, people who work part time, and those who don\u2019t have dependent children, are excluded. \n\nIn my own case, I can only work part time because I need to care for my disabled wife, who is also in a very poor state of health. Consequently I cannot claim Tax Credits.\n\nIn addition, many people who are eligible for Tax Credits do not claim because they simply don\u2019t know how to go about claiming them.\n\nThe obvious solution to this would be to restore the 10 percent Income Tax band.",
