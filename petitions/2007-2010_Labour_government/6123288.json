            "background": "The requirements for workers in the construction industry to prove competence through exams and registration via bodies such as CORGI has not significantly improved safety or removed the illegal workers (ie those who cannot prove competency) from the marketplace.\n\nThe increased time and financial contraints placed upon construction businesses to meet these ever increasing certification and registration demands is creating a deeper divide between registered and non-registered workers which is having a direct and detrimental effect upon legitimate business as well as putting the public at risk.  \n\nHome information packs (HIP's) are both deeply unpopular and can never bridge this problem.  Therefore, we ask the Prime Minister to review the entire registration and certification process to reflect the real needs of the industry and an effective way to promote competence and safety without further encumbering legitimate businesses.",
