The Council insist that Three Owls must apply for a zoo license because visitors are allowed on the premises by appointment on 6 days a week. The birds who are in recovery or are permanent residents due to disability are in their aviaries and in full view of the visitors and according to the legislation \u2018are kept for exhibition\u2019 .   The Sanctuary is a charity and in today\u2019s difficult economic climate has barely sufficient funds to cover the day to day running costs. A Zoo Licence and all the associated costs is beyond their means!",
