            "background": "When I was 16 I had a moped. I then turned 17 and after a year of getting wet, overtaken dangerously, beeped at and nearly knocked of my moped, I want a car. I started driving lessons and now I have one years no claims, A full UK car licence and pass plus-I have done everything physically possible and I am as qualified as possible. Then, insurance companies decided to tell me that due to company policy, they just ignore the fact I have driven safely for a year, because \u201cI had a different vehicle\u201d This excuse is simply not acceptable. I have driven on the same roads, followed the same rules and I havent had any accidents, for a whole year. But insurance companies just totally ignore this, to make money out of a non-earning student. This is unacceptable, why should somebody who has a proven track record be likened to somebody who hops straight into a car? I propose that it should be illegal for insurance companies to totally ignore someone\u2019s driving experience due to \"company policy\".",
