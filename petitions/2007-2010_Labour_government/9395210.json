            "background": "The proposed increases in road tax affecting larger cars such as people carriers, which include cars built after 2001  is foolish to say the least. This measure is nothing more than a tax grab designed to raise revenue. Let us remind the government that we are already paying 70% tax at the petrol pump . How we choose to use that fuel is upto the individual. If this government wants to get cars  off the road then offering an alternative would be a good start. Penalising people with large families is not the answer.",
