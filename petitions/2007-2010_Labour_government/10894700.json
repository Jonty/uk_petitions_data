It has started a consultation exercise, which ends on the 30th October 2008, on applying charges to spectrum use.\nMountain Rescue organisations are charitable voluntary bodies, funds are raised from public donation and their teams are staffed by volunteers. The additional cost of these licences will cause significant financial difficulties and potentially cause the closure of these vital emergency services.\n\nThis proposal must be rejected wholeheartedly.",
