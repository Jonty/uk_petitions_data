        "background": "These vile actions by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross have offended too many, particular Andrew Sachs and his family. At a time when the nation is collectively against yob behaviour, two high profile individuals (Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross) who are contracted by the BBC have decided to display outrageous yob behaviour towards an elderly well loved man (Andrew Sachs). The BBC should be ashamed of itself for this yob broadcast, and Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross should be severely punished to teach all yobs, including Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross a clear painful lesson.",

The Government does, however, expect the BBC\u00a0to act responsibly towards its audience and\u00a0the Trust must ensure that the standards that are clearly outlined in its Charter are upheld at all times.\n\nResponsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters themselves and the organisations which regulate broadcasting, in this case the BBC Trust.  Listeners who have been offended can also contact Ofcom if they feel that acceptable standards have been breached.",
