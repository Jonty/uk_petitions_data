This week Senior Appeal Court judges accepted Mark and Nicky Webster may be right in thinking they had suffered a miscarriage of justice. It will be a continuation of the injustice if these children grow up away from their family. They will at some point learn that they were taken away and this will  do more damage than taking them back from adoptive parents and reuniting them with their natural parents and the brother they have never met. The judges said: \"The circumstances in which adoption orders can be revoked or set aside are extremely limited. None applied in the present case.\" Then the law needs to be changed or adapted. It is an appalling miscarriage of justice and must not be allowed to continue.",
