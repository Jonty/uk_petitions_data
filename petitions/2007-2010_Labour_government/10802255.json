Unfortunately, Mount Wise Youth Project is facing the stark reality that unless further funding is found then the project may have to close its doors for the last time in early 2009.\n\nThis project, also know locally and affectionately as \"Malcs & Hevs\", has in its 13 years, seen over 400 young people come through its doors and on the streets. Many have experienced outdoor activities and residentials experience's that they otherwise wouldn't have had the opportunity to do.\n\nM.W.Y.C.P has run many 10 weeks programmes which aim to build confidence and resillence in young people.  \nYoung people have remained involved with M.W.Y.C.P over many years and positive relationships are maintained. Young people have said the project has been inspirational in their lives and that the workers are always available and welcoming. Many can't believe the project may have to close.",
