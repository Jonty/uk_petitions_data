            "background": "Senator Edward Kennedy, far from providing \"services to the US-UK relationship and to Northern Ireland\" is a man who has given succour to the Irish Republican movement while it was conducting a terrorist campaign against the United Kingdom, involving the murder of British civilians.  Since the IRA murdered Lord Mountbatten 30 years ago, it is disgraceful that Kennedy is put forward for an award that is officially granted by HM the Queen.\n\nThere is also Kennedy's involvement in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne in 1969, where it is alleged he was driving while under the influence of alcohol and left this woman to die at Chappaquiddick when his car went off a bridge.\n\nWhile it is a great shame for his family that Kennedy is terminally ill, the fact that he is a personal friend of the Prime Minister is no reason to grant him an honorary knighthood.  He is no friend to this country.",
