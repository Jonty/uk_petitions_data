            "background": "The number of residential properties currently under development has reached a post war low and we face a disastrous housing shortage. This subject is on the governments radar and is constantly at the forefront of policy promises and proposals. Why then, has the HCA recently decided to refill it's coffers by reducing the \"per bed\" grant funding by \u00a35k? This has rendered the small number of developments that were in the pipeline (at planning stage or thereabouts) totally unviable. The grant reduction has been passed on to landowners resulting in a further reduction of already diminished land values by 30%-40%. It seems very short sighted and unsustainable to further stifle the housing industry and is contrary to promises made. Why penalise those willing to stick their necks on the line at this difficult time.",
