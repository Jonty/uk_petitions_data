        "background": "I think it is truly unfair that those on low incomes or benefits have to pay twice as much for a TV License, How can you justify those on lower incomes who normally only have 5 channels , being penalised and again becoming 2nd class citizens to those on higher earnings who can afford to pay.  Why has this not been put on a PAYG system, so if you watch you pay.  If you watch it on the Internet after the event are you liable for licensing fees?",
