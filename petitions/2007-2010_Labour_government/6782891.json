            "background": "The unscrupulous sale of Tattoo Equipment to Non-Registered persons and premises must stop. \nCompanies, including online auction sites,notably EBay, are allowing Tattoo Equipment to be sold directly to the public.\nTattooists in the UK are required to register with their local Health Authority at great expense, therefore, it is only fair and lawful that companies be made to guarantee that equipment sales are restricted to Registered Premises. The practice of indiscriminate sales not only presents a risk to public Health, but to tax-paying businesses also. We demand our livelihood be protected.",
