Also recently in my area someone was convicted of murder 2 years ago and in the past week has gone missing whilst on a home visit. When being covicted of something as serious as murder why less than 2 years into his sentance is he in an open prison and allowed home visits. It is not exactly encouraging criminals to change their ways. Meanwhile the victims family have to live with the consequences forever!",
