            "background": "The recent flooding in Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Berkshire has been a terrible disaster for all who have been and continue to be affected by it. Although the Government have pledged an additional \u00a310 million for flood defences the great masses of water that fall will still need to escape somewhere, which is why flood plains exist. We should not build houses in areas where there is a real and proven threat to the safety and personal belongings of entire communities. In addition, the financial implication of fighting the floods and the resultant clean-up exercise can only increase. Nobody should knowingly be put in the situation we have faced over the last few months.",
