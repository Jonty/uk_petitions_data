            "background": "My 85 year old mother has alzheimers and has been in a care home for nearly 4 years.  During this time her only form of seating has been a wheelchair with a lap belt. I understand that for safety reasons the elderly must have secure\n seating, but surely more comfortable , secure chairs can be provided.  I am informed by the care commission that sitting in wheelchairs all day is not against the law.  It is shocking that  some elderly citizens only form of seating is a wheelchair. I am a regular visitor and see first hand how uncomfortable this can be. People with dementia cannot always express how they feel and have to put up with the discomfort. This form of practice must stop.",
