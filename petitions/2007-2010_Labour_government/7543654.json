            "background": "Many people would like the car driving age changed to 16 as by then people have finished school and want to go out and get jobs and travel to college and even though a moped maybe a solution for many people its dangerous and slow to travel long distance on them and holds a danger to others on the road aswell. This also gives many people independance to get around. For the above reasons we have started this petition we feel that at the age of 16 you are no more maturer or have changed in anyway than if we were 17.",
