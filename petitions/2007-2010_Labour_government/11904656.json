        "action": "Amend the smoking ban in relation to pubs and clubs by introducing a \u201cminimum air quality standard\u201d that must be met by businesses who wish to allow smoking in part or all of their premises. This standard should be set at a realistic level to be achievable by all businesses but robust enough to protect staff and non smokers from serious harm. This would then provide the option for pubs and clubs to make the necessary improvements to their premises or to remain smoke free. We believe this would be a fairer system giving more choice to smokers, non smokers and business owners alike.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Businesses shall initially have the option to allow smoking on their premises for a period of 6 months which would allow a period of 3 months to ascertain the level of investment that would be required to provide a safe smoking environment in all or part of their premises according to demand, and a further period of 3 months to make the necessary improvements to either meet the standard or revert to their previous non smoking status. They shall also be required to give notice of 2 months to all staff and customers of their intention.\n\nWe believe this amendment to be a fair and workable solution which will address the many objections to the ban without impinging on the rights of those who wish to enjoy a smoke free environment. At the same time it would provide a lifeline to those struggling businesses that have been adversely affected by the ban.\nWe urge you to seriously consider this suggested amendment as a matter of urgency as we believe it would help to arrest the dramatic number of pub closures that are occurring nationwide and the serious impact these closures are having on local communities and their economies.",
