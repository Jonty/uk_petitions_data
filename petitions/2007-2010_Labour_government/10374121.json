            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "DoH management of the regulation of psychotherapies is questionable and undemocratic. Psychotherapists, Analysts and Counsellors working on the ground have not been properly consulted during this process. The DoH is currently making ill-founded claims that there are only three paradigm approaches i.e. Psychodynamic, systemic and CBT, and that all other therapies are variants of these. This is simply not true. These three approaches now enjoy secured status within the NHS whilst other approaches have been marginalised to the private sector. CBT in particular has been prejudicially promoted even though it is a fairly recent approach - described by Ann Keen, MP as \"psychological rehabilitation\" rather than psychotherapy. CBT is an obvious derivative of other therapies which preceded it historically. Individual schools of psychotherapy should have equal and protected status under any fair and proper regulation. This petition calls for an enquiry into the current railroading of the psychotherapies which will, without doubt, adversely affect service provision and the careers of thousands of psychotherapists, analysts and counsellors in the UK.",
