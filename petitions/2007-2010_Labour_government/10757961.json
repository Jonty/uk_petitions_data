In some circles this is even referred to as a war - class war no less.\n\nIn the egalitarian society of modern Britain where it is illegal to discriminate against people by race, gender, religion or sexuality it needs also to be illegal to discriminate against people by class.\n\nTo provoke discrimination by class and to incite class war needs to be criminalised.",
