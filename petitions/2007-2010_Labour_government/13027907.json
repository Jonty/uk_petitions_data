            "background": "Increasingly lorries are adhering to a crazy speed limit law introduced many years ago. Why have a limit for lorries on single carriageway roads which is 20 mph below the national speed limit for cars? Surely more accidents are caused by fustrated drivers attempting to overtake these vehicles than are preserved by the current 40 mph limit? The cost of delayed people and goods to the country's economy must also be great.",
