        "background": "The CSA currently have a drive to collect arrears built up by NRP in 2 years. It is not alwayss the fault of the NRP, often caused by CSA delay's and maladmin. These arrears are not small sometimes ammounting to 10's of thousands of pounds. These NRP's often have second families to care fand provide for. The CSA are taking 40% of income and still sending in bailiffs to the home. This leaves the NRP and his family destitute. Also the agency does not seem to tell the truth to either PWC or NRP, leaving many chilldren in poverty. The goverment needs to change the whole system to benefit all children First and second families alike",
