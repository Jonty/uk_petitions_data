            "background": "UK quarantine laws are outdated and unnecessary. Many countries do not qualify for pet passports, and dogs and cats from these destinations must spend SIX MONTHS in solitary confinement.\n\nFACT: There has been only one case of rabies diagnosed in a quarantined dog since 1973\n\nFACT: Thousands of pets die in quarantine due to stress and separation anxiety, NOT due to rabies.\n\nFoxes and bats are the main carriers of rabies, yet they can freely fly and walk across UK borders.\n\nIt is important to keep the UK rabies free, but the Quarantine law established in 1901 is outdated and unnecessary.\n\n- Regular vaccines can protect against rabies for up to three years\n- Blood tests on arrival can prove the presence of rabies antibodies.\n\nStop the bureaucracy \u2013 the only people this outdated practice protects are the quarantine kennels and organizations who reap profit from it.",
