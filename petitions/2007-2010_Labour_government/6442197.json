            "background": "The 2 new aircraft carriers the Royal Navy have been financed for are already in many people's opinion antequated technology. I suggest the Royal Navy are further financed to buy a $4.3 dollar (around \u00a32 billion) Nimitc class aircraft carrier. These carriers are powered by 2 nuclear reactors giving speeds of 35mph and no need for refuelling. Not only this they can hold 85 aircraft. I beleive this is a necceasry way to maintain the Royal Navy's fleet capability. I will stress I am not saying we have this aircraft instead of the 2 proposed aircraft carriers for the RN but in addition. I also suggest the 85 aircraft are British made to boost the economy.",
