This is treating young people like animals and poses some serious human cruelty issues.\n\nHarming peoples ears as well as dictating where we can and can't go, Where exactly do you want us to go? We live in a world where the authorities and many higher aged people do not understand the behavior and social structure which younger people have to live through. \n\nBan the mosquito and get the Police to do their jobs properly by sorting out the minority of teens which cause disruption. DON'T TREAT US LIKE ANIMALS!!",
