            "background": "A small town named Arbroath in Angus, Scotland is home to 45CDO RM. This Royal Marine Commando base (RM Condor) has been here since the 1960's, before this it was home to the Royal Navy Air Squadron. \nA few nightclubs and pubs in Arbroath have made it company policy to ban 'Forces' personnel and have offered no explanation for their actions. This is blatant discrimination and should not be permitted by law. These brave Marines have recently finished a 6 month deployment to Afghanistan and even the most severely injured Commandos have been refused entry!! Please help to stop this crime against our true heroes!!\nI am sure Arbroath isn't the only town where this same discrimination occurs?? I have also personally witnessed it in Exeter, Devon where the Commando Training Centre is located!!",
