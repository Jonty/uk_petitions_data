        "background": "It is estimated that over a third of the population have used illegal drugs. Recent reports suggest illegal drug use costs the UK some \u00a320bn a year in terms of treatment, crime, enforcement and prison. While the drugs industry itself makes huge profits for criminal gangs which in turn finances other crimes.\n\nIf the drugs industry was controlled by the state, the profits from it would help to pay for far better preventative measures and treatment, sales could be more easily controlled and help offered to addicts at point of purchase.",
