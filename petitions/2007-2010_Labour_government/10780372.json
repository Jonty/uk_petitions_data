            "background": "Now, it is needed to add named drivers to the policy. This means that at any time part of policy is NOT USED but it is already PAID FOR. Insurance should be assigned to CAR not drivers because it covers against damages caused by car regardless if somebody is driving it or not [i.e. car rolls back on a hilly road due to brake failure and causes collision]. Moreover it is scam that insurers do by charging extra for additional drivers in the policy. Also Fully Comp should be in force regardless who is driving [with owners' permission] because it is paid for the whole period of validity of the policy.",
