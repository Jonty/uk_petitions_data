Phage treatment has been in successful use in the EU (Poland, Checzk Republic) for many years (they didn't have access to western drugs during Hitler's war or under Stalin). Importantly, it has no immunity build up. The UK government knows all this, and as an EU member would be able to licence it for immediate use here, but has not done so, instead it delays and repeats the research. And stop encouraging immune strains. Stop putting antibiotics in domestic cleaners.",
