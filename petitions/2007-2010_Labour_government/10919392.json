        "background": "We are very concerned at the cynical approach of the Energy companies who, seemingly each winter, use any recent rise in oil prices as an excuse to keep bills high during this time of year. We also feel it is outrageous when the oil price drops substantially for them to carry on with high prices rather than reflect fairly what is happening in the marketplace.\n\nGovernment regulation may prove a better tool for controlling unfair price levels rather than a windfall tax, which will not help those who are on low wages but above benefits level.",
