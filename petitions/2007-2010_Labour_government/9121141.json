            "background": "My husband works in the building trade and I believe this happens alot in the trades. His annual leave entitlement includes all the stautory holidays instead of getting them as extra to his entitlement of 24 days which is the minimum now. He has only just had this increase this year from 21 days to 24 and only because of the new law bought out in October last year. It means he misses out on family outings because he cannot afford to take days off without pay inbetween his two week summer holiday and christmas which is when he has to take his holiday entitlement. Most employers do have the stat days on top of the normal entitlement but just a few selfish employers use the loophole in the law which allows them to include the stat days in their entitlement.",
