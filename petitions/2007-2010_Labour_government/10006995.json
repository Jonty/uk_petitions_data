        "background": "In May 2005 Ofcom insisted on codes of practice then failed to enforce them. The consumer cannot take a company to court for failure to comply with a code of practice, only the regulator can and Ofcom have been negligent in carrying out these duties. Voluntary codes are being introduce regarding internet speeds but Ofcom should accept if they failed to enforce the previous codes despite claiming \u201cfines upto 10% of the annual turnover\u201d then voluntary codes will not enforced either.  The consumers need fair contracts not further unenforceable codes of practice.",
