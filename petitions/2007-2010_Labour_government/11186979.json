        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is to help the Great British tradesmen and women who are unfairly villified in the press and in the general public as being lazy tea drinkers, the vast majority are very hard working and the among the most highly skilled in the world, proven as they are sought after the world over. These same tradesmen are under huge threat at the moment with the current economic climate, not just do they have to deal with finding work, but also the work available is increasingly being snapped up by under qualified cheap foreign labour. Believe me as somebody in the building trade myself, this is a huge problem and is getting worse. For example the olympic village site. Only Londoners need apply unless you are foreign of course. Any man and woman on a building site works hard enough to earn a good living, this matter needs to be addressed  URGENTLY. Because of major undercutting and wages being slashed this is becoming a MAJOR issue. From the bricklayers and carpenters, to the plumbers and electricians, it takes years in Britain to learn and perfect these trades in many cases from generation to generation, hence this is why the British tradesmen are regarded as the best in the world.",
