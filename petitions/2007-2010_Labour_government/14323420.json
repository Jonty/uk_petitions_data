If found guilty to force the agencies responsible to publicly apologise and say that it won't happen again.\n\nExtensive checks are made with the Civil Aviation Authority and the Police and reports do not always coincide with police or registered helicopters\n\n\"Training exercises\" has been an unsatisfactory reply from the Ministry of Defence to allegations previous.\n\nYou don't have to have seen unmarked helicopters yourself, we are simply calling for an independent investigation from the PM into a severe allegation that doesn't involve the UK Ministry of Defence or Security Services.\n\nDavid Connolly\n\nPro Civil Liberties\nOpen-minded\nFormer Student of International Politics/Intelligence Studies.\nFormer UK Schools Chess Champion.",
