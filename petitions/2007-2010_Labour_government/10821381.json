            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "With the increasing tax on polluting cars, a yearly road tax should be levied on Caravans.  When towing a caravan the efficiency of the car is reduced, increasing the pollution given out by the car using up the dwindling resources of the World.  Adding to this car\u2019s towing caravans is a well publicised source of congestion, particularly on single carriageway roads; again causing an increased level of pollution.\n\nThis in turn causes stress on other drivers who are stuck behind these caravan when they are trying to go about their daily affairs, stress related illness is putting a strain on the NHS \n\nFurther more caravans cause people to migrate around the Country.  People towing the caravans seem to all go to the same areas of the Country, Cornwall, Devon etc; this in turn puts added strain on the local roads and services, rubbish, pollution, congestion etc.  When these \u201cCaravaners\u201d go home they leave their mess behind; the revenue raised by taxing the caravans on a yearly basis should be put toward elevating the financial pressure on the local authorities of these areas as well as tackling road congestion caused by this nuisance.",
