            "background": "It is not acceptable that the over tolerant indulgence of one section of society (children) should be allowed to discriminate against the civil and human rights of another.  Could any of us have imagined the situation that plagues us today with the rising tide of anti-social behaviour, and each successive wave further eroding the quality of individual lives? The widespread unrestricted activities of teenagers/children under the euphemism of play, and its consequent nuisance, distress and damage, by people to whom the values of social responsibility and tolerance are mere words destroys quality of life, not least for the elderly.  That this is allowed to continue unrestricted is a disgrace to civilized society and creates an environment where fear and intimidation flourish.",
