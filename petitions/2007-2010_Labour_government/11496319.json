        "action": "make it a legal requirement for all offenders who cause or allow violent crimes and deaths, to be charged with all applicable offences.\u00a0 Resulting sentences should be served consecutively.  Parole should be abolished for all violent crimes and non-accidental deaths.\u00a0 This should serve to lengthen prison time and better reflect the gravity of these crimes.\u00a0",

        "background": "Too many offenders have been getting off too lightly for violent crimes such as manslaughter, causing or allowing the death of a child, rape, child cruelty & grievous bodily harm.\u00a0To add insult to injury the vast majority of these vile offenders are released after serving only half their sentences.\n\nWhy were the Baby P 3 not also charged with child neglect or cruelty, failing to protect him, destroying evidence or misleading police? They were guilty of all these offences, so why only hold them accountable for his death? \n\n2 year old Sanam died from 107 injuries & broken bones.\u00a0Her mother pleaded guilty to charges of 'failing to protect her' & 'allowing her death', demonstrating that all appropriate charges can & should be enforced.\n\nOffenders responsible for causing or allowing any violent crime or non-accidental death, should be held accountable for all their offences.\u00a0Resulting sentences should then be served consecutively without parole.\u00a0Only then, might justice actually be served.",
