            "background": "One of the main problems people on sickness benefits face is the lack of opportunity to do part time or temporary work over the long term (more than 12 months). Many people may not ever be able to work continuously or full time but could work occasionally. If you replace ESA with a Sickness Tax Credit you will make this automatically possible for all those who are sick.",
