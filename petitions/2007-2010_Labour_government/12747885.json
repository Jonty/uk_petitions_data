The longer this situation is allowed to continue, the more damage it does to the country internationally. It is therefore reasonable to ask Her Majesty to exercise her royal perogative & dissolve parliament and initiate an election, in order to allow the country to try to regain faith in its leadership and to repair its damaged international standing.",
