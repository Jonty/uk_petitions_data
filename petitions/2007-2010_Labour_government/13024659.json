        "background": "The Minstry Of Defence have asked the Court of Appeal to cut compensation to injured troops by up to 70% claiming that two soldiers recieved too much compensation for injuries sustained in service and on active service. MOD contest that they should only pay for the \"original injuries\". As more troops are being injured on active service, they fear that demand for compensation will be too great for their budget. \nThis is a disgace as the politicians sent them into a war yet still refuse to reasonably look after our troops when \"battle damaged\" but to discard them, whilst not giving them the same rates of compensation in comparison with civilians injured on roads or in the workplace etc. Therefore we pettition the Prime Minister and the Government of the United Kingdom to pay equal rates of compensation to injured members of the Armed Forces in parity with Civilian rates of compensation or higher.",
