        "background": "1. Government departments and public-sector organisations are fond of issuing consultation documents.\n2. They should be asked to clearly state maximum three points that they are proposing to implement. This is because many consultations are unclear about what they want.\n3. If 25% of responses are against the course proposed they should not be implemented. This is because many times organisations do what they want to do, despite the responses received.\n4. Auditors should be given the responsibility of eliminating consultations that do not meet these norms.",
