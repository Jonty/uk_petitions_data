            "background": "With more attention being paid to both women earning less, and fathers not being able to spend as much time with their children, I propose extending the length of paternity leave to equal that of maternity leave, with all the same benefits. As well as the obvious effect of allowing children to bond with their fathers more strongly, it would mean employers have no reason to pay women less for the same work, since now both men and women would have the same clauses in their contracts allowing them to leave work for a lengthy period of time (currently, 2 weeks for fathers, 52 weeks for mothers).\n\nThis would also need promoting, to make fathers aware of and to encourage them to take advantage of their paid leave - this would further reduce the difference in likelihood of men and women to take time off to look after their newborn children.",
