It doesn't.\nIt simply attracts the greedy, the excess money lovers.\nSo by working for nothing, only the candidates with interest, desire, determination ie the best for the job, will be tempted to do it, and the ones who are money motivated who don't care will be kept away as they should be.\nthe recent expenses crime and debacle has utterly destroyed any residue of honour, crediblity and decency MP's had, reinstate it by introducing this measure, consitutionally, this IS within the governments and PM's remit, I have well researched it.",
