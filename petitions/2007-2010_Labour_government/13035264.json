            "background": "The proposed route for AirTrack will close each of Wokingham's three main level crossings 5 times each hour, in addition to the current closures, causing additional disruption to roads which are already congested due to poor road layout and configuration of traffic flow. This will have a detrimental impact on businesses and residents of Wokingham, and the surrounding area. It will also have a serious impact on traffic in the surrounding area including Junction 10 of the M4, A329M, Bracknell and Reading. AirTrack acknowledges these crossings will \"be significantly affected\", but have offered no solutions. We call on the government to ensure that bridges or tunnels are provided as part of the AirTrack scheme to allievate traffic congestion, or if that is not feasible to re-route the track.",
