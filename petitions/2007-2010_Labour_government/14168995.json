            "background": "There is a company that wishes to start using CCTV footage from the cameras dotted around London to be displayed live on the Internet to not only people of this country, but to eventually other members of the EU state. This as you may or may not know is a violation of our human rights and also illegal! This company and others which may arise from it, must be stopped. What people may witness could be very minor to something quite horrible. This is not a video game, it is real life! Also, the Metropolitan Police think giving incentives for this behaviour and having the footage shown is completely acceptable.",
