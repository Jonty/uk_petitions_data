            "background": "My T.V. licence is due to be renewed in less than a week but I haven't yet received the reminder without which (as far as I know) I can't renew it.  If I don't renew it in time I could be liable for a \u00a31,000(!) fine or even a prison sentence! but how can I renew it when T.V. LICENCING hasn't sent the reminder?  \n\nIf I receive this reminder within the next few days (i.e. in time to renew it before the end of the month) I'll have to take it to a local Pay Point shop; last year I was charged \u00a310 for using such a shop (and, having investigated the situation, this shop charged the least of all local ones).  Since it was the government's decision to stop Post Offices renewing these licences I would have thought it only fair that Pay Points should be able to recoup their costs from THE GOVERNMENT rather than charging the individual licence holder. Alternatively I could send a cheque but I was told it could take UP TO A MONTH for this to be credited.  I'm very angry and worried about this situation; I rang T.V. Licencing and it was suggested that I could make an arrangement to pay by Direct Debit but that would have meant giving my bank details over the phone which I did not consider to be safe.",
