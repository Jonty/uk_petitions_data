            "background": "A local town council has admitted that they illegally removed, towed and impounded a vehicle parked perfectly legally prominently displaying a legal handicap driver badge. The driver (who has no legs) was forced to     struggle home 15 miles away because he never had the means to pay a \u00a3260 release fee demanded by the councils pound agent. The next day the local London council released the vehicle after forceful complaint by the invalids employer; but refused to compensate the injured party in any way. This type of lawless behaviour is not uncommon and we therefore petition the prime minister to intervene to propose laws providing fair and equitable remedies for victims.",
