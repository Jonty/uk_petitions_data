            "background": "Although the BBC iPlayer will initially only be available to Windows users, it is ridiculous that the BBC should have to delay releasing it on one operating system just because of others who will have to wait a short time. The BBC has already confirmed that they are working on a version of the iPlayer for Mac OSX, and there is no reason why Windows users shouldn't be able to use the iPlayer, simply because users of other operating systems will have to wait. Windows is the largest platform, and it makes sense to develop the iPlayer for Windows first as it has the largest market share of personal computers. Releasing the iPlayer on Windows first is not biased, in fact, users of Windows Vista will hae to wait along with Mac users for a version to be released for their operating system. Also note that the BBC is only releasing a beta version of the iPlayer on 27th July, and the final version will not be released until the Autumn.",
