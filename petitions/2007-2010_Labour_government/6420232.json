            "background": "Youngsters are being asked to walk or cycle to school to be green and reduce jams.\n\nWalking and cycling are generally safe but parents will worry - if they are brave enough to let youngsters be independent.\n\nThe perception of safety has to be improved.\n\nLower speeds and extra road education will play a part but this petition is calling for a change to strict liability laws on drivers\u2019 insurance policies.\n\nAt present, in a car - bike/pedestrian collision, the cyclist or pedestrian (probably the worst injured) has to prove the motorist was reckless.\n\nWe want that burden of proof switched so the motorist \u2013 choosing to use a ton of metal at speed \u2013 has to prove the cyclist or pedestrian was at fault.\n\nThis only applies to insurance claims. In criminal law, drivers in collisions remain innocent until proven guilty.\n\nThis rule exists in many EU countries with more walking and cycling, and a better child road safety record, Let\u2019s raise driving standards and create better road user attitudes.",
