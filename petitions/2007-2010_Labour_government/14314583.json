I am especially concerned about children in their rooms up in the early hours watching this.\n Writing to Ofcom they tell me 3 of the channels are licensed by the Nederlands and 2 regulated by Ofcom. \nIt is about time action was taken against these channels now before we end up with dozens of them.",
