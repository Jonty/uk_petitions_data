            "background": "If every vehicle carried an external display showing their current speed, drivers would be less likely to exceed the speed limits, knowing that police and every other road user, armed with a camera, could provide evidence against them.\nI believe that speeders think they can get away with it only through others' ignorance of their true speed.\nSuch a move would render speed-cameras, humps and other, sometimes bizarre, traffic-calming measures unnecessary. Thus saving administration and maintenance money and returning the roads for law-abiding users to use in a dignified manner.",
