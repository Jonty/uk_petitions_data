        "background": "The large scale expansion of many High Street Grocers has, and is still having, a devastating effect on many small independent businesses. Our High Street are on the verge of complete meltdown. An alternative approach would be to control or restrict what a particular retailer is allowed to sell. For example would there be wider benefits it supermarkets were not able to retail alcohol products and to buy such products you went to a specialist retailer that only sold alcohol. There are many examples of where control can deliver significant and wider benefits. We seriously need to address the preditory tactics laws to protect the wider business community.",
