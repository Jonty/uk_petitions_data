            "background": "At present, it is lawful for juries in some cases to convict when the only evidence of the defendant's guilt is the word of one or more people; the jury only have to 'be persuaded' that the defendant is guilty. This leaves the legal system wide open for abuse, as it means someone can achieve the conviction of another simply by lying in court. The perpetrator can then often go on to claim financial compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. We ask that judges should be required to direct juries to find a defendant not guilty in these cases. We would also ask that the Crown Prosecution Service (who make the final decision whether or not to prosecute) be advised not to proceed in these types of cases, thus avoiding an expensive and pointless trial.  We do appreciate that, in some cases, this may mean that the guilty go unpunished - but this is better than the innocent being wrongly imprisoned.",
