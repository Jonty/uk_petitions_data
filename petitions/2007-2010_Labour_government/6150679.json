            "background": "Mains adapters are commonly found indoors. But we have forgotten about the outdoors. Mains power outdoors would mean many things. For example, buskers can busk outside with PA systems and amp stacks. Newspaper distributors can stand and sell their papers in urban areas, whilst watching the TV or charging their mobile phone perhaps.\n\nThere are many possible locations that mains adapters can be installed. The ground, for example. Aluminium flaps can be lifted to reveal 230 volts of joy. Homeless people can also enjoy the luxury of having an electronic light source. Or perhaps a personal computer, or a laptop maybe, with a wireless network card, so they can pick up signals from other routers and connect with their friends using instant messaging and social networking sites.\n\nMains adapters on the streets opens up a large cardboard box of possibilites for those who have to work on the streets or live on the streets. Or whether it's a quick stop to make a cuppa with a kettle. Please carefully consider this suggestion, as it will benefit the public greatly.\n\nPeace out!",
