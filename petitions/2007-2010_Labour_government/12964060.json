        "background": "It is a well known practice for defence solicitors to advise their clients to submit a 'Not Guilty' plea at an initial hearing. This eventually results in a trial date being set. On the day of the trial the plea is changed to 'Guilty'.\n\nThis practice exists as the defence hope that a witness may fail to show up at court (or similar) and the case will be dismissed on a technicality. It can also provide extra work for defence solicitors.\n\nThe defendant knows they are guilty from the beginning and could enter that plea at the first hearing. The result of this practice is the wasting of court time and thousands of pounds of public money on court costs, witness care, police and all other bodies associated with the justice system. More importantly it needlessly extends the agony for the victims and witnesses in the case.\n\nIf no further evidence is offered between the initial hearing and the day of the trial, yet the plea inexplicably changes a far harsher penalty could be handed out.\n\nConsideration could also be given to removing or reclaiming legal aid funding to defence solicitors in the same circumstances to prevent them advising their clients to indulge in this practice.",
