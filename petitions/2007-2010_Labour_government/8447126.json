            "background": "The government announced recently that it was making several hundred million pounds available to upgrade the disused  army camp, to accommodate  athletes  training facilities for the 2012 Olympics.\n\nI propose that the money would be better spent to upgrade the housing of our brave servicemen and their families who are living in squalor.  It seems that the government is giving precedent to sport rather than to our soldiers who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
