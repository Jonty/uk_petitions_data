        "background": "Mr Speaker pointed out the hypocracy of MPs who are now queing up to condemn the expenses system they themselves have been abusing and have voted against reforming.  Instead of making Mr Speaker a scapegoat with motions of no confidence, I call upon the House of Commons to table a Motion of Sincere Apology to the People of Britain.  Furthermore I call upon every MP to sign the motion within 20 working days or to resign their seat.  MPs are sincerely mistaken if they think the resignation of Mr Speaker will do anything to restore confidence in MPs.",
