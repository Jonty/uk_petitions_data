            "background": "I quote \"Every child matters\". Well obviously to our local council, children in Shelthorpe, Loughborough don't count! They are closing our purpose built Childrens Centre and Nursery which was built about 5 years ago to help families and children in our community with a whole range of issues, problems etc. The nursery is used both by people inside and outside of the area and it is the best equiped, most professionally run nursery I have ever seen. The staff are trained to a very high standard and the facilities are amazing. The have places for special needs babies and children along side the other children and also have a real nappy policy to cut down on waste going to landfill sites. I have heard that the place will be turned into something concerning drug rehab which is totally outrageous as it is inside Shelthorpe primary school grounds. We have to stop this closure as it would be devastating to our community and leave 100's of families without our Surestart Centre which is much needed and used.",
