        "background": "We, the British People, want to know what the Third Olive is; the one that is used to make olive oil.  Lots of the populace despise green olives... and black olives are at least twice as horrible.  Olive oil, on the other hand, is great.  Therefore there must be a secret \"other\" olive -- a Third Olive.  One that is the hallowed source of the oil and has been kept under wraps by a succession of secretive and repressive governments.  We demand to know what this is.  Give us the Third Olive.",
