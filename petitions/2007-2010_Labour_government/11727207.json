This is due to point 45 of the passenger charter re compensation. Apparently if the incident which causes the cancellation is \"outside of the control of the train company\" then they don't to pay their customers any money back. This applies to all train companies at all times of the year. My petition to the Prime Minister to remove this ridiculous rule and make train companies at least pay back ALL paying customers their fare for the relevant period that trains are cancelled or delayed.",
