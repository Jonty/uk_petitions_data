            "background": "Corsham is a town with a population of 12,000. It used to have a train station, providing easy access for travellers to Bristol, Swindon, London and the South Coast. However, the station was closed in 1961 because of the Beeching Cuts in the 1960's. The reopening of one of them at Corsham, is viable and necessary, and would be of great benefit to both business and commuters and the town as a whole.",
