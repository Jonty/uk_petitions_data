        "background": "Many people who have spoken out about Islam have been branded racist by both the courts and the press.\n\nConstructive criticism of a religion cannot, in a free-country, be banned anyway - but that is a different issue.\n\nThe government should make it clear that criticism of a religion - including Islam is not racist.  Islam is a religion; it is not a race.  Therefore people who speak out about it and its effects on British life are not racist.\n\nThe government should make it illegal for a person to be labelled a racist, or prosecuted as a racist for simply criticising a religion.",
