            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Reasons why we need subsidised travel...\n\n1-Buses in Devon are ridiculously expensive. It now cost \u00a34.25 to make a one way journey of 10 miles and \u00a36.00 to make that a return. If the average 16 -18 student works the recommended 10 hours a week, earns \u00a34.85 p/h and makes that journey 3 times a week, then that represents 37% of their wage. \n\n2-Devon is a rural county, for many students buses are the only method of transport available to them. \n\n3- As more and more choices and power are taken away from under 18s (plans to make education compulsory until 18, raising the smoking age to 18), and the minimum wage not even applying. Surely it is unfair that we have to pay for adult fares.\n\n4-Higher public transport costs mean that more teens are learning to drive ASAP, and travelling by car wherever possible, thereby increasing the pollution problem, and totally at odds with the current government push for greener living.",
