            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I applaud the government for banning ageism against the elderly, but I find it appalling that ageism against young adults continues. Ageism is something that effects all adults, no matter what their age is, age discrimination is not exclusive to the elderly. An example of ageism against young adults is the domestic properties to let market, landlords often discriminate against young adults by putting a minimum age limit for applicants. Even the council housing offices use this ageist method of advertising when letting properties throught the country. The council often puts an age limit of 50 years of age and sometimes 60 years of age on it's properties to rent. That practice is ageism against young adults and it should be banned without delay! I can understand priority being given to the elderly for disabled reasons, but young adults can be and often are, equally or more disabled than elderly people, therefore even disabled properties should be offered without an age limit. All properties should be advertised to adult applicants of any age without age discrimination, and the ageism laws should protect people of every adult age from age prejudice in every area of life.",
