        "background": "The Nursing Times is campaigning for an end to parking charges for nurses in England. Unlike nurses in Scotland and Wales, where hospital parking charges are largely being phased out, most nurses and other NHS staff in England currently have to pay to park at their place of work. Therefore a postcode lottery exists. Equally, few private sector staff and other public sector employees, such as teachers, have to pay to park at work.",
