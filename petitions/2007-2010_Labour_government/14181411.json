            "background": "Once a company goes into liquidation or administration the liquidators swallow up any future realisations with their extortionate fees.  This often leaves creditors with less than a penny in the pound agasinst their losses.  Liquidators typically charge in excess of \u00a3150 per hour for cashiers with a typical partner fee being in excess of \u00a3450 per hour.  These are unrealistic in the business word, support staff fees are around \u00a360 per hour!  These fees are imposed against 'captive' creditors who have no option to 'shop around' for a more realistic alternative.  Liquidator fees should be capped, they are thriving in the recession.  They should also not be allowed to 'jump the queue' and become preferential creditros, receiving their money before trade creditors who themselves are struggling.",
