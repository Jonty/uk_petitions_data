        "background": "One of the goals of the 2012 Olympics is surely to showcase Britain\u2019s culture and heritage. On that basis, I propose that plate smashing be introduced as an Olympic sport. Plate smashing has been a popular British endeavour for generations and there can be few better ways to illustrate our country\u2019s rich sporting traditions. It is commonly believed to be a sport without skill, but nothing could be further from the truth. What\u2019s more, it is a sport that breaks down barriers of class, as it can be taken up by anyone. No expensive equipment is required, and low-cost practice sessions are available every year at summer fayres up and down the country. I feel certain that introducing plate smashing to the 2012 Games would see several British athletes standing atop the winners\u2019 podium and adding significantly to the country\u2019s medal haul.",
