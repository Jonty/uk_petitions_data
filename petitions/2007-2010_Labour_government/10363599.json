How an area grows should not be down to a few builders/land owners who can lobby the right people and get the plans pushed through. As our local 'Joint Core Strategy' group decree how much our town grows is NOT OPEN FOR DEBATE. What happened to democracy? how come the people who live in an area have no say in what happens in the area?",
