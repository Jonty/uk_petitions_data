            "background": "The system in Greater London has at its core a directly elected powerful mayor and assembly, who have control over various city-wide functions such as public transport and major roads. Down a level are the individual boroughs, who have control over local aspects of life such as local roads and Local planning. This system has been a success since there is a single person who can be held accountable, and should be rolled out across all metropolitan counties. \n\nAlso, more metropolitan counties should be created for cities such as Bristol, Cardiff and Portsmouth/Southampton metropolitan area.",
