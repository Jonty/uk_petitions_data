            "background": "There is an extra duty on Sparkling Wine compared with Still Wine.\n\nThis unfairly discriminates against Quality English and other Sparkling Wine versus foreign still wine and imported gassy lager.\n\nThere is already Duty on Still Wine. If Carbon Dioxide is deemed to be worthy of taxation then by equity there should be Sparkling Duty on fizzy gas injected lager, sparkling water and fizzy drinks such as Coca Cola and Sprite.\n\nSo \n\nEITHER:\n\n1. Abolish the Extra Duty on Sparkling Wine\n\nOR:\n\n2. Impose an equivalent Sparkling Duty of \u00a360.11 per 100 litres on all drinks containing natural or more commonly artificially injected Carbon Dioxide such as lager, water and Coca Cola. This would be in addition to flat beer tax as is the case with still wine and sparkling wine.\n\nUK Duty Rates\n\nUK Rates of Excise Duty (from 23.04.09, set by the April 2009 Budget)\n\nStill Wine \u00a3214.02 per 100 litres\n\nSparkling Wine of 8.5% volume and above \u00a3274.13 per 100 litres",
