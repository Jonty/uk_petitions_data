            "background": "There are plans to turn a great swathe of green belt land near Bristol into housing. From Emmerson's Green down to Bitton, swallowing up Webb's Heath in the process, will be a massive development that the transport infrastructure could hardly accommodate. The impact on the local environment will be hugely detrimental. Green belt legislation was created to protect this country from such urban sprawl. This must be upheld before the whole country sinks under a mass of concrete. Stop this development now.",
