            "background": "Motorists often complain that their hire company has unbeknown to them, received, as the registered owner of the vehicle, either a Notice to Owner or CCTV issued Penalty Charge Notice and paid it.  Often to add insult to injury their credit card has not only been charged with the penalty but in addition with an administration fee!\nThis petition is designed to require hire companies to notify the hirer of the receipt of the penalty charge notice and allow the hirer to appeal or more importantly to require the hire company to appeal and \u201ctransfer liability\u201d to the hirer which would once again allow the hirer to appeal.  I believe that there are already adequate safeguards in hire contracts to allow the hire company to recoup from the hirer any penalties for which they become liable.  Additionally the transfer of liability to the hirer transfers all financially liability to the hirer who can then make appeals without hindrance",
