            "background": "The current policy of Broadband Tax is unacceptable and i question the legality of TAX going to corporate company`s. My ISP is not BT or Virgin Media so why do i have to pay them money?\n\nAlso questions need to be answered as to how long the TAX will be in place and how much will it be allowed to increase by. In 2012 will it be \u00a330?\n\nAnd will customers be able to get the new superfast broadband for the same amount as what they are currently paying for broadband through their copper phoneline.\n\nThen comes the bigger question, why am i paying for a service that someone cannot afford for themselves? I dont see a third party paying for my fuel bills.\n\nThis is clear and cut case of fascism and erge the uk citizens to take a serious look at this matter before submitting to to this TAX as we already have Value Added Tax on these services.\n\nIf company`s do not wish to pay for new hardware, why should the citizens?",
