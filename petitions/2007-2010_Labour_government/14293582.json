            "background": "i would like for the non resident parent(nrp) and the parent with care(pwc) to be treated in the same way i.e both parents and their partners income(including the benefits that are listed on the csa website) to be assessed in the calculations.i do not think that it is fair that its just the nrp and their family who get assessed when pwc have got an income to,especially when there is other children involved as this can lead to financial hardship for the nrp's second family.is it not the child support agency's role for parents to contribute financially to their upkeep,so why does this not apply when the nrp has other children to a different partner,its seems to be unfair to the other children involved who have the right for their parents to help them financially to.lets make it fair for all families,what we do not want to do is take from one family to make them better off and leave the second family poorer because its unfair.",
