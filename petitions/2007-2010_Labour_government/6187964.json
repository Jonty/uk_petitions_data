            "background": "Even as a proud member of this country I reguarly feel we fail to achieve the heights that we could. I feel this is in a large part due to the devisive nationalistic tendencies and feel that by renaming our various regions we could reduce these. I therefore propose to rename our regions after the nations primary region, therefore Northern Ireland would become West England, Scotland would become North England and Wales would become Lesser England. By such a process we would increase the unity of the nation and this would hopefully lead to a more successful and prosperous future.",
