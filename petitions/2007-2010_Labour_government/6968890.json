Our Governments are teaching the innocent Iraqi\u2019s to fight against the Taliban themselves.\n\nBy this they are helping them to create their own army. Do they think the Taliban are stupid! The Taliban are waiting for that army to be created. Once they have a Professional army the Taliban will lie low for a while, they will then place one of there own men into the politics of the country. Once that person has the enough power he will take over the army (Trained by both the Americans and the English) to invade more countries.\n\nWhat a waste of Beautiful Countries which could make lots of money by tourism and manufacturing,\n\nComing soon\n\nThen Benefits of the Scroungers in the UK",
