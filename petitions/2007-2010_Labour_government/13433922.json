It creates narrow-minded views from both sides, but the faith schools are more likely to have this.\n\nReligion is dying. \n\nIf an employer was to tell an applicant they could not get a job because of their colour, there would be outrage. yet, this happens with faith schools.\n\nEnd it before we create more bigotry.",
