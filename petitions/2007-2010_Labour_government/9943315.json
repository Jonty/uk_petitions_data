        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "UK Deaf Sport (UKDS) is a bona-fide organisation; UK Sport made decision not to fund UKDS in March 2008 so as to prioritise their investment on Olympic and Paralympic sports and athletes. This has led to a serious breach of equality of opportunity for Deaf athletes; UKDS strongly urges British Government to divert funding back to Deaf Sport to enable GB Deaflympic Organising Committee to support Britain's leading deaf athletes to represent their country at the highest level; if no funding forthcoming from the Government then deaf athletes face serious threat of pulling out from next year's Deaflympics simply because they cannot afford full costs themselves",
