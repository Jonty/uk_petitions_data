        "background": "There is far too much animal cruelty taking place in the UK as we speak. Animals are defenceless creatures who love unconditinally. Laws on how people are punished for animal cruelty are far too leniant and people like the RSPCA and other organisations don't have enough power to remove animals if they are in potential danger. We call for harsher punishement for people who are involved in animal cruelty. We suggest the punishement for animal cruelty should be on par with that of child/human abuse. These people should never be allowed to have any animals ever again and they should be on a registered list, such as the sex offenders list so people can see what kind of people they are living amongst. Animals rely on humans to love, feed and keep them safe, abuse of this is the same as abusing a child. We need harsher punishements to prevent this from happening.",
