        "background": "More news we hear of children being bitten, injured and killed through parents, relatives leaving their children un supervised with dogs, Any dog has the potential to bite, kill. Its a dogs natural reation, they cant tell us ,\" get off me please that hurts or i dont like that\".But we hear these stories , think badly of the animal but nothing much of the human who let that ANIMAL  unsupervised with a child, that doesnt think falling on an amimal could result in serious injury. Please give the incentive to dog owners who dont think about the  situation they are putting their child in and a fine might just make them think  before they send their  5 yr old out on the garden to play with rex",
