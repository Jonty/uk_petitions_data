It will be a positive  way for him to show that he is getting back to nature and in a sense the symbolism of his nudity would demonstrate to other important nations just how open to new ideas of resolve Britain really is. Being naked will show the world what Gordon Brown REALLY has to offer, and all the good work he is doing is done by a man who is not afraid to expose himself and show the world who he REALLY is. The leader of this great country teaching the world to lighten up showing us the way to comical Peace.",
