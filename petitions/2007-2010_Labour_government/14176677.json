        "background": "With the thought in mind to control government spending the government should check thoroughly any attempt to pay bonuses to all its departments and agencies before approval is given.  This lack of control is brought to light by the revelation that the UK border agency, under the Home Office, has approved bonuses totalling \u00a3295,000 despite its many failings and still not meeting targets.  This cannot possibly be justifed and yet again we see us, the taxpayer, paying for a failing service that is not fit for purpose.",
