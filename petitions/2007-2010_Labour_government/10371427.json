We therefore register that we are not bound by any laws or directives they pass in the name of those European institutions and we humbly suggest that they risk leading the nation towards inevitable civil disobedience if they persist in their undemocratic political unification with Europe - that they; not those accused of civil disobedience; are the cause, and that the ascendancy of British control for British subjects without foreign input can be the only just outcome.",
