            "background": "Despite the fact that unemployment remains high, the Government are going to make the jobless work for their \"dole money\", without getting anything extra for doing so. This will make the new scheme even worse than New Deal which pays \u00a315 a week, and will cause the genuine jobless to feel that they are being punished. If the unemployed work, they should be given the Minimum Wage rather than being used as a source of cheap labour.",
