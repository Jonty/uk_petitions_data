            "background": "The sort of people I have in mind are sports, pop, etc stars plus people in the top echelons of high finance and business \"fat cats\"; none of whom, in my very strong opinion, contribute ANYTHING BENEFICIAL AT ALL to the country.  Why SHOULD such people be allowed to get away with contributing so little to the public purse?  If they don't pay for the public services on which we all depend who do they think WILL do it?  Even if they were taxed at 90% they'd hardly miss it on the sort of money they get!  \n\nWhy should they be treated so much better than the rest of us?  One example of this is the football manager/similar(?) who received some vast amount (at least \u00a31 million) after England FAILED TO QUALIFY for Euro 2008; it was his job to ensure they did qualify and he failed at it.  If you or I failed at OUR jobs so spectacularly we'd be out on our ear without even a reference but he gets \u00a31 million!!",
