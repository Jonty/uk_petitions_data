I am willing and able to go out to work between the hours of 9am and 2:30pm but have to be home for him before and after school.  However, due to the limit on how much I can earn, I am simply not able to find a job that is restricted to these hours and will pay me less than the top limit.  I would lose my allowance and be worse off for working.  This is so unfair when people like me want to work but have no facilities for child care after school when the child is in a special needs school.",
