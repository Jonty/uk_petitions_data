            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In July this year, Bible-believing Christian Duke Amachree, married with 3 children, a Wandsworth Council Homelessness Officer for 18 years, was dismissed in outrageous circumstances.  \n\nIn January, Duke was helping a client with her housing situation. She had seen various doctors who told her she had an incurable medical condition. Out of compassion, Duke commented that sometimes the doctors don\u2019t know everything \u2013 and encouraged her to consider putting her faith in God.\n\nThe client went to Duke's managers to report him. Two days later managers knocked on Duke\u2019s door as he was conducting another interview, asked him to finish up and report to the Director.\n  \nOn arrival, Duke was told there had been a complaint and that he was being suspended with immediate effect. His pass was taken away and he was told not to make contact with any friends and colleagues or come near the offices. He was then marched off the premises and subsequently dismissed.\n\nThe people of Wandsworth lost a compassionate man who had given 18 years of service to the community without blemish. Please sign the petition to protest against the disproportionate punishment he suffered.",
