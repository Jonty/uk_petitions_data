So it would cost \u00a31billion+ to allow Gurkha settlement- as our government have already propped up a thieving banking system, and suuport terrosist activity by letting all and sundry into this country (then giving them social security benefits), what is a mere \u00a31billion+ to support loyal solidiers of this country?  Step down Mr Brown, you've lost the plot.",
