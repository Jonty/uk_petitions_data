They should then be allowed to increase prices by only inflation plus, say, 1%.\n\n2) MASSIVELY INCREASE taxes for the wealthiest to cover the cost of reducing taxation for low/middle income tax-payers. In tandem with this outlaw ALL loopholes which enable people to avoid paying their fair share and penalise tax evasion by forcing offenders to pay not only what they have evaded paying but also a fine of, say, 25% of that amount.",
