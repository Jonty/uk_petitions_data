Because of this prohibition England fans are disadvantaged from gaining access to support our side in the World Cup and are forced to deal with unreliable street dealers to get tickets.  We ask the Prime Minister to repeal the provisions of the 1994 criminal justice and public order act that prohibit the resale of football tickets in this country.",
