            "background": "The driving test nowadays is far harder than it was back in the 1950s. Back then if you drove an army truck around an air base you obtained a full road licence. There are too many dangerous drivers on the road and those who pass today are exceptional drivers because the test is so hard. Over 60s should have to retake the driving test and this will make them safer drivers, and probably reduce the number of cars on the roads.",
