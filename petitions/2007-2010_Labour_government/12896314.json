        "background": "I'm sorry, but, this is a total outrage. Do the government actually still consider this 79 year old man who's clearly done his jail time to still be a threat against soceity? This is wrong and should be looked at.\n\n\nThe Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs has been refused parole by Justice Secretary Jack Straw.\n\nMr Straw rejected a recommendation by the Parole Board which backed the release of Biggs, 79.\n\nMr Straw said Biggs was \"wholly unrepentant\" about his actions and had \"outrageously courted the media\".\n\nThe news comes as his solicitor revealed that Biggs, who is in hospital after breaking his hip in a fall, had \"taken a turn for the worse\".\n\nGiovanni di Stefano said Biggs's son Michael was on his way to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital \"on an emergency basis\".\n\nBiggs, who is being held in Norwich Prison, is in hospital after a fall at the weekend. \n\nThe Parole Board report said the risk Biggs posed was \"manageable under the proposed risk management plan and consequently parole is recommended\".\n\nBut the panel added that \"in terms of his attitudes and risk areas\" there was little evidence, apart from his increased age, to suggest he would not return to his old criminal lifestyle.",
