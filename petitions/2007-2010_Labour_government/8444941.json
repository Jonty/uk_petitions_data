        "background": "I like you to stop all the legal robberies. I mean legal gambling. It dose not matter if it is legal or illegal. It is still a robbery of people\u2019s money. I can not believe UK can do this to its own people to make money by supporting an act. Believe it or not this is robbery of millions of people\u2019s money to make millionaires. The government is doing every thing to support those people who have addiction to gambling by giving them a phone number to call. A number which cost those people, who have lost all their money in slots machines or casino. I think people should not suffer any more. If you could stop this act then I know I will vote for you and all those people who suffer. The UK economy will be strongest in the world. More people in UK will be happier.",
