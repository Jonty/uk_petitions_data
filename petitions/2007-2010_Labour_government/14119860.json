            "background": "Leaked emails from key figures at the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit show that scientists have been tendentiously manipulating data to show 'proof' that man-made global warming is occurring. We call on HM Government, which part funds the CRU, to start a Public Enquiry to investigate the truth of the CRU's work. Given that it has informed many of the arguments made by those proposing future legislation in this area, we feel these disturbing events at the CRU are too important to overlook; its voracity must be put to public scrutiny.",
