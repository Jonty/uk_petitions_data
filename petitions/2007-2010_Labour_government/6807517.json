            "background": "Millions were exported from West Africa into slavery in the 1800s \nThe West is being asked to pay Africa $777 thousand billion within five years in reparation for enslaving Africans while colonising the continent. \n\nThe African World Reparations and Repatriation Truth Commission, called for all international debt owed by Africa to be \"unconditionally cancelled''. \n\nThe Accra Declaration issued at the conference says that money will be demanded from ''all those nations of Western Europe and the Americas and institutions, who participated and benefited from the slave trade and colonialism''. \n\nthe reparation figure was based on the number of human lives lost to Africa during the slave-trade, as well as an assessment of the worth of the gold, diamonds and other minerals taken from the continent during colonial rule. \nBetween 1450 and 1850, it is estimated that at least 12 million Africans and probably many more were shipped from Africa across the Atlantic Ocean, primarily to colonies in North America, South America, and the West Indies. \n\nThe United States or the UK have never formally apologised for its participation in the slave trade.",
