            "background": "The Governement should have the bottle to back up its claims with an early general election. The Prime Minister is in office by immoral means, elected by a party politics, not the general will of the UK. Gordon has back tracked on a great many promises and lacks the courage to push any policies through his own party, never mind the House. Get a grip and stop clinging to a powerful job, allow an election of both your job and the job of running the country, thus allowing your party to stand a chance. You were a lucky chancellor, but your luck has not extended to No.10. - do the honourable thing and allow the UK to move forward, at the very least go back to No.11",
