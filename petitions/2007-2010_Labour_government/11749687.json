            "background": "As we all know with the conflicts the UK troops are involved in, too many are being injured and maimed. There is therefore a need for a NEW Military Hospital to accomodate our brave lads and lasses whom become injured in the line of duty. I propose that the disused Standish Hospital be used for this cause as it has all the requirements in place. There is 2 operating theatres,a hydrotherapy pool, room for at least 300 casualties and is situated in a quiet location perfect for recuperaion. Please sign this partition and forward the link to all your friends email addresses so that we can help our Military services.",
