The picture, once complete will be sent around the country to be put on display at major Cities.\n\nThe picture should depict a diety from every religion in the UK - Eg. Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Quaker, Mormon, Pagan, Voodoo etc., and the dieties should be doing an activity together, like having a picnic.\n\nThis sounds a bit silly but I think it would show that we are serious about the UKs diverse peoples (and integration thereof).  This giant picture would be a world first and would really go-miles to show how the UK is leading the world in race-tolerance and cultural acceptance.",
