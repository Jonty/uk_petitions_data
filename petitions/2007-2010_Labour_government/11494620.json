            "background": "We appear to live in a welfare state where benefits are readily given out in the form of cash, whilst vital that we support people in their time of need the current system is subject to abuse. I urge you and the government to stop handing out cash benefits and start issuing a percentage of benefits in the form of vouchers or coupons which can be exchanged for items such as food, clothing, and essential products. This would ensure that those in reciept of benefits would be spending the money as it is intended, it could also halp to prevent benefit fraud and provide a greater support from tax payers knowing that abuse of the benefits system is being reduced.",
