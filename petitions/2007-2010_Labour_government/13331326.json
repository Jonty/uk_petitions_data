        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is currently a planning proposal from West Coast Energy before Eden District Council for 9 Wind turbines standing 335 feet tall, to be installed on Berrier Hill, Greystoke. These turbines will loom only approximately two miles in front of Blencathra and needless to say, will blight the unique and beautiful view as you approach the Lake District from the East - i.e. from Penrith and the M6.\n\nThe proximity of these Turbines to the National Park mean that they will be visible from the Helvellyn Range, the Scafell massif, High Street, Great Gable, the A74 at the Scottish border, Shap, Penrith, Hartside, the Pennines and many other key locations throughout the Lake District and Dumfriesshire, totally ruining one of the most beautiful and iconic views in the Country.\n\nHave your say and make sure these structures are put only where they don't ruin the natural beauty of the English Countryside.",
