            "background": "It beggars belief that Iraqi interpreters serving with the British Army are likely to be abandoned to their fates in the event of a UK withdrawl.  This is the stance taken by No 10 in a letter to an interpreter (with a glowing testimonial from his former commander) sent on June 22 this year.  The government has shown it can change its mind to let justice prevail, as in the recent case of Pun VC, and we call on the Prime Minister to allow these brave interpreters to reside in the UK, with their families, following the cessation of their service.  After all, our Danish allies have followed a similar example.  This safeguard should also be extended to other staff at risk.",
