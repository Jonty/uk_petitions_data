            "background": "At the moment the price of a bacon roll in the Erinaceous canteen in Becor House is \u00a31.80 and this far exceeds the cost to make a bacon roll. The same company, in Croydon (where the cost of living is more expensive) charge just \u00a31.40 for the same thing. I believe the price of bacon rolls should be reduced to around the \u00a31.20 mark.",
