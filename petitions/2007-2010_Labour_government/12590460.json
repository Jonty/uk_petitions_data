            "background": "Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) is controlled by Mr Hussain in mafia-style, with his word being the law. Detractors face the ultimate punishment \u2013 death \u2013 carried out through the private armed force maintained at his Karachi barricaded headquarters known as Nine Zero.On Mr. Hussain\u2019s order, his Party was involved in the 12th May 2007 carnage in Karachi where 48 people were killed and 200 sustained bullet wounds, including 10 workers belonging to my Party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). You can refer to your Karachi Consulate\u2019s report on this incident. The MQM then went on to physically disrupt court hearings of this incident.\nIn 2007, on two occasions, the Federal Court of Canada ruled that the MQM met the legal definition of a terrorist organisation and its members could not be given political asylum. In addition, the US State Department web site describes the MQM as a \u201cviolent organisation\u201d.In the light of above mentioned facts we would like you declare MQM a terrorist organization and should ban all its UK base activities and offices.",
