            "background": "Please do not allow police to use anti-terrorism laws on people who are clearly not terrorists or supporters of terrorism. Powers such as stop and search even with no grounds for suspicion, holding people for a month without charge should only be used where there are genuine grounds for suspicion that someone is a threat to others' lives - not against peaceful protesters. \nI realise the airport is busy. If protesters break other existing laws by causing a nuisance etc., the police can detain them using such laws. Where protesters are bothering no-one, they should be free to exercise their human right to protest in a free society. Simply putting across their opinion is a right and harms no-one. \nThese \"anti-terror\" laws are a very dangerous road to go down, and a threat to civil liberties.",
