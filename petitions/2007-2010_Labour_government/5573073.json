            "background": "People suspected of criminal actions are not always prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service. In cases in which a clear victim exists, that victim should have a full legal right to criminally prosecute the suspect with or without the permission of the CPS.\n\nIn cases in which there is no identifiable victim, eg tax evasion, then a criminal case could only be brought by a public authority or an advocates groups which mandates itself to tackles such crimes.\n\nThe final judgement would still be left to a court, so the issue is one of allowing victims or groups to bring criminal cases without the CPS approving of such actions. The law, especially the Criminal Justice Acts should therefore be amended.\n\nThe PM should express his views on this matter and recommend changes as outlined above.",
