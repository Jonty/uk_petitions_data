            "background": "The intention of this said petition is to persuade the UK Prime Minister to firstly, create an English parliament and a Cornish Parliament. Second, for these new parliaments to join the British-Irish Council as full members and replacing the UK as a member. Third, to scrap the status of \"Crown Dependency\" of Jersey and Guernsey, and the Isle of Man and replace it with the more equal \"Constituent Country.\" Fourth, to develop the British-Irish Council into a political and economic union, asking members to devolve some national power, giving it greater powers and a revolving presidency that can be occupied by members of all the states within the organisation elected by all the states with it. Lastly, to create a kind of British-Irish version of the European Parliament. This could be based anywhere in the British Isles and could be called The Council of the island of Britain, Ireland, the British Isles and Channel Islands.",
