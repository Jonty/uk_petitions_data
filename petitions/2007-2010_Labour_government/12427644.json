            "background": "The government's car scrappage scheme is being described as green because it will destroy older vehicles, but many 10-year-old cars have plenty of life left in them; from a climate perspective, to send them to the scrap heap is money poured down the drain. This petition proposes replacing it with a \u2018pounds-for-pedals\u2019 scheme to give cyclists \u00a3100 to spend on a new bicycle, but in contrast to the car scrappage grant the traded-in bike would not be destroyed but shipped to the developing world to be re-furbished and re-used.",
