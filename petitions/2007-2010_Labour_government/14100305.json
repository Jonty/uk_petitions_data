Their conduct of their military campaign against the Tamil Tigers earlier this year \u2014 which had a massive impact on the civilian population \u2014 was rightly condemned around the world, including by very many people here in Britain.\u201cThe Prime Minister has real concerns about Sri Lanka\u2019s bid. We simply cannot be in a position where Sri Lanka \u2014 whose actions earlier this year had a huge impact on civilians, leading to thousands of displaced people without proper humanitarian access \u2014 is seen to be rewarded for its actions. - Times UK 27 Nov 2009 \n\nPM believes it is vital for the Commonwealth to ensure Sri Lanka suffers consequences for its handling of the military offensive against the Tamil Tigers earlier this year. Thousands of civilians were killed as the government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa ignored appeals from Britain and others for a cease in hostilities to allow them to flee the war zone.\nMr Brown will press for the 2011 CHOGM gathering to be hosted by an alternative country whose record better reflects the Commonwealth values of respect for human rights. - Daily Telegraph 27 Nov 2009.",
