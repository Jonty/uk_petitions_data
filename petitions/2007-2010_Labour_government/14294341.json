            "background": "Burgess Farm still contributes to the UK's rapidly diminishing food chain. Government initiatives to sustain food production in the UK and reduce global 'food miles' need to be supported. The 170 acre farm will close with the loss of the 50 acres on which the farm buildings are located. These green spaces are a highly valued 'green lung\u2019 for our communities. Once these green areas are gone we will never get them back. This development will not meet government objectives to get more people out of their cars and onto public transport as transport links in this area of Salford are not well supported. We urge the Prime Minister to oppose these plans.",
