        "background": "By the UK Government not taking action to assure the UK Savings Deposits of IceSave, they have breached our legal right to the same protection afforded to Northern Rock and similar organisations, when they have had crisis. The Government have clearly failed in their duty by not acting to protect our interests.\n\nWe feel the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and (FSCS), are failing in their duty to make it clear that the deposits in some UK institutions are not as protected as other UK Savings Banks.\n\nThe Government must change the way Banking Institutions display their Banking Guarantees and Bank Licenses, so we as investors have informed choice and are fully aware of the facts.\n\nWe, as investors, feel the Government should underwrite all savings, including those within Icesave UK and all other UK Savings Banks for a period of 2 years.",
