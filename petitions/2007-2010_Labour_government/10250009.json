The people that suffer from a bad case of endometriosis end up having to have time of school or work because it\u2019s too painful to go out.  I missed half a year of school from being sick with it. My school tried getting me extra support for my exams so I could learn at home but they were unable.  Why should people have to suffer any more than they have too?",
