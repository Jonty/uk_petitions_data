            "background": "This is an official petition to call upon the prime minister to impose compulsory licences with minimum age restrictions, for both horse and rider with the intended common goal of making our roads a safer place.\nHorse riders are completely un regulated when it comes to using our roads. There are no minimum age restrictions, compulsory licences, or insurance for ether horse or rider using our public high ways, this must be stopped to try and reduce the number of accidents these animals cause on our roads each year due to improper training and inexperience. I propose that the following should be legally imposed upon all horses and riders using our roads.\n\n1. minimum age restriction of 16 to ride on the road\n2. Compulsory licence for all riders using the road.\n3. Yearly tests for horses to astatine there suitability for road use.",
