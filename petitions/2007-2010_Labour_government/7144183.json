            "background": "All dogs that attack and bite without provocation should be destroyed as they are then capable of re-offending and attacking others. All owners with a dog should advertise what breed they have in their home.\nI was bitten in the face unprovoked by a dog who i have known for 4 years, i was hospitalised for 2 days and went to theatre to have 25 stitches. I have been left physicaly and mentally scarred. I feel this law should be changed for the safety of other people.\nI am disgusted that being bitten in the dogs home is not an offence as I was assulted. \nLicenses should be issued to all dog owners no matter what breed they hold, each dog will have a identity number which can be logged into police files following incidents.\nPlease sign my petition to stop others going through what i have encountered.",
