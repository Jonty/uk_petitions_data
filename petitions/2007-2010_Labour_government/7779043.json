        "background": "This issue has been recently and rightly brought into the public eye through a high profile campaign, the conditions 'Standard' chickens are raised in is no longer acceptable in the UK, these birds go from egg to slaughter in just 39 days, how can this be humane, these birds are fed and watered until they can no longer stand because they are so heavy and become lame, this inhumane treatment MUST be stopped in the UK, lets use this a chance to show the rest of the world our commitment to the highest standards of animal welfare and food production. Free range benefits everyone, farmers, chickens, economy and consumers, a free range chicken costs just \u00a32 more than a standard but you know it will be flavoursome and will have been brought up in a healthy environment. Chicken Out!",
