            "background": "This petition seeks to use market forces to reduce the North / South divide and drive greater employment into the North of England without the need for additional support by the tax payer. \n\nBy effectively restricting the housing stock in the south, employers would be forced to pay an increasing amount for staff in the South. This wage pressure would make relocating offices in the North of England more attractive as wage bills would be lower (due to a lower cost of living).  This movement of primary businesses would then also drive the creation of smaller support businesses to cater for the additional employed people. \n\nIf additional housing stock is allowed in the South, this should be restricted to Housing Association properties for essential workers on government contracts only (Nurses, teachers, police etc.). These would not be subject to a right to buy, so ensuring a continuation of supply.",
