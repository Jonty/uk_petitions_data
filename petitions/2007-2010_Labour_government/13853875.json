        "background": "Bullies are mainly cowards and insecure people. They use covert manners to de-humanise their victims. Without doubt, bullying is on the increase and the Government ought to consider tougher legislation which would include prison sentences of the bullying perpetrators in severe cases of bullying and harassment. Over the past year and six months, I have been at the receiving end of bullying and harassment and victimisation, and aim to drive a UK wide campaign for tougher penalties to be imposed by the courts and tribunals to wipe out bullying.",
