        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Different councils have different ideas on what constitutes recyclable waste that is collected from the doorstep, before allowing pay as you throw, a council should be required to collect a MINIMUM range of recyclable waste - eg, glass, cardboard, paper, plastics ( bottles and packaging), garden waste via doorstep collections - ONLY then should they be allowed to introduce a pay as you go scheme.\n\nThis will prevent a council from introducing Pay as you throw without providing improved facilities to households for recyclable waste collections from the doorstep, preventing the introduction of schemes which increase carbon emmissions by forcing households to traqvel to central site to dispose of say Cardboard, as it is not collected from the doorstep.",
