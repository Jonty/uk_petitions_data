            "background": "Dr. Lawrence Einhorn is a Distinguished Professor of Medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine and an oncologist. Dr. Einhorn pioneered the development of the life-saving medical treatment in 1974 for testicular cancer, increasing the survival rate from 10% to 95% . His pioneering Chemotherapy regime has also become a prima for new treatments for other cancers survival rates. It is impossible to say how many men's lives have been saved by Dr Einhorn's work but with 10,000 men a year between just the UK and USA alone since 1974 when the treatment was started it's possible to say near to one million lives world wide. We thousands of British and commonwealth testicular cancer survivors world wide wish for the British Prime Minister to honour Dr Einhorn on our behalf.",
