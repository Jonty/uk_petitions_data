We all recognise that there are differences of opinion about the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. These differences indicate a healthy democracy, but the place for this debate is in Parliament and the media, not to abuse our soldiers, sailors and airmen/women in the street. We should all respect the dedication, professionalism and patriotism of our troops, who are after all, our brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers.",
