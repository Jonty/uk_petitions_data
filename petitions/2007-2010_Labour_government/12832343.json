            "background": "Dr. Ibrahim from the Littlebury Medical Centre, Fish Pond, Holbeach, Spalding, Lincolnshire PE12 7DE needs to have his visa renewed and I would appreciate if you could please look into this matter as a petition is being organised by us and understand thet John Hayes(Conservative)has been asked to look into this. Dr Ibrahim and the other two Drs./staff at the clinic have done so much to get the clinic to a high standard to match the other clincs in the area, but\nmore importantly, the clinic for a long time has had a lot of partime Drs and we have only now adjusted to a smooth routine and regular Drs and built up a good patient/Dr relationship. With all his titles etc., with his cardioligist background it so good and reassuring for us older patients and again I can only express his sence of humour/kindness to us is more that all the medication. Please do help to keep him in this country as we need people like him. Thank you for your help.",
