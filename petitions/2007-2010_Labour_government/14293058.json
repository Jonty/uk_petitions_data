It is a purpose built, award winning art gallery in Poole, Dorset & houses an internationally significant collection of art. \nThe Kube is the only big visual arts space between Southampton and the Tate gallery in St Ives, Cornwall. It has employed hundreds of artists for workshops and performances, showcasing work of local, National and international artists of real significance.\n It is the only big visual arts space between Southampton and the Tate gallery in St Ives, Cornwall.\nIt has a world-class education programme, and offers workshops and activities for everyone from toddlers, to workers, to residents, students, artists and community groups. \nThis year has been the Kube\u2019s busiest year, with 4 times more people visiting the gallery than last year.
