            "background": "Many employees including local government request health details and sickness record at an interview.  This is a discriminatory practice as it discriminates against those who may have or had an illness. This confidential information should only be asked once a job offer has been given.  Also the habit of asking for a 'medical' before a job offer is allowed because this practice discriminates against those on Incapacity Benefit making it difficult for them to gain employment.",
