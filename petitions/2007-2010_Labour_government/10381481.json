            "background": "Currently, different bus companies have different rules about the carriage of buggies, different rail companies have different rules, and in different boroughs and district councils there are different rules for the carriage of buggies by disabled persons in Hackney Carriages.  We ask that there should be a national standard for buggies for use by disabled persons to be carried on public transport, and buggies for use by disabled persons built to that standard and their occupants should be carried without cost.  The standard should be devised in conjuction with organisations of disabled persons and their carers, and public vehicles should be constructed to carry them.",
