            "background": "We the undersigned ask the Prime Minister to change the Animal Protection Act 1971 to include any domestic pet living out doors. We ask that these pets get the same rights as livestock. As at the moment domestic pets that are living outdoors i.e Rabbits and Guinea Pigs are not covered under this legislation but Pheasants, Partridges and Grouse are covered while they are kept in captivity. This is strange because Chickens, if they are kept as a domestic pet\u2019s, are not covered where as chickens on a farm have protection because of the Live Stock Act 1953. We ask that domestic pets come under the Animal Protection Act 1971 because as animal lovers we can not defend our domestic pets from wanton obtrusion from other domestic animals i.e Dogs. We would like there to be a defense if the un-wanted decision should arise that the domestic animal attacking have to be restrained. Most of the doemstic pets that are kept belong to children and the loss of them causes great trauma.",
