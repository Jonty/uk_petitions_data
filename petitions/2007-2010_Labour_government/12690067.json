They could make a creature that could trip over it's own legs, or not be as great a fighter as other creatures, WHICH IS THE FUN OF THE GAME. I seriously want to cry when I watch the 05 video. I feel so sad over the fact that we could have had this amazing, wildlifelike game we could be playing for ever and ever, and instead we got this simple, basic, \"nothing new\" piece of junk. I hate Spore. It only brings bad memories.' see my point?\nso please get something done and let us have our moneys worth and make us people happy!  maybe they could remake this childish crap and release spore 2 for us hardcore gamers. thankyou",
