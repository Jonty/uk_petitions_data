        "background": "I request the prime minister to request the removal of President Obamas name from the Nobel history books as a peace prize winner for the following reasons.\n\n1.The US still uses extreme rendition to extradite terror suspects without evidence to detain them and use torture to extract confession.\n\n2. The US is currently waging war against 5 nations around the world\n\n3. The US Allows their troops to handcuff and execute children without fear of reprisal\n\n4. The US still imposes trade sanctions against Cuba , and its people \n\n5. The US foreign policy aims to divide and conquer and to steal other nations natural resources for the benefit of the US government.\n\nAll signatures would be greatly appreciated, It is time our government stops hanging around the bully for protection. The UK is no longer a waring nation and we should steer clear of US foreign policy and should not be manipulated by them.",
