        "background": "The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation is an unelected, undemocratic Quango set up by Central Government to redevelop and greatly expand the Borough of Northampton and western side of the county. It's willingness to seek or take into account the views of the general public, and in particular those of the residents of Northamptonshire, is considered highly questionable. The controversy over the proposed \u201cNorthampton Needle\u201d is a prime example. Despite these points, the Corporation has extensive powers and decides on all major planning issues for the area. This is a disgrace.",
