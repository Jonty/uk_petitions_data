            "background": "Following reports and convictions of violence and sexual assaults by taxi drivers, we believe that to safeguard the well being and safety of their passengers (often single females travelling alone at night), that some form of legal background check should be carried out prior to their license being awarded to ascertain their suitability for the job in respect to criminal activity.  Taxi drivers are in a position of trust and most do acknowledge this, however there are some that clearly don't and abuse this trust.  Surely those drivers who are law abiding citizens would not object to such a measure which would go toward screening out untrustworthy   drivers and reassure the public that the service provided is safe to use.",
