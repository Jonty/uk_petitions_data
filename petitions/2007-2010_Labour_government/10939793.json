            "background": "Currently, commission payments can be counted towards an employees hourly rate. This puts the employee at risk of earning less than the national minimum wage under certain circumstances i.e a quiet period for a sales consultant. This risk goes against the principles of the minimum wage. A fairer system would be minimum wage for all, therefore commission would be more of a reward where paid.",
