The other has an 8 year, a 13 year old and a husband at home.  BOTH have computers at home already and BOTH are about to receive their free computers courtesy of the UK taxpayer.  The rules need to be made a lot stricter so that ONLY those who genuinly cannot not afford to purchase a computer can have a free one.",
